A man whose hefty multi-volume opus 'A la Recherche Du Temps Perdu' continues to delight, puzzle, stimulate all the arts even today, Proust has had many biographies and treatises written but few supply the sheer pleasure of this perfectly designed little volume.In Proust's time he had two questionnaires, separated by time, but similar in content, questionnaires he responded to allowing the reader to discover his psychological fears and fantasies as well as his favorite poets, writers, painters, composers, fears, embarrassing moments etc. This artfully designed volume presents copies of those questionnaires, both in Proust's handwritten responses in French in type set English form. But the pleasure of this idea doesn't stop there.After a learned introduction by Henry-Jean Servant as to the manner in which the original questionnaires were used, William C. Carter relates the importance of Proust's influence on the arts that followed his death and the myriad films, books, studies, and conversations that continue. Then the creators of this colorful book placed the questionnaires in the hands of a number of interesting celebrities including Alain du Buton, Brigitte Bardot, Marisa Berenson, Richard Meier and Peter Lindbergh.THEN the book opens Proust's game to the reader, supplying pages of questionnaires to pass among friends and guests in a party game for the intellect. The book makes a delightful curiosity for dinner parties, but it is the writing of the creators including the responses by Proust himself that make this book one to own.

I liked both of the romances, with one couple seeming so well suited for each other and the other involving the man coming to appreciate the initially overlooked finer qualities that the woman has. The conflict was created by family resentment over Gervase inheriting the title and estates and between the men vying for innocently flirty Marianne.The mystery involved who was attacking Gervase and how Gervase was going to resolve all the conflict (including dealing with whomever was attacking him). Sometimes Heyer has the prime suspect really be the \\"whodunit,\\" and sometimes she has it be someone else. I wasn't entirely sure which it was in this story until near the end, so I had two main suspects until then. I enjoyed trying to puzzle this out.The characters were engaging, interesting, and acted in realistic ways. The setting and historical details brought the story alive in my imagination. There was some explicit bad language. There was no sex. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"As always, Georgette Heyer spins a very good story with a twist. Very entertaining.

You might find that these you love. So many of my non-romance reading friends make an exception for this writer. And now her books are available on Kindle - such a nice way to keep one with you for relaxation.This is one of her best, in my opinion. It gives a nice overview of life in Victorian England and the ways the various classes related. As usual she has characters you can really relate to and want to know more about."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"I totally loved the way the relationship between the main characters developed in this book - with subtley and understatement. A nice little mystery, too. Even the most humorously callous characters learn something and redeem themselves in the course of the book. Masterful. No modern romance could present this way, but it works perfectly for its era."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Perfect as usual for Georgette Heyer. Great plot depth and clean writing.

At first it seemed to start out a little slow to me but quickly picked up speed. It as all heyer novels keeps you guessing until almost the very end as to whodunnit.

If you love Georgette Heyer and haven't read this one try it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Honestly, it is a rather boring book. I really had to force myself to get through this one. I didn't really take to the players. There was little character development, so you felt like you were on the outside and not embracing them.

Great book, and if you don't mind that the romance doesn't really figure in too much until the end, go for it!!"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Intriguing story line and very easy to read. Another enjoyable Georgette Hayer book. Couldn't put it down until the mystery was solved."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"The new Earl of St. Erth finds that upon arrival at his castle that his remaining family would have preferred him to have died while fighting Napoleon. Happily for him he survived to claim his title as the seventh Earl. His half brother Martin had been treated as the heir and is quite put out that he is not! But is he put out enough to murder?The Earl's cousin Theo has been taking care of the estate since his uncle took him in as a young boy and he has done very well as its steward. Theo worries that Martin will do harm to St. Erth and watches him like a hawk. Also living at Stanyon Castle are the dowager duchess and a visiting friend, Drusilla Moreville.The tale is full of the witty dialog for which Ms. Heyer is so famous. It rolls along like a bright, sparkling creek. The plot is a good one including romance in unexpected places, murder attempts, secret passageways and loyalties misplaced. The dowager duchess is a marvel of self absorption - except when it comes to her \\"perfect\\" son, Martin. She can see past herself for him. But ONLY for him. She provides much comic relief in the midst of the tension.This is my second book by Ms. Heyer and it has only whet my appetite for more."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Gervase may have inherited the family estate after his father's death, but no one was very excited to see him come home...This is another Regency Romance written by Ms. Heyer. She wrote numerous mysteries and romances and none of the ones I've read have disappointed me. Her writing style provides a lot of period detail and the plots move along slower than most modern works. That fits well with the time period she's talking about and she always comes up with a well thought out story.Ms. Heyer had an interest in people and how they behave because her characters are always authentic. Her main male character is just trying to stay alive and figure out who is trying to kill him. The biggest suspect is his stepbrother, who thought he would be the Earl because Gervase would get killed in the war. Ms. Heyer gives us two interesting young female characters; one all sweetness and grace with beauty and one who is very practical and handles any crisis with ease but is more plain.Mix the pot with attempted murder, love, jealousy, and greed and you get a story that moves right along with several suspects. This author takes all these emotions and swirls a story together that make sense and surprises you with the solution. She also smoothes out all the emotional issues so things are calmer at the end of the story.Why not visit Regency England with Ms. Heyer and follow the Earl on his quest to find out just exactly who wants him dead and why? And if he falls in love on the way there, who can complain?Originally posted at the Long and Short of It Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"The only problem with Georgette Heyer books is that they end too soon!

And Georgette Heyer has managed to mix the two genres so that the result is something quite special.Having survived the Napoleonic Wars, Gervase Frant returns home to a hostile stepmother and half brother, both of whom feel resentful he has survived the wars and that he is now the new Earl of St. Erth. Gervase has to contend with open hostility and challenges to his authority. Adding to all this are the attempts on his life! But Gervase sails through all this with the quiet civility, good humour and charm which define the Georgette Heyer hero and which fans have come to expect in her work.In Gervase Frant we have the classic Heyer hero, and he is evenly matched with the quintessential Heyer heroine, Drusilla Moreville, a quiet, sensible and very capable young lady.I enjoyed reading this book for the first time 20 years ago, and I still enjoy rereading it, There's nothing that quite compares with a good Georgette Heyer novel, especially during bleak winter nights."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"I have read several Georgette Heyer novels and I don't seem to get bored with her wonderful stories, unique characters and great eye for historical detail. The Quiet Gentleman is a bit different from the other Heyer novels I have read. There isn't so much romance here. Instead, there is a mystery suspense plot. I am not bothered with that. Her characters are as memorable as ever and the backdrop of the Regency period is as authentic-sounding as ever. Gervase Frant, Earl of St. Erth, has returned home after surviving the Napoleonic Wars. To his step-family's disappointment, he has not only survived the last battle, Waterloo, he has come to claim his place as master of the estate. His family is now determined to make his life as unhappy as possible. And there is the matter that someone has tried to kill him since he arrives. He suspects his step-family of doing this of course. After all, his stepbrother has a lot to gain by having him killed. But Gervase takes it all with quiet dignity. He sets his eyes on a couple of young ladies, including one Miss Morville, all of this while watching his back and awaiting the opportunity to catch the people who want him dead. There are some twists throughout the novel.The most impressive part of The Quiet Gentleman is the humor. Once again, Georgette Heyer has created an amazing romp that had me in stitches in various occasions. The dialogue is so full of subtle sarcasm and undeniable wit and I marveled at the author's ability at coming up with such lines. Again, I have to compare her to Jane Austen. Anyone who has hungered for a Jane Austen read other than the stuff she wrote can feast on Georgette Heyer as the next best thing. Another great thing about this novel is the characterization. I like Gervase because there's a quiet confidence about him that makes him a compelling and enjoyable hero. This is the second Heyer novel I have read that concentrates on the hero more than the heroine (The Unknown Ajax was the other one). Romance isn't the focus on this story, but, as I said earlier, I'm not in the least bit bothered with that. Heyer had established herself as a three-dimensional writer that branches out of the genre and creates stories and endings that are less predictable than most romances. And of course the other thing that I loved about this book is the accurate description of Regency England. Many romance authors resort to anachronisms in order to keep the story interesting because they don't know how to, or perhaps don't want to combine the rules of propriety as things were at the time with a plausible and passionate story. Georgette has done the aforementioned combination beautifully in her novels. Anyway, The Quiet Gentleman is a must read. You will love the quirky characters, the great suspense plot and the incredible wit. I have combined this read with another Regency book by an author called Loretta Chase and I think Heyer must've inspired the aforementioned author because she writes in a similar style and I loved her novel as well. I had so much fun reading the two books. If you are new to Georgette Heyer, this is a great place to start. I recommend this gem. If you get the Harlequin reprint (I found an out-of-print trade paperback at an used bookstore), I suggest you read the story first and then the forewords from romance authors (if there are any) afterwards, for they tend to use spoilers."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Gervase Frant, Lord St. Erth, heir to broad acres and an ancient and variegated pile known as Stanyon, returns from the Napoleonic Wars to find he is something less than welcome in the ancestral bosom. His widowed stepmother would greatly have preferred his glorious death in battle on the Continent. She has no desire to relinquish her position, and she has hoped that her own son Martin would inherit.The Earl, in his quiet way, quickly makes a conquest of two eligible young ladies on the scene, but it becomes almost immediately apparent that someone at Stanyon would prefer to have him die by a means more sudden than old age.Georgette Heyer's comical genius never fails to deliver delight. Much better than anything Jane Austen ever wrote!!!"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"I am rereading this novel for the ump-teenth time (I have a much yellowed 1951 paperback edition of this novel, imprinted by ACE Books). I have always enjoyed this novel because there is something so very endearing about Gervase Frant, the 7th Earl of St.Erth.Upon this rereading I have noticed that the social comedy and satire in this novel is the *wickedest* of all of Georgette Heyer's novels. This is a novel rich in all aspects of novel writing, not merely a good regency romance, but a good novel. It captures the feel of Jane Austen's novels more than any other of Heyer's novels. The description of the Stanyon Castle and of each member of the Frant family are deliciously frank and snide. The conversations between members of the Frant family are so comedic that I stop and reread passages in order to savor them (like a really wonderful flavor of ice cream - yummy!).Gervase was hated by his father, the 6th Earl, because he looks like his beautiful mother, the Earl's first wife. Gervase's mother ran away with a lover when Gervase was young and the 6th Earl never forgave her or Gervase.Upon the death of his first wife, the 6th Earl remarried and his second wife gave him two children, a son Martin and a daughter Louisa. Gervase's half-brother and sister look like the 6th Earl, unmistakeably Frant-ish, as well as Gervase's cousin Theo Frant (son of the 6th Earl's younger brother).The 6th Earl, his second wife, and their children have always expected that Martin, the second son, would become the 7th Earl. Martin has been raised and indulged as the heir apparent all his life. Since Gervase entered the army during the Napoleanic Wars, it was expected by all the Frants (except of course Gervase), that he would be conveniently killed in the War. They consider it quite shocking and inconsiderate of Gervase not to have been killed in the Spanish campaigns or during Waterloo (some delightful conversations occur about Gervase's lack of foresight in not getting himself killed or even wounded followed by \\"politically correct\\" recanting). Upon his death the 6th Earl left all of his unentailed property to Martin, beggaring the Earldom in order to leave as much away from Gervase as possible.A year after the 6th Earl's death, Gervase finally arrives at Stanyon. He has deliberately stayed away for the whole year to avoid going into official mourning for a father who treated him shabbily (Gervase dislikes his father as much as his father disliked Gervase). The members of the Stanyon household upon the arrival of Gervase are: Lady St.Erth (Gervase's step-mother), Martin Frant (his half-brother), Reverend Felix Clowne (my lord's Chaplain, most appropriately named), Theodore Frant (Gervase's cousin and my lord's estate agent), and Miss Drusilla Morville (a guest). Later they are joined by the Viscount, Lord Ulverston (Lucius \\"Lucy\\" Austell, heir to the Earl of Wrexham, and Gervase's very good friend). Marianne Bolderwood is the local reigning beauty in the Stanyon neighborhood and heiress to 100,000 pounds. While not as funny as the other characters, she is an important plot element. Minor characters who contribute to the comedic elements in the novel and are well-drawn are: Louisa (Gervase's step-sister), Turvey (Gervase's valet), Chard (Gervase's groom), Mr. Leek (a bow street runner), and Drusilla's parents.At first Gervase thinks that Drusilla is a paid companion to Lady St.Erth until Drusilla makes it clear that she IS the daughter Hervey Morville AND Cordelia Consett, prominent members of the society surrounding Mr. Coleridge and Mr. Southey. She is visiting Stanyon while her parents are visiting their friends. The most flattering description of Miss Morville is that her countenance is pleasing (faint praise indeed). Drusilla is of an extremely practical nature and always has wise advice to handle the everyday problems of life at Stanyon (such as what to do about the ugly epergne in the Small Dining-room that will satisfy both Gervase and his step-mother; also how to handle the inconvenience of Marianne's parents coming down with influenza that might prevent her from attending a ball at Stanyon).Attempts are being made on Gervase's life and all indications point to Martin as the culprit due to his obvious resentment of his older brother. Opinions as to who is responsible for the murder attempts on Gervase's life are expressed by Theo and Lucy. Lady St.Erth seems oblivious, a very conceited, self-centered, and stupid woman (a running gag is Lady St.Erth's opinions and commentary on card playing and other topics, all based on precepts handed down to her by her father). Miss Morville, who figures out who is trying to murder Gervase and why before anyone else, keeps her own counsel until the end of the novel. Over time, Gervase consults Miss Morville increasingly as it becomes clear to him that she is the only one with exceedingly good sense (delivered with witty repartee).If you love Jane Austen novels, be sure to order this novel by Georgette Heyer. I guarentee you will want to own it -- not just borrow someone else's copy!"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"If you love Heyer you will love this book. The Quiet Gentleman contains all the Heyer elements. You will find a mystery, a wonderful plot, memorable character, the amazing Heyer humor, and, of course, romance. I enjoyed this book very much, and it will be one of those I read over and over again.Leslie Rosen DavisDangerous Affairs"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"An indifferent Heyer novel, however, is worth three books by a lesser author.My problems with this book are that I found it difficult to like the protagonist (I didn't dislike him, either; I simply found him uninteresting), I found the plot very easy to predict, and the romance seemed to me to spring up out of the blue. Most of Heyer's novels are much better than this, with beautifully-drawn characters and believable romances.If this were by anyone else, I probably would have given it 4 stars, but it's only an average Heyer novel and not an outstanding one."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"As always, Georgette Heyer's humor is the driving force in this wonderful story! Her ability to see the satirical in all social situations make her books an enchanting read. The Quiet Gentleman includes a murderous plot, with the usual mix of gentle romance. A thoroughly enjoyable romp through Regency English society!"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Georgette Heyer novels should be printed with a warning. I have to be careful when reading her novels in public. This is because they inevitably cause a goofy smile to be pasted on my face, and I'll start giggling loudly at random times for no apparent reason to the poor, unsuspecting public around me. The Quiet Gentleman is no exception to this rule. Absolutely nothing beats a Heyer Regency romance for the sheer enjoyment factor and witty, intelligent humor. She truly is the closest thing to reading Jane Austen - and is generally more hilarious. The Quiet Gentleman is the perfect combination of mystery and romance. The whodunit aspect of the novel is so carefully plotted that the revelation of the guilty party is an eyebrow-raising surprise. And with the romance, Heyer once again succeeds in bringing together two seemingly irreconcilable individuals who turn out to be, of course, perfect for each other. To all you fellow Austen lovers out there - if you've never read a Heyer, and my enthusiasm still hasn't convinced you to pick one up, read The Quiet Gentleman for the pure novelty factor that the hero can be named Gervase Frant and still be incredibly hot. Unbelievable, but trust me, it's true."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Too much description of the Castle, too many uninteresting characters-I cannot like the heroine, and don't feel very drawn to the hero either. Cannot begin to compare with the best of Ms. Heyer's work. I read it right after re-reading \\"Frederica\\" which was probably unfair, but \\"Gentleman\\" really suffered by comparison! Can't really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"While this is not one of my favorite Heyers, it is an enjoyable comedy of manners. I place it in my second tier of Heyer books. In addition to unexpected matches, there is an element of mystery, as our hero faces repeated attacks upon his life."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Having read most of Georgette Heyer's regency novels, I was sad that I only had a few left to read and assumed the good ones were all behind me (Frederica, The Grand Sophy, Venetia, etc). So I was very pleasantly surprised to come across this one with a bit of the mystery/gothic novel about it. Yes, it was not hard to figure out the \\"bad guy\\" early on, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. The love story was a quiet one - which makes sense with the title - and that didn't bother me either. This book reminded me a bit of the Reluctant Widow, though not quite as good as that one. Like most of her novels, I would keep this in my bookshelf to reread in the future."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"About the book:Gervase Frant returns home after surviving the Napoleanic Wars. Gervase is now the Earl of St. Erth and is home to claim himself as master of the estate known as Stanyon Manor. His step-mother Lady St.Erth, and step-brother Martin, are both openly unhappy about this. Also staying at Stanyon Castle are Gervase's cousin Theo and Miss Morville who is a guest.One day while out riding, Gervase stumbles upon a maiden in distress. Miss Marianne Bolderwood has fallen off her horse.Gervase notices right away how lovely Marianne is and begins, like so many others, to give her his attentions. This makes Martin furious, he thinks that Marianne is his personal property and plans to marry her someday, fueling his hatred of Gervase even more.With Gervase waking in the middle of the night swearing someone was just in his room, to his being setup to purposely take a tumble off his horse, the new Earl has the distinct feeling that the jealous Martin is behind it all. Miss Morville actually tries to help Gervase figure out who is trying to do him harm and she becomes a good friend to the new Earl.My thoughts:Since I first read Heyer's work she has reminded me of Jane Austen.Heyer brings Regency England to life in her stories, and as I read, I am instantly transported there. She set a Gothic mood in this novel from the start with her description of Stanyon Manor and I really enjoyed that.Heyer had a knack for creating fun characters and storylines. There was a sweet and unexpected romance in the plot.Gervase Frant himself is a well thought out character and he is definitely The Quiet Gentleman, never losing his composure and finding clever ways to get through difficult situations. He makes for a great hero.There's a duel, people wandering the castle at night, a ball, men fighting over a female, witty dialogue and murder attempts. What more could you want in a book?I giggled as I read, was swept into the storyline and sighed as I turned the last page. Heyer had me guessing until the end and the person behind trying to harm Gervase wasn't who I thought it would be.\\"Good God! The fellow's nothing but a curst dandy!\\"- p.13With interesting characters, a Gothic like mansion, a dash of humor and some romance, you have a fun mystery the likes of which only Georgette Heyer can weave."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Gervase Frant returns from fighting in the Napoleonic wars to inherit his seat as the Earl of Stanyon. His family is not at all happy to find that he is still alive as they all assumed he would die a horrible death and leave his half brother to inherit the estate. As his step mother says, in droll English fashion, serving at the front lines of a war is, to her mind, \\"most unhealthy\\" and it really was a pity that he didn't die doing it. But, he is alive and his family now has to deal with a step brother heading the household and no one is happy about it. In fact someone is so unhappy that \\"accidents\\" begin to befall the new Earl and he soon realizes that not only does someone not want him at Stanyon, someone wants him dead.This novel was a delightful mix of mystery, historical and regency romance all twirled into one with lots of intrigue, suspense, mystery and yes just a touch of romance making this a wonderful read.I also liked the heroine was named Drusilla and wasn't necessarily considered a beauty. She was sensible, a little plump, short, and didn't have anything really to recommend her aside from her ability not to fall down into fits the moment something tense happens requiring a swoon. A rarity in the regency, unheard of in romance novels, but Georgette Heyer makes it work to comedic effect and makes you love the character all the more.With Heyer's witty dialog, engaging and sparkling characters and her humorous portrayals of characters, repartee, and the situations that come out of them this was truly an engaging and wonderful read. It was a breath of fresh air after I was finally starting to get a little sick of regency romances. Not sick of them anymore! I think I might even be interested in giving her modern day mystery novels a whirl, if they are anything like The Quiet Gentleman I won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"The only other Georgette Heyer work that I have read before is Cotillion when I was a teenager. I loved it, but somehow, missed out on reading more of her work as I grew up. I found the Arrow reprints on a book shelf in a shop in Cardiff, Wales. and brought them home to read.It is warm, filled with laughter and brightness. Innocence is wonderfully cherished in this book and the characters are sparkling with humour and wit like diamonds. It is a remarkable book, light read for anyone who likes romance and it also something that picks you up from pits of depression if you are likely to encounter those in your life."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Timeless. Comfort reading at its best. If you like Regency romances, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"STORY BRIEF:Gervase (Ger) is the heir. His mother ran off with a lover which caused Ger's father to hate Ger. The father remarried and had a second son Martin. Ger has been away for a long time. The Earl died. Ger now returns to his inherited entailed estate. Martin inherited everything else. Ger's cousin Theo is living there and has been an excellent manager of the estates in Ger's absence. Ger's friend Lucius (Lucy) visits. Martin's mother the Dowager also lives there. She is haughty and boring. She asked Drusilla to stay with her to keep her company while Drusilla's parents were traveling. Drusilla is plain looking, perceptive, very smart, and has a lot of common sense. Ger was in the military and is a highly skilled swordsman. He is handsome, intelligent, calm, quiet, and amazingly courteous to Martin and the Dowager who are rude and dislike him.Ger's life is in danger. There are several attempts to hurt/kill him. Martin is the obvious suspect because he is very open about his hatred of Ger. His other motive is inheriting the estate.A secondary story involves beautiful Marianne. Almost every man who sees her wants her including Martin, Ger, and Lucy. In order to spend time with her, Ger hosts a party.REVIEWER'S OPINION:As an audiobook, this was a pleasant way to spend time. The best parts were the characters. The author is so good at pulling different types of people (whom I've probably known and forgotten about) into the story. Although Martin is kind of a bad guy, toward the end of the book I was enjoying his character - maybe because he was so open and never tried to hide his thoughts or feelings. He couldn't control his emotions and acted without thinking. He was angry blaming Ger for everything in his life that went wrong. Ger told someone that Martin never sees beyond his nose. Martin probably had some smarts, but they weren't visible through his immature rants and rages. I was chuckling over Martin. He was fun to read about.The main story is a mystery - who is trying to kill Ger? It was good. I didn't feel like we are slowly unraveling clues at the author's whim. It's not a traditional mystery of someone dead, and the rest of the story is figuring out who did it. This is a series of harmful occurrences that we are living through.There is a bit of romance at the end, but there is no developing romance during the story. It's more of a respectful friendship. That was ok, but I would have liked more emotional something.The narrator Cornelius Garrett is one of my favorites. He's good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 10 hours. Narrator: Cornelius Garrett.

The perfect book by a cozy fire on a cold winter night."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"It probably would have been this book: a gentle story of mannerly, upper-class people set in Regency England that is primarily a novel of manners but with a hint of romance and suspense. As in all of Heyer's Regency books (at least the few I have read so far), her command of that era is so masterful that it makes for a strong and unshakeable sense of that time and place. In The Quiet Gentleman, in particular, her writing reads as though it were written during that time, not during the 20th century; except for a slightly more streamlined and modern use of language, The Quiet Gentleman reads almost as though it were written by Ms. Austen herself.That is this book's biggest strength; that and the occasional flashes of wit and tongue-in-cheek humor. I'm thinking in particular of the few scenes near the end of the book involving Mr. and Mrs. Morville; they were wonderfully drawn characters whose appearances were all too brief. Drusilla Morville, the main heroine, was also a wonderful character; she is level-headed, strong, and ever-so practical, although of only mediocre appearance. And when she realizes that she has fallen in love with Gervase Frant, the main character, she is certain he feels nothing for her and bemoans the fact that she cannot even swoon; after all, if she could only occasionally swoon like any well-bred young lady, that would certainly give her some attraction in Gervase's eyes.But other than these occasional bright spots, The Quiet Gentleman is an apt title for this book, as I found it overall pretty dull. Gervase Frant is a phlegmatic character who, although quite handsome and quite the fashion plate, expresses very little emotion and certainly never stirs any in the reader. His romance with Drusilla Morville proceeds at a quiet, gentle, gradual pace and comes to a quiet and predictable conclusion, just like a Jane Austen novel. And although there is an element of suspense to the story, it is very mild and very predictable; there are two obvious suspects who have strong motives for wanting Gervase dead, and the culprit does indeed end up being one of the two.The only weaknesses in the book, other than its overall dullness, are the occasional lapses into farce. For instance, when Gervase Frant returns home unscathed from the Napoleonic Wars to claim his title and his inheritance, his step-mother and half-brother are quite open and unabashed in expressing their disappointment that he wasn't killed in battle. I am certain that no decent person, even in the ill-mannered 21st century much less the gently-mannered 19th, would express such an opinion so plainly and openly. And then it was made worse when they inevitably followed up their comments by telling Gervase that it was really ok, because he was a decent fellow and they really didn't wish him ill.Others have commented that this is one of their favorite Heyers; in fact, Karen Hawkins, in her very nice introduction to this edition, says that. However, I found it overall too dull and nondescript to be a favorite; I still have several Heyers in my to-be-read pile and am certain there must be some more engaging stories among them. But admittedly, I am not a fan of Jane Austen; so to those of you who are, The Quiet Gentleman might very well be a favorite."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"If you Regency fans out there haven't yet read THE QUIET GENTLEMAN by Georgette Heyer, you're in for a treat with this romance filled with comedy and danger.The earl of St. Erth has come home--not that anyone wanted him to. Banished by his father because he was a constant reminder of the wife who deserted him, Gervase has spent his years at war. His stepmother and half-brother hoped a bullet would find him. After all, war is dangerous. But St. Erth is home, to a sullen family, a motley assortment of hangers-on and the no-nonsense Drusilla, a guest of the family. Matters worsen when Gervase and his brother compete for the same lady. And then the accidents start. Or are they accidents? Does someone want the earl dead?THE QUIET GENTLEMAN is the type of romance I like, plenty of regency and with something else, in this case comedy and mystery, contributing to the action. I also love a secret identity story, and THE QUIET GENTLEMAN is one without masks. Gervase, blond, blue-eyed (I LOVE blond heroes), his manner unassuming, gives the impression of a lightweight. But he's no pushover, as the other players in the story soon discover.The danger mounts with the page count. And not only the serious danger from a killer, but that most dreaded of comic regency dangers, rabid mothers seeking the earl as a matrimonial prize for their daughters. And, in a refreshing change, the heroine is the antithesis of the beautiful but not-much-else female.I haven't read Georgette Heyer in a while, and I'd forgotten the sheer pleasure of wallowing in everything Regency. The history, the customs, the situations, the clothes, and most of all the language. Granted, I don't understand some of the thieves' cant, but that's part of the fun. If you really want translations, page through the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue.They don't write regency romances like this any more. In these days of wallpaper, if you want a more authentic regency experience, read Georgette Heyer's THE QUIET GENTLEMAN.ARC provided by Sourcebooks"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"The mystery kept me wondering as I enjoyed the characters.Gervace Frant returns from war to the mismatched castle and estate of Stanyon where he hasn't felt welcome for years. Now he is returning as the new Earl to take control of the estate. His younger half-brother, Martin, is the son who has been doted on and treated as if he would become the Lord of the manor. Someone is so unhappy about the new Earl that he begins to suffer accidents. At first they seem almost like careless pranks that might cause some small harm but when the Earl is shot it is clear that someone really does mean to remove him.Martin is a hot head with a short temper. He doesn't like his elder brother whom he barely remembers. His antagonism increases when Gervace begins to pay attention to the local beauty, Marianne, interfering with Martin's courtship attempts. One of Gervace's good friends from the service visits and he too shows interest in Marianne.Other members of the household include Martin's mother, the Dowager, who only sees perfection in Martin and views Gervace as a threat to her son's happiness. At least Gervace finds one friend at home in his cousin, Theo, who has been his man of business watching over his affairs. There is also Miss Morville, a neighbor young lady who serves as a sensible, and seemingly unremarkable, temporary companion to the Dowager.Marianne is the sweet beauty who attracts the men. The estimable Miss Morville, Drusilla, manages the household and handles all circumstances from planning a ball to taking charge when the Earl arrives with a gunshot wound. Drusilla clearly likes the Earl and is concerned for his welfare but she has no expectation that he would be interested in her.There are red herrings that blur the search for the person attempting to murder Gervace. This kept me interested to see if I was guessing the villain and motive correctly. I did guess about midway into the story but the confirmation didn't come until near the end.The story focuses on the different society positions, the behavioral expectations and the jealousies existing among the characters. The romance is merely light flirtations. I enjoyed the subtle satire, sarcasms and gentle humor. The writing tone, detail and characterizations fit the time period to perfection. There is a certain propriety and elegance to be found in Heyer's writing and characters. If you enjoy an old-fashioned romance, with no sexual content but plenty of character, you would like this story and this author."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"My second Heyer book was a bit different because there was a big mystery in it, still it was not one of her true mystery novel. There is romance, mystery and the stillness that is proper manners.First I was not sure about this one, mostly cos I felt Gervase was going after the wrong woman. Well I feared so. Though that fixes itself because he is a very quiet gentleman. A proper and nice man, a bit too nice actually. But then I do think Heyer seemed to like second chances and being all nice and all.Back to the story. Gervase comes home. His younger step-brother resents him because he wants to be lord of the manor and get the pretty girl. Soon strange things start to happen. Who wants to kill Gervase? And that is the question. The way she continued to spin things did have me wondering even if I guessed it (ok I did not settle, I had options).Martin the step-brother was very young and rushed into things. Still I never disliked him. Cousin Theo was all nice and managed things around the place. Miss Morville I liked from the start and hoped Gervase would fall for her. Miss Bolderwood was the beauty everyone fell for but yes just too pretty and nice (not the smartest cookie in the jar). Lucy (not a girl, just a nick-name) was Gervase's friend and fell for the local beauty too. But before you think everyone fell for her, I think I can spoil things and say that Gervase did not. It's not really a spoiler since he kind of realizes it at once. It was a full cast of characters who all brought something to the book.And again, everyone is just so proper and it is fantastic. The style is truly Austen and the language so too. I can't help to giggle when a certain young woman cries that someone tried to make love to her. Oh the phrasing is just wonderful. She meant kiss, nothing more.Still I did feel it was a bit slow at times, but I enjoyed it none the less.Conclusion:Heyer is just fun."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"Light-hearted romances (\\"romance\\" in the original, literary sense) are sometimes sneered at because they aren't Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, but not every good, readable novel has to be -- or even should aspire to be -- great literature. Heyer was the master of the Regency-period historical (she basically invented the genre) and her books stay in print decade after decade. She always did an excellent job not only in creating characters possessed of individuality but of setting them firmly in the milieu of middle-to-upper-class English society. I've seen complaints by some present-day readers that the early 19th century is just too strange or foreign, they don't understand the slang, they can't picture what people are wearing, and the mores are alien. But restricting oneself to reading only about the familiar and everyday is mentally limiting. And if you feel compelled to pause and look up \\"curricle\\" in your dictionary, that's a good thing. Yes, Heyer's view of history is socially selective -- she isn't Dickens -- but the detail she presents is highly accurate.In this one, Capt. Gervase Frant is serving in France when his father dies and he inherits the earldom of St. Erth. He sells out his commission and returns home (though he takes his time about it) to take up his responsibilities and estates. His mother, unfortunately, had run off with a bounder shortly after Ger's birth and when she died in poverty a few years later, the old man remarried, had another son, and pretty much ignored his heir. The younger half-brother, Martin, now in his early twenties, has been spoiled all his life and both he and the earl's second wife hoped Gervase would do the proper thing and die in battle, thereby making Martin the heir, as he clearly felt he deserved. The new earl is something of a dandy, but a quiet, undemonstrative one. He's also an excellent horseman and a patient master to his underlings -- though dealing with the lazy, egotistical Dowager Countess who plainly resents his existence is certainly a trial. Martin is a pain in the neck, too, but at least there's Theo, Gervase's first cousin, who has managed the St. Erth estates for years and done an excellent job of it. There's also the lovely young Miss Marianne Bolderwood on a neighboring estate, whom Martin considers his personal property; she's a featherbrain but a nice one and the earl pays her close attention. And there's Miss Drusilla Morville, the daughter of two intellectuals and authors; she's not especially attractive and admits she doesn't know how to be romantic, but she's of a very practical turn of mind, pays attention to what's going on around her, knows how to get things done, and even enjoys organizing the earl's welcome-home ball. And she doesn't faint at the sight of blood, which turns out to be useful when a series of accidents seem to zero in on Gervase. All in all, it's a good story, though a bit predictable, and the resolution of the mystery is somewhat telegraphed. Still, there's a reason Heyer's novels have been continually popular for three generations."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"The Quiet Gentleman is the third Heyer book I have read and the most enjoyable. It is about an Earl who returns from war only to find he is not welcome by his Stepbrother or Stepmother both of whom who wished he had died in the war. Once home he is beset by \\"accidents\\" and that is where the mystery comes in. The Sense comes in with Miss Morville who seems to know the common sense approach to any problem. I really liked her because she wasn't some silly female who swoons she actually is helpful in the midst of a mystery. I also liked her because is not a size 2 and gorgeous. She is plumb and ok looking. And yet she is the one of the love interests in the story not just a side charecter. This is a good book give it a try."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"\\"The Quiet Gentleman\\" and \\"An Unknown Ajax\\" are two books with a similar premise, but don't confuse them. In each case, an extremely unwanted, not to say loathed, heir comes to the rambling - or crumbling - family seat in the countryside. But that's where the similarity ends. \\"The Quiet Gentleman\\" features a seeming dandy with a soft voice and great charm, pitted against more than just resentment. In fact, it becomes clear that someone would be happy to do what years of military service failed: put him underground. He is surrounded by people who are either hostile, ill-bred, or dull, with only a taciturn cousin on his side. The prosaic Miss Morville, a guest in the house, is a plain young woman with nothing much to recommend her except common sense, but the new Earl finds himself relying on her for everything from arranging a ball to, eventually, saving his life. This isn't one of my favorite Heyer books, but I've read it at least half a dozen times over the years and it holds up pretty well. The only real drawback, a serious one, is that I have never seen any physical spark between the hero and heroine. Ms. Heyer wrote clean romances, so I wouldn't expect the kind of sizzle of modern times, but Miss Morville's lack of looks and constant down-to-earth statements are emphasized so often that I truly don't buy into the romance. However, the ill-bred conversations of the Dowager, her daughter and the off-the-wall conversations of Miss Morville's parents are all a treat."},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"I share the opinion of another reviewer, that the romance seemed to \\"spring up out of the blue\\"! You never have a clue that Gervase has changed his opinion of Drusilla until the last chapter. He keeps all his emotions close. The mystery I also agree is predictable. Drusilla is an enjoyable character though!"},{"Title":"The Quiet Gentleman","review":"I ordered quite a few of Heyer's books during her birthday anniversary when amazon was offering them as low as $1.99 or $2.99. The Quiet Gentleman was one of those books I ordered and after noticing the different ratings I was a little skeptical I would like it.Not knowing what the book was about I was a little surprised to find the book contain mystery and very subtle romance. The Earl of St. Erth has just arrived to England and is not welcomed by his step-mama or his brother, who had high hopes to become the next earl. It gets interesting when someone is out to murder the earl and I was kept guessing til the end.Not one of her best books but I was still interested to keep on reading on. A book I would read again but one looking for witty dialogue, romance and a London setting-this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is Percy's last adventure of the Revolution. I must admit that I was glad that the man was finally going to get some time to go home to England and sit on his can! His wife must have been getting pretty lonely by then. Anyway, the Pimpernel's last escapade is a wow! He must help a misguided young French actress who is duped into Chauvelin's service. Several young counter-revolutionaries are also in trouble, as is Marguerite, per usual. As Percy plots to spring his wife, he stages lots of daring escapes and wears some classic disguises. Poor Chauvelin is on the verge of complete mental collapse by now, having been duped countless times, and the humiliating situation in which he is left at the end will make the reader guffaw out loud. Orczy paints an amazingly vivid portrait of Robespierre's fall and the end of that bloody revolution."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Triumph is an excellent ending to an excellent series. Sir Percy has to face his most difficult challenge. One that will bring him face to face with his most implacable enemey, and also save the life of the woman he adores. Full of Pimpernel wit and audacity, this is a must for all Pimpernel fans!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Triumph is the first SP book I've read after the original story. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't excellent. I found the beginning to be very drawn out; it took me a very long time to read the first 75 pages or so, before it got going. Once it did start, (with Theresia and SP meeting for the first time) I found it to be fast paced, and I looked forward to reading it. However, the long beginning brought it down to a 3 star book for me. Also, the ending wasn't really explained at all...one second, literally, Robespierre is the tyrant in charge, next paragraph, well, no spoiler, but suffice to say he's not. Even in real life, the change was not so dramatic, and surely Orczy could have written a page or two more explaination.Furthermore, I was disappointed that while St. Just, Andrew, and Tony were mentioned, that was about it; they were barely in the picture at all.A fun adventure.....but not much more than that."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is one of my favorite pimpernel books. It is so awsome!The story begins with a fortune teller predicting to Robispeirre that the only thing to hinder his taking over France is the Scarlet Pimpernel. So, of course, he goes to Chauvelin, who once again sets masterful plans for the Pimpernel's capture.One of the things that I liked about this book was the simplicity of plot. No more going for the Pimpernel's honor, or others through him. The plot is cut and dry simple, catch and kill the Scarlet Pimpernel. That is not to say that the Pimpernel does not have something up his sleeve. I simply mean that as far as Chauvelin is concerned his plots aren't as elaborate or far-fetched as they have been in the past.Margarite is also involved(duh). But in the case of this book, she actually doesn't get involed through an act of her own stupidity. Also in this book it dwells less on Margarite's life in her captivity than others do.Lastly, I love the dialogs in this book. Percy shines in this book almost unlike any other. Therisa Cabarras is an interesting character, and she has two great conversations with our elusive Hero. Chauvelin is Chauvelin. No matter how hard he tries he simply cannot keep track of Percy(and belive me he tries extra hard in this book). Chauvelin and Percy have the best exchange ever in this book, a whole chapter of uninterupted audacidy. Any Pimpernel lover will be in heaven.I highly recomend this book to all who liked the original, and any of the sequels. But if you haven't read the original Scarlet Pimpernel then I suggest reading that first, so as to know the characters a little better.-E"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"If you know this story, or have even read the CAPS section above, you'll know where I get my net-name from. La Cabarrus (based on a historical figure whose real life reads better than most fiction) is the main reason why this book is one of the best in the series. The terror has reached its height and both of Orczy's main protagonists are beginning to crack under the strain. Chauvelin has become obsessed with catching Sir Percy using any means necessary and his current tool is beautiful Spaniard, Theresia Cabarrus. Unfortunately for both Chauvelin and Blakeney, you never quite know where her loyalties lie. When she succeeds in luring Margot into Chauvelin's clutches, Sir Percy is driven to ever more extreme measures to save her. Can Cabarrus be trusted? Is she friend or foe? Unlike Chauvelin, she can see through Sir Percy's disguises, which makes her doubly dangerous to know.As ever Orczy delivers a cracking good adventure through a slightly rose-tinted quizzing-glass, making even the rather gruesome sections seem light-hearted... unless you really stop and think about what she's saying."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Loved it - a must for any Scarlet Pimpernel fan! I read the original years ago but only recently discovered that Orczy had written numerous sequels, and I'm enjoying every one! Working through the plot twists is like following Columbo as he tries to solve a mystery; it's no surprise that Orczy also wrote detective novels. The whole concept is just so much fun! Interestingly, though, she remains true to the historical reality of the period at the same time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"First, the good points:As other reviewers have stated, this book is Emmuska Orczy's excellent conclusion to her Scarlet Pimpernel series. In it, Sir Percy Blakeney tries to effect the hardest kind of rescue possible--that of a counter-revolutionary, who doesn't _want_ to be rescued--in the closing months of the Reign of Terror, when drowning \\"aristos\\" by the shipload had apparently replaced the guillotine as the preferred method of execution. All the while, Sir Percy must match wits with said rescuee's lover--an actress almost as good at disguise as the Pimpernel himself, who has secretly been blackmailed by an increasingly paranoid Citizen Robespierre (and the revenge-obsessed Chauvelin) to bring them the Pimpernel's head--at the cost of her lover's! Can Sir Percy outwit someone who can anticipate his every trick?Marvelous story and a fit ending to the literally epic series.Now, the bad points--Don't be fooled by the professional cover art--the Kindle transfer was obviously done in a huge hurry. Whoever it was ran the text through a computer spellchecker without taking the time to make sure the machine had replaced errors with the correct word. Consequently, words such as but/by to/too/two this/thus are interchanged. But there are many more. If you cannot get past such things, I would recommend finding another edition of this."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I bought this book for my wife who loves the series. She said that the book was excelent, but beware, the editing is HORRIBLE. You have to be prepared to translate quite a few words in the text. It must have been edited by a computer becuase no human could be such an idiot. She said that it is kind of funny after a while, but she did enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book brings the Scarlet Pimpernel series to a very satisfying end.

A must-read for any Scarlet Pimpernel fan."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel again has to deal with a femme fatale, but this time, she is Spanish. This doesn't mean that the Robespierre types are not around, just that she is involved with one of them.The Pimpernel has to save a brash young man from her wily clutches, and really is quite enjoying himself in the process.When she can't outthink or seduce our hero, they decide to do the kidnap the wife routine.

It is as simple as that. But the story delivers a powerful impact, because a man like this finds opposition everywhere even from the rulers of his own Church.He was first christened John Patrick in 1907; but when he entered the novitiate of the Franciscan Order after 5 years in St. Anthony's Seminary at Santa Barbara, he was re-christened Emmett. He spent 12 years in the seminary and 14 more in the parish to which he was assigned --the South Side of Phoenix. This was a spot characterized by U. S. officials as the worst slum area in the United States. It was close to the city dump; there were open privies, dilapidated shacks, stabbings and shootings on the streets at night, whores, outlaws, glassy-eyed victims of denatured alcohol, grotesquely deformed venereal babies, women being delivered in broken-down hovels by untrained midwives while their children looked on ... and the underprivileged: impoverished Negroes, Spanish-Americans, whites.\\"Sandy-haired Emmett McLoughlin,\\" as Time called him, founded here St. Monica's Hospital, described by a Public Affairs Pamphlet on housing as \\"the first American hospital founded with a definite interracial policy.\\" The Time article explains what happened:\\"Soon young Father McLoughlin began to be almost as well-known in Phoenix as the mayor. He organized a slum clearance campaign and wangled federalfunds for three major housing projects. He started a church for poor people in a vacant store. Then he began to crusade for a hospital for the poor. He persuaded Mrs. Roosevelt to make a special trip to Phoenix on behalf of the project, and in 1943 a 232-bed St. Monica's Hospital was built, at a cost of more than $500.000. Father McLoughlin served as superintendent. He was also chairman of the Phoenix Housing Authority and secretary of the state Board of Health.\\"The busy priest had little time or patience for formalities. Mostly he dressed in slacks and a sports shirt, and wore his priest's habit only on formal occasions....\\"McLoughlin became one of the most famous personalities of the Southwest. The Brooklyn Tablet, Catholic diocesan paper, headlined: \\"CATHOLIC CENTER AIDS NEGROES'. Notable Record Made at Institution in Arizona.\\" The Catholic Registersaid: \\"GREAT NEGRO APOSTOLATE IS DEVELOPED AT PHOENIX.\\" Said El Sol in a 7-column banner: \\"EL SANTO DEL SOUTHSIDE DE PHOENIX!\\" and spoke of \\"el spiritu cristiano del Rev. Emmett McLoughlin.\\" St. Anthony's Messenger carried a story headed, \\"SHANTY TOWN NO MORE. A Franciscan priest turns Good Samaritan for the Negroes and Little Harlem in Phoenix, Ariz.\\" And so it went.Then his hierarchy charged him with neglect of priestly duties, ordered him to resign and to leave Phoenix. After agonized soul-searching, Emmett McLoughlin decided that his work in the clinics and in human rehabilitation was as true a reflection of the teachings of Jesus as the piety of prayers in a chapel: he refused to surrender, and resigned as a member of the Catholic priesthood.These were turbulent days, with threats and anonymous letters and telephone calls; and a fighting Irish-man like McLoughlin cannot describe them dispassionately. But he speaks frankly and without rancor.Here is a human drama stranger than fiction. It reveals one man's lonely search for a way to live and practice day by day what he so devoutly believes."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"Troy Soos has started a wonderful series with this first installment of the Mickey Rawlings mysteries. The combination of the early 1900s time period, the freshness of a young kid new to the big leagues, and a murder intertwined with baseball is great. It is an easy and quick read. The setting plays a big part of the appeal of this mystery novel--which Soos masterfully creates. The mystery/plot is believable and does keep the reader in suspense. I eagerly await each installment of this series. Soos writing seems to get progressively better."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"There is just the right mixture of baseball, mayhem, and 1921 events to make a fine book. The author's subsequent baseball mysteries are a little better, but this one certainly satisies. Of course, if you're not a baseball fan, this may leave you a little cold--no pun about death intended."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"I like baseball, I like historical fiction, and I like murder mysteries. This book is an enjoyable combination of all three of those.As you have probably gathered by now, the protagonist is a baseball player in 1912 who has just joined the Boston Red Sox. Just as he arrives at Fenway Park, he stumbles across a body -- and his adventures begin.There are several things that make this story work. One of them is that Our Hero isn't impressively intelligent. He's realistically drawn, and he makes realistically dumb mistakes.The author also does a good job of capturing the sensibilities of the era outside the news headlines (such as the Titanic sinking); Mickey likes those newfangled movies, even if he has to sneak to see them because the baseball pros are concerned that the flickering lights are bad for his eyes. And I had been unaware of the Highlanders, who played in a baseball stadium in New Jersey in which attendees walked across the field to get to-and-from their seats.There's just enough baseball to make the story fun for the casual fan (Go Diamondbacks!), without making the reader drown in statistics or who-did-what at the plate. Some of the characters are famous names that you'll recognize -- such as Ty Cobb, who apparently was a real jerk even if he was a great baseball player. I found the history charming rather than tedious (I'm not one for reciting baseball history).The mystery -- who did it? -- is good but not astonishing. However, the rest of the book is so much fun that I didn't mind in the least.If you're looking for a summer beach read, this would be a heck of a good choice."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"This is one of the best novels I've read in my life! I bought it in New England, thinking that Soos must be a local writer. He captured the essence of New England at the turn of the century.Any serious baseball fan has to read this book while on a trip to Boston (which must, of course, include a trip to Fenway!)Bravo, Mr. Soos!"},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"I am not interested in baseball or the Red Sox (and I'm from Boston), but I found this book very interesting and fast reading. I enjoyed the bits of history and could see in my mind the places in Boston that were written about. I enjoyed it very much. (ps: I even checked some of the facts to see if they were acurate and most were!!)."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"By using a baseball player as a detective, Troy Soos, givesus the possibility of finding the murder together with him, because his hero is nothing special and the lines of thought are very common.Different from other detective books, in which the authors try to create a very difficult line of thinking to make the hero look greater than an normal human being, Mickey the hero of Troy is just that: A Normal Human Being."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"The first installment of the Mickey Rawlings series leaves you hoping that both the hero and the character will mature as things progress. &quot;Murder at Fenway Park&quot; is linear, neat little bit of amatuer sleuth fiction, but nothing spectacular. The writing and the plot are a little too flat.The little bits of baseball history that are threaded through the book are very nice, but the descriptions of the character playing in the games become very tedious and really do nothing to move the story along. They're the sort of descriptions that you'll find in the sports section of any newspaper during the summer. For someone who is clearly passionate about the game of baseball, Soos descriptions of play are surprisingly mundane.And in spite of the book's historical setting, the day-to-day events of the era seem to be dropped in for effect, rather than interwoven into the fabric of the story. And our hero Mickey seems to have quite a few anachronistic notions about forensic evidence for a boy who grew up in rural New Jersey at the turn of the century. These will come across as patently absurd to fans of historical mysteries.Still, there's a simple charm to the book that shows through, and the book leaves you wanting to give Soos one more chance. Maybe in the next installment the writing perks up and is a little less grade-school level. And maybe the descriptions of life around a baseball locker room are a little less G-rated and stilted. And maybe the plot isn't wrapped up so tidily at the end of the story.I'm rooting for Soos and his hero Rawlings to get better, because the premise of his series is so engaging. But if it keeps up like this, it's not going to cut it."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"Mickey Rawlings arrives for duty on the Red Sox, only to find a dead body at his entrance to Fenway Park.

Along the way, Mickey suspects almost everybody on his team and several ballplayers on other teams of being the murderer.I read the Cincinnati Red Stalkings before I read this book, and it was much better. The love interest started out interesting, but the lady disappeared for too much of the story."},{"Title":"Murder at Fenway Park","review":"This was the second Mickey Rawlings book I read and I thought the &quot;Cincinnati Red Stalkings&quot; was much better. I thought that the characters in &quot;Murder at Fenway Park&quot; were not very well-developed or differentiated from each other. I also thought that most of the middle of the book consisted of Mickey going from here to there without advancing the plot or doing much detecting. I look forward to reading the other books in the series but don't recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Contrary Writer: Alternative Information for Writing in the 2000's","review":"This book is the straight scoop about the publishing industry. Not at all like the silly how-to books for writers that just recycle the same hopeful (and useless) advice. Cartoons and a humorous approach make this a great book for writers who want REAL info."},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"As the author of this book, I happy to hear criticism and welcome people sending me their opinions. However, it is important for people to understand that this book is for people who have have no experience with beta testing or are looking to improve an existing program.If you have already a successful beta program, you do not need this book. If you have years of experience in conducting tests, this book will only confirm what you know. It is focused on best practices.If you have a beta program and it doesn't work or if you have never beta tested before, then I believe you will get a lot of benefit from this book(...)"},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"Having previously coordinated beta tests at several companies, I've seen how a wonderfully executed beta can be in terms of value to the organization.. as well as how a poorly defined program can result in months of wasted time.In reading the book, I can identify with several of the &quot;gotchas&quot; that the author points out (such as how crucial customer communication is during a test). The elements of a well run beta are clearly described, and are presented in such a manner that anyone can take the concepts as a template to apply in their own organization.I have purchased a half dozen copies to distribute to various groups within my company, and hope to get both hardware and software teams to utilize the planning, execution, and post beta processes that are described in this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to improve the value of a beta test to their product - or needs to fix just one component of their current test procedure."},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"Having never managed a beta test or QA testing, I found this book insightful into the processes used. It was definitely a fascinating book full of valuable information for anyone interested in beta test management. I'd highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"Although it doesn't go into a great deal of depth, this is an excellent starting point if you're looking to build a beta program"},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"book arrived by promised date in promised quality. would certainly do business with seller again. book is an interesting read for anyone in the beta testing business."},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"I appear to have to give at least one star, but I'm not actually sure what that star is for. This book is so lightweight and so lacking in anything of practical value that I think you could change the title to pretty much anything you wanted and no one would notice. Most of what you need to know can be learned by scanning the table of contents. You know it's bad when the author has to write his own review and gives himself 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Beta Testing for Better Software","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I've worked 10+ years asa software developer and manager so I guess I've seen everythingbecause this book didn't present any ideas/processes thatI hadn't seen from working in the industry.

This isn't a keeper"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Product in good condition except that a couple of maps had been torn out but where still in the book and I received it sooner than expected.

Super crazy informative!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I just got back from a week trip to Kauai last month and this book was a life saver! Anytime I veered from the book, I was either lost or got stuck eating not so good food. I feel like I really was able to make the most of my week by having this book to point me in the right directions. Everything about this book was great! If you're going to Kauai don't make the mistake of not having brought this book with you. It's absolutely a must! Enjoy Kauai, it's beautiful! Oh and Kipu Ranch Adventures is awesome ... just like the book said. Staff were great and I never thought I'd see such beautiful views. Two thumbs up!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book was the ONLY one we used after a few days in Hawaii, simply because it is the best!! Driving directions were flawless, prices accurate, and the special tips were great. We started referring to it as \\"The Bible\\", as in, \\"Well, what does the Bible say, should we go there?\\" You will get so much more out of your vacation with this book in hand!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I purchased this book for my sister prior to her moving from CA to Oahu AND she loves it!!! Last year I purchased the same book covering the Big Island - I read it from cover to cover before vacationing on the Island and it was like being on a professional guided tour! I highly recommend this read and give all my thanks to the author for the wonderful memories!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Really wonderful book-the best maps--better than maps we got in honolulu--detailed, very very accurate information about everything from waikiki, hanauma bay, what to do, where to stay, luaus, etc. recommended by another friend who had visited a different hawaii island--highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is an excellent book.

We saved a lot of money and avoided some hassles based on the help from this book.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We recently travelled to Hawaii and used this book exclusively. \\"Oahu Revealed\\" led us to every destination with detailed directions--the usual and the unusual places. We had the history of the sites, hours and phone numbers and insider suggestions at our fingertips. We might not have found the out of the way turtle basking beach or the small restaurants with local flavor without this book.

Tells lot of things you didn't know about Oahu. It gives and rates restaurants, hiking trails, beaches, activities, and places to stay."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"As with the others in in this series, this is the only book you really need. What is funny is to see how many others will be reading this on the plane over."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is an excellent resource. I've been to Oahu once in 2008 and used my brother-in-law's copy of this book before we went, and just purchased my own last week for a trip in October. Having an idea of what was around before we went helped tremendously, and having it again now that I am familiar with the area makes it even better.Oahu has so much to do, it almost gives you a headache trying to decide in the time you have there. \\"Oahu Revealed\\" takes the guesswork out of looking through the myriad of websites and other books trying to piece it all together. It is a one-stop shop of what to do, what to see, where to go, and good directions for everything you need."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We bought this to help us plan a trip to Oahu. It was invaluable! We found places where the crowds didn't go and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a marvelous book for anyone travelling to Oahu, who wants to see the real Hawaii outside of Waikiki. So much detailed information on what to see and do and where. I love reading open and honest reviews of attractions, restaurants and accommodations. Booked my entire 2 week trip around the information in this great guide!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Lots of information that you never would think of..highly recommend this book. No detail left unnoticed..from bus schedules ..maps..tours ..restaurants..even local no trespassing issue's! awesome book"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Was a very well done. Like the details in the book about hidden trails and beaches. The only thing is that I wish the maps were a little bigger."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"OK, I haven't read this one yet, BUT I have used their guides for Maui, Kauai and Hawai'i (The Big Island) These people know their stuff................this is the ONLY book you'll need when visiting Hawai'i-TRUST MEI have been to the Islands numerous times and their books have proven themselves time and time again. Secret locations my local friends never knew about and the straight skinny on when and where to spend your time and money. My husband and I refered to it as \\"The Bible\\" on our last visit to Hawai'i since we read it everyday of our trip (and faught over it ;)It's worth every penny and then some!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Was just okay, used the same title book for Maui and was great. Did not agree with most of the things they suggested"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I understand that the some of the layout of the book is helpful, especially the hotel placement in Waikiki. I live in Honolulu, and a friend of mine who visited us last week brought this book with him. We all found this book to be generally negative about places, and wondered if the authors had visited some of the places more than once before forming opinions. After we got over the negative offense of the book, it basically became more a target of our own bad humor.If you want a true experience of Oahu - I'd say make friends with a local. Otherwise, don't believe everything you read."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have the second edition of this book that I bought in 2006. I am currently about three weeks into a month long Oahu vacation (and have been here four other times since 2006, one of them to get married). I have used this book every time I come to Oahu, and have been able to get more of local's perspective and experience of the island each time because of it.I more so use this book as a guide to finding the non-touristy parts of the island. I agree with other reviewers that the author's opinion of places to stay, and eat do not necessarily align with my own tastes. For that component, I like to use Yelp. His opinion about activities should also be taken with a grain of salt, since everyone has different concepts about what constitutes fun. So, again, using something like Yelp as a companion to this book is a great way to get the most out of the island.Finally, on this trip I decided to blog about my experience while here (Baker With a Cause), and this guidebook has served as an excellent resource for finding not only enjoyable spots to spend a day, but also an opportunity to take some great pictures of some of the beautiful places on Oahu. None of the other guidebooks I checked out at Barnes and Nobles offer the level of detail that this book does. It's definitely a great buy and you will get a lot more out of your vacation if you use it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I was advised by a relative who has been to Hawaii several times to get the Wizard Publications books for our upcoming visit to The Big Island and Oahu. He sent a older version of the Hawaii book and we bought the Oahu version. I had a couple of questions about things on the Big Island and emailed the publisher. They responded very quickly and suggested getting the revised version, so I bought the Kindle (for iPad) edition, especially after reading the Oahu book. These books are fantastic! The writing is entertaining but the honesty in the reviews just makes me feel confident that all the recommendations, including what to see and how to get there, are solid advice we're using to plan our trip. We didn't know much about the islands before we started reading these books and had a bit of trouble getting started as to what we should do, but now we're totally psyched about going and have great ideas for our trip. I hope this review helps you decide to buy these books for the islands you'll go to and enjoy them as much as we have!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We purchased three books as we planned our honeymoon on Oahu. We found all of them to be dry reading and not very helpful. A friend loaned us this book and we loved it! It has great maps, very useful info written in a humorous style, lots of \\"back stories\\" on places, sites, restaurants, tourist attractions, etc. We are returning to Oahu next year, so I ordered our own copy. I highly recommend it!!!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Just returned from Oahu. I thought the book good was very nice. It is 2 years old now and needs to be updated if you want specifics. It's a good over view book at the moment. And nature doesn't change much unless there is a disaster (I made this mistake with Louisiana books). Biggest changes have been to the Polynesian Cultural Center. Make sure to get current information. I liked the Atlantis submarine but my wife didn't. I've dived in Belize and can say it doesn't compare. It didn't help the tour person saying that the sand you are looking at one time was beautiful coral with lots of fish. They go on to tell you that it was worse until they started to quit dumping in the ocean. Maybe we just had a candid guide."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Excellent excellent guide to Oahu. Took it on our honeymoon with us and it gave us great and accurate insight to restaurants, sights, and places of Oahu. We found this awesome hidden beach that made us feel like we were on an adventure! It was really helpful to have price indications and reviews before we went to restaurants too. I highly recommend this book if you are going to Oahu anytime soon!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"So much good stuff is in this book, that even the locals use it. I grew up in Hawaii then left for the mainland. My family moved back there, and they still use this book even after living there for years. Very organized and explains things simply."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Someone told me about this book and I just got it and have already read most of it, I can tell it will be the difference between and good and great vacation. I want to give the author a hug, thank you for your candid information and research into everything that will help us have a wonderful vacation!!!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We used this guide book daily in Oahu. We were able to see the island with much less frustration due to the many hints given. The maps were great. We bought a GPS due to advice which was a godsend. We went to places we would never have thought about due to the book. This book is a very easy and quick read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We were going to spend a few days on Oahu before embarking on a cruise, so I already knew that the book we needed to guide us was \\"Oahu Revealed.\\" We had previously used the Kauai and Maui 'Revealed' books and knew the Oahu book wouldn't disappoint. The authors don't get any kind of kickback or royalties from their suggestions, so one gets a forthright overview of what to do and not do on the island. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have other guide books for Oahu, but this one is the best! I also have Kauai, Maui, and The Big Island Revealed. The person who writes these books (Andrew Doughty) actually goes and lives on each individual island so that he can experience what it is really like and investigates thoroughly. I've tried other guide books for Hawaii and they do not compare. These books have made my vacations on each island extremely pleasurable! I only wish I was him! Aloha!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We recently moved to Oahu and I love this book. I am so happy that we purchased it. Everywhere I go I am saying my book says this or my book says that. I picked this particular one out of all the travel guide books because I enjoy the history background it gives. The other books had more tourist information, but since we are living on Oahu I wanted more history."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I took several travel guides to Oahu but this is the one we kept coming back to. We went to Oahu with another family and they kept borrowing the book because they liked it better than the guidebooks they brought. I agreed with most of the evaluations and the maps included with the book were very useful. I purchased the prior edition used and it was worth every cent. I would use this series of guide books for other areas we plan to visit if available."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is easy to read, very informative, and candid. There's even a little humor sprinkled throughout. I feel like it's prepared me very well to make the most of my time on Oahu. The only drawback, is that the book is a bit heavy and bulky to lug to Hawaii, but it wouldn't be useful if it was any smaller."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The \\"Blue Books\\" by Andrew Doughty on the Hawaiian Islands are by far the best guide books that we've ever used. We've been to the all of the islands several times and each time we use these books to enhance our trip. We've never had a bad meal, bad excursion, or bad hotel thanks to these books. They take you out of the tourist trap areas (like where the cruise ships drop off passengers) on the islands and get you to see and experience the really cool hidden areas. Maybe I shouldn't write such a good review since these areas have gotten a bit more crowded since more people are learning about the books. As always, please keep the islands clean by picking up after yourself."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"In preparation to our first trip and one month visit to Waikiki I have basically purchased all Travel Guides on the market.......If I'd had known about Oahu Revealed initially than I wouldn't have wasted my money on the other guides.......very well written and covers everything you need to know....also the Editor is entertaining and funny and the maps and pictures are first rate"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I read this book cover to cover. It is so informative and entertaining. The author is obviously familiar with Oahu. I have lived here for six months and through this book I have learned of so many places that I had never even heard of. I love that the book is funny...I didn't expect that. If you are coming to Oahu I recommend you buy this book...sit down with a paper and pen and read the book. Write down the names of all the places that interest you and the page you found it on and you are all set!! Aloha!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My husband and I bought this book to help us plan a short trip to Oahu and we're so glad we did. The author's reviews are candid and often funny, making this informative and easy to read at the same time. It helped us plan meals, day trips, and transportation -- it also helped us budget our money well. The only thing we felt this book was missing was a more detailed street map that we could remove from the book and take with us when we went out (so we didn't have to tote around the entire book)...that's the only thing that kept me from giving a 5-star rating.Overall, I highly recommend this book for those who haven't traveled to Oahu and want details on must-dos for tourists (and also want tips on some local gems)."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"WOW! we went to Oahu for the first time 10/14/06 - 10/21/06 - just in time for the earthquake! That aside, this book was with us every step of the way. I read it ahead of time, and had an idea of things I wanted to do and see. It was so full of information, I highly recommend it to anyone spending time on Oahu. Invaluable!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"As you can see from all of other comments this book is outstanding. This is a true guide book that does not have to be read cover to cover, but if you do you should find something interesting on just about every page. This book talks about many hidden gems on the island that only locals know about.Its refreshing to read a book that gives the true picture of a destination and highlights everything...not just the major attractions everyone already knows about. I'm not sure what the one person that gave this book 1-star was talking about? The authors actually live in Hawaii and give first hand accounts everything they write about. My wife and I found it to be dead-on accurate. Everyone has there opinion of what is good and bad. The authors paint a true picture of what to expect. They love Hawaii and paint a great picture of all of the attractions with a few realistic expectations thrown in here and there.I won't travel again without a book from the \\"Revealed\\" series."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We love the REVEALED guide books. They are written by someone 'in the know' and who shares a lot of details so you can decide what is right for you on your trip. They are very descriptive, covering the island much more completely than any other guide books i have seen, and are very open and honest about what they think is worth the look, and what isn't. How refreshing! Not only that, but the writers are quite funny, so the books are fun to read, as well as very informative in various bits of history, culture, and island lore."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is definitely the best book and reference we could have purchased prior to our trip to Oahu. I downloaded the Kindle version and referred to it daily while on the island. The maps came in handy and the recommendations were spot on. Thanks to this book our trip was a memory of a lifetime."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Used the guide primarily on iPad while visiting the islands. It was extremely helpful and made our trip exciting while exploring areas of the island we would have not known about otherwise."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This guy is amazing, his books are so easy to read, he has all the information you need including phone numbers, prices, exact location and directions and all the secrets and tips he can offer. It was a nice read, he really knows his stuff and he's comical at the same time. I now feel prepared and safe to travel to this destination after reading this book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Personally, I liked the style of this guide. It included detailed information on how to find lesser-known or hidden sites, using local landmarks such as signs, telephone poles, mileage markers, etc., rather than just general directions or street signs. The occasional humorous comments made me chuckle, and the guide to pidgin brought back memories of when I lived on Oahu back in the 70's. The maps were very helpful for locating specific sites mentioned in the book. The hotel and resort guide was very helpful and it was nice to read objective comments about them, revealing both the good and the bad.There were several comments on how to lessen the chances of having your car burglarized, which is important when driving a rental car.This is a great guide for visitors who like to go off the beaten path, especially all the detailed hiking information. I will definitely take this guide with me and refer to it often."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"As a proff tourleader from Denmark - best starting book for an area that I have ever read. And very funny"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book really speaks the truth. We went to several of the recommended places in the book and they really matched what the reviews said! Very helpful since we'd never been to Oahu before."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is my third purchase of this guidebook. I buy a new edition each time we travel to the islands. No better tour book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I used the Hawaii Revealed book when I visited there several years ago. It was the perfect travel guide because I like the less touristy areas and this book explains all those little secret areas that only locals know about."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I live by my Kauai Revealed book every time we go there and it has done us very well.My mother and father in law are going to Oahu for the first time soon so I got them a Revealed book for their trip. This is also a great book and has lots of great tips on where to eat, places to go when you need to get away from the crowds in Oahu, quiet beaches and reviews on good excursions. Highly recommend all the Revealed books for all the islands! I have personally used the Kauai and Big Island Revealed books and loved them both!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Useful information for our vacation. The kindle version is good, but the maps provided are impossible to read. I hope this is a better way to zoom in images.."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I found this book to be, by far, one of the best guide books I've ever used. We were only on Oahu for a few days, and the concise, easy organization of this book helped us to zero in on exactly what sights were best to fit in for our short visit. We did two separate driving trips (up Tantalus and around the east side of the island) and this book made doing it a snap. With regard to Tantalus, I had looked up the information before we left the mainland, and I'd looked at the map and decided it was going to be too hard to find. Once on Oahu, we decided to give it a try and I didn't even use the map - only directions straight out of this guide. I found it, no problem.I really don't have anything negative to say about this guidebook. Its advice and reviews were spot on, and it was worth every penny."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Best book I have ever traveled with detailed not boring and full of insider information. I highly recommend using this book when visiting the island!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is great if you want pictures of all the various beaches to visit in Oahu. Very descriptive of how to get to some of the hidden places most people don't know about. I do wish that the restaurants were organized by city or region. They are in alphabetical order- who knows where they are. I want to go to a town and look it up and know where to eat!! All other recommended sites to visit as well as hotels are done by region, so who knows why they did it this way with restaurants."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Plenty of info we both found useful. Recommends and not recommends many different things. Plenty of maps and tidbits of info to help you maximize your time in Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The information in this book is quite good, however, I found it difficult to follow due to the way it is organized. The book is divided into different activities then further divided into regions. So if you are going to a certain area of the island, you have to flip through to read the review of different things (hiking trails, snorkel spots, restaurant). Also, because of the way the regions are organized, you may not realize that you are physically very close to an area that you want to see because it is in a different region and thus in a different section. The best way to work with this book is plan your itinerary ahead of time step by step after studying the book carefully, which should not be the case for a well written travel book. It should allow for some spontaneous exploration without spending your time flipping through the book to different sections. I still give it a three because the content is quite good."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My husband and I spent a week in Oahu. We lived by this book and tried to follow as many suggestions as we could. It is an entertaining read with beautiful pictures and good advice. The pricing is a little outdated as it was probably updated in '07 or '08. The North Shore is definitely \\"Hawaii\\" as one thinks of it on the mainland. Anyone staying in Waikiki should rent a car for at least a day and take this magnificent drive."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My husband and I just spent a week in Oahu and just cannot say enough about how great a tool this book was to us!! We only had six days and five nights and Oahu Revealed kept us on track and going to everything we wanted to see and none of what we didn't care so much about seeing. I recommend going to their website for updates before you go. It was full of honest, valuable information, and was, surprisingly, also a very easy and pleasurable read. I highly recommend picking this one up for your trip to Oahu - It's priceless!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Amazon has impressed me once again! This is the best price I've found on this book so far! The book itself is incredibly detailed, honest, and helpful. It's going to make our trip to Oahu much easier to plan and navigate."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"had Limited time for activities since in Oahu for Soccer Tournament, but was helpful for our limited free time."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a great book - It tells you all the hidden little gems you might not see if you're a first time tourist. It will give you the directions on how to get there, rate it and describe what you'll be seeing. We did a whole driving tour of the east side of oahu from things recommended from the book and saw a side of Oahu that gets lost in the tourist hodgepodge on Waikiki. Check it out, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My wife suggested this book. This book was invaluable for our trip to Hawaii. I rented a car and so I was constantly checking the map to make sure I was making the most out of my driving time. The maps also included points of interest that were easy to find. The book is also written well and is a pleasure to just read."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Information contained in the book is very current and helpful to me as a first-time visitor to Oahu. The detailed maps are especially helpful. Makes you feel like you can navigate the island like a native."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The honest opinions and insider information provided in this book are great, but there are two things that I found rather annoying. First, a lot of time is spent telling people turn-by-turn directions for getting to the various places on the island. It is painful to read all the right and left directions. It's like the way my grandmother used to give directions. Second, noticeably absent are addresses that could be entered into my GPS unit to get me to the destinations worry free. The author goes so far as to complain in the book about how difficult it is to navigate the island. It is even more difficult when there are 10 rights and lefts and no addresses. Good grief! Buy this book for the opinions, but get another guide to give you addresses you can use for your GPS units."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I used this guide for my first trip to Oahu, and it was all I needed. Even though it was a few years old, the authors' recommendations were accurate and valuable. Good regional maps. Book's website was great to check for latest updates. Only complaints - it would be nice if the authors showed or mentioned bus stops and numbers for specific destinations, but I got by okay; also, I asked several locals and they had never heard of Turtle Beach. This was somewhat confusing, but I finally figured out which beach they were refering to in the book. There is no sign indicating the beach by this name, though. The local NOAA turtle volunteer was surprised to see this beach listed in a guide book, but she was pleased with the \\"no touching or feeding the turtles\\" warning the authors provided."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This series are by far the best Hawaiian guidebooks available. (See my review of the Doughty book on Hawaii.) You won't believe the detail in these books. You get hotel reviews, maps, and much more. Nothing was left out. All of this and access to a great website too! If you are going to the islands, get the whole series. You have to see them to believe it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Without telling our Oahu dwelling friend what the recommendations were in this book, he ended up picking hikes and places to eat for us that were listed in this book as things to do. So, I'd regard this book as the real deal - these are the cool things you should do and see while you are on Oahu. We even taught our friend (who has lived there for 15 years) a thing or two based on what was written in the book. The only thing I didn't care for in this book was the writing style - it reminded me of one of those goofy tour guides who tries to inject comedy as much as possible. I'm all for a good laugh, but when I'm reading a guide book, I really just want to know the facts. I'd definitely buy this book for someone who was looking to vacation on Oahu if they don't already have a local contact."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought this book for my upcoming trip to Oahu. Having purchased Maui Revealed a few years ago, I should have realized what a mistake I was making. I looked at the reviews and thought to myself, \\"Well, maybe this version is better.\\"Note on format: I prefer Frommers and Lonely Planet guidebooks. A lot of people who travel to Oahu are there for a limited amount of time. Both LP and Frommers have a section that outlines what you should see and do if you have 2 days, a week or more. This book doesn't offer that guidance. There are definitely more pictures in this book, which is a plus, but there's something disorganized about this book. For example, what is the difference between \\"Sights\\" and \\"Attractions\\"? Why is the \\"Attractions\\" section not listed by geographic zones like in the \\"Sights\\" section? What is the difference between \\"Activities\\" and \\"Adventures\\"? The organization of the book is just very confusing. So, if you hate Frommers and Lonely Planet, then you may not like my review.My biggest complaint about this book is the Dining section. The author notes certain restaurants that \\"stand out\\" with a little \\"ono\\" symbol. In addition to an \\"ono\\" designation, the author highly recommends the Cheesecake Factory. I am not a food snob, and I have nothing against the Cheesecake Factory. I like the Cheesecake Factory, but when I go to Oahu, I don't want to go to the Cheesecake Factory. The entry for the Cheesecake Factory is longer than the entry for Alan Wong's. That just doesn't seem right to me. There is also an \\"ono' recommendation for Dave & Buster's. If you understand my disappointment at these recommendations, then you will understand my suspicion for other recommendations in this book. If you know what a Cheesecake Factory or Dave & Buster's is and you would go to such places when vacationing in Oahu, then you should ignore this review.The Dining section would have been really helpful if it had a section that said, \\"These are the restaurants you definitely need to hit on your trip from high end to low end.\\"After reading through the Dining section, I feel like I need to get a second opinion on everything else recommended in the book. So, it will be useful for the contact information, but I don't trust this author for anything else."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have all 0f Andrew Doughty's books on Hawaii and, although I have been to the islands many times, Andrew always has new places and things to suggest and explore.I enjoy his writing style, informative but not \\"stuffy\\", with a sense of humor. It makes exploring his books as much fun as exploring the islands. My husband and I have found we enjoy his taste in foods and places to eat and generally stay away from those places he does not recommend."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Helpful, fun read, full of details that help to make navigating this beautiful and confusing island less stressful. The turtles really do come right to shore at turtle bay, as pictured. The detailed trail guide was also very useful."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We just returned from Hawaii and used this travel book for our family vacation. The information was excellent and very accurate, and I'd highly recommend the book. I really enjoyed the authors authentic voice and integrity...and found the book a trustworthy resource. We saved a great deal of money by following his advice and recommendations. We used the book to find attractions, drive the North Shore using a rental car, visit hidden beaches and find good places to eat. It was easy to use and well organized by topic, such as attractions, dining and hotels. We brought two travel books to Hawaii and this was the only book we ended up using because it was so informative. Save room in your luggage and bring this book everywhere you go!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Just back from a week on Oahu, I can say that this is one of the best guidebooks I've ever seen. We used it constantly. We found Hidden Beach, great places to snorkel, an island that we could wade out to, and wonderful places to eat. Don't go to Hawaii without one or more of the Revealed books!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I was leary to start reading a \\"Travel\\" book, for the fear that it would be stuffy and very generic. This is not the case with Oahu Revealed. It's an easy ready from two people who have actually lived on the island for an extended period of time. Oahu was their home, and they give you recommendation as locals would do, as well as steer you away from the rip-offs. There are easy to read maps and tons of pictures! This is a must buy if you are on your way to Oahu!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This was an excellent book. I've been to Oahu many times and saw this book during my last visit. It does an expert job of describing little known areas (beaches, snorkeling spots, restaurants) and gives great detail on how to locate them. I found the book to be dead-on in its descriptions. If you're going to visit Oahu, you only need this book!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Very good book, have just come back from Oahu and almost everything I read in this book seemed to be true. Hanauma bay, get there early! (I got there at 9am and it was already closed because the parking lot was full) Tantalus drive, do it, it's superb, Pearl Harbour, get there early, (arrived at 7:55, was on the 9:15 boat, not too bad a wait but!)Basically a great book, plus it's actually readable, I read the entire \\"things to see\\" portion of the book from cover to cover, enjoying the reading as well as the knowledge of the places to visit."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is the BEST travel guide series for Hawaii, and this book \\"Oahu Revealed\\" has the best pictures of this travel series! Why, dozens of high quality COLOR pictures, some double full page layouts! This is worth the price of the book alone.PROS1. Fantastic color pictures! Some of these are as nearly as good as you would see in \`Travel and Leisure' or \`Conde Naste'.2. Good selections of topics and activities covered.3. Honest opinions of that they review. (Not all that I agree with!!!!)4. Wonderful detailed maps!5. Good layout and quick reference pages.6. Great coverage of beachs, with photos!CONS1. The writing, flat colorless prose, lacking the vibrant rainbow of color, scents, and sounds that Hawaii deserves. (A problem with the whole series of books)2. Their \`Best Of' at the end of each area is not very helpful, it's supposed to be funny I think but no one I know finds it to be so. A Best expensive / moderate / cheep seafood or Best beach for swimming / romance / surfing, would be more helpful.3. This is not as detailed or as comprehensive as their other guide books, part of the problem is the amount of things to cover on Oahu, part of the problem possibly is less research and time spent on this book compared with some of the others that they took years to write.4. Some of thier reviews are way off in my oppinion, one restraunt that they liked is terrible (Maui Taco), and some that they did not like are good!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Before our second trip to Oahu I bought this book and what a difference it made. We found so many things that we never knew were there the first time. Very easy to read, has great directions and descritions."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book was available to us where we stayed. We thought it was fabulous. We enjoyed the commentary and history that went along with the places to visit. Because of this book, we were able to see some very out-of-the way places where we were the only tourists. It truly made our Hawaiian vacation more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I just got back from Oahu this week (June '06). This book was the only book my husband and I bought, and it was all we needed. It is very thorough, easy to read, has great commentaries, photos, maps, etc. We liked that it was written by people who actually live on the island - they really know what they are talking about. Once you are in Honolulu, you can pick up TONS of additional free tourist guides with ads, maps, coupons, etc on every street corner, and those are helpful as well - but they are of course biased towards the advertisers. We liked this book because it was very accurate, comprehensive, and fun read. Buy it, and don't bother buying anything else."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"One of the best guide books about Oahu. Provides descriptions of places to visit that are off the beaten path as well as giving great descriptions on more popular attractions. The authors did a wonderful job in providing pictures that highlight areas that they are describing. I highly recommend this book for anyone traveling to Hawaii for the first time."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"In preparation to our first trip and one month visit to Waikiki I have basically purchased all Travel Guides on the market.......If I'd had known about Oahu Revealed initially than I wouldn't have wasted my money on the other guides.......very well written and covers everything you need to know....also the Editor is entertaining and funny and the maps and pictures are first rate"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I found this book to be way more helpful than the travel agent we visited. We visited with the agent after I had just skimmed this book, and even then I was telling her a ton of stuff she didn't know. In fact, she didn't share one thing with us that I hadn't already learned from the book. (Maybe she wasn't the greatest travel agent, but I think you get my point.)If you are handy with a computer, you can use this book to find what you need about where to go and where to stay -- allowing you to bypass a travel agent altogether and book your own trip online. In the process, you will learn a lot of interesting things about the island that will help you enjoy your trip so much more."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The book arrived promptly and is a treasure. This is a coffee table type of publication, as it is printed on very high quality paper and the pictures and text are excellent. As a past visitor to Honolulu, this publication will definitely be in my luggage on my next visit."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I was thoroughly impressed with this as a guidebook. I took it everywhere and used it to find the very best beaches, the very best shrimp truck on the side of the road going to North Shore, and some very secluded, breathtaking spots that we never would have found otherwise (my favorite's were the Spitting Cave of Portlock --- gorgeous and a complete surprize after walking through a yucky trail between fences in a very nice Oahu neighborhood and the scenic drive in Honolulu that offered a view so incredible and over 360 so we had to take a video to capture the whole thing). All in all, we were more than saisfied with the places the book enabled us to find. One thing that was outdated is the recommendation to visit Hale Koa for lunch -- it's for military folks and their friends and families only ad it was embarressing to try to get in and be sent away. I have a feeling the military hotel changed their open-door policy at the restaurant after the book was published. So...definitely buy this book if you're going to Oahu! My new husband and I (it was our honeymoon) plan to get Maui Revealed and visit Maui next! You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I spent 1 1/2 weeks on Oahu working with a client. I had a weekend and evenings to tour. Used this book extensively for maps, directions, weather information, restaurant reviews and places to go -- and avoid. In every instance my expectations were exceeded. The authors even include history of the spots (where appropriate). I would bring \\"the book\\" to the client each day, and they pointed out places I must see. Even they were impressed with the accuracy! Oahu Revealed is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants an enhanced view of what to expect when visiting!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Great information about the island- maps, guides, etc.I am impressed."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I also own &#34;Hawaii Revealed&#34; and found that to be extremely useful so when I visited Oahu I wanted the same excellent source and I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Probably would have been better off without a guidebook at all. A hike described as light to moderate was difficult for even the seasoned climbers in our group. Would not suggest this guide or purchase from this line again."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Even if you have been to Hawaii several times these books are worth having. The maps are great and the recommendations are always right on. Mine are all marked up from the notes I write in them about the things we want to see. We like to hike and the hiking section is great. It gives you things to see NOT on the beaten path and stuff to do you may never have heard about otherwise. The other thing I like is the history they give about the islands. Money well spent!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"All &#34;Revealed&#34; books have a lot of useful information about each island. Each needs to be used while planning your vacation and taking notes specific to what you are going to do."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I love this guidebook!!!. Great info on everything you need to know to plan a trip to Oahu. I love the fact the author visits everything personally and does not let the place being evaluated known who he is. So he is treated just like me: a tourist.The book has well organized chapters by region as well as separate sections for activities like hiking, boating, restaurants, and hotels. And areas you don't want to miss are so marked.The most useful item for the actual trip is the smart phone app by the same name as the book. The book is great for planning, but the app is excellent for touring. It has an integrated mapping feature built into the app. Suppose you are hungry. You can ask for a list of recommended restaurants close by. Then you can pull up the menu right on your phone or call to see how busy they are. Really cool.So the book is best for planning, but the app is what you want to take on the trip."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is all you really need to plan your island vacation. Easy layout and fun for the kids to look through too."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"When our family was researching our Hawaiian vacation, I was often recommended to purchase these book series for Hawaii Revealed. I must say that the books are very informative.The writers take a lot of time fine combing all of the major attractions, giving you great \\"hints\\" on how to save time and money, and even rate them.You will find a lot of Hawaii's hidden \\"secrets\\", that either the most accustomed Hawaiian traveler will know, or only the locals will know. This book truly gives you a plethora of informative information, and will absolutely make your Hawaiian vacation much more productive. You get everthing in this book, including secret beaches, to the best places to see the turtles, to the perfect time to hit the North Shore, and from whom to take your Surfing Lessons from!I do NOT recommend going to Hawaii without purchasing this book first!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"It was a very thorough guidebook, it wasn't trying to sell you anything. I liked the hiking and hidden beaches part of the book. They also recently put out an app to go along with the guidebook that has gps for hiking trails etc. I am only 60% of the way through the book but so far, so good! It gave me a lot of ideas of what I do and don't want to do while I am on my trip in Hawaii!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The book showed up on time and in great condition just as stated on the add. It has a lot of good information on what to do and where not to go in oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"very informational.

So, we tried Oahu Revealed and we're not disappointed. The authors are dedicated to authenticity and detail, with real-world experience. This is our go-to book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I would never go to HA without my copy of Revealed! Their reviews are spot on and can save you time and money! Thanks for suffering through touring the islands and eating at all of the restaurants just for me!

It is an invaluable guide, and as so many others have said, it seems to mirror exactly what I felt about my trip there. I found everything point-on, including the hotel reviews.I bought it about three months prior to our trip, and spent a lot of time poring over the book and looking at our vacation options. We chose to forgo some of the things we'd initially planned, and checked out some other things off the beaten path instead. It was even small enough that I kept it with me constantly throughout our entire trip, enabling us to find restaurants, etc. at the spur of the moment. I often shared the book with some of our fellow travelers on our trip who were discussing various options, and have recommended it to everyone I know who is even thinking of going to the islands.We are returning to Hawai'i in 2011, and I will be purchasing the updated version for O'ahu and at least one of the other islands, as plans are to make it a multi-island trip. Thank you, Andrew, for the best Hawai'i travel guides out there!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I could not believe how easy this book made our trip to Oahu. Every thing we wanted to do it had tons of information! We never went anywhere without it! Even the questions of where do you want to eat- they have completely right, honest opinions of everything even down to the shave ice and shrimp shacks! Tons of info and ideas on activities and luau's...simply amazing! We bought and brought 3 other books, and I dont even think we bothered to open the others, this is the only one you'll need! I'm excited to visit the other islands now since they have a book for each Hawaiian island! :)"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I might look at other guidebooks as well, but if I were limited to just one, this would be it. It covers pretty much everything, covers things in detail, and gives honest opinion. If an attraction, restaurant, or hotel sucks, they tell you. The text, maps, and pictures nimbly steer you toward what's worthwhile and away from what's not. They can't cover everything on Oahu, but we'll definitely be carrying this book with us on our upcoming trip."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We purchased Hawaii Revealed last year & it went with us everywhere. When we were planning our next trip to Oahu, we ordered Oahu Revealed before we left so we could read up and decide what we wanted to do before we arrived. The information provided is accurate, and the opinions are right on."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is awesome!!! We brought it on our honeymoon to Oahu and found ourselves never leaving our room without it. At first my husband wanted to explore on our own and not have to worry about what other people had to say about different areas but after 2 days - he made absolutely sure we had the book with us wherever we went! This book not only gives excellent recommendations for dining, hotels, activities, etc., it told us about incredible \\"hidden treasures\\" we never would have even known about, as they are off the beaten path. Just to name some examples - a little macadamia nut farm near the north shore and the Maunawilli Trail hike and this beautiful rock formation that had the center blown out of it during a storm years ago. Friends of our who didn't have the book couldn't find it because its hidden in a neighborhood. We found it NO PROBLEM! Incredible! I've bought this book for many other couples going to Oahu and they have thanked us Sooo much for it! Buy it! It's worth 10 stars!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We have the other Andrew Doughty Hawaii travel books and this one did not dissapoint us."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"For an upcoming trip to Oahu, I recently purchased three guide books. My favorite is Oahu Revealed for the following reasons:Written it a personable, entertaining style - more like advice from a friend.Steers you away from sights and activities not worth the time or money.Contains lots of fold-out maps and color photos."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We spent a week on the North Shore, and wanted to really get around the whole island. First, the maps were very neccessary, accurate, and helpful. We'd drive around the coast and the book provided information on almost every stop along the way. The book mentions things that you'd have no clue of, especially cultural information (the birthing rocks, the way a chief used to be buried in sea cliffs, etc). Some of the off the beaten track \\"gems\\" they mention, like Hidden Beach on the far north west shore, were not all they cracked up to be, but they were adventures. Anyway, a very useful book!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Our family just returned from a wonderful trip to Hawaii, and can't say enough good things about this guide. We bought three others as well, and abandoned them not far into the planning process. We covered a lot of territory, and saw things we never would have known about otherwise. We did not encounter any problems (or many,if any, other people) accessing these \\"hidden\\" treasures. The directions and maps were exactly right, and we found that we nearly always agreed with the assessment of the sites and the restaurants. (We found beautiful homes at great values via the internet and didn't rely on the book for lodging.) Our advice is to buy this guide, and forget the others."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book made our trip to Oahu fantastic. This book really let us utilize our time efficiently and make the most out of our trip. I like how you could follow along in the book as you drive along the coast and identify things to stop and see as you go."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have used the Oahu as well as the Kauai books by this author and highly recommend them to anyone traveling in the Hawaiian Islands. He has searched out the information not readily available to tourists and has made it easy for us to use. Very entertaining reading and VERY informative."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I used this book along with \\"Honolulu, Waikiki and O'ahu\\" (Lonely Planet) on a wonderful trip to Oahu. I particularly liked the full color maps and photos of the beautiful island. The advice was down-to-earth and honest. There were helpful pointers about when to go to Chinatown, where to go and what to skip. The restaurant descriptions were great along with the synopsis of each hotel. They rated our hotel a bit harsh (ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Hotel) but we forgive them!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I never do reviews, but this book was so helpful that I thought I would pass on the word. If you are looking to lay on the beach in Waikiki and not leave the city then don't bother, but if you want to see the entire island and really enjoy yourself then this is a must have. I had the book open 3-4 times per day, descriptions and instructions were spot on! This book made our trip 100% more enjoyable than it would have been."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have the book on Maui and have used it thoroughly. I didn't think I needed the Oahu book since I was stationed at Pearl Harbor for two years. I thought I knew the island pretty well. Well, not as well as I thought! This book pointed out new places, and certainly updated me with all the places I was familiar with and of course provided the absolutely new things. No one should leave home without it!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"After having been recommended this book, I purchased it prior to my trip and am glad I did. It is very comprehensive, yet easy to read as the authors flow the topics smoothly. I have planned what I want to do and know where to go to do it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get out and off the beaten path. It holds a wealth of information most people would overlook or not know where to find."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Excellent, well-researched guide to Oahu that covers more than just the basic, usual tourist stuff. This is the only guidebook you'll need!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The pictures are pretty but that's about it. I was looking for a really great drive guide but found this to be sort of a regular guide. There were so many stops with tourists all over. I guess I expected too much."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I traveled to the Big Island, thinking I would take an excursion to Ohau, which I didn't. I also purchased the book for the Big Island, and it served me pretty well, albeit it lacked some of my requirements, such as reviews of some restaurants, and locations of some coffee farms. I just suspect the same would hold for this book, I just don't know.The way I look at it, any additional info you may have for a location in which you find yourself should be considered good, I suppose. If I had it to do over, I don't think the cost of this book is worth it, what with the AAA Travel books being free of cost, and provide quite a bit information on the islands.These books tend to provide a lot of the history of the Islands, as opposed to a really good travel guide, but that may be what some travelers wish. I found it sufficient to learn the history of the islands on the internet and the library. Some may not wish to spend the necessary time to do this."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"A waste of money. Outdated material. Nothing here I hadn't seen before. You should give me money credit on my next purchase."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We have in past purchased and used a book on kuaui from the same author. Based on that, we have 0 doubts in going ahead and purchasing this book before our trip to Oahu. The book (and other books too by the same author) are detailed, and give you the right information. There are a lot of insider tips that help you get the maximum out of your trip. The book is written in nice, occassionaly humurous, easy to follow language and specially calls out the important information. Has pictures, instructions, and information on how to reach those amazing but not-so-popular destinations.The best part is that the author does not try to pose his opinion on you, but provides you with unbiased facts and tips that you can actually use. We would not recommend you heading out on your vacation without a copy of it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book saved us over$50.00 in free parking alone. Very informative. It brought us to sites that other tourists missed. This book really made our trip to Maui!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This item was bought as a gift for my daughter & her family, as they will be going to Hawaii for the first time in October '12. She was very excited to receive it, and plans on using it extensively in planning their visit & using it as a guide."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have used a number of guides for Hawaii. This is the most poorly organized one of all. The author fails to group by location so when traveling to areas one must search through a number of sections to find sights, food, lodging and other essentials. The author is also completely wrong on the translantions and current usage of the Hawaiian language. Living on the island of Molokai with the largest native hawaiian population, one has an opportunity to hear how the words are currently used. They are certainly not as described by Doughty. Lonely planet is a much better guide."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"E.g., bus schedules. I also found the organization of the maps a bit difficult to navigate. Otherwise it exceeded my expectations in every way."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is a comprehensive look at Ohahu from history to all you need to know about traveling there. A great book, is easy to take with you also."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"One of the best travel books I have used. Insightful, detailed and honest. Recommended."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is the best book ever! The recommendations and reviews are right on. We found this book to be an invaluable book during our trip. I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is the best guidebook I have found. Landmarks are identified in their relation to mile markers on the road and the maps are easy to follow. The casual writing style is easy to follow and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We liked the off the beaten path ideas that this book had. This series is great."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The best guide book available! Every time we pulled up sonewhere most everyone had one! The book paid for itself with the money saving helps it gave!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is so GREAT and gives so much information. I can't wait to get to Oahu! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Since I picked the cheapest price, I was unsure what my book would look like. I was really pleased when I got it, it looks like it has hardly been used. No one had marked or written in it. I have used Amazon.com in the past and will continue to do so in the future."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This guide really was the best one I found. I got a few from a friend and some from the library, but I had to buy this one. Absolutely worth it! I got out my highlighter to mark all the great places listed in this book. It really was a great help to find neat restaurants, out of the place ways, and attractions. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is awesome. It's formatted well so it's easy to find information on the fly regarding attractions, beaches, hotels, etc. It's written in a down to earth, almost humerous style so you feel like you're really getting the lowdown from a local guide. It goes into so much detail in some areas as to give turn-by-turn driving directions to get to Waikiki or where to park at Pearl Harbor when it's crowded. This is by far the best travel guide I've ever purchased and I used it every day of our trip. I highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We haven't gone on our trip yet but so far has been a huge help in choosing where to stay, golf courses, siteseeing and dining. Will have to write another review when we return to see if what was in the book proved to be correct."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"A great guide book. Tells it like it is. I just used this book on my visit to Hawaii last week."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I'm taking this with me on the plane for sure; it gives comprehensive, well-rounded, balanced information. It makes the idea of vacationing in Oahu so appealing, but reminds you of the things you should be wary of (overpaying for food/lodging, things that live in the ocean and will bite you, other tourists).I would recommend it to anyone who wants a realistic interpretation of what it means to be going to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I purchased a copy of this book as a gift for a friend after using it myself last summer. I found the information to be right on and completely dependable. It made navigating the island easy, and it helped us find some out of the way places we may otherwise have missed. Great resource!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Just got back from our trip to Oahu and Kauai. Bought many books before our trip, but only brought these. We found the Oahu book to be better than the Kauai book. Everything that we did on Oahu was recommended, and we were not disappointed.We were disappointed by a couple of the recommendations for Kauai.Food reviews you have to take with a grain of salt. I assume the same for hotel/resort reviews (we stayed in a condo).All the info and sites to see were \\"spot on\\" and GREAT. Biggest reccomendation is to get a car and get out of Waikiki and explore. Oahu is SO much better than just Waikiki.Looking forward to our next trip to the islands and will only buy the Big Island and Maui books from these guys next time!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK!!!! We used it when we went to Ohau.....We found places with the book that we would never have found other wise."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We will be moving to Oahu this fall and this book came highly recommended by several people. It gives a great \\"insiders'\\" view of the island. The set up was nice, and it gives me all kinds of ideas of things to do while living there. I can't wait to move!!!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"\\"Oahu Revealed\\", like companion volumes about nearby islands is a great travel planning resource.It is fun to read and the advice was consistently spot-on and practical. The author (Andrew Doughty) does a great job of describing communities, dining, entertainment, and scenic opportunities that turned out to be the real highlights and vivid memories of a visit to our 50th state ... things that would have been easily overlooked without the author's outstanding local insights!The book is a practical guide, filled with great suggestions, and extremely useful for making the most of a visit to what is a once in a lifetime destination for many of us.When I need to break out of the February greys here in the midwest, the \\"... Revealed\\" books are the first to come off the shelf."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Excellent resource made my vacation more organized and less time thinking of what to do..."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a great guide - we've been before but wanted to be sure and see some new things - the restaurant reviews were accurate - and helpful - having phone number right at top helped when we wanted to make reservations or check on hours, etc. Great guide - all you need."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We just got back from Oahu. Before we left this book helped us choose a terrific hotel. While we were there it was our bible. Our other guidebook was less useful. The only thing missed was the terrific farmers markets where we bought locally grown produce. Overall, I thank the authors very much."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Beautifully done! Honest, detailed descriptions of where, what, when and how to do things. Excellent maps and directions. Love the history!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have purchased the entire line of island Guidebooks in this series, many of which I have given as gifts. If you want to see the island without spending a reckless fortune, this book will pay for itself with just one well selected restaurant meal. We also enjoy the frank reviews of many attractions, and the hikes are well described and fun to navigate. The hotel section could use some addtional options, but overall, well worth the price."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The book is the best, from the descriptions of the places to visit, the activities to do - Shark Encounters - brilliant - the restaurants and the hotels.If you go to Oahu - its a must buy"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"If you are heading to the Oahu, don't leave behind this book!! Explores the whole island, not just Waikiki.Well written, great maps and pictures. A must have!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"These \\"Revealed\\" books are the holy grails of travel guides. I went to Oahu with this book and everywhere I went, it went. It's an easy read with specific directions. It's great and I whole heartly give my 2 thumbs up for this book. Great pictures and maps. I was able to navigate easily and stay interested with the bits of history compared to Oahu today. I love this book and plan to get the others to travel to the other islands with them."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My husband and I used this guide on a recent trip to Hawaii. I'd never been to Hawaii before, and my husband had lived there years ago. Both of us got something out of this book. It's well written, funny, and pulls no punches. It helped us discover parts of the island we might otherwise have missed--and avoid wasting our time on tourist traps. Thanks in part to Oahu Revealed, we had the perfect vacation!On a side note, my husband bought Maui Revealed for his brother, who was taking a trip to that island. My brother-in-law doesn't like guidebooks; he prefers to discover places on his own. But he loved Andrew Doughty's guide, bringing it home with a cracked spine and dog-eared pages. The whole series is fun, whether you're planning a trip or just dreaming of one from your couch!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Highly highly recomend for anyone going to Oahu. Read it cover-to-cover before we left and took it with us to reference. Very helpful. I wish this author would review everywhere I travel."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I actually love the fact the books not brand new because all the neat notes. I plan on adding more really soon to pass on to the next person! Thanks for the fast shipping!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Really excellent guide book. Very thorough with lots of secret tips. Activities are separated from adventures, which I found a useful distinction. Good recommendations on vendors -- we used their recommendations and agreed!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book made our trip! We planned each day trip by using the information provided. We then took the book with us in the car. The maps got us everywhere we needed to go. Each part of the island has its own section in the book, so it makes it really easy to find the best places to see,eat and explore. My husband thought I had done amazing research before going but I had to admit to him that I was only reading what was in the book as we were going along. If you use this book you will be an Oahu expert!! It will make your trip so much more enjoyable. You need this book if your planning a trip to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"You cannot see the photos or maps needed on the kindle version of the book.The tips are much better on other islands."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting. It was very helpful to use when planning our vacation in Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Tour the island of Oahu just like a native with this book as your guide. Packed with interesting and useful information."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book helped us make the best use of our time and gave fantastic recommendations for dining and attractions. It also gave good tips to help you save money since Hawaii can be expensive. This book is worth the money!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We have all of the books in this line and these are worth the money. I love the style of writing and the restaurant recommendations."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I read this book from cover to cover before our trip to Oahu.I stayed in Ko Olina and this area was not complete before this edition so it was not much help there.Otherwise the directions are great for the popular attractions. We tried to hit some of the off the beaten path excursions like swimming to small islands off the coast but that just looked like crazy talk.Since Honolulu is a metropolis the restaurants are not all still there. There were quite a few that closed down.The voice this is written in is casual and you do learn some Hawaiian words as you read. The maps are great and I would definitely recommend getting the most up to date paper map when you go to any island. Smartphone navigation is not always reliable.Overall, I really think I got more out of the free travel guides that are available in any hotel lobby, AAA office, or supermarket. Those books offer coupons as well as give you an idea of what you can do. If I had it to do over again, I would have just used the free guides and coupons."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"It's like having a buddy by your side who is completely familiar with the territory. Whenever I travel to places other than Hawaii I am wishing I could find the equivalent."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We just returned from Oahu & this was the best book. We took the book with us every where. The book is very informative and helpful. I would recommend to anyone travelling to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We just returned from our first trip to Oahu, and I have to say that because of this book I felt like I'd already been there as soon as our plane touched down. The island seemed so familiar because of the thoroughness and detailed research the authors put into the book. We also loved the candid and humorous writing of the authors. The up-to-date and easily accessible information on the Revealed website scored points with us too.My husband and I had made a tentative itinerary for things to do on our trip. With the help of this book, we were able to do and see even more than we had originally planned. The maps of the island helped us to easily navigate the 400 miles we logged exploring in our convertible Mustang. We especially enjoyed the charming North Shore area, and the breath-taking scenery along the south-east coast of the island. All of the beaches we visited on the island were beautiful and clean. The restaurant reviews really helped us to narrow down our dining options.We also purchased the book Driving and Discovering Oahu. We found it to be out of date and not nearly the gem of a resourse that this book was. We look forward to many return trips to the Hawaiian Islands and will definitely use the other books in the Revealed series in the vacation planning process."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I live here, and this is by far the best book available. I found new stuff to see and do!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book provides insight about the island's great features, along with it's worse, and recommendations on restaurants, hotels, and beaches. This book just doesn't provide maps and addresses of famous tour sites, but they either recommend for you, or tell you not to waste your time there. The one thing I would say this book should have more of, are pics of the places they recommend. But other than that, if you are planning a trip to Hawaii, get this book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I found this book refreshing, and with pictures, it's a great buy! Who can stomach travel guidebooks without pictures? The point is to get you interested and excited about where you're going! Good guidebooks will steer you away from bad meals, tourist traps and overpriced souvenirs, and toward the real benefits of a vacation; getting the most for your dollar and enjoying everything the wonderful destination has to offer. This will make my upcoming visit so much more exciting!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I enjoyed Kauai Revealed but not this book. I was hoping to know about all the hidden spots. However, I learned about an Aiea hike and secret waterfall through the internet which was not in this book at all. As were some other waterfalls. That was disappointing. I felt like I wasted my money and was able to find everything online.Also, the restaurant reviews are bad. They rate Cheesecake Factory very high. Really?!?!?!?! These authors must never been to one before going to Waikiki. That place has the longest waits and huge portions that anyone with a hotel without a microwave and fridge is going to take advantage of leftovers. This is the last place I would eat when on vacation in Oahu. Actually who would eat at any of the chain restaurants!?There is a little diner on Kuhio I like. Believe it's called Seaside Grill. Anyhow it has cheap breakfast specials before about 11AM and it's good! These restaurant wasn't even in the book at all. If you ask me, these authors suck at restaurant reviews and should just leave it out the book altogether. They should really just stick to the adventures, activities, hikes, and those types of things."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"If the resteraunts and activities had area codes with the phone numbers. We just left Kauai and Oahu and had these books for both islands. They are funny to read, up to date, and honest. The only reason I am not giving it a five star is when calling businesses, we had to look up the area code everytime on our cell phone. The phone number alone will not work from mainland cell phones. Other than that, I highly recommend this series."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought the Ultimate Kauai book several years ago and the next edition last year. Both times were for an upcoming trip to Kauai. The books were fantastic for getting the most out of your vacation with the least hassle.Based on the positive experience with that Island I bought the three other books and have decided to go to Maui for my next trip but to spend two or three days in Oahu first to see the important sights there. The idea of vacationing in such a touristy place doesn't appeal to me and this book spelled it out pretty well. It saved me from potentially spending thousands on a hectic vacation!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is such a pleasure to read. I read it cover-to-cover before I went to Oahu (only skipping some of the hotel and food reviews) and it was so fun to read and learn fun facts and history! My copy is full of notes in the margins, highlights and sticky notes. Great for planning- I had an awesome time there."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought this book based on other reviews I read. The book is very informative and gives direct opinions on tours, dining, and hotels. We were able to find alot of discounted places to eat thanks to the book for good food. Also, the hiking section was very good as we did the lighthouse hike and saw a ton of humpback whales breaching in the water. If it wasn't for the book, we would have never known about this hidden treasure. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to discover and explore Oahu"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Although I only read up on the Waikiki(where I stayed) I found the information spot-on accurate and very helpful in navigating my way around the area. I especially appreciated the detailed restaurant section with the insider info (like telling the reader you're allowed to BYOB to restaurants)."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have purchased all the other Revealed books for the other islands of hawaii, and find them all the best and most informative.You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"These books (Maui, Kauai, Oahu, The Big Island Reveled) are by far the best guide books to the Islands. We are military and moved here a couple years ago and these have been amazing. Not only did they help us around town but made visiting the neighbor islands a real treat. The books give you information not found in the other guidebooks out there. Because they are for each island they give better detail. If you ask any local what guidebook to the real Hawaii is the best they will most likely tell you the blue one (FYI, all of the Reveled guide books are blue)."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is one of the best travel guides I've ever used. I have been to Oahu before, in fact I was stationed at Pearl Harbor for three years during my time in the Navy. Recently, a friend and I decided to take a week off from work and enjoy all that the island has to offer. I purchased this book and began to read it cover to cover to reacquaint myself with Oahu. Well, I found so much in the book that I had never known about that I made a list of \\"things to do\\" that I couldn't possibly complete in one week. Oh well, there's plenty left for next time. What I really enjoyed about this book is the sense of humor Mr. Doughty shares as he describes the island. It's obvious that he loves the place, but he can also turn a jaundiced eye on certain local behaviors and advise a tourist of where they may feel comfortable and where they may not. Also, it is refreshing that he is so candid about what is good and not so good about restaurants, beaches, hotels, etc. I like the fact that he never let a restaurant owner know he was reviewing it in order to get a free meal. He wanted to be treated like any other customer in order to make an honest appraisal. He has visited every beach on the island and described the swimming, surfing and snorkeling in detail. He points out the best drives, viewpoints, museums and tours. You only need this one book, it is as complete as I could imagine."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book was very helpful in our travels on Oahu. It showed us many sites we would have missed had we not had the book. It is clear, detailed, descriptive and always gave the right directions. We had rented a car and were able to see as many of the sites as we wanted. A must have when traveling in Hawaii!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This series \\"Revealed\\" is nothing short of excellent, up to date and accurate for visitors to any of the Hawaiian Islands. Tons of useful tips. Try and read up on the area you are visiting in advance, but if you are in it for the adventure as it comes, it is also very useful while on the go."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Hands down, the \\"Revealed\\" books are the absolute best travel guides for the Hawaiian islands. We lived there for 4 years, and turned to this book almost month we lived there - all the way to the very end it was helping us find new places to explore. We always used these when we traveled to the other islands. There were things in this book that some of our local friends who had lived on the islands their whole lives didn't even know about!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This travel guide is well structured, well written, and very complete. This is the best travel guide for O'ahu that I found. The maps are excellent."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is better than Fodor's for Hawaii, and Fodor's is my usual favorite. Oahu Revealed helps you select a route and do specific things on that route. We got to do many things that would not have even occurred to us, like Chinatown or the Polynesian Cultural Center. We also benefitted from street-smart advice, like arriving early in the day to do snorkeling at Hunama Bay (the parking lot fills up). If you are taking a plane over to Hawaii, make this your mandatory plane reading. You will be delighted at how many extra things you can squeeze into your trip. Even the restaurant guide is great, segmented by location so you can find the best based on where you are at the moment. All the reviews are accurate and helpful."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My husband and I just got back from Oahu and before we left we bought this book. This book is a great tool and guide to Oahu. It tells you which locations are \\"real gems\\" and what is \\"not to be missed!\\" It also gives recommendations to locations that aren't as popular but definitely worth seeing. It is easy to use and also includes maps. It offers suggestions on what places to visit as well as dining and shopping. We used it every single day and we would have been lost without it! Definitely recommend this book to anyone visiting Oahu!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We went to Oahu a year ago, and never went anywhere without this book. We will be forever grateful to the authors for helping us have the vacation of a lifetime! With this book we were able to avoid most of the tourist traps and find places we otherwise never would have seen. I just sent a copy to my brother who is going to Hawaii next month."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Outstanding detail. Honest reviews. An excellant guide for planning your vacation."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"So far this book seems fabulous! I haven't been on my trip yet but the details they provide are amazing so I'm not anxious at all!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book made planning my Oahu vacation simple. The authors are very thorough and honest. I read the book and planned my whole trip itineary on the 8 hour plane ride using only this book...and the trip was amazing. Would recommend for all Oahu travelers. P.S. Gives excellent driving directions, especially to/from airport."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"It is a good book. We used only this guide book for our trip on Oahu island.Nevertheless, we found the maps tedious to work with. For instance, it was very difficult to find the points of interest cited in the text. And this is especially true when Hawaiian places are 20 letters long words written in font size 9 and hidden in the jungle."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"If you're going to Oahu, you must get this guide book. It tells you everything you want to know about everything and more. The author keeps you laughing all the way through the book. It's truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book was a big help on our trip. We had a lot easier time finding things and figuring out what we wanted to do in our too short time on the island. I would definitely recommend this book and other \\"Revealed\\" books to other travelers."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Admittedly, the cover is a little boring. But don't let that put you off. This is not a distant \\"satellite view\\" of Oahu. This is Oahu close up and alive. Of the Oahu guidebooks I have looked at, this is easily my first choice. Even if you're just going to stay in Waikiki, Oahu Revealed has great advice on hotels, restaurants, and things to see and do.But where the book becomes particularly valuable is in its descriptions of the rest of Oahu. For anyone wanting to know how to find great snorkeling, hidden beaches, fun surf, hiking trails, or anything else Oahu offers from kayaking to skydiving, this book can get you there. The descriptions are so compelling and intriguing that I've read the book through twice--and I'm still planning my trip. The cover may not catch your eye, but the interior is full of beautiful photography and thoroughly useful information."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a great insider's book to visiting Hawaii. I will be moving to Hawaii soon, and it wasn't quite as helpful as I'd hoped for facts about living there, but it isn't designed for that. It is definitely a must have for anyone planning to visit the island of Oahu. Although, I know these authors have also written books about the other islands too."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I researched a lot of books before my family went to Oahu, by checking them out at the library first. This is the one book that I purchased for our trip. We used it exclusively as a guide to restaurants, attractions, and just plain getting around in Oahu, which can be a challenge with the signage on their roads. I highly recommend this book as a traveling companion."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have all of the blue books now....They are worth their weight in gold.....an insider's view of the islands! We agree with all of the recommendations, too!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I purchased this as a gift for a friend going to Ohau because I have used all of their other guide books and found them very useful. I looked through it before giving it to them and found it full of all the information they will need. I hope it comes home battered from the trip."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Just wrapping up our 8 day trip to Oahu. We had the BEST time thanks to this book. You can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"If you wanna visit Hawaii and see what is hidden from the mainstream - this book is the ultimative guide for. Doesn't matter which tip you take on, it's always the best tip you can get! I love it! Thanks to this great couple that discovered all the hidden beauty!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book (and series) is among the best travel guides I have ever purchased.

You will see people all over the islands with this book in tow!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Don't leave for a trip to Hawaii without the corresponding book for the island you'll visit.

It was my goal to come up with as much of a different itinerary as I could from our first trip (not that our first trip wasn't good). This book helped make our second trip a great success! We took a few hikes and had a great time. This book has a good flow and is printed in color. Well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We had previously gotten the Kuai Revealed and loved it. When I went to Oahu I had to get the book for it too and was not disappointed. This is the most accurate and honest of all the 'travel guides' I have read for any location. The author will tell you 'when the baby is ugly'. It's like a Consumer Reports of travel."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Great book and it was a really valuable help in planning our upcoming Hawaiian Vacation."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is absolutely packed with information specific to Oahu. USEFUL information, honest opinions on activities, restaurants, companies, just about anything you could think of doing or seeing. It's been instrumental in helping us to plan out our vacation.... I definitely recommend this book for anyone visiting anywhere on Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought several books before going to Hiawaii but I found this one was the most up to date, honest, and easy to follow. A must for reading before going on your trip."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is well organized and filled with lots of good tips. It points out many interesting places that the average person would never know about or find. Well worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I appreciate the upfront and concise terms and descriptions Doughty uses in his complete Oahu Revealed, even has web password to use for more hotel info. Was pleasantly surprised by his humor and candor, a pleasure. Will take it to Oahu this summer for my first visit to test it first hand. Will definitely look for this author next year when I go to Maui."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I used this guide to visit Oahu it is the only guide you need to see everything just like a local. I highly recommend it and give it 5 Stars. Writing this review from the pride of America as we tour Hawaii."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Planning a trip to Oahu, never been there before and needed some info on dinning and things not to be missed. Covers all of the island, not just the Honolulu area.Great info and listed in order of ranking from best to least.Has helped me plan the trip, and will take it with me for infomation after I get there."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I picked up four different travel books from Amazon to help plan my family's trip to Hawaii. I found this book to be the best resource for helping make decisions between two like items. In fact I found it so helpful I picked up additional copies for other families who are going with us. We all highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Wouldn't use any other guide! Not only very helpful but makes it fun to read. I wish there was someone like this to write all other type of guide books out there."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I read this book before going to Oahu. I think it helped a lot. All the locations I visited were just as he described. He said I would see turtles at turtle beach and sure enough there were 2 turtles. They were friendly and swam right up to me. Very useful and great for first time Hawaii travelers."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The Hawaii Revealed series was recommended by a friend from Honolulu as the best Hawaii guidebook series available. I've purchased three, each is comprehensive and thoroughly researched. Along with reviews of lodgings and restaurants and the most popular sightseeing spots you'll find information on off-the-beaten-path sights and activities. I can't wait to go to that special beach that's down the dirt road that's 15 phone poles farther east than mile marker blank!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought this book before my trip to Oahu last year, and it is invaluable for anyone planning a trip. I used to live in Oahu, but this book told me things I had no idea about. The organization is superb -- by area, by activity. There are reviews and commentary about a lot of activities, some with pros and cons so you understand what the reviewer was looking at and why it was important to him, and can determine if that review will apply to your feeling as well. The map of the area was really very useful, and helped us get along very well. We had a good idea of where we were at most points, without having to resort to a city map.This book helped me plan a wonderful Hawaiian trip without the benefit of a travel agent. I knew what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, and got a lot of useful information that I would not ordinarily have had. Like: directions to sparsely used beaches (all beaches in Hawaii are public) and information on rarely used hikes (we did one. Only saw two people the whole time)If you're going, you need this well in advance. It is definitely a Must Buy."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a great companion to Maui Revealed. Both are great, comprehensive resources for planning your Hawaiian vacation."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I purchased 4 of these book of the islands and found them to be the most thurough informative books out there. I would highly recommend them to anybody that is going to visit the islands and want to feel like a native in navigating the sights to see as well as the culture."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I love all the Hawaii revealed books, as they let you know where the real gems are - the hidden places that most tourist will never visit."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We are going to Oahu next week and I'm pleased with how much info this book as given us. I appreciate their candid approach and cannot wait to try out some of the Gems."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Probably an excellent book at the time of printing,but very outdated 2005. Many hotels, atractions and restaurant have been outdated and changed, so it is not really helpful in that area.Beautiful pictures and nice description of the island and its history"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We haven't gone on our trip yet but we'd be lost without this book.Anything and everything you'll ever want to see, do or eat is in here.The best $15 I spent in a long time."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This book is awesome. I have a list of places to go and restaurants to eat at and the maps are amazing. This book helped me plan for my honeymoon."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"With my trip to Hawaii coming soon, Ohau Revealed helped tremendously in finding accomodations and activities. Would recommend this to anyone going to Hawaii."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a great travel series. Nice photos, great maps. Sturdy book you can take along. Comprehensive and helpful."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Oahu Revealed was our constant guide for the best 10 days our family has spent together! Wow!I only wish the authors would come to my neighborhood and review some of the restaurants and attractions."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Wow- so glad i bought this book!! It was very informative and literally our guide! We found several items within this book that took us to wonderful spots to visit - we used it constantly on our recent trip. It's a little heavy but worth the carry!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Having visited Oahu over twenty times and living there for a couple years in the late 1960's we were amazed at the massive amount of new useful information. We especially appreciate the author's expression of opinions even if very unflattering.We are going in three weeks for a month on Oahu and will take the book with us to use frequently on our trip."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is a great book to have if you are visiting hawaii for the 1st or second time. Very valuable information about the island and the activities they have to offer. I would recommend this book for anyone that is looking to find information about Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We just returned from a week-long trip to Oahu. This book was recommended to us, and we took it with us everywhere! We found the reviews of restaurants to be spot-on. I'm so glad we had this with us. Otherwise, we would've missed out on a lot- especially on the North Shore. We also had a copy of Frommer's Oahu book, but honestly, we never even took it our of our suitcase. This one had everything we needed. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We have found this book to be extremely helpful, with honest reviews and detailed pricing information. It is also an interesting read, and even humorous at times. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I purchased this book for a trip I was taking with my husband for our anniversary. I choose this book because not only did it look like it had a lot of general information, it also had a lot of fun facts and details that might be overlooked in other guidebooks. I was very pleased when I recieved the book and saw that it had all that I wanted. Not only did it have tidbits on everything I wanted, it also gave directions and recommendations from people who actually visited the location. I like knowing that the research is done and that I can rely on the information that's given me to. :)Only con would be that since it does have so much information it wasn't that convenient to bring with me everywhere we went. I just had to make sure I thoroughly read up on the locations we were going to when we didn't bring the book with us. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know more than an overview."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I read this before going to Oahu and took it with me as a guide. It is easy to read and easy to look things up while traveling. The recommended places to visit and the descriptions were excellent and made for a wonderful trip. We followed many of the recommendations and were not disappointed. I'd recommend this as your travel guide if visiting this island."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"While this company does not do a great job with rating many hotels it is an awesome book written by people that live there. I originally checked out the Kauai book from the library then bought it and this one. I really feel like I got a better insight as to what I really want to do vs the more popular travel book companies. These people actually check out their picks without letting the companies know they are doing it. They do have two ratings for hotels that I like and used to pick my hotels out. My 16 yr old neice and I are going to have a better time because of these guys."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I have 3 others of the 'Revealed' series for Hawaii and have been very impressed with the books.....until now. The Oahu Revealed seems haphazard and incomplete. You may be reading a paragraph on a topic that then points you to another part of the book and when you go there, it is not easy to find what you were looking for. Take 'snorkeling' as an example. There is no coherent one place to read about snorkeling, such as where to go and what operators are good. The information is scattered and you need to hunt for it.There were only a few hotels listed for places other than Waikiki, and I know there are other places to stay on Oahu, which was what I was hoping to see.The book is just OK, not great like the others in the series."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Glossy color photos and writings on every page, super detailed maps and written by a local who live there for a very long time... this is seriously the ONLY Oahu book you need and I bought Four different ones out here on Amazon. All the others ended up staying at the house we rented on the North Shore..this is the only one that ended up on our adventures. BUY THIS BOOK and you will not be sorry. This book is invaluable.It has many hidden places to see that no other book even talked about. Our July 07 trip was the best and with this amazing reference, yours can be too.No other even compares. Super detailed, and way..way out of Frommers, Lonely Planet's, Fodders league.If you go with another book without seeing the amazing Revealed books about Hawaii, then you WILL miss a lot."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"My wife and I were married on Oahu and spent 2 weeks there and used this book every day and it was great. It tells you a great deal about what to do and where to go. Well worth the price."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Great book. Great information and funny! Would recommend for anyone who is planning on making a trip to Hawaii !"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"If you ever plan to go or have been to Hawaii on Oahu Please do yourself a favor get this book. The Author is a great guy and his family live on the islands and the places he points out are Great and some of the locals dont know about them."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"this book was exactly what I was looking for. lots of information about eating and and playing. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Best guidebook for the Hawaiian Islands. You see everyone on the islands carrying it around. Have bought many verisions of the years"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I don't think I could have enjoyed my trip to Hawaii near as much, if I had not read this book first. This is a must for anyone that has never been to Hawaii. So much useful information. Food, sights, nightlife, activities and of course culture, everything you need."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Oahu Revealed. All the inside scoop from people who live on Oahu. Can't wait to get there and follow their suggestions."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I went to Oahu with a friend and we used this book all the time! We were able to see parts of the island that we would have never known about. We had a great time and I will definitely purchase this book for other islands that I go to in the future. It's a must-have!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The restaurant reviews were spot on both for positive and negative reviews. We were so grateful to have had this guide. The cautions included were spot on. In retrospect, we really were better prepared for having read the book a bit on the plane ride over. Wish we'd read it sooner so we could plan more activities!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Lots of useful information written in an entertaining way. Great maps too. I'm moving to Oahu so it's coming in readily handy."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"All of the island guidebooks by this author are fantastic. I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought this book for a trip to Oahu with my girlfriend. It was excellent. It has excellent maps, destination information, tips, history and lots of ideas. It's easy to read and was always spot on for the information we needed - it must be very up to date (our trip was November 2008). I would definitely recommend this book.One other place I recommend for dinner is Irifune, near the Honolulu zoo, for the Garlic Ahi. Be sure to rent a car when you go to Oahu because Waikiki isn't Hawai'i..."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Get it while you can. THe locals don't want you to know what 's in this book. GREAT opportunities await! We passed the crowded waterfalls and found private ones that we had all to ourselves! THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I called this book my Hawaiian \\"bible.\\" I bought it for a 2 week trip to Oahu to visit my sister. It is hands down the #1 purchase for/during the entire trip!This book lets you know about places you would NEVER know about otherwise! Places just off the beaten trail that are not marked at all from the road. Several places that we went, even my sister and other locals had never even heard about! I took this book with us every where we went, and it was worth every page! The maps are awesome; I knew the geography of Oahu before we even went, just by studying the maps. They came in handy when we were there, too. My sister had given us a huge detailed map book of Oahu, but I found it way to hard to find anything on it, and kept finding myself refering to my Hawaiian \\"bible\\" instead. The maps in this book were all that we needed.I would gladly pay triple what I paid for this book, and have refered it to many people since I purchased it. Even my boyfriend (who is hard to impress) keeps raving about it to everyone when we tell them about our trip, saying how good it was. We got to see and experience things we never would have without it. I mean it when I say \\"don't go to Oahu without this book!\\" You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Yes, this is a must-have for visiting Oahu. I compared a dozen books at the bookstore and this is one of two that I bought (the other being Frommer's \\"Honolulu, Waikiki & Oahu\\").The hotel photos at the back already justify the expsense of the book. They're heavily focused on Waikiki but that will satisfy a larger percentage of visitors.The lists of activities and places to visit are varied and extensive. They'll help plan all kinds of vacation styles. The photos are pertinent and helpful."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Very comprehensive book with a companion Web site. Don't go to Oahu on vacation without it."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This entire set is awesome. I drove over 1,000 miles on the Big Island just exploring the destinations revealed in \\"The Big Island Revealed\\". My only caution: the book makes it sound like some remote spots on the islands are ok to visit, when in reality the are private land. I really appreciate the beauty and pristine nature of the islands, and if the public starts visiting some of these areas the land will surely be damaged. Tread lightly, but take this book with you when you go!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I highly recommend this series of guidebooks. This guy really knows what he's talking about. We used the book for Oahu and for Kauai. Never got lost, found everything he talked about. Great books."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"The only guide book that gives you current detailed information. They even post updates online between editions. Things tend to be poorly marked in Hawaii and so the mile marker details help get you where you want to be."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is the second book I have by the author and like the first, I highly recommend it for travel to Oahu.Very good recommendations that I found accurate and was pleased to make my decision process based on his recommendations, though not with every one of them was perfect. But that is to be expected since alot of decisions are subjective.It is a good starting point and of course it is fun to go off book and ask around for opinions from people who live there for some other ideas."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about Oahu and found it very helpful in selecting sites and events to visit even though I used an older edition for my July 2010 trip. Hopefully the newer editions are better about including addresses for GPS devices. I didn't agree with every recommendation I followed, but I still think the book was a big help in making the vacation the absolute blast it was."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Going to Hawaii? This is your passport. I could not imaging my recent trip without it. Even though it may drive the people that you're traveling nuts, read it, highlight it, post-it it, quote it, live by it. That's seriously what we did with both the Kauai and Oahu guidebooks. His restaurant recommendations are dead on. We'd drive up to these somewhat hidden waterfalls and there would be three other cars with people grasping their blue books. If you want to see the best of Oahu, always know that your meal will be great, find places that are off the beaten track, find quiet secluded beaches, snorkel with thousands of fish, buy this book. I have friends who are getting ready to go to HI and they want to discuss my trip - well first I tell them that the blue books are required reading for any further conversations on HI travel. I cannot applaud him enough. I wish he could write a travel book for every vacation I wish to take. Plus, he is an extremely talented photographer - I enjoyed the photos very much. THE BEST!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We've been to Oahu a couple of times and this book is a valuable resource for places to see, things to check out, best time to avoid crowds, etc. The book is also well organized with useful maps. There were a few places that you wouldn't think to stop when you are driving in Oahu, but the stops we did make at the book's suggestion were worthwhile. I felt the author was subjective in his opinions. This book is well researched and made our trip more fun.I would highly recommend this book whether you are visiting for the first-time or a return visitor to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Think of Andrew Doughty's OAHU REVEALED as a very good all you can eat buffet because there are so many treats in this book you'll find yourself picking and choosing how best to fill your vacation plate and wanting to go back for more later. More than just a travel book Doughty taps into the gems of the Island with the insight of someone who knows what the first time visitor or even second and third time visitor want from a good Oahu vacation.Hey, if you're spending money on air fare and a good place to stay then why not spring for the small cost of this very good book that is bound to make you grin by what you'll find inside!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"this book was very well writen and i am extremely happy with it's recommendations. lots of ideas for the off beaten paths.thank you for the info"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is my 3rd Oahu Revealed book purchase. I bought it for my son for his honeymoon. It has so much information and hundreds of beautiful pictures. It can be read like a book or picked through for specific info because it's organized perfectly. Lots of cross-references. The maps are accurate right down to the last fence post! I would recommend this book for a first timer or a seasoned Hawaii visitor. Get the other Revealed books and Andrew Doughtys picture books as well ... just gorgeous!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I'm a bit of a travel guide nut, and after buying everything I could about the island, this is the one I'm bringing with me to Oahu. Fun to read, opinionated, and chock-full of information, this is what I want to read, not just for the information, but for the insights and YES, for the writing! I made the mistake of putting this one on my nightstand to read before bed, and I couldn't stop."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought this book for a week trip to Oahu, and it proved to be a very worthwhile purchase. The maps are great for navigating the endlesssly twisty Honolulu roadway system (for example pointing out that the exits marked 'Waikiki' going east on H1 are not the exits you're looking for). Tips about beaches, hiking and restaurants were also useful. The book is easy to flip through and find relevant info, light (I carried it around most of the time i went out) and smallish (fits easily in my medium sized purse but not my small one). It's written in a light hearted but informative manner. I would have given it 5 stars if it had more information about non-chain places to eat (specifically breakfast around Waikiki) and if it had included more information about the bus system."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"This is an awesome book! I have a brother-in-law and also a stepmom who lived in Oahu for a couple years and neither of them knew as many hidden secrets as this book. We were there for a week and did everyting we wanted to do with the help of this book. The place we rented out in Kailua also had this book on the shelf and the owner raved about how it has all the secrets of the island and all the history and legends to go with them. Thanks for making our trip one of the best ever!!!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We just returned from Oahu - the book was right on target for the activities we selected. I appreciate the objective opinions covered in this book."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I love to travel, but had never visited any of the islands of our 50th state....that is, until last summer. A friend and I decided one crummy Wisconsin winter day to plan a trip to Oahu. Our objective was to experience it more like locals than tourists, though we did do some of the touristy things. For those touristy things we did choose to do, this guide was invaluable in helping us make our best choices, both in venue and in approach to places such as Diamond Head or Pearl Harbor. Detailed information about best times to visit are really helpful in maximizing your time. What to bring and pack lists were helpful, even for the somewhat seasoned traveler.As budget conscious travelers, the ratings based on cost were really helpful as well. The guide does assume that you'll be staying at Waikiki, which we did not, but still gave fair coverage and reviews of places outside that small part of the island, which is where we spent most of our time. For those trying to make lodging choices, the aerial photos that show the hotels in site would be helpful. If a hotel says \\"beach view,\\" you can get an idea of just what that actually means by studying these photos.The reviews and descriptions of the beaches were really nice and helped locate some hidden gems along our way. Also helpful for us were the descriptions of hiking trails, letting us know how much time we might need and the conditions we might encounter on those trails. Honest reviews of the best place to rent kayaks and where to paddle were also key to an enjoyable adventure. The photos included were great inspiration for our own photo adventures, and I appreciated that they were done by the author, not a paid professional photographer. We paired the use of this guide withOahu Trailblazer: Where to Hike, Snorkel, Surf from Waikiki to the North Shoreand as a result, came home with happy memories."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I bought three guide books to take with us on our 12 day trip to Oahu. My husband was home from Iraq and we were ready to see as much as we could. I read all the books before we left, but found this one an easier read, well organized, and full of useful tips. For the most part we found every review pretty much on the money. The off the beaten path type hikes was just what we were looking for. I wish they had included more on Koko Crater, because that was a great hike! Because of the way the book was organized by areas, we were able to travel and stop along the way at each thing mentioned in the book. It was nice having a pretty large selection of reviewed restaurants to choose from and my husband kept asking \\"What would Andrew do?\\" throughout the trip as I directed us to our next adventure. I wish he had books out for all the other trips we have planned!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"By far, one of the best travel series I've read- I wish Wizard publications covered the entire world with their practical, tell-it-like-it-is approach to getting the most out of your time in the islands. The pictures were on par with the DK Eyewitness Guides (my favorite series until I stumbled upon this one!) and the maps were detailed and easy to follow. In addition to the fantastic reviews and recommendations in the book, the website provides additional information that is worth checking out, and that's entirely free! I would insist that any Hawaii traveler consider this Wizard Guide as an essential travel companion."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Torn and worn out now, this book has all your typical travel advice, really good maps too. However, the in-depth commentary on the sites and activities were excellent!!....Things I did not find in the other two books I purchased. I would reccommend this book to anyone. -Ken"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I loved the book. I got Frommer's and Fodor's and liked this book better. Tip for Wakiki dining... I wish we had gone to eat at Duke's Canoe Club (in the Outrigger Waikiki) the first day. The prices and quality of drinks and food were the best we experienced. Try the Opah (fish) if they have it available and get it made Duke's style. DELICIOUS! Oh and for appetizer, try the crab mac wontons. We compared every place to Duke's after that and no one stacked up."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I got this book prior to going to Oahu and it was one of the best things I have ever done. Their maps were the most reliable in comparison to all those I had available to use. And believe me you need a good map in the islands as they are often loose about putting up signs and postings. It's ratings on places to snorkel, places to eat, and little tips etc. were right on the mark. I have friends going to Oahu this summer and I insisted that they take the time to get this book and read it to help them really enjoy and get the most out of the island."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Andrew Doughty is an excellent author. When we were in Kauai we used his book and his comments and input were right-on. Looking forward to using his suggestions when we are in Oahu come November. I would highly recommend his books."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Just returned from a first trip to Oahu and used this book exclusively as a guide. Best parts - Maps, Directions, Advice to rent a car (get the Jeep Wrangler) and explore, hiking trail recommendations (Maunawili Trail was fantastic). Only draw back - encouragement to check out the beaches on the west side. Sorry, I couldn't honestly recommend anyone to go west past KO'Olina. The Windward and North Shore were great as well as Waikiki. Really worth having if you're heading to Oahu."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"We have both the Maui and Oahu books. They are invaluable and accurate--great planning aids.

It has everything you need to know about what is (or might be) interesting to see, along with detailed instructions on how to get there. Wanna go up the Tantalus Loop above Honolulu? This book tells you how to do it. We did it, and it was worth the drive. Wanna know the best shrimp shacks around Kahuku? This book names some names. Ever heard of the island with a hole in it off La'ie? This book tells you what happened and how to get to see it.This is a guide that has useful maps that are accurate enough to find your way right to the spot. It has oodles of restaurant reviews with the ones the authors consider ONO (Hawaiian for \\"good\\"). It suggests places to stay, things to see, beaches to visit -- and when. It has everything you will ever need to get around Oahu.This is the way all guide books should be written."},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"Travel books are probably a blast to research and write, but after they go to press, the authors probably start preparing for a different kind of \\"blast,\\" as in the \\"what planet did you come from that you rated my favorite restaurant as a dive!\\" kind.Oahu Revealed is blisteringly candid. You want a travel guide that sings praises everywhere and for everything? Find yourself another book. However, if you want to be prepared for the lines at Hanauma Bay, want to know what \\"ocean view\\" means in a hotel two blocks from the beach, want to know whether the Polynesian Cultural Village is a rip-off or entertaining, and how many speed bumps you have to drive over to visit the Pu'u O Mahuka Heiau near Pupukea, then this is the book. It is refreshingly honest, candid, funny, interesting, and educational. I found myself agreeing with the author's comments far more than I disagreed. And yes, there were times I disagreed. I like the folk at North Shore Diving (now Deep Ecology). And I'm queazy about encouraging beginners to rent a kayak and just start paddling offshore. But if this book mirrored my mind, then I would have written it!Here's a warning, however. There are many folk on Oahu who are upset with this book, and it is not just from getting more visitors into personal favorite places. It also involves having more visitors actually affecting the nature of places, with added trash, human waste, trespassing, and trampling. Ask a local, and know before you go. Don't trash Oahu, please!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"There are many guidebooks available for Hawaii in general and Oahu specifically, but this one is by far the best. Not only is the book extremely current (it posts a 2005 copyright date), but the layout is easy to use, and it provides information that is actually useful in both planning a trip and once on the island.The book is well written, and is especially strong in the section on lodging. Without question the coverage of hotels in this book is superior to any other guide. The restaurant information is also informative, much better than other guides, but remember that no book can completely cover all the restaurants on the island. I have been to many of the places detailed in the book, and generally agree with the appraisals of the authors (the one exception being that I thought the Honolulu zoo was substantially better than the authors did). Even if you don't completely agree with every opinion offered in the book, every claim is well reasoned and nothing is completely out to lunch.This is the gold standard for Hawaii guidebooks, and I recommend it highly to anyone visiting Oahu!"},{"Title":"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","review":"I don't think this book has any real competition from other books. My Oahu Trailblazer had some supplementary and detailed info on places like Hanauma Bay, but it came nowhere close to this book in useful coverage of big and little sights to see and why you would want to see them.The restaurant section alone is worth the price of the book. We went to five restaurants with an ono rating on Maui and Oahu and everyone was outstanding.The author tells you what you need to know to prepare for your Hawaii vacation and has strong opinions on what to see and do, including where to hike and snorkel and the best beaches. You're time in Oahu is extremely valuable, because even if you're staying two weeks, you can only do so much. I bought my book a month in advance of the trip and I'm glad I did, because it takes a while to read and absorb the information. Of course you'll have to plan earlier than that for flight, places to stay, etc. The book is easy to read and entertaining and has many color photos to backup their descriptions and put them in perspective.I didn't agree with everything in the book. I thought the Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC), which the book (and almost everyone else) highly recommended was a totally fake and commercial experience. You might want to backup their opinions on some activities with the tripadvisor website, which has many visitors' opinions on popular attractions. They didn't give near enough info on snorkeling at Hanauma Bay either. If you don't snorkel in the right spots along the waterways just inside the coral on the left and middle of the bay you'll miss most of the fantastic snorkeling here. Snuba and a snorkel tour, which they seemed to recommend, would also be a waste. The fish are in shallow water close to shore.The complaints I have about the book are actually very minor. It was extremely helpful in extracting the most out of my week on Oahu. It's a must have.

It really should be the official travel book for Oahu but I'm afraid the \\"hidden secrets\\" it reveals will become too popular! For around $11, it's such a bargain! It is apparent to me that the author has really LIVED the book as they detailed everything you will ever want to explore on the island. With this book, I avoided paying hundreds of dollars to tour companies for simple hiking trips to Manoa Falls, Diamond Head, North Shore and Pearl Harbor. Instead, with it and a rental car for the week, I explored all the spots at my own leisure, and I don't even feel like I missed out on the description and history of the places I missed by not going with a tour guide because this book has it ALL! I just can't say enough good things about it. Absolutely amazing! I tend not to be a homer when it comes to reviews, but this time I really do feel compelled to spill my true feelings, it is kind of strange to be so passionate about a guidebook, but trust me, it is THAT good.P.S. The picture of the book on Amazon really does it no justice at all. The paper is thick and glossy and the print quality is A+, plus there are so many great pictures in here that it could serve as a souvenier for your trip! Also, I bought the Big Island Revealed book from the same authors and it is every bit as good!One thing though, Polynesian Culture Center and their Ali'i Luau are total rip-offs, I don't know why the author liked it so much.

It suffers from some lackluster technical publishing issues: Cheap printing, poor typography and editing (I admire the effort of the extensive footnotes, but at times they are over-bearing or even misleading!). Also, it's entierly one-sided, as only Cochrane's letters appear, the other half of the correspondance apparently burned after his death, along with a mass of his other writings. So what we are left with is this very Cochrane-ian tome: A murky sort of mirror, perfect for seeing all sorts of phantasms in.Much of the letters deal with his defining of the Old Ways, and a constant theme is his distaste for Gerald Gardner's Wiccan movement, which was chronologically in tandem with Cochrane's own revivalism of the Tradition. His prose is never quite stable: Often, he makes a firm statement in one letter, only to completely contradict it in another! His terminology also shifts and sways as he attempts to define his Path to others. But then, a sudden break in the clouds, and his words turn to complete lyrical poetry, and the man invokes genious! Lovely little bits of hard earned knowledge are dropped throughout, such as the Italian exorcism song he transcribes at one point. Or this:\\"... A teacher is yourself seen through the mirror darkly.\\"The question so often asked about this man is, Did he really ever hold any hereditary Keys, or was he a charlatan, patching together the lore of the countryside as he saw fit?

The author, C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne, is not exactly a household name today, but, back when, was an extremely popular and prolific writer. His serialized tales of Captain Kettle, also in &quot;Pearson's,&quot; were supposedly only second in popularity to the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;'s Sherlock Holmes stories, as submitted by Conan Doyle. But today, Hyne's reputation seems to rest solely on this wonderful novel of the last years of the continent of Atlantis.The history of these final years is told by the soldier-priest Deucalion, who, at the book's opening, has just been recalled from his 20-year viceroyalty of the Atlantean province of Yucatan. On his return to his homeland, after that two-decade absence, he finds that much has changed. The upstart Phorenice has seized power and declared herself Empress; the capital city boasts many new pyramids but also many new slums; the people are starving and in revolt; the priest clan is challenging the Empress to amend her ways or face the wrath of the High Gods. Yes, it is quite a mess that Deucalion returns home to, and things only get worse when Phorenice takes a hot-blooded fancy to him and decides to take him to husband. Before all is said and done in this fast-moving tale, the reader has been treated to a four-way love triangle (or is that square?), a runaway mammoth, fights with sea monsters and giant cave tigers, pyramid intrigue, a gigantic battle between Phorenice's army and the High Priests (a battle perhaps inspired by those in H. Rider Haggard's lost-world novels), the use of arcane magic and, of course, the final destruction of the continent of Atlantis itself. Hyne writes marvelously, and uses language that is archaic enough to sound authentic but still remains eminently readable. The character of Deucalion is well drawn and quite likeable, despite his initial aloofness and rigidity; I suppose Hyne would have us believe that this character is the inspiration for the Deucalion of Greek myth. Phorenice makes for a terrific villainess, being beautiful, quite ruthless, lustful, remarkably intelligent, and ambitious. Unfortunately, these very qualities of the Empress lead directly to the downfall of her empire. Besides well-drawn principal and secondary characters, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; also boasts marvelous detail and color. The capital of Atlantis, as well as its wilder volcanic outer districts, are well depicted, and Hyne tells us something of the lives of the people, the politics and religion of the Atlantean realm. All in all, this truly is a wonderful fantasy, and great escapist entertainment. The University of Nebraska Press, with its Bison Frontiers of Imagination series, is to be commended for making this lost manuscript available again to modern-day readers. I heartily recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)","review":"Whether or not you believe Atlantis existed there is something compelling about the idea of a far-away time, when the world had eight continents. I've been interested in Atlantis since childhood but I prefer to think of it as a myth. Many archaeologists hate Atlantis, refusing to believe in the teasing possibility of a vanished civilization swallowed by the sea. But it's been a source of inspiration for many SF and fantasy writers, ranging from Jules Verne to Robert E. Howard. C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne's novel \\"The Lost Continent\\" (1900) begins with the discovery of an ancient manuscript in a cave in the Canary Islands. In describing the events leading to the destruction of Atlantis, the narrator Deucalion tells an action-packed story of adventure, romance and revenge.After giving up his post as viceroy for the colony of Yucatan, Deucalion, a warrior-priest fiercely loyal to the gods, and completely devoted to duty, returns to Atlantis for the first time in twenty years, finding it very different to the spiritual, prosperous land he remembers.Atlantis is now governed by the Empress Phorenice, a beautiful but ruthless tyrant hell-bent on crushing opposition. Despite Phorenice's physical beauty, her evil mind and lack of conscience enables her to inflict acts of cruelty on her subjects without a qualm. Like most power-hungry autocrats, Phorenice views the suffering of others with casual disdain or amusement. In her endeavours to strengthen her power as a self-proclaimed deity, she treats the gods with an equal level of scorn and contempt, as she discovers more and more of their secrets.Phorenice now wants Deucalion to be her husband. As Deucalion is a fatalist, believing his life to be in the hands of the gods, he agrees to her wishes and sees the full extent of Atlantis' fall from grace. Cruelty and brutality are commonplace in Atlantis, among the splendour of its spires and temples, and anyone who incurs the displeasure of the Empress is punished with torture and death. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that rebellion is growing.We already know the ultimate fate of Atlantis but this doesn't stop the reader from enjoying the story. C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne was a writer with a sense of humour and this sometimes comes through in the dialogue. Deucalion fits the mould of the ideal fantasy hero: strong, daring, brave and articulate, a possible precursor to Conan, but a bit more intelligent. And celibate. Phorenice is the archetypal femme fatale.Sadly \\"The Lost Continent\\" is the only book C.J. Cutcliffe Heine is remembered for today. Despite a productive career much of his work is now forgotten. But anyone fascinated by Atlantis will want to read this. \\"The Lost Continent\\" is reputed to be the best interpretation of the legendary civilization."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)","review":"Not that I claim to be an expert on stories about Atlantis, but C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne's THE LOST CONTINENT is certainly the most entertaining example I have ever read of this rankly overgrown subliterary subgenre.

They offer a full breakdown on popular ingredients from cactus leaves (nopales) to tamarindo, along with brief overviews on their tastes, and how to cook them. Plus they include photos of the different ingredients, to make them easier to identify when shopping for produce.They also have a photo with a guide to 14 different types of Mexican chile peppers used in cooking, along with descriptions for each. So if you couldn't tell the difference between an ancho pepper or a guajillo before, you will after you get the booklet.I'm partial to food photos, and there are plenty of great ones included in the booklet. But what I like most about this small cookbook is that they included a wide variety of dishes that you typically wouldn't find in other Mexican cookbooks.There are recipes for appetizers like toasted chili nuts, seafood-stuffed chiles, and chilled avocado soup. Main dishes include chicken with pepper-pumpkin seed mole, and garlic shrimp. One of the better recipes (and photos) is that of the Mexican almond pudding with custard sauce.So while this is obviously a thin booklet no thicker than a magazine, it's honestly filled with some recipes that are off the beaten path. If collect Mexican cookbooks like I do, I think you'll want to add this one to your collection.*Amazon doesn't have an image of the cover, so I scanned my booklet and uploaded a picture of it."},{"Title":"Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience (Book with CD-ROM for Windows and Macintosh)","review":"I have used both the first and second editions of this text in courses for first-year graduate students in a Psy.D. program.

If your professor requires this book, make sure that they are a good instructor via ratemyprofessor.com or other sources. If you have a professor who cannot teach effectively, you may end up getting lost unless you are extremely competent at biology and learning new, foreign words easily.

I didn't know anything beyond basic Psych 101 knowledge before taking this class, and I've had to study more than I have in any other class. It's possible to succeed, but this textbook won't do you any favors.As a note, the online portion of this (biopsychology.com) is not entirely good, with very vague study questions. That said, it is free to access, so feel free to check that out before you purchase this textbook to get a good idea of the kind of tone the book uses!"},{"Title":"Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience (Book with CD-ROM for Windows and Macintosh)","review":"Breedlove's BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY is a wonderful introduction to the intersection of physiology, biology, and behavior. I used this textbook at a graduate level, and it served as a great primer to many areas (sleep, sensation and perception, neurotransmission). With that disclosure, I think that this text would also serve well in a higher-level undergraduate psychology course.The content is presented in a clean, clear, and concise way; it rarely gets bogged down in jargon or esoteric concepts. Colorful, easy-to-understand figures are presented often to illustrate processes and concepts. There are many images and figures here, which does well to convey things like neurotransmission, but often it breaks up the natural flow of reading. This serves as my only true complaint though; this book is probably the best I've come across for this field.Word to the wise: you can probably do well with just the fifth edition of this book (which is currently much cheaper). Doing so will result in some missed content concerning function MRI, but most everything else is still well represented."},{"Title":"Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience (Book with CD-ROM for Windows and Macintosh)","review":"I read this book to better understand how biological factors affect human psychology.

It contained too much fantasy."},{"Title":"A Liar's Tale","review":"What if every lie you ever told became a reality, as long as someone believed it? Money, sex, love, you name it - all is yours if you simply master the skill of deceit. No longer would you have to bother with the truth and the sacrifices it entails; then again, from suffering can come growth. And a world built upon lies, like a house of cards, inevitably comes crashing down upon itself.Those are the central themes in \\"A Liar's Tale,\\" the wonderfully inventive, thought-provoking first novel by Andre Coleman, who, as a journalist (the city reporter for the Pasadena Weekly), has dedicated his life to a search for the truth (one of many delicious ironies infusing this story).The setting is modern-day America, whose rhythms of life and speech - from the forbidding back alleys of homelessness and the claustrophobic confines of prison to the working class apartments of New York City and the oak-paneled courtrooms of justice - Coleman apparently effortlessly captures with veracity and immediacy.The central character is Scott Hampton, a young black man originally from an upper-middle-class family. His father is as hard and cold as the marble floors in their spacious home. His mother is warm and supportive, yet in the shadow of the father. His older brother, Kevin, is the apple of his parents' eye, successful in all he does. And Scott, the chronic underachiever, has become a habitual liar (although there is more to the genesis of his prevarication, as we will learn).One evening, Scott sneaks out of the house and into the park, where he chances upon a mysterious, cold-eyed figure, the Rastafarian, in the first of several appearances throughout the story. He appreciates Scott's sense of suffocation in his real life and appeals to his overly developed sense of fantasy: With the gift of some very exotic sticks of incense (\\"truth and lies\\"), the Rasta man offers to make all of Scott's dreams come true. Fearing perhaps a Faustian bargain - which indeed will be the case - Scott runs back to his dysfunctional home; after watching his hero Batman on TV, hidden from the world by his mask as Scott is by his lies, he lights the incense (or, rather, it lights itself) and falls back in bed.Over the years, his father became a judge; his mother, a published professor; his brother, a professional football player; and Scott, an artist who didn't want to suffer for his art. Living in New York City, as far away from his family as possible, Scott becomes a technician in a hospital (where there has been a series of \\"mercy killings\\" of elderly patients). Living in an apartment, he shares brotherly banter, laughs, and thought with \\"his boys,\\" Darius and Rich, and love with his long-suffering girlfriend, Dorene, who never knows when to believe her boyfriend: Scott is as uncommitted to the truth as he is to her.At this point it is worth mentioning that Coleman has said: \\"I don't write heroes and villains. Instead I try and write flawed people.\\" As with everything else in \\"A Liar's Tale,\\" Coleman has created characters whose imperfections only heighten their reality.Which only heightens the believability and, thus, the impact of the unreality that is about to come.Scott has tempted fate far too long, his words in effect playing God, by creating false, new identities and histories for people in his life every time he has gotten someone to believe that he couldn't be at work because his brother was in the hospital, or he was worth sleeping with because he owned a Porsche, or he couldn't turn in his school report because his dog ate his homework. The day of reckoning finally arrives.In the course of a day, because of his lies, Scott loses his job, his girl, and almost everything he owns. \\"I was suffering, and I hated the suffering,\\" Scott laments, \\"It's fate's joke, and once fate finds a sucker it doesn't let up and it keeps laughing at you even after you've been defeated.\\"Digging through what is left of his belongings, searching for his emergency cash to make his way, tail between his legs, back home, Scott comes across the mysterious incense. \\"Truth and lies,\\" he thinks to himself, as the incense ignites itself and fills the room with colorful smoke.Scott arrives at the train station, but you can't go home again. Rather, from this point onward, Scott embarks on a Kafkaesque adventure in a world turned upside-down, where every lie he has ever told that anyone has ever believed has come true, with profound, often disastrous consequences for all concerned. (\\"It's like throwing a rock in a pond and watching the ripples it creates.\\")Far be it from this reviewer to reveal the intrigues that threaten to overwhelm our increasingly enlightened and repentant central character; but suffice it to say that Coleman has crafted a marvelously creative, modern-day morality tale, involving the gain and loss of all the wealth and love one could hope to enjoy, solving a murder mystery created (appropriately enough) by deception within deception, and utterly dripping with irony (For example, at one point Scott is hooked up to a lie detector to prove that he truly believes that his lies have become true).Ultimately, \\"A Liar's Tale\\" is a classically heroic tale, of growth through adversity; indeed, it examines that very premise by standing it on its head! Again, Mr. Coleman has written a decidedly intelligent, wondrously inventive novel, whose elements of fantasy as well as reality work only because he describes every scene and portrays every character - most especially his or her very individual manner of speech - with a clarity and attention to detail that place you right there with them (a quite shocking realization in the very first scene).But at the core of the book is the conscience of Scott, asking questions of others or simply of the fates that each of us asks, often in the most trying times of our lives, but rarely has answered - especially \\"Why does God let people suffer?\\" In the end, Scott concludes: \\"Suffering is the road to revelation. We travel on it to realize our dreams. When we lie to make the journey easier, we veer off the road.\\"\\"A Liar's Tale\\" is a road well worth traveling."},{"Title":"A Liar's Tale","review":"\\"A Liar's Tale\\" grabs you by the throat immediately and does not release you until after you have been taken on a wild roller coaster of emotions. The writing is so enticing, so vivid, that the readers will feel as if they are watching a film rather than reading a book.The story evokes every basic human emotion, ranging from fear to joy to anger to sadness to triumph. It helps us delve so deeply into the very core of people from such a wide range in life that we feel as if we have moved in and become a part of a new community. We get to *know* the characters that Mr. Coleman writes about; we learn to care about them, we worry for their outcomes, we eagerly anticipate their next actions... and often, the unexpected consequences of Scott's lies send us reeling right along beside him into a fuzzy whirlwind of confusion and instability. The reader will constantly wonder, \\"How is this all going to end?\\" Prepare yourself for some pleasant and not-so-pleasant surprises... just like real life hands us every day.I like the book so much, I really can't find the words that seem to do it justice.

Then, as a result of his lies, Scott Hampton is catapulted into a surreal nightmare with many well-executed twists.Scott lies so many times that he cannot remember them all, that is until they all come back to haunt him, one horrifying event after another. Scott says in the novel, \\"So many lies, they were too hard to keep track of. Every time one of them came true, it shocked me.\\" That is the core of this paranormal story.Who is the person who allows these lies to come true, knowing they will kill his soul and affect his mind? I was left wheeling from sequence to sequence; never knowing what's come next. The author knows his facts in the prison sequence and in the courtroom. Tough love is definitely a part of this chilling story, not preaching, just telling truths about Scott's lies.You could say Scott's lies put him on the bridge to nowhere. (Patron the pun.) I vowed after reading \\"A Liar's Tale\\" never to lie again. This novel shook me. Andre Coleman is an excellent writer--his product is right up there with the better paranormal fiction."},{"Title":"A Liar's Tale","review":"I was captivated from page one! Reading about the consequences of Scott's lies took me on an emotional roller coaster. This novel has excellent detail, depth, and dialogue. I truly loved the drama and fantasy it contained.

From the plot, I didn't see any similarities but curiosity lead both of us to contact each other. I wanted to know who was this author. So, I read his book. I couldn't be more delighted and flattered that I am somehow connected to this publication. I read books like fish swim, so usually when I pick up a book, I try to figure out what the ending will be just from the gist of the beginning. There are many books that I read and don't remember much afterwards. There is no doubt in my mind that I will always remember this one. This book took so many leaps and turns to the point where I was caught up in trying to ride the rollercoaster of words. Speaking of words, this author couldn't hide his poetic capability if he tried. It wasn't just the fact that the book took a unique spin on a boy who loved to tell lies and became a man who had to face the consequences of his lies. It was the WAY the writer's flavor of writing lead the man to face the consequences. Sudden actions and descriptions throughout the book were vivid and engaging. If the character's shoulder hurt, my shoulder hurt. When something happened to his nose, I touched my own. When he cried, I blinked furiously. The description of the tattoo did it for me though, because I have one, and there is no better way to describe that sensation than how the author did. THAT'S when you know that you're into a story, when you start fancying yourself that character. If I type too much, I'll tell the story, but I am extremely impressed with this book: the detail, the depth, the morality (without preaching!), and the description made this a solid read. I will definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"A Liar's Tale","review":"\\"A Liar's Tale\\" is a mind-bending look at a simple question: What if all the lies come true? This novel is an intriguing character study of a young man who has a penchant for fabricating stories to manipulate situations and people. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that his journey into the surreal world his lies formed and back again pulls reader into his head. You can almost feel what he is feeling, and you want to know what happens next. You see how even the insignificant \\"little white lies\\" prove to have dire consequences for the protagonist. You may want to feel sorry for him, or want to smack him upside the head. Either way, you will feel something. As soon as I picked up the book, I didn't put it down until the end. It's not a long novel, but it is one you want to read slowly so that you don't miss any details. This is a great first novel for an up-and-coming author. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Liar's Tale","review":"The person who did this book's typesetting did a questionable job and the end indulges in a bit too much moralizing. Other than that, there is not much to complain about in this well-paced, highly artistic, wonderfully insightful novel.This is not the happy, happy adventure of one of life's big winners. In fact, it is the tale of a rather average guy--an artist who does not want to suffer for his art--in a family of life's biggest lottery winners. Dad is a judge with a good shot at becoming governor of California. Mom is beautiful and smart--a professor. Kevin, the brother, is a high school football hero for whom the future looks endlessly bright. And then there is Scott. And then there is Scott...Since he was not born for glory, he makes short cuts for himself by making up his victories, the title. For Scott, the consequences for dishonesty come a calling, often with interest.As a writer, I read other writers looking for lessons both good and bad. Out of professional courtesy, I do not review the books I pick apart.This is a book that stands up to scrutiny on any level. The writing is fresh and sincere. The dialogue is extraordinary. Clearly Andre Coleman has a good ear for the way people talk. The story is a bit depressing; but then, I think that is doubly so for those of us who consider ourselves the \\"Scott\\" of our family.I believe this book was printed in limited quantities, so I am glad I got mine.

Greenleaf introduced a new way to look at leadership, with a focus first on serving, and the ripples of his revolutionary vision for leadership are still resonating with us today. Spears and Lawrence have collected an eclectic assortment of reflections on Greenleaf's work. Some of them are simple essays describing the various behavioral components of Greenleaf's servant leadership. Some of them are interviews with well-known advocates of servant leadership. Some of them are stories of a particular company that has been run under the framework of servant leadership or a unique partnership between two organizations which were collaboratively joined together under servant leadership. This great variation in both style and substance of the various essays kept the book fresh and readable.However, the almost spastic nature of the disparate essays also kept the book from feeling like a cohesive unit with any sort of specific direction. As much as the variation kept the reading experience lively, it almost felt jarring at times to bounce around from essay to essay, without any sense of connection from one to the next (beyond an obvious adoration for Robert Greenleaf and his work that was consistent from beginning to end). I realize that a book of this nature simply cannot flow together as if written by one author, but I feel like some sense of continuity would have been helpful.In any case, I'm glad to have read this book, if for no other reason than to have encountered some specific examples of servant leadership in real-life institutions. Greenleaf's book presents a compelling vision for his idea of servant leadership, but it remains largely theoretical and rather abstract. The stories in this book help to fill out the picture that Greenleaf was painting. Some of the essays were rather forgettable, and the lack of continuity prevented this book from being one of my favorite leadership books, but I'm happy to recommend it to those who would like some helpful follow-up to Greenleaf's work, including specific cases of servant leadership in action."},{"Title":"Practicing Servant-Leadership: Succeeding Through Trust, Bravery, and Forgiveness","review":"This is a great book and one I think anyone who has aspirations for leadership in any form should consider as a permanent part of their library.

No significant discussion of the issues involved with implementing Windows Media Server, Darwin (Quicktime), or Real, no info on planning your bandwidth or simultaneous connection needs, nothing on sizing servers appropriate to anticipated needs... and way too much very basic stuff (i.e., explaining what a domain name is.)All in all, a huge disappointment, particularly coming from Wiley, who has long had a reputation for high-quality, in-depth technical books."},{"Title":"Streaming Media: Building and Implementing a Complete Streaming System (Professional Developer's Guide)","review":"I was very pleased to see the step-by-step process of how to build a webcasting system.

Initially screwing a great many people in Cleveland OH, Greg Demetriades left town to begin his pyramid scheming in Houston, until he again skipped town with all the money. Living the high life, many of his former employees lost their homes. He's also being held responsible for child support.As a former burned employee, he had me working on this book before it was published - everybody in the office knew he had cobbled this together from other uncredited sources in his bid to get rich quick. While some of us lost our homes from rarely ever getting paid, he was driving around in either his Porsche Boxster, Mercedes Benz, or his Audi 8000.If you have any doubts concerning negative comments made about this 'brilliant entrepreneur,' see if you can find him anywhere - he's in hiding because of all the enemies he's made from conning people."},{"Title":"A Marriage Made in Heaven: Or Too Tired for an Affair","review":"I borrowed a copy of this book from a library. I could not put it down until I was done with reading it. There are funny stories, remarks and insights. I was laughing out loud over Erma Bombeck's book. There are stories that made me teary and sad. It was the first time for me to read this well-known humorous author, and I am excited that I discovered Erma Bombeck's books. I cannot wait to read all of her other books that she gifted to her readers.It is possible that if I picked up this particular book on marriage when I was childless and single, I would not have related to too many stories from the book. As a family person I found that there are many things Erma described I could relate to. Even though she was living in different times - when woman's role in society was changing, thanks to the book, I discovered there are some aspects of married life that remained almost unchanged. Turned out, half a century is nothing when it comes to married couples' challenges and arguments and family values. Anyone who reads the book is likely to get reinforcement that being together with your partner for better and for worse is challenging and rewarding at the same time."},{"Title":"A Marriage Made in Heaven: Or Too Tired for an Affair","review":"This book is funny, but it's more like a sweet, wistful and at times a little sad and rueful kind of funny, rather than the knee-slapping sarcastic wisecracks I was used to after reading most of Erma's previous books. Erma for the first time tells some of the true stories of her own life and builds on those for her humor. The problem is that, while Erma's other books focused on the 60s and 70s, this one starts all the way back in 1949 when she became a young bride to her husband Bill, without much realistic sense of what marriage entailed. My own parents weren't even married until 1961 and by the time I was old enough to get married myself, people's ideas and expectations of marriage had changed pretty drastically to say the least. My own marriage and life have been very different from Erma's and that makes it harder to relate to the book, especially when she's making a thoughtful point rather than just being hilarious. Some of her viewpoints came off almost martyrish to me, although my mother, being closer to Erma's generation, would probably understand the mindset better.I was a little sorry I read the book because, despite the age difference between me and Erma, a lot of her previous funny writings stood the test of time and were something to which I could relate or at least see the humor. I see now that my enjoyment of her previous books was a testament to what a great and gifted writer she was, because she could make experiences universal even across generations for purposes of humor.I would recommend this book if you're either \\"of a certain age\\" or are interested in the \\"woman behind the books\\", with the understanding that her life experiences - trying (and failing) to be a perfect housewife, struggling with \\"hippie\\" children in the 60s and so forth - might not mirror your own experiences or views. Frankly, just the fact that she and Bill stayed married for so long in this divorce-laden age and despite her eventual great commercial success is likely to interest a few readers right there."},{"Title":"A Marriage Made in Heaven: Or Too Tired for an Affair","review":"This book is full of wit and one liners from a woman who knows family.

We spend our lives changing our partners, resisting the changes that life throws our way, staying married through thin and fat, through children, through illness and career changes ~~ through death, death of a father and friend. It's a wonderful little book full of wisdom and insights. I love her chapter titles: A House Morally Divided Cannot Stand Each Other or Living on Love.She offers insights to her own life and marriage oftentimes, poking fun at herself and her family. She is never mean but instead she is inspiring. She makes you think even while laughing at some of the silly things we all do in our own lives. I have not been married as long as she has but already, I see some of the things she has pointed out such as trying to change your husband.If you're looking for a wonderful book to read ~~ don't miss this one. It's beautifully written and so poignant in some places. Erma writes about life because she has lived it. Her stories are still true today as they were fourteen years ago.5-11-06"},{"Title":"A Marriage Made in Heaven: Or Too Tired for an Affair","review":"The chronicle of Erma Bombeck's married life, this is a sweet, funny, and realistic view of timeless marriage.Ms. Bombeck starts on the wedding day, when she and husband Bill were married by a priest who spoke Latin with a Polish accent.

I think I purchased one copy of each of his works, and have been making my way through them all, (sometimes jumping back and forth), and Intentions is really a wonderful collection of some of his very witty, and very cutting stories. My favorite was 'The Decay of Lying' which is a subject I noticed Wilde writes about in many of his works, like in Dorian Gray.For some reason, this book is missed but many, and I myself just found it by accident, so do yourself a favor and read it!

He founded the Buddhist Society in London and was the main Buddhist mentor of Alan Watts. Throughout this wonderful book, Christmas emphasizes that his thoughts and teachings are not authoritative or final, because such a thing is not possible in Buddhism. Yet, at the end of the book, I felt privileged to have been in the presence of a Great Spiritual Master. Throughout this book, Humphreys breathes a refreshing tolerance for many spiritual and religious traditions, that seems so lacking nowadays. The book begins with the main theme; \\"Asked, \\"what is truth?\\" a master of Zen Buddhism replied, \\"Walk on!\\" and though there will be many words between these at the beginning and the same two at the end of this small book they will say no more.\\" There are so many wisdom teachings in this book, it is impossible to enumerate them all. However, one example that I loved was his discussion of karma. He states that we are \\"punished by our sins and not for them.\\" Karma is simply a statement of the law of cause and effect. No \\"Big Daddy/Mommy God\\" is punishing you for your sins. There is no such thing as good karma or bad karma, just karma. Simply put, act and you must accept the consequences of your actions. I can't recommend this book highly enough.

Stone certainly has an excellent command of the language. The writing in this book was all, however, which I did actually enjoy. I don't believe that Stone wrote the book as well as he could have. The plot would have been good had Stone not made every character a figure of my hatred. I hate them all. None of them have any moral values. They all live according to themselves. It embarasses me to think that our country actually went through this selfish stage. &quot;She set about separating another high from the dope on the sheet of paper.&quot; Drug crazed hippies. This book is about evil, selfish people focused on drugs. I did not like this book because of the lack of moral values that the characters have."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"This book is strange, to say the least. It won the National Book Award in 1973. The characters are so realistic and involve themselves in what people have the ability to do in extreme situations or when opportunities arise to gain wealth or power and no negative consequences seem imminent. The book is very believable because the characters resort to drugs and illegal activity when the chips are down. That's how a lot of people in society deal with problems; either drugs or alcohol. It's usually the people who don't fit the typical mold, like Converse. He's just a simple, tabloid reporter. The fact that the book seems to jump around in setting constantly keeps the reader immersed in the story and wanting to know where the next page will lead them. I felt that the book contained too many characters and each character's purpose and importance were sometimes unclear. The sex scenes and drug use were too many and too detailed for me. I would recommend this book to an older audience due to the drugs/sex. It will inform younger adults of the dark side of the 70's/Vietnam lifestyle or serve as a trip in time for readers who actually experienced it."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I found this book very hard to understand. There are a lot of characters most of which are in one scene and didn't have much significence to the story. Throughout the book I only understood about five sections. The author used words about drugs that I couldn't understand, I didn't know what a &quot;fever&quot; was or &quot;getting off.&quot; Many of these words I have never heard before. Each scene of the book was short and insignificant. The author bounced from scene to scene making it difficult to use information from one, very short, scene to the next. In the end of the book you realize there are only three important people and all the rest were fill in's to add to your confusion. I had to read this book for a school project and found it boring and frustrating. It is hard to have to read a book you don't understand."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"The book Dog Soldiers has a good story line, but the writer makes it kind of hard to understand the story. I like the idea of the book, but I don't think it is written very well. The business about overseas drug dealing is very realistic. It seems that lots of drug dealers get their drugs someplace where it is cheap, and bring it back to the United States, and sell it for big bucks. The main characters are Ray Hicks, John Converse, and Marge Converse. Ray Hicks and John Converse are in Vietnam at the beginning of the story. John and Marge are married, and Marge works at a strip club, and John is a reporter in Vietnam. John Converse, and Ray Hicks are drug dealers. The story gets hard to follow when the characters are running around all over, because the writer doesn't explain who everybody is, and what they are doing with them. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"Stone's books are all filled with drugs and paranoia, but Dog Soldiers, his second novel, is his most on-the-edge. His vision takes in everything, the obscure details that fill the world, focused in tight-points on the counterculture and that which the counterculture resists, on the idea of America, of respectability. Dog Soldiers starts in Vietnam with a drug deal, moves to California, where the deal goes wrong, and winds up with one of the protagonists walking through the desert, wounded, toward death. Welcome, America, welcome"},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"More than any other novel I can remember reading, Dog Soldiers perfectly captures the paranoid, conspiracy riven, drug-saturated atmosphere of American in the late 1960s. The story is largely the stuff of pulp fiction, elevated to literature of a very high order by virtue of Robert Stone's razor-sharp prose, complex characters, and his honest depiction of violence in all its many guises. In the wanning days of the Vietnam War, a battle-hardened soldier named Hicks is paid to smuggle into the U.S. a large cache of heroin; when he deviates from the pre-arranged plan, he sets in motion a violent chain of events that, in terms of their intensity and body count, bear an all-too-frightening resemblenace to the war Hicks left behind.On the run, Hicks is persued by characters worthy of Jim Thompson at his demented best. Among them are DEA agents and cops who may or may not be legitimate, drug dealers with a penchant for sadism, an aspiring screen writer who misjudges Hicks with disasterous results, and an odd assorment of other less than honorable types. Hick's companion on his hell-bound journey is a bored, drug-addled housewife with an insatiable appetite for heroin and mayhem. And the odyssey itself sends Hicks hurdling head-long through a California landscape of annonymous suburbs and dead end border towns that in Stone's twisted vision of reality are nothing short of nightmarish.I've long thought that Robert Stone is deserving of a far bigger readership that he currently enjoys. But in rereading Dog Soldiers recently I realized that there is good reason why his audience is relatively small. While he dabbles in genres that are typically the province of popular fiction -- drugs, terrorism, political assassination -- his stories are imbued with a pitiless view of humanity that provides none of the escapism that readers gererally look for in pop fiction. In this sense Stone is not unlike Graham Greene (the writer I think Stone most closely resembles), who, even in his \\"entertainments,\\" could not help but speak the truth, even if it cost him readers.Dog Soldiers is a page-turner with both style and brains, a vastly entertaining novel that doesn't insult a reader's intelligence by sugar-coating reality, and a work that leaves one with a great deal to think about long after the last sentence is finsihed."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I am a fan of robert stone, and this is my favorite book by him.First, having served as a correspondent in Vietnam and as someone who was immersed in 60s counterculture, he brings an authenticity to the story. The characters and setting ring true.Secondly, for me this is his most successful integration of the philosophical/ideas novel with adrenaline-powered storytelling. It is a page-turner with a brain, with echoes of hemmingway and joseph conrad.his central protagonist, hicks, is my favorite of all stone's anti-heroes. his novels never contain a \\"perfect\\" hero but rather protagonists doing the best they can in the world they inhabit and with the imperfect tools they are born with. Hicks is a fascinating though flawed character.a deserved winner of the pullitzer prize."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"This is a crime story about drug dealers during the Vietnam war, and about their various mental, emotional, money, and health problems. What exotic people they were!This is also a novel from and about forgotten times and it deals with forgotten segments of the US society. What a strange country it was!Glimpses of Vietnam and Cambodia come into it; what a sick war it was!It is pretentiously literary: the main hero Converse travels to Vietnam with Saint-Exupery in his baggage. His courier Hicks reads Nietzsche on his carrier and thinks of Hemingway when he remembers fishing. The missionary lady in the park reads Cronin, appropriately; she identifies a half sentence, spoken by Converse, containing the words \`God' and \`whirlwind', as Job 37. The guru's son reads Stevenson. The psychotic killer recites Heine (that's odd). The soon-to-die medic reads Hesse.The novel's epigraph is a quote from Conrad. I assume the flabby devil is meant to be Kurtz, and that probably means that Converse is a version of Kurtz.The novel won the NBA in 1975. The publisher of my pocket book seems to feel a need to justify that award by printing praises from various reviewers who saw reason to compare the book to all kinds of stars, such as: a) Conrad, b) Hemingway, c) Traven, d) Chandler, e) Faulkner.And now, let me tell you, despite all this the novel is not at all bad. I did actually find interest and pleasure in reading it. I do think the author was his own man. None of the comparisons makes sense or is needed. If I may come up with my own comparison, this style strikes me more like what I would imagine Kerouac to have written had he known how to write fiction and had he asked Graham Greene to improve on the manuscript.The main character Converse is anguish personified. He has reason to be afraid, though he is luckily often almost too tired to be afraid. He gets involved in this drug dealing thing while in Vietnam, as a less than second rate journalist, because, as he lucidly self-diagnoses later: Being there f(oul)s up your perspective. Asked again in another situation, he says: in the absence of anything else... This man is no Kurtz, he is just a weak lost soul. Kurtz was lost too, but he put up a much harder fight and moved a larger wheel. Maybe the whole crowd of heroin dealers are Kurtzes? That is more like it! A worthwhile paradigm!The Californian publisher that Converse works for, his father in law, is in the business of newspapers with headlines like this timeless beauty: Mad hermit rapes coed campers. (Seriously, should I sue for defamation?)The book was made into a movie (Who'll stop the Rain?) and the focus moved from Converse to his courier Hicks, played by Nick Nolte. Nolte is something of a blue collar Buddhist, an amateur student of Japanology, a veritable samurai after service as a marine on Okinawa and a Vietnam tour. His interim conclusion halfway through the ride: Zen is for old men! (I knew I have to wait before I understand it!)Quite possibly nobody will understand this novel in 50 years, or it will require deep historical and cultural education. For us contemporaries it is a good visit. (Ignore the 1 star reviews, they are from a bunch of funny HS students and not meant literally.)"},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers is one of the most important novels to come out of the Vietnam experience. His insight into the counter culture and American society during the last years of the war ensure that this book will remain forever in the canon of American Letters. Stone is a remarkable writer. He takes Hemingway on at his own game and wins. To bring the Americans out of Vietnam and bring Vietnam and the War back to the US is Stone's masterstroke.

I loved this book because I am so interested in the 60's and 70's. As I was reading the book I kept thinking about what my parents were like during this time. A lot of the book is disturbing to read becuase it is so hard to beliecve that people behaved like this.

You'd give up the twighlight one decent night to really appreciate the novel.The deal is, is that this is just \\"for whom the bell tolls.\\" And I don't mean that as an insult. The truth is Robert Stone does Hemingway better than Hemingway, because he's not scared of Henry James and he rolls naturally in his voice.It's sort of like that was Hemingway's goal, to turn out and let the dialogue take over, the same kind of self conscious experimentation of a Samuel Beckett but in a way Europe appreciates less (and for good reason). But this is what it is. It's a literary plot driven novel, and that's simply astounding. This had all the makings of garbage and it turned out golden. And i'd bet money that cormac mccarthy read it and ripped off a piece too big to try and make the story his own.So yeah, this ain't light lit.

There are others out there, but not so many others that Stone's Dog Soldiers didn't more or less have me at hello. The premise is a little more straightforward than I would have chosen (I'm a sucker for subplots that cross unexpectedly at the end) but the action is quick and pulpy and the voicing is strong and clear and vibrant. I've never seen anyone string as many thoughts together as efficiently and as comprehensively without the use of commas, for one thing, and their absence impels the reader through the narrative in precisely the right way for a calamity-on-rails like this story. I didn't give the book five stars because of some aspects I don't want to spoil except to say that I didn't feel as fulfilled as I might have, and also I'd have preferred a little bit more heft to the main characters, who sometimes seem more to be driven by quirks and affects than personality differences. All-in-all, I'd recommend this book but at least partly because it shares its place in the pantheon with so few rivals."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I may be completely missing the point of this novel, but I found it to be completely devoid of any coherent observations of any culture or &quot;counter-culture&quot; or, for that matter, anything beyond the method the protagonists used to get high on each different page. I might have been able to give this book a higher rating, despite its lack of commentary, social or otherwise, were it not for the fact that plot dragged along slowly, causing me to wonder if it would ever end... Perhaps this novel would have been better off at the novella length, perhaps not.

The proliferation of American slang and jargon made the book a difficult read for me. There are nevertheless tracts in there which I truly enjoyed - like the disastrous incident with the young middle class couple who wanted to experiment to experience the real thing - very much a sign of the times which evoked in me an indescribable sense of horror. That the novel is populated exclusively by unsavoury characters is not unexpected or a put off. After all, we're dealing with the underground world of drug traffickers in a hell that has followed us back to America from Vietnam, where you learn who you really are. As I was reading the book, I was thinking to myself, &quot;what a great movie this would make&quot; not realising that it was made into a movie in the late 70s under the title of &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; with Nick Nolte, Tuesday Weld and Michael Moriaty. While I found much of the book tough going and confusing - especially the part with Ray Hicks hallucinating - perhaps seeing the movie will help make the meaning clearer. My feelings towards the book are decidedly mixed. It's an important book.

Seeing Denzil Washington in the recent movie hit \\"American Gangster\\" piqued my curiosity in this novel.American Gangster: And Other Tales of New YorkBesides, I needed a break from constantly reading nonfiction. Reading a novel allows the reader to absorb without constant attention to detail and historical connection.The Way It Wasn't: Great Science Fiction Stories of Alternate HistoryIt is also proven to bring up one's reading speed. Thinking topics such as the Vietnam War, the heroin trade that existed during the Vietnam Conflict and CIA complicity in the trade, I was expecting an exciting yarn. Regrettably, I was disappointed. I found the characters, in particular \\"John Converse and his wife, Marge\\", to be burnt-out losers.You can read other reviews to get an idea of what the plot is about, so without being a \\"plot-spoiler\\", I felt that with all the drugged-out corruptness, the infidelity of the protagonist's wife, the illogical decisions made by people bent on profiting by the sale of heroin, this book was a waste of time to read. In trying to get any connection to reality, there was the part early in the story where \\"Converse\\", the protagonist, justifies smuggling a couple of kilos from Vietnam into the U.S. by what follows.Things That Make No SenseStone wrote:\\"The last moral objection (to smuggling heroin) that Converse experienced in the traditional manner had been his reaction to the Great Elephant Zap of the previous year.The Land of a Million ElephantsThat winter, the Military Advisory Command, Vietnam, had decided that elephants were enemy agents because the NVA used them to carry things, and there ensued a scene worthy of the Ramayana. Many-armed, hundred-headed MACV had sent forth steel-bodied flying insects (helicopter gun ships) to destroy his enemies, the elephants.All over the country, whooping sweating gunners descended from the cloud cover to stampede the herds and mow them down with 7.62 millimeter machine guns. The Great Elephant Zap had been too much and had disgusted everyone. Even the chopper crews who remembered the day as one of insane exhilaration had been somewhat appalled. There was a feeling that there were limits.The Politics of Heroin in South East AsiaAnd as for dope, Converse thought, and addicts-if the world is going to contain elephants pursued by flying men, people are just naturally going to want to get high. So there, Converse thought, that's the way it's done. He had confronted a moral objection and overridden it\\". Obviously, this twisted analogy to justify selling heroin made as little sense to me as the end of the story (what happens to the heroin and the people smuggling it).The Elephant and the Tiger: The Full Story of the Vietnam WarFor me, I need a story that has a semblance of logic, reality and historical connectedness, an attribute I felt \\"Dog Soldiers\\" lacked.Sorry to any of you that really liked this book, as I know I am going to catch some slack for this critique. Opinions about books are like songs, everybody has their own opinion, and there is no right or wrong answer.Cherries : A Vietnam War NovelPersonally, I seek in a novel some type of subjective historical tie in that I can use as a framework to relate to. Many veterans of the Vietnam War have written about their tours, using a fictional backdrop to explain their experience.Internal ConflictsThis assists them in translating their adventure from almost 40 years ago into a fluid, dynamic story, with fictional usage of a storyline to fill in their gaps of memory. A few examples of this are John Podlaski's \\"Cherries,\\" where through fiction he was able to explain what it felt to be an 18 year old, fresh out of high school, transported 8,429 miles away to rice paddies, jungles and mountain tops.All For NothingOnce in Vietnam, he described what it was like to be shot at by an enemy he knew nothing about nor had any reason to hate. Flint Whitlock's \\"Internal Conflicts\\" actually describes the author's experience in life, using the storyline to vicariously represent his ordeal. Another excellent example, albeit lengthy, is Clair Raney's \\"All For Nothing.\\" Both books are winners, true \\"page turners\\" hard to put down until finished. Regardless, it is simply my opinion."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"Drugs and corruption are the themes of this novel by Robert Stone. In a disjointed way, Stone shares his feelings during the time of the Vietnam War. He tells a story of a journalist, a strung out wife, and a dealer. There is not a single person in this book who is &quot;normal&quot; -all of the characters are addicted to drugs. The writing is so real and descriptive that I felt like I really was living with Converse, Marge and Hicks. The bad part was that their lives were so out of it! There is a great deal of profanity in this book, which sometimes gets in the way. The book is very complicated because there are so many characters and each character is different.

Now that I have finished the book and have thought about it,I feel that Robert Stone meant to shock people with a story filled with corrupted characters to show hoe life in the counter culture of the 1970's was. The characters are so realalistic it makes the reader almost sick to hear their story. Another feature of this novel that I feel makes it good is after you get into it you don't want to put it down.

It won the National Book Award in 1973. The characters are so realistic and involve themselves in what people have the ability to do in extreme situations or when opportunities arise to gain wealth or power and no negative consequences seem imminent. The book is very believable because the characters resort to drugs and illegal activity when the chips are down. That's how a lot of people in society deal with problems; either drugs or alcohol. It's usually the people who don't fit the typical mold, like Converse. He's just a simple, tabloid reporter. The fact that the book seems to jump around in setting constantly keeps the reader immersed in the story and wanting to know where the next page will lead them. I felt that the book contained too many characters and each character's purpose and importance were sometimes unclear. The sex scenes and drug use were too many and too detailed for me. I would recommend this book to an older audience due to the drugs/sex. It will inform younger adults of the dark side of the 70's/Vietnam lifestyle or serve as a trip in time for readers who actually experienced it."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"If you came of age in the late 60's and early 70s (as I did) and found yourself at the center of the counterculture (in my case, Madison, Wisconsin), you'll recognize all of the characters who people this extraordinary story. In no book I've read are they rendered with such precision and invested with such uncanny life. Charmian, the heroine dealer, is the most sensuous femme fatale in American Literature. There's Danskin, the hippie narc, turned by the feds to surveil the counterculture -- a far more convincing psychopath than Hannibel Lecter. There's Smitty, the jailbird 'muscle', for Antheil, the 'bent' DEA agent. There's Converse's own mother, nursing home-bound and lost in paranoid dementia -- and my personal favorite, Eddie Peace, the wheeler-dealer who supplies drugs to the Hollywood film community. And these are only the supporting cast. Converse, Hicks and Marge are the richest, deepest, most dimensional protagonists in recent fiction. The story is at once twisting, turning action-adventure (it was made into the wonderful movie, 'Who'll Stop The Rain,' with Nick Nolte, Tuesday Weld and Michael Moriarty, all perfectly cast) as well as a dark parable of the Manson-flavored decline of the Woodstock Generation. Briefly, John Converse, a playwright, has decided to escape a degrading job (he writes for his father-in-law's skin magazines ('Woman Impaled by Falling Skydiver!')) and failing marriage and becomes a freelance journalist in Vietnam. As his tour draws to a close, he has a brainstorm: Buy two kilos of pure, Golden Triangle heroine, smuggle it back into the US and reap the enormous profits. For the smuggling, he calls on old friend Ray Hicks, a merchant marine who's a student of Nietsche and Zen, and 'cultivates the art of self-defense.' Hicks agrees to carry John's skag when the USS Coral Sea departs Vietnam for San Francisco. Trouble is, Charmian's tipped off Antheil, the crooked DEA agent, and he (in the persons of Danskin and Smitty) are waiting for Hicks when he delivers the heroin to Converse's wife, Marge. A page-turning chase ensues that takes Marge and Hicks into the dark netherworld of the Los Angeles drug scene (circa 1970) and ends at a New Mexico commune very like Ken Kesey's own psychedelic ranch. (Stone was one of the drivers on Kesey's bus, 'Further.' Imagine, Ken Kesey, Robert Stone and various Beat poets (Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, et al.) on the same bus! An astonishing time and place!) I can't overstate the excellence of this masterpiece. More than any since Conrad's and Hemingway's (writers Stone's often compared to) this novel confirms that classic quality and rivetting story are not mutually exclusive categories. His two subsequent novels, 'A Flag For Sunrise' and 'Children of Light' are both excellent -- as was his first novel, 'Hall of Mirrors.' ('Flag' may be as good as 'Dog Soldiers.') If you found his last two novels, 'Outerbridge Reach' and 'Damascus Gate,' a bit slow-going and overly 'philosophical,' be advised that early Robert Stone had a much better balance between story and theme.Also recommended: The 13th Valley by John M.

The novel was assigned as a high school project in Iowa, and the kids who had to read it seem to have flocked en masse online (perhaps part of the project) to review it. I found reading these reviews very entertaining, and recommend the experience to anyone, though it won't tell you much about the book. I like kids, what can I say. Now that that's out of the way, Stone is one of the most important (and most strangely neglected) writers of the 20th Century. I think comparisons with Hemingway and Conrad are a bit off the mark; this novel is far more reminiscent of COMEDIANS-era Graham Greene, in his troubled Catholicism and concern for the decline of religion in the 20th Century. While Stone is hardly interested in promulgating any particular religious point of view, he IS a moralist, and a scathing critic of what we've become without a sense of God. This novel can be read, I think, as a crucifixion myth of sorts, made relevant to the 20th Century. It IS dark, but it's brilliantly paced and written, and a fairly accurate look at the time it deals with. Stone, by the way, talks of a recurring dream he has, where he's bringing drugs or contraband into a country, usually on a ship, and knows that he is about to be caught. This motif informs the paranoid tenor of the novel. A final point: the title has nothing to do with Lakota warrior societies, and is a bit of a misappropriation. It appears to be a reference to the proverb &quot;better a living dog than a dead lion,&quot; which Converse muses on in the text.

I had never read any of Stone's work before, and I was absolutely blown away by this, his second novel and winner of the National Book Award. The story of drug smugglers in the waning days of Vietnam, the novel owes much to American Naturalism (Stone has been compared to Conrad, but I think Jack London and Stephen Crane are closer), but filtered through the post-war sensibility of Ken Kesey or even Hunter S. Thomson. Fast-paced and utterly plausible, the narrative ranges from the shadowy cafes of war-time Hanoi to the lawless valleys of the American southwest. Throughout, Stone describes the varying landscapes of moral corruption with equal vividness and intelligence. For my money, \\"Dog Soldiers\\" is the best novel of the 70s, and yet it still seems completely contemporary today. I re-read it every few years and always discover something new."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I got a BIG kick out of this book which, I suppose, is indeed intended to be social commentary of some kind. Whether you buy into that angle or not it's an engrossing thriller about a lost generation, a group of people drifting completely without any moral anchor and the inevitable results. Although vaguely anti- establishment in tone the story is really deeply anti- counterculture! Definitely nihilistic, which is not for everyone!"},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I read this years ago, and saw the movie adaptation, 'Who'll Stop The Rain', and found Stone's take on the questions to what our involvement in southeast asia was and the crippling results of that amoral action hard edged and totally embodied by the pathetic denizens of this novel. From Hicks' stance as a lost samurai to Converse's justification to sell dope and make money it's only natural all who they come in contact with suffer from some delusion or another of what is 'right' . There are no good guys in this book. This was a pretty delusional era and the symbolism of dope as gold as cure all to be lost in the dust of the desert with leisure suited thieves works as a beautiful ending. A hard book to put down, especially for anyone who lived through this time and like Hicks, has a decent sense of irony."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I read this novel after Richard Ford mentioned that Robert Stone was one of his favorite authors, someone who in his mind best deserves the accolade of \\"getting Vietnam right.\\" Or at least, I thought he said something like that.Stone is again pretty famous because he has come out with a memoir of his time in the counterculture -- Prime Green -- and that certainly colored my time with this novel.Stone offers a lot of story in this novel. This is no aching reflection. It is not about peering through drawn shades on to a street in Vietnam, like Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. It is a thrill ride of a drug deal gone horribly wrong.I suppose that desperation opens well into the moral ambiguities where these characters live. In each of the three main characters -- Ray Hicks, John Converse, and Marge Converse -- their lives have taken a break from normalcy. In Vietnam, Converse runs with a crowd of two faced brothel owners and press corps types. Back in the states, its more of the same: everyone is grifting -- from the police officers to the hippie commune leaders.My favorite part of this book was the description of the odd stories that Converse wrote while working for his father in law at a second rate tabloid newspaper. \\"Hungry Skydiver Eats Woman,\\" was a title, I think: that makes sense, in a way, because before he was famous, Stone made a living covering wrestling for local newspapers.I am glad I read this book. It seems like it was an important story when it came out. I feel glad to have stumbled upon it. I thought I was going to get something historical, and it turned out to be a yarn and a half."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"This is as true a take on the corrupting effect of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam as you will find. It is a world in which most people are torn from their moral and ethical moorings. Like Converse, one-third of an unholy triangle that includes his wife, Marge, and his best friend, Ray Hicks. The book is a chronicle of how Ray sticks to his moral code, as the rest of the world goes haywire around him. It's left to the reader to decide who is crazier--Ray or the world he lives in. This book is an essential part of the American experience. If you were of draft age during Vietnam, reading this will confirm for you the craziness of the times.

Yet, overall, this wasn't a novel that offered me anything new."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"Now not the topic of everyday America, discussion about drug smuggling army-enterprising souls involved in our escalating use of heroin were commonplace to those who lived in the 1960's. It was not a coincidence that the Viet Nam War and heroin occurred hand-in-hand, just like it was no coincidence that the following decade was a war on South America and cocaine became prevalent.Viet Nam, and the people involved in the same, were often thought of as not bright or insane events of our 1960's (which carried into this book's 1970's while the counterculture's movement tried to pry the military out of Asia). Revolution abounded by those opposing the same and the generation gap became the cry of the leaders of that revolution - don't trust anyone over 40. But, the main character of this book, John Converse, volunteers to go to Viet Nam for professional purposes - find the great American novel - and risk life and limb for the story. He leaves his wife, the mother of his infant daughter, to be alone. And, then to make matters worse, he and his wife, Marge, horribly botch an attempt to smuggle drugs into the United States from Viet Nam. And, off on the races they go after people are chasing them for the drugs almost as soon as they arrive at the port.In this book, we learn not to trust anyone involved in the smuggling of drugs - even the cops who enforce the laws preventing the same. Corruption abounds, mainly by those over 30, and the hard knock stories we read of the main characters are comparable tot he cartoon characters of Evanovich, Hiaasen, Hess and others. Filled with remorse and dulled spirits, this book touches upon sexual depravity (Marge works in a porn theater, and does one need discuss Viet Nam's issues?) parallels parts of Stone's contemporary - Joan Didion (thinkPlay It As It Lays). And, like Didion's work - the female protagonist is pessimistic about everything about her, to a point where life has no meaning whatsoever.But pessimism in the 1960's was not a monopoly to this author or Didion - it was a cottage industry for bundles of authors. And, those novels often delved with an escape from the depression - remember this occurred before the days of antidepressants as advertised on today's television. For many, maybe even most, escapism was mandatory. In this book, the method of escape includes heroin, psylocybin, LSD and marijuana. Nothing extraordinary for the time of the 1960's.The dialogue of this book is rich with 1960's patois. It touches upon topics which American television today harbors on. It runs us on chases rivaling mystery novels. It is a fun read."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"Dog Soldiers is one of the most intense chase novels ever written.

In any case, I was disappointed: I'm not sure how novel this was when it appeared in the 70s, but many of its scenes have become standard cliches of the movies - the torture scene, the bags of drugs, the shootouts in precarious and picturesque locations.Perhaps it isn't fair to criticize a book for how much it's been imititated, but a genuine work of art shouldn't lose much of its lustre just because of mediocre followers, and I found myself genuinely bored by a great deal of Dog Soldiers. The only scene that showed the talent of the author was the surreal conversation between the central character and his slightly crazy mother.

This is the place where everybody finds out who they are.&quot; -ConverseDog Soldiers is a story laced with despair, paranoia, and several other not so fuzzy moods, and this quote from the main character elegantly demonstrates this mood. The tone of the book was a point of interest and displeasure for me, since this was one of my first experiences with total negativity, it was a fun struggle for me to understand the point or the necessity of such an angry mood. At the same time it made me very uncomfortable, sometimes to the point where I would have to stop reading for the day.There is a constant stream of action in this story, which makes it rather difficult to process what's going on as it happens. The story rarely drags and it is written so that it feels very real and alive. Slang terms are used often too, which are also hard to understand. But after the first few chapters it seems that most readers are able to get around this and start enjoying the fast paced style in which the book is written. This style also adds to the mood of panic and paranoia that encompass the entire book as Marge, Hicks, and Converse try to flee with their dope.Marge, Hicks, and Converse are the book's three main characters, and as the plot follows first Converse's activities and then moves back and forth between Hicks and Converse, these two main characters develop into very complicated people. Marge's character isn't delved into as much, but it didn't seem to be that she was usually thinking about much besides the next time she could get high. Some of the things Converse and Hicks did or said still baffle me, just like the characters that are a part of my real life. Because all of the characters are so weak and hurt each other with such frequency and carelessness, I found it hard to like them, but I liked the fact that not many stories center on people of such violent natures.I had to read Dog Soldiers for a class, and I'm not sure if I would ever seek out a book of such violent and depressing extremity on my own reading schedule, or even be able to get all the way through it without someone else pushing me along.

After reading the Biography.com description of Robert Stone and his &quot;carefully crafted&quot; books, I decided to give it a try.For the most part, the book lived up to my expectations. It is indeed very exciting and pessimistic, but I did have trouble with some parts. One of the characters actively practices Zen at great length, but I didn't know much about that subject so much of that character was difficult to understand. Also, much of the discussion of drugs is written in a vernacular I'm not very familiar with, so a great deal of that was also difficult to understand. Aside from these shortcomings (which I know were largely my own), I would give the book five stars."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"In fact, I forged through most of it just to be sure how much I hated it.

You may even consider it truthful, a confirmation of your worst imaginings. The drug-crazed America it portrays is rotten, morally and psychologically, at all levels, from the command center of the CIA to the candy sellers at the porno theaters on Market Street.

The writing does have moments of craft, patches of well-observed detail, but it's soooo exaggerated! It tries too hard. It piles the \\"authentic\\" military and drug-traffic jargon too deep, up to your nostrils. With its precious allusions to Nietzsche and Joyce, it wallows in \\"hipper-than-thou\\" pretentiousness. And it's cluttered! Too many uglies with too clever nicknames! Even so, if any of the chief characters were plausible human beings, one might care about their outcomes. They weren't and I didn't."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I felt that this book was an in-depth look on the crime and corruption in America in the 1970's during the Vietnam War. This book was about a drug deal gone very wrong because the main character, John Converse, was very inexperienced and wanted to deal drugs for the thrill of it. He gets a friend, Ray Hicks, who is in love with Converse's wife, to transport the three kilos of heroine from Vietnam to the US where Converse's wife, Marge, is supposed to take care of it. Unfortunately, the woman Converse was having an affair with and who he got the heroine from, Charmian, tipped off a CIA agent, Antheil. That led to Ray Hicks and Marge running away to New Mexico where Ray Hicks' insanity starts appearing as he gets very possessive over the heroine. All the characters and continuous switching of points of views from Converse to Ray and Marge made this book a little hard to understand at times. The explicit sex scene seemed a little unnecessary as did some of the &quot;getting high&quot; scenes in the book but overall, I think the author, Robert Stone, did a good job of representing the underground workings of the U.S. during the Vietnam war in the 1970's. He did an extremely good job with the dialogue when the characters were high. I could really get involved in what was going on because I felt as if everything was really happening. Dieter, a friend of Ray Hicks, said a quote in the book that I really liked. I think it really sums up what these people in the book were feeling. &quot;There's such a thing as personal necessity. Maybe it's beyond moral areas.&quot; These people were doing anything and everything to get money from the heroine and it shows how evil people could really be."},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","review":"I read about this book on Jorn Barger's website, in the section in which he recommends books. This book is on a par with Conrad and Hemingway. Intensity of mood meshes with character development and descriptions of people, actions, places, weather on a particular day, crowds in different countries, literary allusions. There are a few pages on which a little jargon is used: most English-speakers who grew up in an English-speaking country and don't live in a cave will \\"get\\" them. A few were even over my head, and I'm not only a native English speaker but a native Californian, who grew up in the 70s drug culture, so I should get all of them (there are about three or four things I didn't understand). But even if you don't know what place June is referring to when she says \\"P.V\\" (it's Puerto Vallarta), these few phrases shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of one of the greatest American novels. IMnotatallHO, this book beats anything I have read by David Foster Wallace, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Don DeLillo, or anyone in the McSweeney's crowd.DON'T TAKE HEED OF ANY REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK WRITTEN BY DISGRUNTLED IOWAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW OF IT FOR A CLASS.[Oh yeah: why I gave it one star: I like to give my reviews one star, because then discerning people will read them.

Very funny, very light and just a little bit gritty to give it spice."},{"Title":"Meet The Hormones","review":"This book is very funny and very quick to read. It is a comedy done from the perspective of people's hormones, who represent our conflicting impulses and baser thoughts. The humans are totally clueless and stumble through a life of bad relationships and bad jobs, while the hormones do their level best to make life even more problematic. I loved it.

All the ends are tied here as you finally get to see Morgan Hasek-Davion in action. One of the great things of these books is the minor characters that get good face time. The likes of Andy Redburn throughout the series gives the reader a feel for the men in the trenches while still able to give the overall political view from the Successor Lords. The end of the 4th Succession War is an excellent read and is very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Battletech 41: Warrior Coupe","review":"it got here fast and was in mint condition what more can you ask for...it was cheap too"},{"Title":"Battletech 41: Warrior Coupe","review":"This book ties up the ends of the 4th succession war, Quintus Allard (Kai Allard Liao's father) triumphant return to Federated Suns and more. In my opinion, this series is better than the Kerensky series because the plots are better. There is no shortage of action with scenes from Morgan Kell vs Yorinaga Kurita (founder of Genyosha Regiments), Andrew Redburn (now a battalion commander in 1st Kathil Uhlans) during 4th succession war, the traitor Michael Hasek-Davion (Morgan Hasek's father). I was particularly moved by the sacrificial action of Patrick Kell in saving Melissa Steiner. This series is a must read for all Battletech funs.

They make the decision making process of a new parent even harder. This book has a reasoned, less combative tone. It presents opinions as well as information from both side of the debate. I found it educational and helpful."},{"Title":"Vaccination: The Issue of Our Times","review":"I recommend this book to every parent and parent to be as well as health care professionals, especially pediatricians. It is an eye opener about the issue of vaccinations. The presentation of the issue is very well rounded.

Hope that wasn't too confusing?! In other words, we not only have upside down pages but we are missing 20 pages!! This is a MAJOR error from either the publisher or the printer. So, we will have to hold off final judgement of this book until amazon ships us a new copy that actually has the missing 20 pages in it!"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Secrets of the Martial Arts)","review":"This book provides the reader with a very good taste of Grandmaster Giron's system of self-defense. It is particularily strong in the largo-mano or long range area, with clearly photographed techniques using sticks, knives and empty hands. In addition to the techniques, he puts his system into an ethical framework. The only part I would have liked to see more of was the excellent empty hands techniques present in the Filipino martial arts, including guntings and limb destructions. Nonetheless, this will make an excellent addition to anybody's library with interest in the subject matter."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Secrets of the Martial Arts)","review":"I\`ve bougth this book in order to support my own escrima training. As a rookie in escrima, it gives you the basic understandings in the escrima-fighting art of Grand Master Leo Giron. I think it\`s not written with the intention to replace training under a qualified teacher. In my view it supports your training as a beginner in the art. What's more, it gives you a good overview including the origins. Escrima has to be practised to be learned."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Secrets of the Martial Arts)","review":"this book gives us a look at the late grandmaster leo giron. this great man and founder of the bahala-na system was one of the last of the true warriors of his tried and battlefield tested art.this is a valuble edition to any martial arts library."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Secrets of the Martial Arts)","review":"Grandmaster Leo Giron is one of a handful of key figures in the history of Filipino Martial Arts in America and this book preserves a snapshot of his teaching style and philosophy along with a visual record of how Giron himself performed fundamental techniques in his system. You will not learn Giron Arnis Escrima from this book alone, but I've found dozens of little bits of information in here that supplement the training I receive in my FMA class.This book is most valuable to the student or interested observer who wants to find out more about how a Master's philosophy of life colors his martial arts practice. This is bare-bones information -- less about 'secrets' as things that the master tries to hide from the public and more about 'secrets' that are subtle elements of the art that one only gets from observing someone who has achieved Giron's level of quiet competence in any situation. It's also one of the only records we have of this grandmaster's method and emphasis in his practice studio that was done while Leo Giron was still alive and teaching. It captures something that would otherwise be lost as his teaching is passed on and evolves from teacher to student.Somera is a competent and functional writer and the book is laid out in a logical manner. The photos don't show all that is going on in the techniques, but they do capture the most critical elements and are enough for a student to piece the techniques together with just a bit of qualified training and a patient and willing training partner.If you are interested in an engagingly written history of FMA in general then you would probably do better with one of Mark Wiley's books likeFilipino Martial Culture (Martial Culture Series). If you are more interested in Leo Giron's life and how his combat experience in the Philipines during WWII helped to shape his art or details about the birth of American FMA in Stockton, CA during the '60s then you would be more interested in Somera's other bookGiron Escrima: Memories of a Bladed Warrior, which covers Giron's life story in more depth and also talks about the cultural environment that led people like Giron and Cabales and LaCoste to open their schools. But none of these books offer a no-nonsense record of Giron's legacy of instruction the way that this book does."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Secrets of the Martial Arts)","review":"I really liked this book. I know it was not as deep in technique and theory as many would have liked, but for the price it is a great introduction. I would like to see a more in-depth version, akin to Jun Fan/Jeet Kune Do the text book, or something as nice as either of the new Gracie Books. I am still waiting for the Filipino book that gives real grasp to the newbie, but still has a lot for the experienced player. In short I am looking for some thing with the thought and grace of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Theory and PRactice, or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Self-Defense, or maybe a book as comprehensive in its coverage as is Simco's Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: The Master Text.Never the less it is still good to see old Giron, moving around and swinging a stick.Nice job."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Secrets of the Martial Arts)","review":"This book is bad for beginner and practically useless for a master. There is no comprehensive description of training complexes, footwork drills and other important details, which were completely omitted.

I always look at it from a lay-person's perspective, as someone who has to learn to use Unix because that is the only operating system available to use.This is a handy referene book, if you have a basic knowledge of Unix, and are comfortable with using the OS. Sometimes, the explanations tend to be a bit lengthy, and that is something you will find in almost all Unix-related books.

With this book, the author really turns her pen into a paintbrush. \\"We sat together staring contemplatively at the startled looking sea wavelets racing before the fresh breeze, at the clean carved shapes of the Islands; at the gently blue sky strewn with clouds that looked as soft and inviting as white fur rugs; at mists lit with rainbows and mountains silvered with sunlight.\\" The visuals of the scenery are quite simply breathtaking, as are the wonderful characters that just spring from the pages. With gentleness and a great deal of humor, the idiosyncrasies of the villagers are delivered in a forthright, but never condescending manner. The hygiene of this time and place will make a modern mama's blood run cold (and probably the postman's too) and the brutal work load will make you grateful for our modern conveniences. I predict you will love the charming journey into another place and time - but probably be glad you are traveling via armchair. While this book stands on its own, I am glad I read it after the other three Bruach books: The Hills is Lonely, The Sea for Breakfast and The Loud Halo. The book also contains a delightful little list of Gaellic translations and pronunciations. --Silly Old Cailleach Mamalinda"},{"Title":"Bruach Blend","review":"I only wish that Lillian Beckwith had had the stamina of Barbara Cartland and written a thousand novels instead of the small number that she did publish. I love, love, love all the Bruach stories, and Bruach Blend is no exception. I wish I could have experienced the islands of Skye and Soay (\\"Bruach\\") as she did, instead of just through her eyes. This book is a collection of episodes spanning all the seasons, loosely connected, but not in the least disjointed. The characters are deeply flawed and totally lovable because of that. The landscapes are always stunning. Much as I love Miss Beckwith's summer walks over hills and dales, those stormy days where she retreats into her white cottage and stokes up the fire inviting various locals to come and \\"ceilidh\\" are my favourite times.

The introduction is basically a reflection of how the author, who had previously been a quantitative scientist, felt that there was something missing in the information provided by this research and turned to ethnography and more qualitative research. I believe that this book is proof positive of the limitations of a purely quantitative approach and the valuable information that qualitative research can provide.Chapter one is a fascinating description of what Jackson encounters when he becomes imbedded in schools to really understand one of the major forces that shapes a culture's habitus (its beliefs, attitudes and dispositions). Jackson doesn't explicitly state this but he strongly suggests it. Essentially, what he finds is what he calls the \\"Daily Grind\\" or a tedious system of rules and regulations that are designed to promote passive consumption, obedience and acquiescence to\\" delayed gratification\\", or simply no gratification at all. Jackson compares schools to prisons, mental institutions and factories. I take his analysis a little further and find his very close to Foucault's interpretation of Bentham's Panopticon. The Panopticon for Bentham was a prison building where all behaviors could be observed. Foucault argued that once a system of rules and laws became part of people's habitus, the system would become its own Panopticon where self monitoring would occur to preserve the system's equilibrium. Of course my interpretation is tainted both by my own dislike for schools and by my personal ideology.Jackson argues that the daily grind is essentially the hidden curriculum of schools that could be preparing students for the tedious life in industrialized society. A disconcerting statement by Jackson is that adults would not tolerate what children are made to tolerate in schools. I found this strange since he argues that the school is preparation for adults to tolerate just this, and in fact, millions of children and adults all over the world tolerate these circumstances in factories and industrialized agricultural settings.I found chapters 2 and 3 of this book to be informative but the least interesting. These chapters offer a summary of results from previous research regarding how children felt about schools, how attitudes related to school performance, how the teachers perceived their attitudes, how attentive/inattentive students behaved and how their teachers felt about attention/inattention. Findings showed that the majority of children fell into two categories of children who either liked or disliked school, but neither group had overwhelming emotions. Rather, they seemed to find schools either acceptable or rather tedious. Surprisingly, the vast majority were content with schools despite of what Jackson describes in chapter one. Yet, half of students found several things that bothered them. However, very few students really loved school or could not stand it. The conclusion drawn by Jackson is that attitudes towards school cannot be dichotomized between like vs. dislike or happy vs. unhappy. Rather, a whole range of emotions are elicited by school life. The other interesting finding was that there was no obvious relationship between attitude towards school and performance. The obvious assumption that high performing students would like schools and low performing ones would not did not match assessment results. Finally, teachers were not necessary able to sense students' attitudes about school even though their predictions were better than chance. They, in fact were better at sensing low performing boys who really disliked school, but were not able to discern high performing girls who disliked school. I should note that the research predates 1968, so these chapters only offer a historical window.Chapter four offers a glimpse at how teachers felt about their practice. Teachers considered to be the best performing by their administrators were selected for extensive interviewing and what they revealed was very interesting, and the exact opposite to present expectations. They all felt passion for what they did. They all liked to be in control of their classrooms and of what they taught and they hated to be given specific tasks, textbooks or plans that they had to follow. They wanted to have the freedom to choose what, when and how to teach. They hated to be monitored or observed and considered this a violation of their profession. They were not concerned about standardized tests since they felt that those assessments did not treat students as individuals with differences. For the teachers, appreciating differences and tailoring their approaches to the various children was important. Their satisfaction came from the feeling that they were helping or making a difference in, at least a few children. The teachers could not explain what, exactly it was that they did that made them so successful, and Jackson alludes to the intangible art of teaching. Of course this chapter is totally dated since all the things that teachers claimed to value have been slowly eroded since the 80s and eventually eliminated with NCLB.Chapter five is dated since it contrasts teachers' attitudes towards educational theory and the behavioral management models emerging then, which would eventually take over the schools. What is interesting is what Jackson describes as a very anti-intellectual attitude from teachers towards their practice which happens to continue today. I believe that this anti-intellectual attitude have left teachers out of the discussions about schools reform.Overall, this is a great book and very easy to read, but with profound content. This is a must read for educators and education students at all levels."},{"Title":"Life in classrooms","review":"I was first introduced to Jackson's work while getting my M.A. in Elementary Education at New York Univeristy. After my first exposure to sections of this book, I went out and bought it. Life In Classrooms focuses on the aspects of school that are not given enough attention in education theory and debates. This book provides anaylsis of the 'everyday' curriculum. The most important concepts expounded upon are the fuctions and repercussions of crowds, praise and power that seem inherent in every school system in America. This is a brilliant book!"},{"Title":"Life in classrooms","review":"The first chapter, as well as the introduction to the 2nd edition, are essential, essential reading for any educational researcher. In the introduction, Jackson describes his journey from quantitative researcher trained in educational psychology, whose research involved mainly statistical analysis of children's test scores, to a qualitative ethnographer of classroom culture. Anthropologists will find gratifying Jackson's account of how he discovered the ethnographic approach and how it totally changed his views on educational research. It's a very personal and vivid account of how intellectual stagnation was transformed to intellectual excitement, and one of the best cases I know for the value of qualitative research.Chapter 1 an excellent introduction for students (graduate or undergraduate) learning to view schooling as a set of cultural processes. Jackson does a great job of \\"making the familiar strange\\" and revealing the underlying, taken-for-granted conditions that shape so much of school life. Although schools have undergone a lot of changes since 1968 when this groundbreaking work was first published, these fundamental processes have not changed much, and in some ways have become even more rigid. Jackson's work brings to light how the basic structural conditions of schooling continue to shape the environment in which children spend half their waking hours, despite numerous \\"reforms.\\"After having taught the whole book, I now assign only the Intro & Ch. 1. The other chapters (as other reviewers have noted) are rather tedious analyses of data that support the points made in the first 50 pages. But those first 50 pages are gold."},{"Title":"Life in classrooms","review":"The book somehow seems to take on a somewhat historical context along the lines of social learning as a result of the date it was written. But despite the age of the book, I feel somewhat ambiguous about it; meaning I did not like nor did I really dislike the book. Some of the material was so dated that I really felt bored at times. But there were other instances when I thought that school really has not changed much which is really dismal. The main idea of the book is a term used to describe the social rules and expectations of behavior though unwritten that we all seem to know called hidden curriculum.Nevertheless, strengths of the reading include Jackson's ideas and manifestations of the hidden curriculum present in the classroom in the 1950s and 60s which are still present today. I did enjoy Jackson's vivid descriptions of the classrooms and its students during the first chapter, but after that he lost me (boring!) One instance that caught my attention was his description of the emergence of Freudian psychology where the interest of investigations were more in depth as student's motives were given more attention than student's manners. Of special interest to me was the section on a series of studies by Benjamin Bloom (yes that guy). It was interesting because most of us are taught the importance of Bloom's Taxonomy as teacher education students. Bloom compared the thought processes of undergraduates during lectures where he found at least 1/3 were deemed \\"psychologically absent\\".The book's weaknesses really begin after the first chapter with long, drawn out explanations of case and research studies with their conclusions not really definitive of anything significant other than girls pay more attention in class than boys, not surprising for the 1950s and 60s when it was not socially acceptable for females to speak out or state their opinion. In the fourth chapter, I did note that most of the teachers who were considered ineffective were women and the more effective teachers were men, attitudes which were also definitely indicative of the time period and also certainly continue today.In short, one could conclude that the message of the book relates to research indicating that a positive attitude results in success in school. The numerous messages of hidden curriculum delivered somewhat indirectly usually deal with attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors which ultimately can cause a student to psychologically withdraw from the classroom. As an educator, the most significant importance of the hidden curriculum is that it directs attention to certain aspects of schools that have never really been acknowledged. For the most part, these aspects continue to be in dire need of further investigation. The hidden curriculum ideas indirectly articulated by the school community can encourage or discourage students to be successful learners. This book is a boring, but necessary read."},{"Title":"Life in classrooms","review":"Jackson's \\"Life In Classrooms\\" seems to key off the acknowledgement of a teacher, or someone who is fairly familiar with the happenings of an educator's classroom. Interestingly, the new \\"reissued\\" version of the text presents the worthwhile introduction of an ethnographer who discloses how he found himself threaded into the environments of a classroom. Ironically, the introduction is also amongst one my favorite parts of the book. It was here where I discovered that Jackson wasn't simply aiming his scientific rhetoric at the vulnerable target of education. In fact, with regards to his previous ethnographic duties, he implies slight humor when describing them as \\"boring.\\" In essence, that initial slanted unintended deception between the teacher and the ethnographer is disregarded due to his honest, raw like narration.In his initial chapter as an outsider looking in, Jackson's semi-scientific observations of teachers, students, and schools were defined via comparisons with societal or indirect, non-academic institutions. Such comparisons portray a gloomy, philosophical parallelism of schooling where individual desires are restrained and teachers play prison guards in jail-like buildings. Yet, whereas the initial chapter stimulates heartfelt recognitions of public schooling, the following two chapters were fairly repetitive or scaffolding-ly \\"common\\" to maintain the same interest. Here, Jackson presents the numerical results of student surveys showing how they felt about school and their teachers. Regardless, initial descriptions and results of children's interest in schools did garner my curiosity where despite the text's context of the late 1960's, I found some similarities in modern schooling.Also, the next chapter portrays a specified glimpse into the minds of recognized teachers and their perspectives about teaching. Without disclosing any previews about the text, I will simply acknowledge how observing other teachers views of curriculum and instruction is encouragingly motivating. Through their interviews, readers, particularly educators, may identify and make connections amidst similar philosophies, including the school culture, environment, testing, and assessment.Of course, the book is a classic, and perhaps specific sections seem outdated, as noted in the last chapter. This section delineates the connection between learning theory and educational practice as well as areas that position teachers as being possibly ignorant and detached from scholarly educational theory. Consequently, many of the perspectives in this chapter have at present been considered, researched and presented. Regardless, like previous chapter, it helps keep the mind fresh as to the theories and considerations that help drive pedagogical practice.Whereas the book observes \\"Life in the Classrooms\\" from an ethnographic point of view, Jackson's studies imply essences of action and reform that would engage the scholarly researcher, teachers, students and anyone interested in the vigors of the classroom."},{"Title":"Midshipman Lee of the Naval Academy","review":"This book for teens by Robb White (1909-1990) was an affectionate salute to his alma mater, the United States Naval Academy. White graduated from Annapolis in 1931, and he served in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War. Before and after the war he wrote books, magazine stories, and movie and television screenplays.Set in the early 1950s, the novel follows two entering midshipmen through their first two years at the Naval Academy. Courtney Lee has been admitted as the son of a World War II officer posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. His roommate, Cy Brewer, has come to the Academy from the Marine Corps and combat in Korea.Then and now, the Naval Academy combines academics, training, athletics, and the development of character. White's well-constructed plot introduces major features and challenges of an Academy education -- plebe summer, plebe year, memorized knowledge, the honor code, discipline, pressure, summers with the fleet, athletics, boxing, and the gradual replacement of doubt with confidence. The generous use of Academy slang pulls the young reader into the internal culture of the Academy.One feature of modern Academy life that it omits, of course, is women midshipmen. (The first class that included women was admitted more than two decades after the book was published in 1954.) The two midshipmen's dates seem straight from 1950s central casting. And there's no mention of nuclear submarines and vessels and the academic courses that now prepare officers for the nuclear Navy.Even so, White's novel conveys enduring contours of the Naval Academy experience.-30-"},{"Title":"Bob the Snowman (Viking Kestrel picture books)","review":"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. Bob the Snowman was one of her picks.One snowy day the children made Bob out of snow and added a carrot for a nose, a hat, and a broom. He liked being with the children. That night, the children went inside and Bob was lonely. A bird came and talked to Bob about her plans to migrate south for the winter. Bob dreamed about going south, too.The next day, he walked to the train station and hopped into a baggage car. Pretty soon, he started to melt as the train went south. By the time he reached the south, he was just a puddle.But the sunbeams called down to him, and told him to climb up to the sky where he turned into a cloud. A strong wind blew Bob back to the children's neighborhood, where he turned into snowflakes.The children decided to build a new Bob. He was glad to be back, and never wanted to travel again. He had missed the children. And the best part was that the children built a whole snow family so he never had to be lonely again.Even the thought of spring did not bother him. He knew that after they all became puddles, they could climb into a cloud and return the following winter.As you can see, this story has many nice features. It encourages your child to use her or his imagination. What would happen if a snowman went south for the winter?Your child also gets a chance to learn about how snow and clouds are formed, so the book is also an early science lesson.The book also encourages the idea of being with others, whether they are the same (the snow family) or different from you (the children).I also liked the way the book portrayed change as something to be handled rather than as an end. Many children (mine included) worry about what will happen the snowmen they build when the snow melts. This gives the whole concept a happy ending.You can also use this book to launch off on developing a story with your child. For example, what would happen if a flower came north in the winter? You can use the outline of this story to have many good chats. Children love to make up stories with their parents. Having a model makes it easier!While you are enjoying this wonderful book, also think about what other areas your child may be worried about (other than being alone or what will happen to the snowman). You can use this story to learn what some of those concerns are, and to help your child overcome them. Causing unnecessary fears and concerns to evaporate is always a useful thing to do.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lovers and Other Lunatics (Time of Your Life)","review":"I just don't understand (dumb ole me) why this heroine is deemed stupid, because I absolutely loved this book.

I won't say it's totally fabulous because the story seemed a little bit too long, to me.Teresa Phelps was held at gunpoint by this lunatic and was kidnapped. This blue-eyed-British hunk claims that Teresa has an affair with his father. And that he won't let her ruin his parents' 35 years of marriage. So now this British hunk, Charles Everett, is going to follow Teresa around.Charles Everett gave Teresa a bull story because he has another reason to get close to her. It isn't for love, but for a treasure that her dead brother has left behind.While Charles is with Teresa, all sorts of people are attacking her, for the treasure. There are the Hispanics and then there is this evil pig guy. (They held her at knifepoint, ransacked her house, shot her house and some other stuff) And while all this is happening, sexual tension is in the air, between Charles and Teresa. Will they be able to save themselves, find the treasure and still be together after all these series of adventures?I found this story to be kind of a drag, the days were long and somehow or another Teresa is always in this angry mood. But I thought the storyline was funny, though. I'm not sure if I would recommend this though, but if people like a light and easy read with a sense of humor, then maybe this book is for you people out there."},{"Title":"Lovers and Other Lunatics (Time of Your Life)","review":"The book was great fun from start to finish. I loved the characters, even the obnoxious Aunt Hatch. The romance betwen Charles and Teresa was really hot. I thought Teresa was hilarious as an egghead out of her element.

Before I finished rolling my eyes over that stereotype, we have the heroine who was more concerned with rescuing newly-bought towels from a kidnapper's car than getting away from him, and who's first comment to the hero after he runs in in response to her screams - because she had just been awakened from sleep by a masked man in her bedroom who held a gun to her head, gave her a mysterious ultimatum and subsequently jumped out of her window - and she sees that he is just wearing boxers is \\"Ch-Charles, you're indecent...and what are you doing with my cat?\\". This from a woman who is supposedly in her twenties and is intelligent enough to be working on her doctoral dissertation.As I was reading the story, I got the impression that the author was making frequent use of a thesaurus, rather than actually developing the characters. There was once character who was a Hispanic former gang member and current parolee, who was a runaway street kid from the age of 14, who has a thought about somebody \\"boxing his ears\\". Now, do you know anyone who has any type of street creds who has EVER used that phrase? I just didn't find the characters amusing or even, frankly, believable.I finally said enough is enough and put the book in my non-keeper box. I read a previous book by Ms. Riley and found it amusing, which was why I bought this one.

I did not feel stupid when I couldn't predict the heroine's actions; instead, I felt that she was not as intelligent as she is supposed to be. I am a fan of spunky, unpredictable heroines--try Midnight Kisses by Kimberly Raye, High Energy by Dara Joy, almost any book by Jillian Hunter, Julie Garwood or Jill Barnett. They have heroines who are fun (and funny) without compromising their intelligence.In this book, the heroine is working on her doctoral dissertation; however, being told she is smart doesn't do it for me. Ms. Riley should SHOW that she is smart, and frankly, her actions (and reactions) are as dumb as they get.Yes, this book is funny and sexy, two things that I appreciate in books that I read for pleasure.

If you don't have much experience growing plants in containers or otherwise, pots of herbs are a good place to begin. Even if you have limited space, as long as you have plenty of sunlight (a balcony in the blazing sun?) you can grow herbs in pots. If you end up buying your herbs at Whole Foods, you can use the recipes the authors share and put your herbs in the cooking pot.This is a beautiful glossy book with lots of color photos. The authors are folksy and fun to read and they provide text and pictures that explain how you too can grow beautiful pots of herbs and use them in tasty dishes.Chapter one discusses 'Herbal Care' where practical hints are provided for the new herb grower. Take watering for example. Even drought tolerent herbs require watering. On the other hand, depending on the pot of choice, overwatering can cause problems. The authors note the most likely cause of death is not Mother Nature, but Mother Hen overwatering her pots.The second chapter is entitled 'The Cook's Patio' and contains photos of handome lettuces, lacy kale, and Italian parsley, as well as many interesting recipes. One can grow herbs singly or in groups in a single pot. Herbs provide accents for the cooking pot as well as the patio. Gazpacho or Pesto anyone?The later half of the book provides the reader with examples of pot containers, planting designs, and eclectic notions. For example, one might plant herbs in used Twining tea tins or enhance plant containers with odd paraphanalia such as shells and small rocks. The book is visually appealing, and contains some of the most original ideas I've come across in a while.

Most pictures are taken from above, so it is hard to see the containers. Pests and diseases are covered in a short section, but there are not pictures or diagrams to help you with these either. For some herbs they tell you what the herb is but not how to grow it.More practical information is needed. There are lots of pictures, but in many pictures the herbs are not identified.

But I loved it, anyway. Faust is just so cool. This story makes soul-dealing really fashionable (which probably wasn't what Mr Marlowe meant in the first place).

Disgruntled with the ecclesia of the time, he established a retreat society and set down a range of practice techniques which are still taught. He also did his best to address the schism between sutra study and meditation practice.Robert Buswell, himself a practitioner and former monk, renders translations of Chinul's &quot;Secrets On Cultivating the Mind,&quot; &quot;Straight Talk on the True Mind,&quot; and excerpts from Chinul's &quot;Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record with Personal Notes&quot; that are accessible, challenging to the general reader, and - for the practitioner - a long finger pointing us to our own mind.This is not, however, practice-oriented material, so the Zen student looking for encouragement in practice will not find much &quot;dharma candy&quot; here. With Buswell's extensive introduction, the book offers us a history of Buddhism in Korea, a biography and extensive critique of his philosophy and methods, in addition to the translations. This offers some edifying history to a Zen student with a scholarly bent, but with this caveat: these are dead words! They were set down at a certain time as medicine for the kinds of dharma sickness Chinul confronted. Don't let this old medicine become a disease!"},{"Title":"Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen (Classics in East Asian Buddhism)","review":"Born in 1158, Chinul almost single-handedly reformed and re-vitalized Zen in Korea by the time of his death in 1210. An intellectual giant, and deeply enlightened master, Chinul's influence of Buddhism in Korea parallels that of the greatest masters of all time. All of the surviving Korean schools of Zen trace their lineage through this uniquely gifted Zen master.Chinul, is sometimes called the \\"Dogen of Korea\\", and this abridgement of Robert Buswell's masterpiece makes it clear why. Buswell's work offers us more than the usual examination of a Zen master. Provides readers with a thorough account of the history of Buddhism in Korea, as well as an account of Chinul's remarkable life, including detailed examinations of all three major awakenings that shaped the future course of Chinul's teachings.Buswell walks us through a meticulous examination of the Chinul's thought and teaching. From Chinul's exposition and integration of Huayen Buddhism, especially as presented by Tsung-mi, to his understanding of original enlightenment and gradual cultivation, and his view on koan practice, and more.Perhaps the greatest treasure is Buswell's inclusion of translations from Chinul's major works including Secrets on Cultivating the Mind, Straight Talk on the True Mind, Excerpts from the Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record, and more...All the extras of a scholarly work, including an extensive and detailed easy to use index.

The depression and hopelessness that it is centered on is so captivating i found it to be naustolgic. I loved the different points of views we were able to gain insight with by making three narrators instead of just one. What i loved even more is that no matter who was speaking, this air of utter helplessness, sadness and loneliness were always profoundly visibly.I especially loved the parts when the mother would narrate. I loved everything she had to say and how it consumed me and how i could relate to it in one way or another was suprising, alarming yet i feel it easy for anyone to relate to. Her desire to be show she is loved and how that desire, since not filled by her husband, is hopefully sought out by her through her son. It makes her flirtations and obvious comeons to her son somewhat understandable. Though they are still perverse and wrong, we understand where she is coming from and why she is doing it.Overall this book was just such a joy to read.

Nothing much happens to these people, but there is a lot going on in their heads. Unfortunately, none of it is really pleasant or positive.Each character narrates their own story, but you are never really sure who is talking at any given time or what is going on. You never have a sense of movement to the plot and are left wondering whether something has happened or whether it was all in the mind of the character. The ending is the same as the start and you've just spent 133 pages going nowhere and learning nothing about yourself or the characters."},{"Title":"City of illusion,: A novel","review":"One of the pitfalls of writing historical fiction is that occasionally the subject written about is just, frankly, not that interesting. This is what the reader discovers very quickly about Vardis Fisher's effort to recapture the frenetically charged atmosphere of Virginia City, Nevada during the Comstock silver rush of the 1860s. Of all the people whom Fisher could have written about (and some whom he might have invented) he chose to make Eilley Orrum Bowers the center of his novel. The story of an overly ambitious and greedy woman who dreams of being wealthy and who achieves this dream only to see it vanish has been told too many times to be counted, and forces Fisher to shuffle between biography and the fantastic in order to keep the reader's interest.Fisher does a good job setting the scene for his novel and the early parts of the narrative has a certain raw attractiveness to it as he introduces his characters (historical and fictional) to the reader. His descriptions of the madness and hysteria of the first prospectors and the hardships and squalid conditions of Virginia City are quite realistic and brings the time and place to life. Unfortunately, he is not able to sustain this intensity; in addition, his characters are for the most two dimensional and become merely stock players in the melodrama that unfolds. Only three of the characters really come to life: Eilley's husband, Sandy, who maintains his individuality and humanity even though he is treated like a disobedient child by Eilley; Luff, a philosophical miner who never gets caught up in the hysteria of the Comstock, and Luff's daughter, Nita, who understands at a very young age the advantages she has over men. To the detriment of Fisher's book, they are only minor characters and the novel is concerned with Eilley and her asinine efforts to become \\"Queen of the Comstock\\", a self-delusional goal that she neither has the intelligence nor background to obtain.Given the fact that only one of his books is still in print, it is hard to believe that Vardis Fisher enjoyed quite a bit of literary success in the 1930s. Although he did not achieve the same fame as Thomas Wolfe, both writers were often compared to each other as masters of the self-confessional novel. Fisher was a very prolific writer, having written thirty-eight novels in addition to essays, criticism, and poetry. His finest work is the Vridar Hunter Tetralogy, a four volume biographical novel in the same vane as Look Homeward Angel; and Children of God, a novel of the Mormon settlement of Utah. In addition, he wrote The Testament of Man series, a twelve volume fictional work that traces man's intellectual development from the cave to civilization. Of course, among these gems there is a lot of slag. Although City of Illusion doesn't quite fit this latter category it is not one of his best efforts -- but still the reader can get a glimpse of the talent that Fisher possessed scattered throughout the novel. One of the finest examples is the description of Luff's death in which the miner and a dying goat, both accidentally fallen down an abandoned shaft, \\"share the final fellowship of death.\\" This book only barely reaches the level of three stars but it is still a good read for those who are interested in this period of American history."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"This novel starts out with Stella Sparrow Avery, who has just turned 13. At 13 she gets her gift, as do all the sparrow women through her family line. All the babies born to sparrow women are girls and all of them are born in march.

During her evening dinner with her handsome and seriously mislead father she confides in him and asks him to intervene when she sees how a woman in the bar will be murdered. This sets a whole lot of events in motion that bring to light the history of the Sparrow women and the simplicity and meaning of love and friendship. It's a wonderful story that was extremely captivating and enjoyable. The book is written in thrid person which was nice because you can see the story from everyones angle and you understand the characters better. The only thing I wish Hoffman would have done better was to expand a little on the romances. They were touched breifly here and there throughout the story but I would have liked a little more detail to build the relationships better. Other than that it was a fun, emotional and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"This book tells the story of the \\"Sparrow\\" women.

Grandma knows for sure when someone is telling a lie; Mom experiences other peoples' dreams and her daughter can instantly detect lies.The male characters are uninteresting. There are two brothers -- one is a spendthrift who is comically irresponsible -- he can't even do the dishes. His brother is the exact opposite. Neither is even remotely realistic.The author is great at evoking the dreamy town of Unity, Massachusetts, a magical place where the unusual is routine. We smell of the vegetation and I loved the way she differentiates between different kinds of rain. The town is swathed in mist, the air is humid and fragrant. Bees and frogs have almost magical powers, weird and unique orchids and roses bloom and mother earth does her fervid work.I was enjoying these descriptions which reminded me a little of Gabriel Garcia Marquez which is high praise indeed. But let's not get carried away. I found the characters very one-dimensional and the plot was awfully hackneyed. Every development is signaled well in advance; there are no surprises here.

Sadly, Hoffman is a poor writer to begin with, and then seems unable to focus her storyline. Is this a book about a family of interesting women all blessed with a gift? Is this a story about a murderer who secretly slits his ex-girlfriend's neck? Is it a love story about an old doctor and an old, reclusive gardener? Is it a story about a taxi driver who can't decide whether to stay in small town Unity or move to Florida? Ms. Hoffman doesn't know, as she demonstrates when she gives \\"voice\\" to each and every insignificant character she can think of.This is a great story idea, but Hoffman's writing is just plain cheesy, and some of her attempts at magical realism are sadly pathetic (i.e., even in the land of magical realism, nobody smells like water lillies). If you must pick it up, at least use the library so you won't waste your own money."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"The Probable Future opens in familiar Alice Hoffman territory: in a New England town, Jenny Sparrow frets over the legacy her daughter Stella will receive upon waking on her thirteenth birthday. All Sparrow woman - and they are all women - find their one \\"talent\\", always something magical or supernatural, on this day. The first Sparrow, Rebecca, could not feel pain while Jenny's mother Elinor can instantly detect a lie. Jenny herself dreams other people's dreams. In true Hoffman fashion, the gift Stella receives affects not only the direction of her life but of those who love her - Jenny, Elinor, Jenny's errant ex-husband Will; Will's brother Matt; Liza, the owner of the town tea house; Hap, Stella's new best friend; and Brock Stewart, Elinor's doctor and companion.While parts of this novel are groaningly familiar, Hoffman deftly moves from these moments to something more solid and truthful. The author has her own gift, that of confident narration. Her characterizations are memorably detailed, with the portrayal of Brock Stewart perhaps the most touching I have encountered in her fiction. Unlike in Turtle Moon and Practical Magic, the magic realism here is not as much a crucial part of the story as it is an overlay. Even though Stella's gift does prompt a journey back to the Sparrows, the reasons seem forced and the action unnecessary. This story would be every bit as moving without the Sparrow women's gifts, fireflies that ignite, and bees that demand politeness. Some fans might be disappointed by the lack of seamless integration of magic and realism in this novel, but others will be thankful the author did not force it upon a story which has its most honest moments between ordinary people. Love and the author's literary expressions of its intricacies figure heavily, verging on sentimentality, but again, Hoffman seems to instinctively know when to abandon this direction just her writing is in danger of becoming maudlin.Turtle Moon and Practical Magic remain Alice Hoffman's most inventive novels; however, The Probable Future has its own charms. Quiet, loving, and upbeat, this novel is more likely to appeal to women than to men."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"The Sparrows are a family of women who've lived in a small Massachusetts town since colonial times, their lives enlivened by a magical gift (different for each of them) that first manifests itself on their thirteenth birthdays. As is often the case with magic, the term \\"gift\\" is applied here fairly loosely. In the present day, Elinor always knows a lie, her daughter Jenny experiences other people's dreams, and granddaughter Stella, just turned thirteen, has developed the ability to see how people will die. The relationship-wrecking potential of the first two gifts is of course blindingly obvious, and the third would be a heavy burden for anyone to bear-especially a thirteen-year-old who's not speaking to the mother who's screwing up their relationship by trying to avoid all of her mother's mistakes.These are well-drawn characters who often inspire, simultaneously, the desire to give them tea and crackers and the desire to knock their heads together. Jenny is completely justified and utterly wrong-headed in her resentment of her mother; so is Stella. Jenny is absolutely correct in having concluded, after having it pounded into her head repeatedly, that Stella's father, Will Avery, is a lying, cheating (...)who can be relied on only to let everyone down. Stella is also right in believing him to be a loving, devoted parent who actually listens to her, which her mother does not.There is a plot in here, involving Stella's gift of seeing deaths accidentally landing Will in jail, charged with murder, but the plot is not the point. The focus of this book is the engaging, and ultimately optimistic, story of the tangled relationships of the Sparrow women and their friends and relations.An enjoyable lazy-afternoon read."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I'll tell you reading some of the reviews on this site, I thought, wow, this is a hard audience to please! Hoffman has so many plot lines, and all of the characterization felt deep and well-thought out. But the thing is, I didn't stop to notice this during the book, because I was just into the story.I disagree that Will Avery was unbelievable. Everyone knows a slacker in life who works so hard to get away with not working. I also loved the magical elements -- and how it made you think, you know, being mortal -- not such a bad thing.Really great read!"},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I love escaping into the magical worlds Alice Hoffman creates in her novels and The Probable Future is no different. The story centers on a teen named Stella Sparrow Avery who, like other teens receives a gift on her 13th birthday. Her gift however is a legacy of magical powers that has affected a long line of Sparrow women. For one, the gift was the ability to run faster than anyone; another could stay underwater for 20 minutes at a time. The first, Rebecca, felt no pain, and yet another was a skilled midwife. Stella's grandmother Elinor can tell when someone is lying, and Stella's mother Jenny dreams other people's dreams. Although each gift sounds fabulous, it is a case of be careful what you wish for, because there is a dark side to each. Stella's gift is disturbing: the ability to see how people are going to die. She learns fast that her power has to be used judiciously when she shares information about a potential murder victim with her father and inadvertently makes him a murder suspect. Stella is sent to live with her estranged grandmother Elinor and is soon followed by her mother, Jenny who is not happy to return to the small New England village of Unity. Stella begins to come to terms with her gift as she opens her heart to the people she meets and begins to understand the family history that has inevitably shaped her life.Reconciliation and forgiveness are the main themes of the novel: about the need to forgive each other, forgive oneself and forgive past wrongs that have been carried down through generations. It is also about the transforming power of love. Hoffman contains her themes within an intricately weaved story that wraps around you like a warm blanket. It is a wonderful story of family love and the relationships between mothers and daughters. It would make a great read for any book club - there is plenty in it to discuss."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"With the exception of a few abrupt segues, I enjoyed this book immensely. The female characters are rich and diverse. The story line has just enough mystery and magic to hook the reader, yet remain believable. I liked the way Hoffman wove the historical events of a small town and its treatment of a woman with the current happenings to her descendents. This is a morality story, it's a love story, it's a story of mother-daughter relationships, it's a story of the rites of passage from adolescence to adulthood, it's a story of small town politics and fear, and finally it's a story about the loneliness and courage it takes to be different and trust in your probable future."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"The Sparrow family have lived in Unity almost since the town has existed, in an old house that's been added on to so many times it's assumed the shape of a wedding cake. The residents of Unity know it as Cake House, and its inhabitants present a mystery the townspeople don't want to solve, or even have much to do with, in spite of the sacrifices the Sparrow women have made to the community through the past two centuries-or perhaps because of them.Each Sparrow woman develops a unique gift at the age of thirteen, and these gifts aren't necessarily blessings. Elinor Sparrow can tell when someone is lying. Her daughter Jenny can enter others' dreams. Jenny's daughter Stella, in her turn, wakens on her thirteenth birthday with the ability to see how some people will die. Her gift lands Stella's father, Will Avery, in jail when he's wrongly accused of murder after trying to warn the authorities about one of his daughter's premonitions.This is not a story of how the murder is solved. In fact, that becomes a minor detail. It's a story about a family, a town, and how a much older mystery is brought to rest, of how the Sparrow women first came to live in Unity, the part they've played in its history, and where they're headed. It isn't packed with action, either. The reader enters the life of each character as one would enter the life of a new friend, easing one's way in and beginning to see the world through the other's eyes. The patient reader is rewarded by the full richness of Alice Hoffman's writing. In the world of novelists, Hoffman is the equivalent of the dedicated cook who spends an entire day preparing a meal with love, creating everything from scratch, and possibly by magic. Other cooks open cans and stir up store-bought mixes, some toss everything into the microwave oven. They feed our stomachs, while the gifted cook-and author-feeds our souls."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I loved Practical Magic and looked forward to this one, but by the time I reached the end, it was a sheer chore just to try and finish. Hoffman does a fantastic job with description but I think she focuses way too much on that front. I felt no sympathy for the characters because really, there was a serious lack of development in each and every one of them. The idea of the Sparrow women and their gifts and their history was an interesting start, but that was really the only thing good about this book. Believe me when I say I never throw books away because I always donate copies if I don't want to keep them, but with this, I tossed it BEFORE I even finished."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I'm not a big fan of \\"magic realism\\" so this book was always going to be a hard sell for me. It tells the story of a family of women, the \\"Sparrows\\" each of whom develops a special gift when they turn 13. The grandmother can instantly detect lies; the mother sees other peoples' dreams and the daughter sees how people will ultimately die. Previous generations also had \\"superpowers\\" of various kinds.The story takes place in the misty, dreamy, magical town of Unity, Massachusetts, where nothing is as it seems. The best aspect of this book for me were the descriptions of this strange place -- the smell of the vegetation in the woods, the different kinds of rains that fall, the mist, the humid fragrant air, the bees, the frogs, the orchids and roses and the strange smell of water that clings to the Sparrow women.That's the plus: on the other side of the ledger, the plot is laughably predictable. There wasn't a single development I didn't see coming 60 pages in advance. Everything is ultimately tied up neatly and happily like a Christmas present wrapped with a bow. The characters are also very weak. Each one is a kind of walking cliche. There is the serious brother and the wastrel (the men in this book are particularly poor), the good doctor, the evil murderer etc etc.I was tired of this book by the end. I admired some of the writing but it didn't add up to a satisfying novel."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I am fascinated with how well Hoffman composes magical realism.

Well, this gets her father in trouble and eventually they all have to move back to their hometown. Parts of the novel were extremely predictable (hence the 4/5 rating), but I enjoyed the rest for how characters thought of each other and how they developed such tightly-woven friendships.

I enjoyed reading it :-) It was very sensually descriptive with respect to nature ...the bees, flowers, lake water... heavy olfactory based that left the reader wishing she could dive into the pages to smell, see and feel all that was being described.

There is lots of family dynamic going on that I found it easy to relate to."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I was stunned by the deep insight into the minds of both men and women in this book, and I loved the way the author makes the current teen with her special power a very modern and realistic teenager.The way Hoffman explores the challenging relationships between grandmother, mother, daughter, and the men in their lives, is quite moving and sometimes sad, especially when it isn't expressed until the end of someone's life.These women all have exceptional and unique talents that they acquire upon their 13th birthdays, such as smelling a lie, seeing other people's dreams, and seeing how people will die. How they live with these in society is part of the challenge of their lives, as is figuring out how to use their powers for good.The book also explores the \\"unofficial history\\" vs the official history of the town, looking at the ways these women affect the community beyond just facts, including the history of the persecution of \\"witches,\\" one of the women's ancestors being one who died as one.Set in New England where witch hunting was severe, this story is completely believable in that respect. Hoffman's descriptions of the environment are poetic and vivid, and you can almost feel the ghosts of persecuted \\"witches\\" in the air.Hoffman says that she was trying to make some sense out of how unpredictable life and death are, to write about magic in the real world -- the possible and the probable future.I thought it was wonderful, and it made me want to heal the female relationships in my family, as well as nurture and express my own unique insights and abilities."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"For readers who don't want another cliche paranormal romance, I suggest reading Alice Hoffman's books. She writes literary novels with hints of the unreal, the magical. Her novels tend to come full circle, but they are finely nuanced enough that you won't necessarily see the end in sight.In The Probable Future, each woman in the Sparrow family has an unusual gift - usually a gift that drives them mad. As the story unfolds, we discover how the first gifted woman died and why. The characters are well-developed, and the connections between mother and daughter and grandmother and granddaughter are complex and realistic.I'd recommend this novel to both young adults (16+) and adults. It has romance, mystery and meaning.-Carey RavenStar Robin, author of Naked in the Garden of the Serpent"},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"\\"The Probable Future\\" is characterized by superb, distinctive prose and an almost mythic sense of the world.

And then I find out that Elaine Markson is her agent--- so enviable).

I read a lot and haven't been so engaged in a novel in a long time. Alice Hoffman paints pictures of depth and beauty, in a way that seems natural and effortless...the mind just follows her down her winding paths. As she says herself, the characters come to a life of their own and name themselves. These were very real characters to me. The sublties of changes in our perceptions about ourselves and others as we grapple for understanding and connections in life were portrayed in a magically interwoven tale much like real life itself. This book helped me to see the magic hidden in my own 'real' life. I gave it to all my grown children. A story of family and the possibilites of change."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"This is the first Hoffman novel I read--I like books with a bit of magic in them, so I liked that element in this book as well. The characters were interesting, the place was interesting.But I found the drastic change in the self-centred Will Avery unbelievable, and everyone gets a romantic partner a bit too 'pat'. I feel the book would have been more compelling if there was just one pair of lead characters instead of so many kind of equally distributed in importance. It's as if Hoffman has tried to achieve too much in too few pages.I felt sorry for Rebecca Sparrow, but didn't find her crucial enough to play such a strong role in the story. There are also a lot of unanswered questions and blurriness--when Stella sees a horse as a cause of death for Hap, why is the reality the *word* \\"sea horse\\"? Jenny starts off by holding our interest but then Stella grabs our attention, and then Elinor, then Dr Stewart, and on and on.They were all interesting, but I think a longer book with the story fleshed out better would have made this a 5star book."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"The more I read by Alice Hoffman, the more I enjoy her works. (Shout out to M.F. for her recommendation). Her characters are quite complex and take you through the story in a way that I'm not sure many authors have accomplished. I loved the relationshio between the women in this book (past and present) and how Hoffman intertwines the spiritual world and the natural world with such ease that it seems, well normal.

You get to watch a number of characters grow (in the mental sense) and see how they all contribute to what defines the town of Unity.I'm very fond of this type of novel, the kind that gets put in the \\"literature\\" section of the book store, but is just a splash of fantasy away from reality."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"This book was a simple and fast read.

The story is about generations of women (but focuses on the most recent 3 generations) who inheret a gift on their 13th birthday (ie cant feel pain, can see how people will die, tell when someone is lying). I enjoyed the book for what it was but it didnt pull any emotion from me or make itself all that memorable to me. The book was written at a medium pace so it didnt bore me. I enjoyed the premiss of the book and the authors stories of the previous generations, but I feel like it lacked that something special to set it apart. I dont think its a waste of time to read but I also dont think you should make it your number one book to get!"},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"I read \`Practical Magic' a couple of years ago and fell in love with Alice Hoffman's writing. Since then I have read several other Hoffman books, (like Indigo and River King) and though they might have similar sprightly moods, for some reason none of the other books have measured up to \`Practical Magic' in my opinion. I have one observation of the four or five Hoffman books that I think is pretty stark when you compare these books that I am talking about. The observation is that Practical Magic had a plot that was indistinct. I, as a reader, was unsure how the characters or plot lines would resolve themselves. The most painful aspect of reading \`Probable Future' is that it becomes apparent from the very beginning of the book exactly how every single thread would resolve itself. So even though Hoffman once again works her lovely magical prose, it becomes dull and thuds along due to the feeling that you have seen what's coming for several hundred pages.The story surrounds the Sparrow women. Three generations of ladies who have problems relating with one another. Each of the three are stubborn and wrong in their own way. I kept thinking throughout the book that each of these ladies were very uninspired (though they were enjoyable to read about as every other Hoffman character). I say that they were uninspired because it felt like Hoffman was using a lazy plot device and ended up making these otherwise intelligent characters into dumb, single-minded, low-brow cartoons. I had no sympathy for any of them as a reader and thus it was hard to read about them.I think that if you are looking for a good read sort of like what I think this book could have been, I would suggest that you read \`Nobody's Fool' by Richard Russo. Or if you have not read \`Practical Magic' I would suggest that one wholeheartedly.The reason I am giving this book only two stars is because of exactly what I spelled out above. I have probably rated books that are much more poorly written than this higher. But I expect more from Hoffman because I know that she can do it. And it was a real chore to get to the end, which is too bad because the writing was otherwise quite good."},{"Title":"The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle)","review":"This is a very well written book.

The authors have a very calming, soothing way of writing that is almost meditative in itself. They begin by examining the causes of stress in our lives and the different and often destructive ways in which we deal with stress individually. By sharing personal anecdotes that may seem &quot;deja vu&quot; to a lot of us, they grasp your attention almost inmediately. Stress not only wrecks havoc with our lives personally, but according to the authors, stress also suppresses the immune stystem and sets you up as a target for a total collapse. Forest and Light (great names) share easy to learn techniques you can use anywhere and anytime that used regularly (practice is the key) provide almost instant relief and inner peace. There are different techniques for different types and levels of stress. I'm still working on Level 1 and it really works!

Can you literally dissolve all stress just by breathing? The answer is a resounding \\"YES\\"! I had the great pleasure of working with the authors of this book while they were still developing their beautifully simple but extraordinarily powerful system for dissolving stress and, having quickly mastered the basic techniques and integrated them into my daily life, I can testify to the quite astonishing effectiveness of this system. I would go so far as to say it not only helps you deal with all the stresses of day-to-day life in this frenetically busy world but, if you continue to follow the simple, step-by-step guidance, it can totally transform your life! Just reading the book took me back to that deep sense of peace that I experienced for the first time in my life when I worked with these amazing people, Forest and Light. I find it immensely exciting that The Tranquility System is now available in book form. Maybe you simply want to learn to cope better with a busy life, in which case this is the book for you. But it goes deeper than that. The same techniques can be of immeasurable help in the deep healing process that a large number of people are involved with at the moment as many of us search for a better way of living, a better way of being. I particularly loved the line on the very last page of the book - \\"Remember to be patient with yourself. You are changing patterns that have been with you a whole lifetime.\\" With the help of this book and just a little gentle practice you can open up to a whole new way of living, a joyful and exciting way, safe in the knowledge that, whatever the stresses to come, with The Tranquility System at hand you will know exactly what to do to dissolve them."},{"Title":"The Tranquility System: Instant Relief from Stress","review":"Having worked in a fast-paced, high stress environment, I quickly learned the importance the stress relief. The Tranquility System was an invaluable guide to me in my quest for relaxation. It is filled with useful tips on how to relax even when you are in a stressful situation (which of course is when you really need it) and how to incorporate stress relief into your daily life. I particularly appreciated the anecdotes the authors share about the individuals they have worked with, as they personalize the damaging effects stress can have on our relationships with others, and on our own spirits. The relaxation techniques outlined by Forest and Light are clearly explained and easy to practice.

Because this book is one big letdown.The contents of the book follow the usual reprint pattern, more or less, consisting of a number of focused chapters by several different authors. The exception to the rule, in this instance, is that one author in particular (who also edited the book?) features several times.Not that it makes much difference who wrote what, because the entire contents are uniformly mediocre.Firstly there's far too much \\"what\\" you should do, and far too little \\"how\\" to do it.Secondly, there doesn't seem to have been any attempt at all to deal with the frequent, and wholly unnecessary repetition - or sometimes contradiction - in the information on offer.Thirdly there seems to be considerable confusion as to what is meant by the word \\"presentation\\". Thus more than one author pigeonholes their comments under sales, speeches, etc., instead of giving guidance that is useful in ANY presentation. Which wouldn't be so bad if only these \\"tips\\" weren't presented at such a high level that they are almost entirely devoid of useful detail.The fact is that anyone with a passing knowledge of the presentations business - but without any practical experience - could have written this book. And quite likely made a better job of it.Indeed, I have a book on \\"Successful Presentation Skills\\" (ISBN 0-7494-3259-4) which I got 2-3 years ago, which covers everything in the Harvard book, and quite a lot more, without the pointless repetitions. It also gives far more practical advice - both \\"how\\" to do things, and \\"why\\". For example, instead of merely naming different types of presentations, it identifies the five most frequent reasons for giving a presentation, and defines a basic layout for each.Despite that, it's written by just one person. And it's cheaper!Not very difficult to decide which book to go for, IMO."},{"Title":"Presentations That Persuade and Motivate (The Results-Driven Manager Series)","review":"I'd echo a lot of the other reader points.... it was a lot of fluff from HBS. However, some of the articles has some novel ideas that I hadn't thought of, and for that reason I would give it 3 stars.

Having each article linked to a \\"recommended reading\\" suggestion has provided some interesting next books to read on the topic.I paid full paperback price for this (a minor $15) and I would have felt better if I had paid a used book price after having read it (say $5).

The approach is a photographic one, not of the dashing Cavalry hero but of geographic places where he walked, rode, fought, lived - and died. Places like the farm house of his boyhood home in Ohio, the towers at West Point,and the serene green landscape alongside the Hudson, of the cannons at Manassas, his first Civil War battle, of the blue skies and open field at Brandy Station, the site of the biggest Cavalry fight on North American soil, and of another open field, that one alongside Rummel's farm at place called Gettysburg.The Moellers continue this photographic journey, through the beautiful flowers and plant overgrowth of that terrible place called the Wilderness, to the bushy ground of Yellow Tavern, where Jeb Stuart was mortally wounded by a soldier under Custer's command, into the beautiful Shenandoah Valley, and on to a place called Appomattox, where their frames captured the beautiful and tranquil southern home where Lee surrendered to Grant.Then out west, to the desolate brown flatlands of the Oklahoma territory, to the plains where the buffalo roamed (and still do), and on to those desolate Black Hills, and a date with destiny at a greasy grass filled hillside not far from a stream called the Little Big Horn. Throughout this journey, the Moellers provide the reader with strikingly beautiful all-color photographs that capture the natural beauty and the drama of the places associated with Custer. There is also a fine text equal to a mini-biography of Custer. And not one image of him, save for the striking statue on the cover. And not one contemporary photograph or illustration either.I believe that the Custer book was the first photo-history that the Moellers chose to do. Since then they have covered the Oregon Trail, Lewis and Clark, Chief Joseph, and Crazy Horse, among other topics. But their Custer book represents their best work, and while the original hardcover is out-of-print and a rarity at used book stores, they have reprinted this slim volume in a paperback edition found here. If you are a Custer enthusiast, or just interested in Western history captured in remarkable photographs, this is a worthy and very unique book to include in your collection."},{"Title":"Custer: A Photographic Biography","review":"Actually, I found this volume a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the photography is absolutely gorgeous, but most of the photos do nothing to really make you feel connected to or walking in the shoes of Custer. The first Moeller photo book I read was the Oregon Trail one. Now that was great and made you feel like you walked the sites with the immigrants. But this Custer volume was just kind of disconnected. Lots of scenery photos of places where he had been, but so little to connect the scenery to the human cast that rode across the stage.So I recommend this book IF you can get it used and fairly cheap (like under $5). Good for Custer buffs, Civil War fans, and Old West afficionadoes, but don't pay full price. Its just not worth it. Again, the photography is certainly \\"eye candy\\", but doesn't really help bring Custer to life. The text was nicely done to provide a mini-bio of Custer. I've only read about him from the Little Bighorn material, so the text of this book helped flesh out the man a little better."},{"Title":"Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets","review":"Given the importance of this book, I find myself puzzled by thefact that I am the first to review it..., but am delighted tohave the opportunity. This book was a real milestone when itappeared. In a very factual, unbiassed but totally proficient andpersuasive way it demonstrated in great detail that the persona of thepoems is presented, through them..... Sonnet 20 is of course a crucial targetfor Pequigney, and he reads it superbly, but he is hardly less good ona great many other of Shakespeare's wonderful poems, and is by nomeans narrow or obsessive about his point of view: on the contrary, hehas an excellent notion of how his argument fits into a wider schemeof things. Those who read the poems in Katherine Jones's disappointingArden 3 edition will realise, if they examine Pequigney's work, thatthat editor's claims about the supposed novelty of her views on thebisexuality presented within the poems is greatly exaggerated, andthat Pequigney makes many of the important points both earlier andbetter. Anyone seriously interested in the Sonnets will want to readthis book, which I would rank as one of the most significant and bestworks concerned with those poems: more essential to read than, forexample, John Kerrigan's edition, competent though that is, and insome ways more to the point than Stephen Booth's excellenttome. Someone reading both Pequigney and Helen Vendler would perhapsbenefit more from those two books than any others, though I wouldrecommend using Ingram and Redpath's edition of the Sonnets alongsidethese critical works...."},{"Title":"Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets","review":"There will always be those who deny something that is demonstrably true: an inconvenient truth, as it were. But, as George Orwell makes abundantly clear, denial succeeds only by manipulating language and oppressing the opposition. And so it has been with the inconvenient truth of the Shakespeare's gay/bisexual orientation. Generations of students have been taught that in Renaissance England the word \\"love\\" (applied in a male-male context) meant merely \\"friendship.\\" After all, great Shakespearean scholars said so. Besides, any male--straight or gay--who asserted otherwise would be made to suffer.Joseph Pequigney wrote \\"Such is My Love\\" in the mid-1980s. It is a critical analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets based upon the character of the Sonnets as most probably autobiographical and certainly homosexual poetry. Of course, in order to do such an analysis, Pequigney had to demonstrate (not assume) that when the Sonnets address love, they address it from a point of view that embraces homosexuality. Furthermore, in order to make the argument at all, he had to show the longstanding evasion of the Sonnets' homoerotic character and trace the origins and currency of the \\"love = friendship\\" myth.All this Pequigney does, which is why his close analysis of all 154 sonnets had to be substantially pared down for publication. It is also why the book cannot be dismissed (on any reasonable ground) as special pleading. Still, given shrill assertions of gay political/cultural conspiracy, it is still relevant that the book, in position and argument, is endorsed by the late Richard Levin, eminent Shakespearean scholar and strong advocate for methodological conservatism.Pequigney employs a carefully hedged Freudian model of homoerotic dynamics, which, given current academic trends, may pose a problem for a few readers. But, for the most part, he is concerned to show that Freud does not contradict the pattern shown in the Sonnets--in effect, that Shakespeare proves Freud, not vice versa.In the years since \\"Such is My Love\\" was published, much has changed culturally, and academic protests against gay/lesbian studies have mostly given way to the realization that accepting homosexual love as a distinct human quality can enhance literary understanding in fundamental ways. (We now find that accepting Sappho's poetry as homosexual love poetry and not as some disguised expression of heterosexual friendship entails re-translating the poetry and understanding it more accurately.) Pequigney's study, which comes early in this change in academe, is a more-than-worthy example of the usefulness of the gay/lesbian/bi perspective in advancing the traditional values of scholarship in the humanities, values that do not depend on the scholar's personal sexual orientation.What's past is prologue. Let me now paraphrase parts of my original 1988 review:1. Pequigney accepts the original order of the Sonnets, that of the 1609 Quarto, showing that subsequent rearrangements have no textual (but substantial cultural) grounds.2. It has long been recognized that the Sonnets divide into two sequences. Sonnets 1-126 are devoted to the poet and his male friend. Sonnets 127-154 are popularly called the \\"Dark Lady\\" sonnets. What Pequigney establishes is that the sequences are not separated in time, but \\"intersect,\\" with the action of Sonnets 133-144 being synchronous with the situation defined in Sonnets 40-42. Furthermore, the action of the Dark Lady sequence begins after and ends before the period defined in the first sequence.3. The substantial action of the first sequence is the poet's wooing, winning, and eventual tiring of his young male lover. The second sequence traces the cycle of desire, lustful pursuit, sexual fruition, and post-coital disgust that characterizes the poet's relationship with the Dark Lady. The sequences are connected by the poet's jealousy \\"at the thought of a sexual liaison between the friend . . . and the woman\\" (p. 144). This despite the poet being evidently bisexual and the friend exclusively homosexual: such are the vagaries of developing relationships and self-definitions.4. Any treatment of the Sonnets must address their great themes: friendship, love, beauty, time, mutability, mortality, and immortality. In this, Pequigney does not disappoint. But he does lead us to acknowledge that Shakespeare's attitude toward love is, without apology, heterodox: true love is exalted over lust, but true love is experienced in a sexual relationship with another male, while unadulterated lust is experienced with a woman who is manifestly inferior in beauty and character to the male lover.A final note: Professor Pequigney was my dissertation director and has long encouraged me in my own scholarship. Professor Levin was one of my professors, and I note with sadness his passing in December 2009."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"What do I mean by dated . . . but . . . foundational?DATEDChrist and Culture has been around for over half a century now. When first penned it attempted to describe all the various ways in which Christians interact with culture, and make sense of it. The book was profound, for its time period. However, a lot of theology has been written since 1951 and culture has changed even more. At first glance the reader might find himself or herself toying with several ideas that are more recent than Niebur's.FOUNDATIONALThis book made such a splash that some Christian colleges adopted similar classes. This was the prevailing text. Therefore, most of the ideas on this subject that churn in the modern Christian reader's mind were formed in reaction to this book, even if the reader is unaware of it. Therefore, if the reader of today can grasp the concepts of this work, that reader will have a deeper understanding of his or her own beliefs.RECOMMENDATIONThis book is dated, but not outdated. Read it and compare it with newer works for a broader grasp of the subject. By the way, this is one of the most important subjects that today's Christian can wrestle with. Too many of our Christians react to culture with limited understanding of what they are doing or why they are doing it. We Protestants, of which I am one, are horribly weak in our understanding of what it means to be the Church of Jesus Christ in a fallen world."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"H. Richard Niebuhr writes as a Christian, but this work has meaning beyond the scope of the Christian faith. Here, he analyzes how the sacred can relate to the profane, the spiritual to the mundane.After defining &quot;Christ&quot; (Mediator, involving double movement, from God toward man &amp; from men toward God) and &quot;Culture&quot; (the artificial, secondary environment that man imposes on the natural), he dedicates a chapter to each of the five ways he sees the sacred &amp; profane relating.The first of these, &quot;Christ against Culture,&quot; focuses on the opposition of the sacred to the profane. He examines the ekklesia, or &quot;calling out&quot; inherent in the sacred (that which is set apart, beyond the horizon). He critiques this approach by showing how ultimately it leads to an otherworldly Christianity which can have minimal, if any impact on the world.Opposed to this is &quot;The Christ of Culture.&quot; From this viewpoint, the sacred is discovered in culture. That which is most Christlike in culture is celebrated, the spiritual teachings which bring man into community, which find meaning in the &quot;ordinary&quot; take precedence. The danger of this approach, is that belief will merge with society, and the sacred will be, eventually, completely lost.Adherents to the &quot;Christ above Culture&quot; motif compartmentalize the sacred and the profane. Christ is for church and bed-time prayers, culture is the realm of business. At best, spiritually informed morals guide behavior in culture. By compartmentalizing the sacred as separate from the profane, this approach de-vitalizes the profane and disempowers the sacred.The &quot;Christ in Paradox with Culture&quot; approach sees man as sinful and grounded in culture. Man cannot escape the profane--this is part of his nature. Christ, on the other hand, calls man into the sacred. This is the paradox--called to the sacred, a part of the profane. The only resolution is seen as God's redeeming grace.His final approach considers &quot;Christ the Transformer of Culture.&quot; He presents the permeation of all life by the immanent presence of divinity. This lays a geis upon the believer to manifest the Divine within culture, leading to both spiritual and practical, political and social action.He concludes by stating that we must make our decisions in faith, that not one of these five approaches can lay claim to being the &quot;One True&quot; Christian approach.I find it interesting that he takes nearly an entire book to develop the &quot;Christ the Transformer of Culture&quot; idea. This is one which more modern Christian theologians (ie Matthew Fox) develop rapidly as a basis for further discussion. Starhawk, the noted author of Goddess thealogy, starts by assuming an immanent Divine presence, both sanctifying all of the &quot;profane&quot; and demanding that situations of injustice be confronted."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"Niebuhr's views, historical, cultural and religious, were solidly based in the context and culture of the late 40's and early 50's. He wrote as an ethicist who, in 1950, fully comprehended the cataclysmic failure of the German National Church. Now, over fifty years later, with the republishing of Niebuhr's book, his inquiry into the relationship of the Church and the contemporary culture remain valid, though the world and the church have dramatically changed.In &quot;Christ &amp; Culture&quot; Niebuhr describes five models of how the sacred &amp; secular can interact. Ultimately he seeks to give insight into the question of &quot;how shall we, as Christians, live?&quot; I will not go into the five types, but of the five types, Niebuhr favors most the &quot;Christ transforming Culture&quot;.Faith, in Christ, Niebuhr believed, needs to go beyond separation, accommodation, adoration or polarization and engage dynamically the culture with the values of life that Christ espoused. Faith in Christ, through presence and social action, will transform the world. Thus, for Niebuhr, if Christ identified with the poor, we should too. If Christ took in the orphans and widows, we should too. If Christ healed the sick, we should too. Jesus is God-with-us, not to rescue us out of &quot;all of this,&quot; but to redeem, transform, restore us and all of this. God's work of redemption is not at odds with God's work of creation. We live in the world, we create the world and we, through faith, are involved in bringing God's &quot;kingdom come, here on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;This is a must read for any student of Christianity. This is a serious read and it can be a bit dense and daunting at times, but it is non-the-less a Christian Classic that every pastor and thinking Christian should have in their library. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"I'm somewhat split on this one--perhaps not surprising, given the topic of the book!&lt;g&gt;The scope of the book involves Niebuhr's attempts at identifying and categorizing five typologies of 'followers of Christ', with respect to their views concerning what it means to 'follow Christ' and what it means to live in the world. It's an ambitious project, and one which Niebuhr, more often than not, manages to carry off with aplomb, perception and wit.After explaining why he thinks the topic should be addressed, Niebuhr proceeds by attempting to define 'Christ' and 'culture' in ways which--theoretically--any of his typology groups would accept. This leads to his first problem, for Niebuhr's definition of Christ ends up carrying quite a lot of 'high christology' weight. Not that this bothers _me_ (being a conservative Christian), but when I read it I thought--hmmm, there are some people who try to follow Christ who aren't going to accept that sort of definition. Not surprisingly, when Niebuhr reached the second typology (the 'cultural protestants', i.e. the generally liberal revisionists whom even Niebuhr admits feel free to redefine Christ in terms of whatever they think is most popular in culture at the moment), the people whom he mentions as being part of that group would have either denied Niebuhr's definition of 'Christ', or else would have used the form of that definition while self-consciously and explicitly relegating the form to a nebulous cypher: 'insert your own meaning as you see fit'.This leads to the second major problem of the book. Niebuhr pretty obviously (and maybe even with a proper sense of charity) wants to grant some real and useful credit to the second typology group as being valid 'witnesses for Christ'. However, even Niebuhr can see (and admits) that they are not witnessing for Christ so much as importing and reshaping the figure of Christ as an authority to validate whatever the cultural focus-de-jour is. This disparity between Niebuhr's purpose and his data leads to numerous contradictions in that section.For instance, Niebuhr describes Albrecht Ritschl on one page as staying closer to the New Testament Christ than Kant; and then two pages later, Niebuhr explicitly admits that Ritschl's theology was Kantian, and describes it in such terms. Or, relatedly, Ritschl is described as staying closer to the NT than Jefferson and Kant; within the very same paragraph where Niebuhr describes Jefferson and Kant (and Schleirmacher) as 'religion within the limits of reason'--as distinct from Hegel, Emerson and Ritschl who (Niebuhr says) represent the movement toward 'the religion of humanity'. Ritschl is put into some strikingly odd groups for someone whom Niebuhr wants to present as staying particularly close to the NT accounts.The disparities of the second section (and there are many), culminate when Niebuhr quietly turns away from the pure subjectivity of the 'culture-prot' Christians, and presents them as if they were another type altogether: a type which really is seeking a true unity in &quot;the tradition of culture&quot;, not artificially importing it in; a type which may actually be trying to use definitive characteristics of Jesus (whatever those are proposed--and cogently defended!--to be) to &quot;discern&quot; this &quot;unity&quot;, rather than tossing away any definitive characteristics which happen not to fit the schema of the particular tradition of the particular culture in question. Niebuhr tacitly turns back to a typology which might possibly have real strength, and which really might accomplish something other than the instigation of an illusionary tautology. By Niebuhr's own admission (and by the tacit admission of the actual evidence he allows to be presented as to means and ends), the 'culture-prot' Christians cannot do this; so, to grant them some credit, Niebuhr must identify them purely by taxonomic convenience (so to speak) with the other culture-positive typologies, who _might_ really accomplish the goal of using &quot;the aid of the knowledge of Christ... to discriminate between the spirits of the times and the Spirit which is from God.&quot;For certainly, the 'culture-prot' Christians, by holding the shape of the target culture as being the final standard for acceptance or rejection (or manufacture!) of data concerning Jesus, are by definition of their own methodology not discriminating between any kinds of spirits--except insofar as they discriminate between spirits of one time and another. If the 1st century Christians could manufacture a &quot;wonderworking supernatural hero&quot;, then we can manufacture whatever kind of Jesus _we_ want. Right?No. We _can_ perhaps do that; but we should not. I have more respect for those &quot;cultured despisers of religion&quot; who have concluded that the early Christians were fairy-tale mongers, and consequently refuse to consider _any_ statement concerning Jesus as being more than a wish-fulfillment gloss (even modern apostate statements); than for those revisionists whose strategy is a conscious embracement of wish-fulfillment illusion. One of these groups might not be blaspheming, in the end, against the Holy Spirit; but one of them definitely is, even if the shape of Jesus they end up with seems to speak in favor of the Son of Man.However, despite the deep problems with Niebuhr's attempt to make his second typology work within his thesis, I do think that he manages to say some internally consistent things about the other four groups (though he verges close on the edge of useless parody in his discussion of the exclusivists). His mis-analysis of the second typology is so out-of-place with the rest of his book, that it sticks out in my mind like a tumor on a generally healthy nose. Or, to put it another way: the rest of his book may not be perfect, but compared to that section on his second typology group, it looks like a masterwork.At any rate, despite the severe intrinsic weaknesses of that one section, I do recommend the book as an otherwise balanced and comparative look at strengths and weaknesses among artificially (but somewhat usefully) distinguished classes of Christians and our attempts to deal both with Christ and the cultures around us."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"Christ and Culture is one of those books that will forever change the way a person of faith understands their relationship to God and those around him. In part, Niebuhr is able to make this book so impactful because he himself avoids most value judgments about the merits of the perspectives he looks at; while he does (persuasively, I would add) advocate the fifth position, his discussion of each of the five categories is fair and even-handed. Indeed, his typology is consistant with his view that there is no single answer to this &quot;enduring dilemma&quot;. No matter which of the categories you most feel compelled by, this method of even handed analysis is sure to build your appreciation of other Christian answers to the problem, and it forces you to examine your own view of this critical question."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"Drawing on the history of Christian relationships with culture, Niebuhradapts the work of Ernst Troeltsch to create a typology of how Christiansthrough the ages have interacted with culture. Strongly biased towards the finalone of his five suggestions, Niebuhr influenced a generation of liberalChristians to seek to transform society in the name of Christ. The workis a classic in the field, but has been challenged as inextricably bound upwith an obsolete commitment to a &quot;Christendom&quot;-based social ethic."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"Niebuhr's book has been seen as a classic for nearly half a century now, and to be honest, when I first read it I too was captivated by his typology: Christ Against Culture, Christ of Culture, Christ Above Culture, Christ and Culture in Paradox, and Christ the Transformer of Culture.There are several nit-picky complaints about it-- for example, his desciption of the Mennonite Church as Christ Against Culture is not accurate. He probably meant the Old Order Amish. Second, culture seems to shift during his exposition, so that by the time you get to the end of the account you forget how he defined it. Third, and sorry if I am giving anything away, he fails to critique the fifth option (transformer) to the same extent as he does the first four. It is a bit of intellectual cheating that this position is his position of preference-- a quasi-calvinistic reformist view that wants desperately to keep Christianity relevant to the society in which it finds itself. Not to the extent of his brother, Reinhold, but certainly more than enough.This book is more a theological treatise than an accurate historical account. The trouble is that the examples then become straw men for the theological or polemical point instead of being able to stand on their own merits.Typologies are dangerous because they do not allow for a lot of barrier-transcending. Calling a group \\"Christ Against Culture\\" fails to consider that it too may be triving for some sort of \\"transformation\\". It may be one that is much more overtly Christian, which is considerably different from a perspective that sees the Church as the moral conscience of the secular state.Finally, some revisions are necessary today for the diferent movements that have come up more recently. Christ the Liberator of Culture, for example."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"This is a well organized argument presenting five sides to a critical problem between Christ and culture. Niebuhr argues Christ against culture, Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture in paradox and finally Christ transforming culture. Although his postscript to these arguments is inconclusive, he does call for a decision, not from the community of faith but from the individual to decide. He begins with an impasse that Christ is sinless but culture is sinful overlaying this with veneers of scripture that seem to contradict. For instance, we are called out of the world but are also sent into the world. Throughout each argument Christ is presented as central but the application to culture swings from rejecting homes, property and the protecting hand of government, seen in the life of Tolstoy, to a harmony of Christ and culture. The latter has a danger of interpreting culture through Christ, but also Christ through culture.Although each of the five arguments is persuasive, Christ and the transformation of culture appear to be stronger theologically. Niebuhr calls the Christian with this view a \`conversionist.' The argument is that God is our Creator and that his creation was \`good'. The work of the Christian is to bring Christ into culture transforming it for our \`good'. Culture itself is something God made and cannot be the source of sin. Therefore culture is neither good nor bad. The Christian who lives for Christ by keeping their focus on him in a positive and productive manner will bring a Christ-centeredness into culture. Virtues of hope, love and peace become part of everyday life.My disagreement is not with the various arguments presented but an agreement where there is no conclusion. Christ against culture has probably done more harm in creating separatists not only between Christ and culture but within the Body of Christ. Niebuhr correctly notes that very little has been accomplished in this view of Christ against culture within any point of history. Sin does not find its origin in culture although it finds a place there. Therefore culture must not be opposed and rejected escaping the community Christ came to serve. The first chapter of John's Gospel ratifies that Christ \`became one of us' along with Philippians chapter three. Christ was born under Roman rule in occupied Judea (two cultures colliding together) yet He influenced both.Niebuhr's work still touches on the obvious debate among Christian leaders today of Christ and culture. It is strong in presentation but weak in current application of a postmodern culture. It leaves too much for the reader to interpret for themselves, even in Niebuhr's call for decision in his final chapter. Written near the end of a modern culture the examples are more historical. If this can be overcome by the reader it is vital material for arguing intellectually with a postmodern culture and presents five different perspectives. Unlike material that wants to make a \`statement', Niebuhr crosses a difficult bridge that can appear dismantling of the church and its fundamental belief in Christ. He does not challenge the doctrine of Christ (eternal, incarnate, became man, died, buried, resurrected and ascended) but the commission given to the church concerning all that Christ has done. His tone is subtle avoiding all political overtones making the material relevant for our day fifty years after it was written.If each chapter could have a short journalistic story, from any time in history, explaining how a culture was impacted through Christ against, of, above, as a paradox and transformation of culture, it would attract far more attention in a postmodern culture of today.By Andrew Fox author of Change Through Challnge"},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"I read the book as part of a history class for seminary.

As much for the content as for the battle that Niebuhr was waging early in his ministry. Christ and Culture is his lecture given at Austin Presbyterian Seminary where his parishoner and noted Old Testament scholar, Prescott Williams, was a member. That was in a Michigan parish whose members were mostly middle income auto workers and union members. Niebuhr championed their cause from a Christian perspective and in the lead up to World War II he and his older brother called for resistance of Hitler's program in Germany. During that time H.R. Niebuhr is credited with writing the Serenity Prayer....a prayer aimed at social justice and the courage to take a stand against evil. The prayer was commandeered by Frank Buchman, founder of Alcoholics Anonymous and close friend of Henry Ford whose support of Hitler's programs and distrust of Jews was chronicled in his series of articles in Ford's Dearborn, Michigan newspaper.

Richard Niebuhr's Christ and Culture. Here are a few of my observations:1. The author's main purpose in writing this book was to rediscover healthy interaction between Christ and culture. Christians \\"[belong] to that community of men for whom Jesus Christ is of supreme importance as the key to the understanding of themselves and their world\\" while culture is the \\"total process of human activity\\" (Niebuhr, 11, 32). Approaches include opposition which demands a decision between the two, agreement which perceives Jesus as the peak of cultural accomplishment, syntheticism which alternates between the two, polarity which proposes different loyalties, and the conversionists which hold to Christ as transformational (39).2. The author's instruction concerning cross-cultural was helpful. Paul warns, \\"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind\\" (Rom. 12:2). Jesus demands an allegiance to his Kingdom and love of others (Niebuhr, 47). However, the church is also instructed not to love the world - \\"a culture that is concerned with temporal and passing values\\" (48). Christ versus culture, in its separatist extreme, influences methods such as monasticism and sectarianism. This approach bans all government involvement but establishes new social structures (56).Another item of instruction that was appreciated was the teaching of the Christ-of-culture method. The church has had to come to terms with \\"the universal meaning of the gospel, and the truth that Jesus is the savior, not of a selected little band of saints, but of the world\\" (105). He took great effort to express a holiness exemplified by action and a Kingdom with implications within government and religion (106). However, this approach does have the propensity to misrepresent the biblical Jesus. Proponents focus on sections, build upon them, and thus recreate an imaginary Messiah (109). Such doctrines affected are \\"sin, grace, and the Trinity\\" (110).3. The most helpful part of the book was the teaching on the paradox between Christ and culture. Martin Luther dangerously \\"discerned the rules to be followed in cultural life were independent of Christian or church law\\" (174). Dualism has thus led to a compartmentalization in government, science, business and education (185)4. The quotation that seemed particularly important was \\"In their understanding of sin the conversionists . . . note that [sin] is deeply rooted in the human soul, that it pervades all man's work, and that there are no graduations of corruption, however various its symptoms\\" (191). This method holds to a Creator who is involved in creation, a humanity that has chosen to rebel against him and a history that is a result of an interaction between the two (194). Such a perspective suggests that \\"Jesus is the transformer of culture . . . he redirects, reinvigorates, and regenerates\\" (209)."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"Very insightful and thought provoking. Made me question many of my views and my perspective of other Christians."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"Christians believe that Christ must somehow interact with culture. Some of these believe that this means that Christians interact best with their culture when completely removed from it; nonethless, this is stilla response.The Neibuhr brothers have been essential in the early 20th century neo-conservative movement. This book by Richard is no less importnat in modern theological development. It categorizes various approaches to culture as Christian try to live out their faith in these divisive times. Nonetheless, while it is not lacking in insight, it is somewhat too catagorical. Christians do not neatly fit into these boxes, and sometimes drift from one to another.One category, for example, &quot;Christ Transforming Culture&quot; is problematic. Most Christians view themselves as taking part in transforming culture. Clearly this is Neibuhr's preferential approach to culture, but his definition is by no means the same as that of someone that he would classify as Christ Against culture. To the ones of the latter category, is it not in the act itself of acting against culture (e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty) that we can truly transform it?Notwithstanding this critique, it is a good beginning to sociology and Christian thought."},{"Title":"Christ and culture","review":"The only helpful thing in this book was the description of the five types. This does provide a framework for analyzing different position. The types could have been defined in a much shorter work.The book does not offer clear Biblical argumentaion for or against differnt views.

For example he talks about Pauline and Johanine Theology as if they had separate, and contradictory on some points, views.With each view Neibhur talks about a few historical people who have held this view. These people are for the most part extremist who have taken one idea and thrown out the rest of the Bible. The majority of them were heretics. The association of each view with some very extreme exponents of it may give the conservative Christian the impression that the view itself is heretical (Which it may or may not be).More work needs to be done on this subject with Biblical argumentation for the different views.If in reading this book you are (as I was) attempting to develop a Biblical theology of Christ and Culture I believe you will find it a dissapointment."},{"Title":"Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology","review":"Bypassing computer security systems has sometimes been called an art rather than a science by those who typically do not interact with computing machines at a level that would allow them to appreciate the science behind security attacks. This book does not address the strategies of how to bypass security systems, but instead concentrates on how to use cryptographic methods to corrupt the machines once access has been acquired. Clearly the authors are very excited about the developments in cryptovirology, a relatively young field, that have taken place in the last five years. Their goal though is not to train hackers to break into systems, but rather to coach the reader on how to find vulnerabilities in these systems and then repair them. The subject of cryptovirology is fascinating, especially in the mathematics that is uses, and a thorough knowledge of its power will be required for meeting the challenges of twenty-first century network computing.After a \\"motivational chapter\\" that it meant to shed insight on what it is like to be a hacker, this being done through a collection of short stories, the authors move on to giving a general overview of the field of cryptovirology in chapter 2. The reader gets his first dose of zero-knowledge interactive proofs (ZKIPs), which allow a prover to convince a verifier of a fact without revealing to it why the fact is true. The authors point out that viruses are vulnerable once found, since their rudimentary programming can be then studied and understood. This motivates the introduction of public key cryptography into the payload of the virus, and it is at this point that the field of cryptovirology is born.Chapter 3 is more of a review of modular arithmetic, entropy generators, and pseudorandom number generators and can be skipped for those readers familiar with these. The authors emphasize the need for effective random number generators and in using multiple sources for entropy generation. They also introduce the very interesting concept of a \`mix network', which allows two mutually distrusting parties to communicate securely and anonymously over a network. \`Onion routing' is discussed as a method for implementing asynchronous mix networks. Mix networks can be used to hide the propagation history of a worm or virus.In chapter 4, the authors discuss how to implement anonymous communication and how to launch a cryptotrojan attack that utilizes an anonymous communication channel. There are many applications of anonymous communication, one being E-money, and also, unfortunately, money laundering. The authors describe in fair detail how to conduct criminal operations with mix networks and anonymous money. This same technology though allows freedom of speech in geographical areas that are not sympathetic to it. Electronic voting, so controversial at the present time, is discussed as an activity that is very susceptible to the threat of stegotrojans or government violation of anonymity. Techniques for doing deniable password snatching using cryptovirology, and for countering it using zero-knowledge proofs, are also discussed.Chapter 5 introduces techniques for preventing the reading of counters when a virus is propagating from one machine to another. Known as \`cryptocounters', the authors discuss various techniques for constructing them, such as the ElGamal and Paillier public key cryptosystems.Private information retrieval (PIR), which allows the secure and private theft of information, is discussed in chapter 6, wherein the authors present a few schemes for performing PIR. These schemes, unfortunately, allow the theft of information without revealing anything about the information sought and without revealing anything about what is taken. The authors also introduce a concept that they call \`questionable encryptions', which are algorithms to produce valid encryptions or fake encryptions depending on the inputs. Related to question encryption, and also discussed in this chapter, are \`deniable encryptions', which allow the sender to produce fake random choices that result in the true plaintext to be kept secret. Also discussed is the topic of \`cryptographic computing', which allows computations with encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. The modular arithmetic used in this chapter is fascinating and well worth the read.Chapter 7 is by far the most interesting of the entire book, and also the most disconcerting if its strategies are ever realized. The goal of the chapter is to find out to what extent a virus can be constructed whose removal will damage the host machine. This, in the author's opinion, would be a genuine \`digital disease', and they discuss various scenarios for bringing it about, which are at present not realized, but could be in the near future. The approach discussed involves game theory, and the authors show how the payload of a virus can survive even after discovery of the virus. They give a very detailed algorithm on how to attack a brokerage firm, including the assumptions that must be satisfied by such an attack. The attack is mounted by deploying a distributed cryptovirus that tries to find three suitable host machines, and the attack consists of three phases, the first involving replication leading to the infection of the three machines, the second involving preparation for the attack, and third involving playing the two-player game. The host machines, to be acceptable for launching the attack, must either be \\"brokerage\\" machines, which have sensitive information available to the virus, or \\"reclusive\\" machines, which are machines that are not subjected to much scrutiny. The goal of the virus, according to the authors, is to give the malware purchasing power, and not direct monetary gain. The virus may then evolve over time to become a portfolio manager, and may even act as a surrogate for purchasing shares on behalf of the firm or client. Other possibilities for the virus are discussed, and the authors overview the security of the attack and its utility.I did not read the rest of the chapters in the book, so I will omit their review."},{"Title":"Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology","review":"This book presents an initial, interesting idea - could a computer virus be written that attacks a computer by encrypting the user's data? This could be a tool for extortion or a unique Denial of Service attack. Now this is not a new idea (eg: the KOH virus) but there is a new twist - the data is encoded with an asymmetric cipher, thus rendering it unrecoverable except to the virus writer. The authors state that such a virus has indeed been trialled in a proof-of-concept form, on a Macintosh SE30 (a nice machine to develop on, from memory) in System 6, so there's no \\"whoops, where's it gone?\\" problem. There is some detailed high level discussion of techniques and pitfalls. The authors then go on to describe how contemporary cryptographic technology may be adapted to the theft of information such as secure data and passwords. This is all done at the level of mathematical relationships - there is no viral code.Two new words are added to the language - cryptovirology (the study of computer viruses with a cryptographic payload, usually malicious) and kleptography (the application of cryptography to data theft).Here are a few chapter or section headings to give a taste of the themes running through this work: Through Hackers's Eyes; Cryptovirology; Deniable Password Snatching; Using Viruses to Steal Information; Computationally Secure Information Stealing; The Nature of Trojan Horses; Subliminal Channels.The book starts with an accessible piece of fiction, but quickly progresses to the opaque style common to much academic writing in this field. The reader is well advised to brush up on matrix algebra, Jacobians and Abelian and non-Abelian groups and to have a working knowledge of computer viruses (however obtained). There are appendices intended to provide brief tutorials on computer viruses and public key cryptography. But both these very different specialised fields require far more study than any pr&eacute;cis can provide.While the writing is often hard going there is an enjoyable first chapter describing three incidents in the life of a virus writer (a student at a US university) as he writes and releases a virus. It provides a vicarious experience of the motivation for such activity - the mental challenge, the adrenalin rush and the exercise of secret power.The writing, as referred to above, is uneven and there seems to be some confusion as to who the audience is for this work. Some seems to have come from one of the authors' doctoral thesis - you have been warned! It's an academic work, so academic cryptographers would be the principal readers. But since it's offered for sale to the public, one wonders who else would read it? We can rule out some groups. If you refer to yourself as \\"133t\\", then you can count yourself out, as can those wannabees who capture virus code, do a partial rewrite, add their handle, then release their \\"new\\" version. There is no rip-off virus code here. Even whoever wrote Nimda or Code Red or NetSky will find this heavy going, competent thought they are in the mysteries of mobile code and system calls. Certainly anti-virus software coders will find this of little use. If I can let my imagination run free, perhaps also the legendary Hidden Masters of cyberspace, those hackers beyond \\"elite\\" in their esoteric knowledge, who work alone, do not meet other hackers except deep behind some firewall and who are never suspected, let alone arrested, perhaps they will be inspired to even greater feats of data theft. But then we'd never know, would we?"},{"Title":"Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology","review":"For some time now we have been taught that modern cryptography offers an elegant solution to a number of problems. Communicate securely? use a VPN; identify the author of a document? use a digital signature; securely encrypt e-mail? use PKI. But what if the very power behind these solutions can itself be [misinterpreted]? If such is the case, then encryption can be a curse, a digital signature an illusion and the heralded savior an unconquerable nemesis. This is the essence of what this book is about.To be sure this is not easy reading. It is adult material, meaning that thinking is required. But it could not be otherwise, the material would not allow it. However the reader will be well rewarded for every morsel of math they endeavor to puzzle through. The realization of the potential dark side of modern cryptography is the first step in preparing to defend against it. This book provides that realization.The reader may find the first few chapters to be an entertaining fictional account of some days in the life of a hacker. Indeed, the text reads beautifully as such. But here is a chilling thought - what if the events described were real?"},{"Title":"Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology","review":"The whole first chapter of this book is a piece of low-grade Gibsonesque cyber-punk.

Why are the authors killing trees with that kind of garbage in a book on malware technology?The rest of the book is fairly informative, although it seems to be padded with a lot of supporting information about things like good vs. bad random number generators. People who have enough background to understand the threats the authors are describing probably don't need a refresher course in algorithms.

The drawbacks are his trust in Tallemant des Reaux (whose Historiettes are demonstrably false, too often, to be relied on) and his painting of Cardinal Richelieu as a complete caricature. That said, his picture of Louis is far too weak, overall. One has only to read Louis and Richelieu's correspondence over eighteen years to see that they were, within the formality of king and servant, friends. Both were intelligent, emotional and intense men, living incredibly demanding lives and battling chronic illnesses; it is hardly surprising they came near to breaking point with each other, not least when Cinq-Mars came onto the scene. The picture of Louis tolerating Richelieu because he feared him or grudgingly accepted that he needed him is nonsense, something straight out of the fiction Tallemant's malicious gossip started. A more balanced picture is to be had from the relevant chapters of A. Lloyd Moote's \\"Louis XIII: the Just\\"."},{"Title":"The King's minion: Richelieu, Louis XIII, and the affair of Cinq-Mars","review":"There's no doubt that this book makes a good read--truth is stranger than fiction, and the story of Louis XIII's sad obsession with Henri d'Effiat is strange indeed. Erlanger writes his account in a lively, accessible style that all can enjoy, and he manages to paint both Cinq-Mars and Louis in a reasonably sympathetic light, neatly avoiding the historian's usual tendency to turn Cinq-Mars into a martyred idiot and Louis XIII into a heartless tyrant.However, as another reviewer has pointed out, the book is fundamentally flawed by its reliance on Tallemant des Reaux as a reliable source of information. While most historians have sensibly treated him as little more than a gossip, Erlanger cites him (when he bothers to provide any citations at all) as his chief authority. This results in a book that often reads like The National Enquirer version of French history, with Erlanger repeating notoriously salacious tidbits as if they were historical fact: Louis XIII hated and feared the Cardinal! Richelieu slept with his own niece! Anne of Austria toyed with the Cardinal's infatuation with her! All titillating, and all extremely improbable.In short, if you're looking for entertainment and are willing to read with an entire shaker of salt, don't miss this book. If you're conducting serious historical research, or even just like your sources to be accurate and reliable, seek elsewhere. DP O'Connell's biography of Richelieu is a good place to start."},{"Title":"I NEVER SAW","review":"In this 1972 work, Judson Jerome, an outstanding American Poet and writer, and Helga Aichinger, a wonderful illustrator and artist in her own right, has brought to us a short book of poetry for children. Each page of this work offers a short poem of what a child sees during a dream. As with most dreams, their content consists of many things we will never see, some exciting, some mundane. We all understand this and it is fun to contemplate the, i.e. our dreams, and children are no different.I've watched the clouds of hours and hours,lying still upon my back,but never saw an eagle passwith wings so wide and black.orI never saw a hedgehog withan apple stuck upon his backhappily walking through the fields,beneath a sky so blackorI've never seen two lovers floatin such a tiny, pointed boat,where the moon glows in lake and skyand fish jump up as though to fly.This is a sampling of the short, descriptive and thoughtful poems offered. This is only half of it though. The art work here is quite impressive. Each poem is accompanied by a dark, dream like painting which fits perfectly with the poetic offering. The artist has used dark, dream like shades that fit the mood of the text perfectly. There is color, but it has bee used quite effectively here and there to offset the dream quality of the rest of the painting.This is a wonderful work to read with your child. The poems offered here are short and easy to understand, yet have a complexity to them that offer the opportunity for the adult to get into some great discussions with the child.All in all, this is another of those books out of print that we should not loose.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sea battles in miniature: A guide to naval wargaming","review":"A delightful book with suitable rules for learned, well read gentlemen to employ in the purpose of pushing miniature ships from all eras around the living room floor and invoking simulated combat while enjoying the company of other similarly minded people and quaffing a few beers.

The problem with this book is that as of now a lot of the earlier story arcs that made the series compelling have been completed.

One of the consistent strengths of the series is the level of detail we have of the characters - their relationships, their history (together and separate), their personal motivations. Another strength is often the complexity of the \\"murder mystery\\" aspect of each novel. This was an adequate entry into the series, but I don't feel that it did much to move things forward with regards to character development - except for giving more detail about Eve after she went into foster care, obviously.This was a change of pace for the \\"In Death\\" series because there was only a single murder victim. There was also very little threat posed for Eve, Roarke, Peabody, or any close friends. So, because of that, the way the story was told had to be different.But, it would have been a far better story if the killer hadn't been so glaringly obvious from the start. Normally, I can 'guess' the killer from the mid-point of the book, but this time the only challenge was determining how the killer and the victim were connected (and even that was laid out pretty early, too).Memory in Death is still worth a read because of the new aspects of Eve's history that are learned and because it gives another opportunity to see Eve settle into her marriage to Roarke. But, I personally would recommend borrowing it from the library or waiting for the paperback (which is my SOP now that the books are hardback new releases)."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I don't think I've read a Nora Roberts book in about 15 years. For a while I had read so many 'love' stories I just dont think I could have stomached another, not just from her, from anyone. I had no idea she'd been writing under the name JD Robb or that this book wasn't the first in a series, or that it was not a 'love' story.As I began reading, I did quickly realize this was not the first book with these characters. It wasn't because she kept flashing back as most writers tend to do with returning characters, say for example like the Kay Scarpetta series by Patricia Cornwell. It was more of a familiarity and a comfortableness with the characters and their world that's achieved only after writing about them before, like King with some of his characters from Derry. In fact, I now can't wait to read every one in this series, not just because of the 2 main characters that return in them all, but because she doesn't go back over everything trying to make it a stand alone book. It can be read out of series and it doesn't take away from the story. That lack of monotony in each should be refreshing for any avid reader. I was worried I wouldn't be able to identify with the characters without knowing more of their background but she gives just enough to make you 'get' them.The setting for this book would have drawn me to it no matter the writer. I love reading about how people think things will be in the future. 2059 isn't exactly far enough into the future to have any extreme changes in the world, but I wanted to see where she'd take it. She's very subtle in this book regarding futuristic lingo, dropping it here and there just enough to remind you this isn't the 2000's anymore. 'Links are the future phones (and PC's?) and personal 'links were most like cell phones, they have video all the time, when you answer your link you are staring at the person calling you and they see you and everyone can hear whatever is going on around you. She doesn't overwhelm you with the futuristic stuff, it's very subtle as I said. It's casually dropped into every day conversation such as 'Wanna watch some 'screen later?', it's immediately understood they'll watch t.v. There are also 'droids, they replace workers in areas such as hotel clerking and other instances I'm sure.In this book we see inside a cop's (Eve) world and into a time of her childhood she'd forgotten. Out of the blue a woman shows up in her office and she's traumatized by the memories of the abuse she suffered at the hands of this woman that she'd repressed for so many years. When the woman is brutally murdured while trying to reestablish a relationship with Eve by blackmailing her, she feels compelled to find out why, for herself and for the woman's son, who once helped her but who could also be a suspect. Nothing is given away, you discover all the details when she does, and you're not left knowing who the killer is faster than the character.

In the early books, Roarke has to coax every emotion out of her. This one shows that she really is \\"getting the hang of it\\" but yet was so moving in scenes like the one where she apologizes to Roarke for being jealous of his family. I also really enjoyed Eve letting go to enjoy Christmas with him (and who wouldn't?). There is some interesting irony in this one--where she and Peabody go to court to make sure Celina (\\"Visions in Death\\") pays for not taking action. Eve has a moment in this one where she remembers not stepping forward during an epsode at Trudy's house when she was a little girl. Roarke tells her that she was a child, and scared, and shouldn't blame herself. Interesting, though, that neither bring up Nixie (\\"Survivor In Death) who was also a little girl, but stepped up. It seems that \\"Survivor\\" is sort of a forgotten chapter in this series since neither this one, nor \\"Origins\\" refer to that book. All in all, I really enjoyed this one.

Robb, treats us to another installment in her Death series, a scant six months after ORIGIN IN DEATH. This series is properly considered to be \\"futuristic suspense\\" --- the books take place in the mid-21st century --- but such a classification ignores the strong elements of mystery, police procedure, and romance that inform each of the titles. Readers familiar with the series have witnessed the evolution of Eve Dallas, a believably difficult NYPD Homicide Detective who's married to the mysterious, charming and wealthy Roarke.Eve's past, always a shadowy presence in her life, comes back to haunt her when Trudy Lombard, her former foster mother, abruptly appears in her office. This has a dramatic and profoundly detrimental effect upon Eve due to the physical and emotional abuse Trudy heaped upon Eve while she was in her care. Trudy's intent is soon made clear. Attracted to Eve by Roarke's numerous and apparently bottomless pockets, she threatens to blackmail him and Eve with revelations about events that took place during Eve's childhood --- events that, it turns out, were engineered by Trudy. Roarke, who suffers neither fools nor thieves, quickly sends her packing. A few days later, however, Trudy is found brutally murdered in her hotel room.Robb wisely avoids the classic plot vehicle of having either Eve or Roarke appear to be responsible for her death and then having to work to clear themselves. Rather, the focus is on the locked door (with open window) mystery that is the heart of the book. Eve does not lack for plausible suspects, given that she was far from the only foster child who Trudy abused or who would have ample simmering motive for revenge as adults. There is also, of course, Trudy's son and daughter-in-law, who were staying in the same hotel just a few doors away from her, and the mysterious, shadowy figure who was Trudy's partner in crime.Veteran fans of the mystery genre --- even those without the resources of a Roarke in their life --- may well discern the culprit's identity ahead of Eve. Whether that is the case for you or not, however, the enjoyment of the novel is derived in large part from watching Eve, with invaluable assistance from Roarke, ferret out the clues and put them all together. What makes MEMORY IN DEATH unique from its predecessors is Eve's intimate though painfully acquired knowledge of Trudy's personality and motivation, a key factor in solving this particular crime.Fans of the science fiction genre who rarely venture into the mystery section of their bookstore should enjoy MEMORY IN DEATH due to the futuristic setting of the novel specifically and the Eve Dallas series in general. The speculative touches that Robb furnishes are just heavy enough to make the series special and just light enough that we in 2006 can almost see them coming. And given the quality invested in MEMORY IN DEATH, this long-running series should continue to have a bright future indeed.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I read Memory in Death over the weekend and enjoyed it very much. The investigation aspect of the book focused on just one killing this time, which seemed like a refreshing (and more realistic) change from some of the other books, which often have Eve chasing after a serial killer. So she wasn't up to her kneecaps in blood in this one. I also felt that the relationship between Eve and Roarke had a more substantial presence in this book. There's always some glimpse of their personal lives, and Roarke is always a key player in a new In Death book, but often his role is that of \\"Consultant, Civilian\\" and he's aiding in her investigation. While there was some of that in this book as well, we also got to see a lot more of their private lives. The cast of secondary characters is not as heavily featured as in past books, which is probably how and why we're able to have a more substantial visit with Eve and Roarke as a couple. (And it was nice to be a fly on the wall during their Christmas celebration, which was quite calm and homey and sweet.) I found myself missing some of the Usual Suspects a bit -- I would have enjoyed having more scenes with Peabody and McNab and Feeney and Commander Whitney and all the rest (although we got some time with Baxter and Trueheart, and that's always a good thing). My one real complaint about the \\"crime investigation\\" was that I didn't buy into the idea that Trudy's son seemed so oblivious to her real character. But I'm a fan of the series and was delighted enough with the rest of the book that I was able to get beyond that quibble."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"J D Robb/Nora Roberts is an amazing writer.

She is already plagued with memories of her father, and his demise at her hands. So imagine her surprise when her foster mother, Trudy Lombard shows up, full of fake motherly love, just to see how she is doing.Trudy, who is visiting New York days before Christmas(with a son and daughter-in-law in tow), claims that she has traveled from Texas because she saw Eve on the news talking about the Icove case. Of course it is obvious from the start that Trudy is only back to try to blackmail Eve or her insanely rich husband, Roarke. Would Roarke pay to hide what Trudy knows from being released to the media? If anyone knows Roarke from the series they already know the answer, and it is not because Roarke believes \\"his cop\\" is not worth $2 million dollars! For him, she is worth that and a lot more. So the adventure and discovery into the truth occurs hours later when after meeting with and being threatened by Roarke, Trudy shows up dead.The usual characters from the series appear and dazzle us as usual. Mavis (who is in her last stages of pregnancy), Summerset (who decides that they will call it quits for the holidays), Peabody & McNabb, Feeney, Nadine,Trueheart, Baxter, Commander Whitney, and a couple others (including the cat, Galahad). And we also find Eve struggling with the Christmas spirit, and Roarke's generosity. And although you won't be surprised who the killer is, you will love finding out about Eve's as a child and coming to understand her a little more. ."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I love the In Death series and have read every one of the books.

The only problem with finishing a J.D. Robb book is that you are left impatiently waiting for the next one."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This is an extremely enjoyable story, whether read as a standalone futuristic police procedural, a psychological study of the impact of psychological and physical abuse upon young girls, or the latest entry in J.D. Robb's very successful ... IN DEATH series featuring Lt. Eve Dallas. However, I would guess that those readers who are already devotees of the series and familiar with the background of many of the recurring characters will appreciate more fully the further development of the many familiar relationships which occur during the course of this Christmas season. Of course, Eve's husband Roarke plays a central role in this story; as usual her partner Peabody (whose Christmas celebration with McNab is potentially a source of great tension) and Feeney also both play significant roles during the course of this story, as do both Captain Whitney, and Dr.Mira as well (complemented this time by a crucial role played by her husband Dennis ).Despite the approach of Christmas and the festive appearance of NYC in December of 2059, \\"death was not taking a holiday ... Santa Claus was dead. And a couple of his elves weren't looking so good.\\" Thus opens MEMORY IN DEATH, with Eve surveying the horrific scene where Santa Claus was splattered on the sidewalk after a swan dive from the thirty-sixth floor of an office tower during a Christmas party. Surrounded by a crowd composed of both horrified tourists the thrill seekers attracted to such macabre events, Eve was attempting to elicit some background information about the tragedy which had not only killed Santa but also the hapless victim who happened to be at the point of impact in the center of Times Square. While this is an interesting case, its solution is relatively straightforward and is a function of the type of investigation described in any standard police procedural. It is in fact only the appetizer for the main course which is to follow.When Eve and Peabody return to the Station and interrogate their primary suspect, Eve agrees to allow Peabody to write up the report and do the case follow-up. She is thinking about Christmas, an event which is a source of both very confusing emotions for her as well as a great deal of tentativeness with regard to the tradition of gift giving and receiving and the festive partying with friends and relatives. As she enters her office, she is suddenly confronted by a Mrs. Lombard, an apparent stranger who attempts to embrace her and when rebuffed shocks her by exclaiming \\"why honey, Don't you know me? I'm your mama.\\" The woman breathlessly informs Eve that she heard about her on TV during the incredible national publicity which her last case generated (ORIGIN IN DEATH), and she has come to NYC to catch up with the events in her since the time when she (Trudy) had taken Eve into her home as a foster child. Her son Bobby and his new wife Zana are all there to enjoy the holidays, and want to have dinner with Eve. Eve's emotions are immediately in turmoil as childhood memories flood back and overwhelm her, and she angrily warns Trudy Lombard that she is no longer a helpless child and she better get out or Eve will put her \\"in a cage\\".Of course, Eve arrives home an emotional wreck and when she eventually recounts the story to Roarke, he reassures her that she has overcome her past and can handle this incident; he also immediately understands that Trudy will attempt to shake them down in some way to keep Eve's past out of public view. Trudy's confrontation with Roarke the next day quickly changes the dynamics of the situation, but just as she has underestimated Roarke, they underestimate her tenacity as well. Suddenly the situation changes dramatically when Eve decides to confront Trudy and discovers Trudy's dead and battered body in her hotel room. While Eve can feel absolutely no remorse for Trudy, she is determined to prove her professionalism by assuming the role of primary investigator on the case.From this point forward in the story, Eve's celebration of Christmas and gradual understanding of the way the human bonds of friendship are strengthened and deepened by such celebration are totally intertwined with the way in which the case draws her back into repressed memories of her past. She is forced to bring to the surface long buried recollections of many details of her horrific childhood (which she has overcome); the litany of psychological abuse inflicted by Trudy is truly horrendous and very effectively fills in further gaps in Eve's childhood both for Roarke and long time readers of this series. She also remembers the small occasional acts of kindnesses by Bobby during her life in that house of horrors, and now can feel the gratitude that her couldn't fully appreciate at the time. The search for suspects soon leads Eve to contact other foster children \\"cared for\\" by Trudy, and the full extent of the horror which this manipulative witch inflicted on many children leads Eve to conclude that in all likelihood her death was the result of vengeance occasioned by Trudy's attempt to blackmail other victims who didn't have the resolve or the means to resist her.As the investigation reaches its conclusion and Eve gradually focuses in on the murderer, the outcome is destined to exact a further psychological toll upon her. Fortunately, the depressing elements of the murder investigation are offset by the many positive aspects of this Christmas season for Eve. In some ways, it appears that this is the case which may finally force Eve to fully confront her past and thus allow her to emotionally move beyond it. The major unanswered question is how she will react to the upcoming childbirth by Mavis Freestone of the first child for she and Leonardo (of course they make an appearance here), since she and Roarke have promised to participate during the birth.I strongly recommend this book for all fans of police procedurals, especially those who appreciate a significant injection of character development. Since I became hooked on this series by reading SURVIVOR IN DEATH, I have chosen to read all the new releases while also starting at the beginning in order to better understand the backstory and the references to Eve's previous cases. As I mentioned earlier, I certainly highly recommend this book as a standalone story if you have neither the time nor inclination to read what has become a quite extensive stories. However, I would strongly recommend that readers who like such series with a futuristic element read at least the first three novels of the ... IN DEATH series in the order written (NAKED..., GLORY..., IMMORTAL...) for two reasons (even though I do not rate them as highly as the later entries). First, as the best method of becoming gradually exposed to the elements in Eve's background which have formed her personality in the extremely effective manner which the author has devised; the evolution of the tone of the series and Eve's personality is both interesting and profound. Second, the extensive cast of continuing characters is an integral element in the enjoyment of the series, and there is too great an amount of material for the reader of just a single story to fully appreciate the context.I will close with two final observations concerning this story. First, perhaps I have simply read a sufficient number of stories in this series so that the futuristic elements seem less noticeable than previously, but it seemed to me that in many ways with only a few minor modifications this story could have been set in the present and that the futuristic elements were basically only minor embellishments. Second, it struck me as somewhat out of character that there was no reference to any concern on Eve's part that this case and the concomitant investigation of Trudy's role in Eve's past had the potential to publicly reveal her deepest secrets and thus traumatize her once again as well as permanently change her relationship with her associates.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I'm so glad that J. D. Robb (also known as Nora Roberts) is a prolific writer, as it means that I normally don't have long to wait between episodes of the In Death series. In her latest, Memory In Death, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is confronted with one of her more emotionally trying cases to date... the murder of her foster mother.Christmas 2059 is rolling around, and Dallas is trying to clean up a scene where a Santa flew out a window hyped up on drugs. Just another day at the office until she gets back to the station, only to find a woman waiting for her there. This lady claims that she's Eve's foster mother, a person that Eve hated with a passion. She gets tossed out, and Eve starts dealing with the emotional turmoil of reliving her past (which is gruesome). The reason for the woman's visit becomes clear, however, when she shows up at Roarke's office and attempts to blackmail him and Dallas to the tune of $2 million to not turn over files pertaining to her abusive childhood. Roarke also throws her out, and promises to kill her with his bare hands if she doesn't leave New York immediately. Problem is, someone beats him to it, and she's found murdered in her hotel. Eve ends up first on the scene, and really should dismiss herself from the case. But she feels it's her duty to stand up for the victim, regardless of how she feels about the person. There's no clear clues as to who might have done her in, but Eve's gut says that her son and daughter-in-law, vacationing with the lady, are somehow tied in...As I've stated on just about every other In Death review, I really love this series. I started this book on a Saturday morning, and it was done by Saturday night. I won't even think about the things I *should* have gotten done that day that remained unfinished. This storyline fills out more of Eve's childhood, from the point where she killed her abusive father until she left foster care. It's been alluded to in the past, but never fleshed out in this detail. And even though the original meeting threw her for a loop, I got the feeling that confronting this ghost from her past might also help her deal with the nightmares of her father. Just a guess... As always, well written and an extremely enjoyable read.And when's the next one coming out???"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Kudos to the author,for never disappointing her readers for this character, Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke! Their adventures, in the future as a police detective & spouse, are always filled with suspense. Even knowing Eve will \\"always speak for her victims\\", the story lines are never dull. The saucy life she lives with her husband and friends, is full of entertainment. Worth getting involved with these stories about Eve! She will pull at your heart & soul!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"JD Robb shifts gears again, giving us a slow-paced whodunit with a different set of bad memories on Eve Dallas' mind. On the heels of wrapping up a Santa splattered on the sidewalk, an unpleasant memory walks into Eve's office. Trudy Lombard had been Eve's foster mother for six months following Eve's escape from her sadistic father. Trudy Lombard had delivered her own forms of torture, and Eve boots her from her office.Eve's husband Roarke is utterly unsurprised when Ms. Lombard visits him to try to shake him down for $2 million. He flicks her off and throws one hell of a holiday party, and he and Eve get a shock when they find Lombard murdered in her hotel room. Lombard had come to New York with her son Bobby and his wife Zana, who had a room down the hall. Eve gets them moved to one of Roarke's hotels while she and her partner Peabody run through what few clues they have, figuring out who murdered a thoroughly hateful woman.Eve is plagued with strange new dreams as she dredges up new memories from her past that are only slightly less nightmarish than the usual fare. Sprinkled in between is plenty of quality time with Roarke and some holiday gift giving.While not the gripping page-turner the last Robb novel was, I happen to enjoy an author who can mix it up, and this was definitely different fare. I also liked the touch of Eve dealing with her foster care memories rather than yet again reliving the nightmare she suffered at her father's hands. Eve gets the added jolt of a sense of family as she connects with other victims of Trudy Lombard, whose beginnings were as joyless as hers. While I had the killer pegged right off, the information isn't held back terribly long, and the story spends time delving into Eve's psyche in a more detached and accepting way than before.A quiet, almost ambling read, this is nonetheless another gem in the JD Robb collection."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Nora Roberts, aka JD Robb had me riveted to the latest installment in the LT. Eve Dallas series. Thought it's not terribly difficult to figure out the who in whodunit, it's the why and how. Roberts leaves clues for avid readers who may or may not pick up on them and weaves a tale that will keep readers on edge.A former foster mother of Eve's is murdered in this installment. And Eve is the primary on the investigation. With minimal help from Roarke - unusual compared to the past few in the series - Eve wraps up the case in her usual cool, cop-like fashion.I love how Roberts has developed the relationship with Eve and her husband, Roarke and hope that in the next few books they have a baby. A pregnant Eve and expectant Roarke would give this series an added zing. And likely push the herione to pursue Captain status, a desk job she isn't quite yet ready for.For those who have not kept up, you can read these out of order. Roberts is deft with sentences that clue you in on the past cases that have tied the relationships of Eve and Roarke and their friends and coworkers throughout the series."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Again, another wonderful \\"in Death\\" by Nora.

A plus for me! Nora writes him with flair. I enjoyed this book, seeing another terrible aspect of Eve's past played out again to disrupt her life. But....I thought Eve's heart wasnt really into the solution of this crime. And what I know of the court system, the culprit will manage to do a lot less than 25 to life.Also, I think Nora is morphing into Eve with her backcover picture. It describes Eve perfectly. Nice duds, Nora. Time Square????I will keep reading the \\"in Death\\" series as long as Nora keeps writing them. My collection is growing from paperbacks to the well worth it hardcovers.

I keep thinking, as I open each one, \\"this one has to be bad, she can't keep this up this long.\\" And each time I'm wrong. And I'm wrong again.Memory in Death is another excellent entry in the Eve Dallas saga. The spectre of her childhood rears its ugly head in the form of an abusive foster mother who shows up to try and shake her and Roarke down. This fails of course, but the woman ends up dead and a trail of other foster children who endured much the same as Eve fill the suspect list.As always, the foundation of the book is the relationship between Eve and Roarke. And I don't mean in romance novel fashion because these books have a romance element but they aren't really romance. But in earlier books, Eve's struggle to get past the nightmare of her youth was more prevalent and played a bigger part. This time, her childhood played a big part but it did not plague her as it did before. Because Eve has moved on.A series this long with the same central characters must have them grow or it gets stagnant. I'm quite pleased to see Eve becoming a better person and not one hobbled by her past anymore.The same cast of characters Roberts/Robb has introduced in the previous books - McNabb and Peabody, Sommerset, Feeney, Trueheart and Nadine are all back but in an interesting enough configuration that it stays fresh.I'll still be anxiously awaiting the next installment in July (and wondering if in fact, Nora Roberts is a cylon for her amazing productivity)"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"In \\"Memory in Death,\\" Lieutenant Eve Dallas is confronted with her cruel and sadistic former foster mother, who is seeking to extort a large sum of money from the ever-protective Roarke. She then is murdered, and Eve takes it upon herself to solve the case.This mystery is much less layered and technical than her previous installment and contained several things that I really liked and one or two that I really, really didn't.What I liked: seeing Eve's vulnerable side, avoiding the cliche of having either her or Roarke be suspects in Trudy's murder, her own mixed feelings about solving the case, Peabody's growth as a character and as a person, Eve's encounters with her foster-brother.What I didn't: how obvious it was who murdered Trudy, the \\"female villain\\" stereotypes Ms. Robb invokes - women are bitchy, conniving, etc, only reinforced with the reappearance of a female villain from another book. Also, just for a change, might we have a book in this series that pushes some else's buttons, who isn't Eve? What about Roarke? Or Whitney? Feeney? Baxter? Don't any of these guys have unpleasant family secrets or past crime-solving activities that might get them in trouble? (Okay, we've had one with Feeney, but still).

However, this entry seems to be particularly formulaic. The villain is a rip-off of at least three other characters in the previous book, someone who appears innocent but in fact is not; Eve's back story is developed to new, Dickensian levels to the point that credulity is stretched; and there's just no reason for the continued bickering between the two main characters.

I have read some of Nora Roberts' other books and I tend to get a little bored after 2 or 3 of them in a row. However, ALL of the Memory books have been excellent and keep you hanging right up to the end. There have been a couple that I have figured out \\"who done it\\" before it's revealed, but there is still always an interesting twist thrown in there for Dallas to try and prove it. And then, of course, all of the personal relationships between the characters is facinating.

Not predictable by any means but you can always rely on her for an enjoyable read. The 'In Death' books always manage a couple of surprises no matter how many or how long running the series has been. This particular story is no exception. It's not so much the actual mystery of who did the murder (you do start to suspect the killer before the end)but the real appeal is following Eve and her cast of supporting characters as they solve the crime. The process they go through and the personal interaction of the characters as they proceed is as fascinating in this book as it was in the first 'In Death' book. Roberts manages to reveal something more about her characters (like Eve's experiences with foster care as a child in this case) with each book while still holding back enough to have you waiting for the next book to learn more. The relationships and personalities are the real treasure in these books and Roberts does a great job of pulling them into a good story for our reading enjoyment. I buy the hard copies as soon as they are released now because I simply can't wait for the paperback release. I think it is obvious there is alot of life left in this cast of characters. Thanks again Nora!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I absolutely love reading J.D. Robb's books. I have read the very first book she has written all the way through to Memory in Death. I just can't get enough. The characters are wonderful and all people you can relate to. There is always a Mavis, Eve and a Peabody that one knows. But the thrilling part is that they take you right to the scene of the crime and you're part of the team throughout the story. The plots are always great and leaves you grasping for more and what's going to happen next. The only thing that I regret is that J.D. Robb just doesn't write fast enough. I definitely need more than one book a year."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I liked this book. But I liked it more for the character developement than the murder mystery. I liked hearing about another chapter of Eve's past (although would it kill Ms. Robb to give Eve ONE happy memory in her childhood? It wouldn't make Eve any less cynical if she just had one shining moment), but the murder mystery was just dull. So painfully obvious who the killer was.I found the same problem with the last book. The killer's identity is getting more obvious with every book. The character development made up for the lack of surprise at revelation of the killer's identity.I'm still looking forward to the next book, I just hope the murder mystery has more \\"oomph\\" to it."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I HAVE AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT(15 YEARS TO BE EXACT),SO TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO LIVES AND WORKS IT 24/7...THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I like almost all of the J.D.

I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion.But anyhow.I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer.It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad.The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens.Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah.I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together.It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on.No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems.Boring.I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them.And why now do we have to be cross with Mira?It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit.Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much.So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed.Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown.Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end.I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together.And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.Okay.Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"The In Death series is fabulous but the quality of the paperbacks recently has been awful.

But it seems Nora has lost the edge with this series. Most of the orginal side plots have been worked out--and the loss of Eve's more neurotic behaviors tied to those was what I found enjoyable. It seems like I keep buying these books just to get a few more fragments into Eve's/Roarke's histories--and those are meted out stigily every 3rd book or so. I knew right after the murder \\"whodunnit\\" and then read 200 pgs of fairly lackluster situations before getting my gold star. Perhaps I have just grown out of the place where I identified with this series, but I can still joyfully reread many of the earlier books."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I enjoyed this book - everything from the witty banter, the resolution to the conflict with Dr. Mira, the words between Roarke and Eve, and how it resolves.

I read these books less for the mystery plot but more for the character developement and interactions. I think when you read a \\"series\\" involving the same characters they become as important as or more important than the actual plot. Eve Dallas has come a long way since Naked in Death. The books are a bit repetitive about her past abuse, etc. but show her evolving personally - she is developing more insight into her interactions and feeling for people around her. A softer side of Eve Dallas showed in this book."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I enjoyed this book because it filled in alot of the background on Eve.

Eve and Roarke seem to moving beyond their usual hang ups, or at least to recognize them faster. It's refreshing to see them getting more in sync with each other. The surrounding plots are also moving along at a satisfying pace and I also liked that JDR didn't force characters into the story just to let us know how they're doing. I found this new information on Eve's past to be well integrated. I especially appreciated that no one close to Eve was even suspected of being implicated in the crime. The plot doesn't beat my favorite \\"Loyalty in Death\\", and may have been more mind games than action driven, but it was well crafted and satisfying. My favourite part, though, was another glimpse into Eve's past, through her last Christmas Present to Roarke. I won't ruin the pleasure of reading about it within the context of the book, but I liked the image that was created. It doesn't always have to be about abuse and torture with her. After my disappointing experience with \\"Survivor in Death\\" I was happy to see a more human, more approachable private Eve, complement her hard-hitting, unbeatably tough, cop from the tips of her hair to the soles of her no-nonesense boots personna."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"In the year 2059, Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the New York Police and Security Department walks into her office and finds a nightmare sitting on her chair.

Robb/Nora Roberts' \\"In Death\\" series takes place at Christmas, and Eve has actually begun to enjoy the holiday, a big change from times past! The discomfort she feels at buying gifts (which nevertheless she does) and enjoying the lavish decorations with which Roarke decorates their house forms a welcome backdrop to the latest murder at hand:A woman (Trudy) who once served as a foster mother for the young, abused Eve surfaces in New York to blackmail Eve and Roarke. Trudy was worse than the wicked stepmother of every fairy tale, and Eve has a near breakdown just seeing her in person again. Before Eve and Roarke even have time to appropriately combat the blackmail threat, Trudy is found murdered in her hotel room.The body is found by Trudy's sweet, winsome, nauseatingly submissive daughter-in-law, Zana, who is married to Trudy's only son and only biological child, Bobby. Eve remembers Bobby as a child who snuck food to her when she was locked without food into her bedroom, and that compassion complicates the case.It's not hard for the reader to figure out who the murderer is, but that's not really the point. The real point is how Eve is going to gather enough evidence to make the accusation stick--and how she is going to battle her own demons while doing so. Because there is a huge part of Eve that is darn glad to see Trudy dead--and yet she must bury that feeling and fight for justice as she does in every other case.I loved this book. I love them all, but this was, unlike some of the more serious stories, lots of fun. Question for the next book in the series: How are squeamish Roarke and Eve going to serve as birth buddies for Mavis? You have to know the series to know just how funny that is. Nevertheless, it's easy to read \\"Memory in Death\\" as a stand-alone, even if you have not read any of the others."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"She looks like a stranger, but she introduces herself to Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas as her mother. Eve's memories have been suppressed, but she remembers that horrible period when social services parked her with this abusive and cruel woman. Eve rejects her, but Trudy Lombard is not content--and visits Eve's husband, billionaire Roark, with a blackmail threat. Either Roark pays Trudy or Trudy will release all of the files of Eve's childhood.Hours later, Trudy is dead and Eve is the officer on the scene. She intends to find the killer, but how can she summon the moral energy to really care about who killed a woman who was nothing but a cruel blackmailer?Author Nora Roberts (writing as J. D. Robb) continues her Eve Dallas futuristic mystery series with an emotionally rich adventure. Eve continues to struggle to fit in, to create healthy relationships with the people of her life. In the Christmas season, Eve's social skill limitations come particularly into focus. Having a woman appear out of the horrible days of her past makes all of her fears come alive. Eve's sidekick, Detective Peabody, is going through similar doubts as her boyfriend insists that she accompany him to meet his family in Scotland--all while Peabody is unable to lose that stuborn five pounds of excess weight.If you're new to this series, you're in for a treat. Roberts/Robb combines just enough mystery with emotional richness to spin an engaging story. Troubled Eve, spunky Peabody, perfect Roark, and the Eve's usual lot of supportive friends and fellow cops all keep up the reader interest. Eve's emotional engagement with the mystery helps us care about more than simply finding who-dunnit."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This book was even more interesting because it is different from the previous books.

It is a tale of pain and growth and of memories for the good Lieutenant.Roarke and Eve's relationship has its ups, downs and rocky patches and yet its almost as interesting as the mystery.

But not bad at all on the whole.An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"What can I say, that hasn't been said before? I love this series. I love the way the characters grow and learn about each other."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I loved this installment of the \\"In Death\\" series because we finally get a glimpse into Eve's life after she killed her father. Eve was in foster care, and the woman she was sent to live with was a piece of work. She tormented the children in her care, and wasn't above fraud and other crimes. When she learns of Eve's marriage to wealthy Roarke, she sees her chance at the big time. She shows up on Eve's door demanding money to keep silent about her past. When she shows up dead the next day, Roarke is the number one suspect.This was a good old fashioned murder mystery, without some of the wilder elements in previous books (clones!). Though many readers will figure out who the killer is quickly, the main draw here is Eve's single-minded focus to clear Roarke's name. And as ever, Peabody is by her side bringing humor and humanity to the tale. I also enjoyed the scenes with Roarke's personal assistant. She's a great example of a well-done minor character. I can't recommend this series enough."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"'Memory in Death' was my introduction to the 'in death' series, and it took me a few pages to get my bearings, but after that I settled in for quite an enjoyable ride. While I found the identity of the killer to be relatively easy to figure out, I also found it didn't matter that I'd figured it out. The real mystery wasn't so much 'whodunnit' as 'howdunnit.' How was the murder carried out? How was it covered up? And how could it be proven?'Memory in Death' is very much a character-driven story. Rather than being filled with action scenes or gore, this story focused on the people. Most of the details came out through dialogue rather than action, and the characters are interesting enough that I enjoyed that.One of my first thoughts when I started reading Memory in Death was \\"wow, is this over-the-top.\\" That was quickly followed however, by, \\"and it's perfect!\\" Roberts/Robb gleefully indulges in everything that makes over-the-top detective novels and mysteries fun, and infuses it with a dollop of romance for good measure. It seems clear that she's writing for the fun of it and thoroughly enjoying what she's doing, and as a result her books are equally enjoyable to read. The characters are fun, wacky, and larger-than-life; the mysteries are suitably labyrinthine; the setting is just futuristic enough to allow her to shape her world to her whim without making it alien to the reader."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I quite enjoyed this. One reason being that for a change Roarke is allowed to show his nasty side...to Trudy...who turns into the victim of murder a few pages later. The more boring In Death books are all those where Roarke is turned into some kind of opinionless crutch for his wife. Which is most of them nowadays. Also. Eve shows her selfish side and then has to apologise to her husband. I enjoyed that too.Towards the end of the book, the perp, Marnie calls Eve a hypocrite. I agree with her. Eve says that she would have prefered that sadistic foster mom, Trudy, should have been tried for her child abuse crimes and then put in a cage for many many years. But who would have the guts to see that justice was done? Not Eve. She had shut Trudy out of her mind and turned into a pathetic quivering coward the first time she saw her in her adult life. Yet Marnie, another abused foster kid had the balls to hand out vengeance and then had to suffer Eve at her sermonising, insufferably moralising worst. The case of Trudy's death should have been left unsolved and quietly closed.In any case. This is a prime example of a crime some police forces categorise as 'no humans involved.' That is, one felon committing a crime upon another felon. Why a fairly decent human being such as Eve feels any personal attachment to Trudy is beyond my understanding.Despite all that. Like I said I enjoyed this novel. Mainly because there are lots of scenes between Roarke and Eve. One relationship that continues to ring false however, is the one between Eve and Summerset. There really is no need for Eve to be so constantly abusive to Sommerset, who is essentially a well-loved servant. Sometimes it seems that she's bullying him. Seeing how she's married to his employer. By now all the readers realise that if it came to a choice between Summerset and Eve, Roarke would choose his wife every time."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"After Eve Dallas killed her father, she was taken into foster care. The first person who took her in was Trudy Lombard.

Eve knows that Trudy isn't here for sentimental reasons, and is quickly proven corect. Trudy trys to blackmail her, and Roarke for $2 million.

As it turns out, Trudy gave many other childrne her special brand of care, and Eve soon relises shes going to have to take down some one who went through exactly what she did.This is the most personal in Death novel.

When Eve panics and throws her out, Trudy makes her true motives known when she visits Roarke at his office, and demands two million dollars to keep quiet about Eve's troubled past. Roarke refuses, threatens Trudy into leaving them alone, and advises her that her best course of action would be to return, quietly, to Texas.That, of course, isn't the end of Trudy Lombard. When Eve decides to face Trudy one last time, to insist that she'll get no monetary gain from either her or her husband, they find Trudy dead in her hotel room--and her distraught son, Bobby, and his wife, Zana, are both horrified and heartbroken.Eve sets out to find out who killed her former foster mother, while battling with the horrendous memories that surface from Trudy's sudden reappearance into her life. As she struggles to balance her home life with Roarke with the death of a woman who only added to her pain and misery all those years ago, Eve is once again faced with her past, and forced to overcome it.MEMORY IN DEATH is another winner in J.D.

No reindeer or sleigh to catch him - only Lt. Eve Dallas and Detective Peabody trying to keep the crowd back. It is Christmas 2059.Seems that there had been a company party with refreshments primarily consisting of liquor and chemical packages. Enough to make Santa try to fly over the chimney tops. While Eve well knew she couldn't pin murder on the drug seller, she thought she could get him for something. He was found at Zero's, which was one step up from a dive with revolving bar and private cubicles. The provider is Zero himself, a pint size package of bravado in a loud suit.Once Eve and Peabody take him in, it is Peabody who interrogates and gets him to give himself up. Case is almost closed, but Eve isn't there to see about it because she has an unexpected and unwanted visitor in her office - Trudy Lombard, her former foster mother, a woman who enjoyed raining insults and abuse on nine-year-old Eve. At the sight of her Eve crumbles as memories of her desperate childhood surface.

As time goes on, I find myself waiting longer to read these books. They just aren't a \\"must read\\" any more.Like: The humor! No one does this aspect as well.The mystery, when it is actually a mystery.Her friends - what an amazing assortment of characters.Dislike: The whining. Its more than time for Eve to face up to her past - or not. just do it one way or the other. Other people (in real life) with much less going for them (supportive spouse & friends, job, respect and so on) have managed to face thier pasts in a healthier way than Eve. I do tire of reading about the horrific abuse in every book. Isn't it time for Roarke to use his influence and find her parents? We all know the man she killed wasn't really her father, right? She has to be a much-missed child from good parents.The sex. Perhaps some people read Robb for the sex scenes but they bore me. I find they bring the series down rather than elevating it. These scenes I skip and its easy to do since, once they start, they invariably take up the rest of the chapter. Why not leave these scenes to the heavy-breathing historical type stuff she writes?Love Roarke but dislike that we have to always hear what a bad boy he was. This book kind of moved away from that. Kind of.Overall, its just time for the main characters to grow up and stop sniveling. There are people out there in the world with ever so much less than either one of them have who managed to overcome. Why not make these characters like that?Oh, and what is with the \\"stand for\\"? Someone is always standing for someone. Its written in such a way I just know that no one would ever really talk like that. And its said much too often. She has used that phrase in other books as well (& other series). Perhaps she does know people who speak like that, but I have yet to meet one. Sometimes her characters come across as almost comic when she places words in their mouths that just aren't thiers.All that said, I honestly do enjoy Robb, but for the mystery and the humor and the relationships. The cop work is usually good, but its been missing. Basically, I could do without all the sex (some romance is lovely) and truly appreciate a good detective story written by a talented woman."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Eve Dallas walks into her office and immediately is confronted with her past. There sits Trudy Lombard, one of her foster parents during her time in Dallas, a woman who'd best be described as \\"Mommie Dearest.\\" Unprepared, Eve handles the situation poorly and has a physical reaction that levels her. When Roarke discovers what has happened, he smartly realizes it won't be long before Trudy will visit him for a shakedown. This book is worth the read if solely to read that scene!That's all I'll share about the story so you'll have the pleasure of following what happens next. This book is a treacherous path down Eve's memory lane and we gain lots of insight into her past in addition to an intriguing murder mystery she and Peabody are tasked to solve. It's interesting and the culprit isn't easy to identify but it's possible.This ranks as one of my favorites in the series both for the mystery/suspense and the peeling back of Eve's many layers."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"J.D. Robb continues her excellent series with yet another great installment. In this book, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is forced to confront painful memories from her past when one of her foster mothers, Trudy Lombard, surfaces at the police station to talk to Eve. Trudy had left emotional scars on Eve and memories of cold baths, being locked in the dark, and scrubbing the kitchen with a toothbrush overwhelm her. Eve leaves the police station instead of wrapping up an investigation, which is so out of character that Peabody contacts Eve's husband, Roarke. When Roarke arrives home, he finds Eve huddled under the hot shower. This is the last weak moment for Eve as she pulls herself together to face her emotions at seeing Trudy again. Meanwhile, Roarke is furious and fully expects Trudy to visit him as well as he suspects blackmail is behind Trudy's return. Sure enough, Trudy attempts to extort $2 million dollars from Roarke at his office; the resulting scene is very powerful and displays Roarke's full capabilities. Eve wants to confront Trudy herself and Eve and Roarke go to Trudy's hotel to tell her they will not be subjected to blackmail. However, Trudy is dead and the rest of the novel focuses on Eve's investigation into Trudy's death. Eve also has to cope with her own indifference to Trudy's death as she generally feels a sense of compassion for the victims. This was a highly enjoyable read and a great addition to the series. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"With \\"Memory In Death\\" Nora Roberts writing as J. D. Robb shows readers a very vulnerable Eve Dallas, making an already affecting character even more appealing. Of course, her courage and strength are evident yet this Eve elicits our sympathy as well as our respect. Needless to say, it's one more suspense filled page-turner from this popular author.The old holiday tune \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' To town\\" was given new meaning when St. Nick plunged some 36 stories to the pavement below. No reindeer or sleigh to catch him - only Lt. Eve Dallas and Detective Peabody trying to keep the crowd back. It is Christmas 2059.Seems that there had been a company party with refreshments primarily consisting of liquor and chemical packages. Enough to make Santa try to fly over the chimney tops. While Eve well knew she couldn't pin murder on the drug seller, she thought she could get him for something. He was found at Zero's, which was one step up from a dive with revolving bar and private cubicles. The provider is Zero himself, a pint size package of bravado in a loud suit.Once Eve and Peabody take him in, it is Peabody who interrogates and gets him to give himself up. Case is almost closed, but Eve isn't there to see about it because she has an unexpected and unwanted visitor in her office - Trudy Lombard, her former foster mother, a woman who enjoyed raining insults and abuse on nine-year-old Eve. At the sight of her Eve crumbles as memories of her desperate childhood surface.

A wonderful story and actually a welcome break from the previously more gory \\"Origin in Death\\"."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Memory in Death is the latest in the in Death series written by J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts. This latest novel is set at Christmas, just a couple of weeks after the conclusion of the Icove case of Origin in Death, and the two novels are very strongly connected. For, the concomitant publicity wrought by the resolution of the Icove case is the primary cause for the action of the new novel.In brief, Trudy Lombard who was once Eve Dallas's foster mother, an abusive and sadistic woman, catches the news about the Icove case which features the primary Eve Dallas, married to the fabulously wealthy Roarke. Resolved to be repaid for having housed Dallas for a few months, Lombard comes to New York City with intent to blackmail Dallas and Roarke so she will be silent about Dallas's traumatic childhood. Though Dallas is badly shaken and spun into the black well of her traumatic childhood memories, she rejects Lombard, as does Roarke whom the woman later approaches. The action of the novel commences when Dallas and Roarke set out to Lombard's hotel to face her down together and discover her murdered with her body showing signs of a severe beating.Fans of J.D. Robb are doomed to disappointment if they come to Memory in Death expecting the tension and bloody trails that are the hallmark of previous novels or even the philosophical musings that are the subtext of Origin in Death. Instead, Memory in Death mirrors the slowing down of business activity-even cop business-that occurs as Christmas nears; thus, it pays homage to the Christmas season in spite of its unorthodox opening with the death of a party Santa.Though restraining the central characters to the investigation of one murder, Robb retains the sense of the diurnal occurrence of murder by having other investigative officers report in to Dallas on the progress of their cases. This is something that she has seldom done even though readers sometimes hear about the case-load of a regular like Baxter. Thus, Robb slows down the pace, reduces the frantic urgency, and so sets the stage for what Christmas is about: loved ones, family, and friends.In a sense, the novel is a Christmas home-coming for the regulars, almost all of whom are present at the party, and who are like family to Eve Dallas and Roarke. The party itself, like Dallas's later conversation with Peabody when she calls from Scotland, is given too short shrift, and this undercuts in some slight way to holiday celebration.One of the benefits of the slow pace of Memory in Death is that it allows for the development of relationships, such as that between Dallas and Charlotte Mira. The Miras are shown, through Charlotte's conversation with Eve, to be a warts and all less than perfect couple. The result is that Dallas, who struggles periodically with roles and the interpersonal aspect of marriage, is reassured that perfection is unlikely. Mira continues to teach Dallas about marriage, family, and friendship.If Feeney is Dallas's surrogate father, Charlotte Mira is her surrogate mother and friend who cares enough to plead for them to remain friends. Dallas's lack of ease with personal relationships outside of her marriage and the work situation, even her hardness, is highlighted by Mira's plea. In the mushy grounds of disagreement, love, anger, and exchange that is friendship, Dallas is often lost. Happily for her sake, Charlotte Mira helps her find her way back. Dallas's discomfort is also shown in the abrupt way she dismisses Peabody who calls from her Scotland visit with McNab's relatives. Moreover, some of the sticks-in-the-craw dirt comes out in a fight between Eve and Roarke which makes them an even more realistic couple because Dallas vents her envy that Roarke's family situation turned out so well for him. The dust up between the two and its resolution reminds that envy and anger can bubble up against even those we love.At the heart of the novel is the rich irony that Trudy Lombard, who, in life, had psychologically abused her female foster charges, in death is the subject of an equally psychological murder investigation. Call it a consequence of the Christmas slow down or what you will, it is undeniable that Memory in Death is not action-driven but more focused on the detailing of the deductive reasoning process that is so crucial to the resolution of criminal cases.The characters of Bobby Lombard and his wife Zana make the novel work on several different levels. For one, Bobby is the vehicle through whom Dallas realizes that not all of her childhood memories are horrific. Though Bobby Lombard did nothing openly to stem his mother's abuse of her foster girls, he compensated by sneaking Eve food when Trudy punished her by withholding food. In looking backwards, Dallas's experience with the neighbor's boy's airskate foreshadows the tough-minded woman who is unafraid of taking physical shots in the performance of her duties. In remembering him, Eve recalls that what prompted her flight from Trudy Lombard's house was her failure to stand up for the boy, who had been kind to her, when Trudy Lombard falsely accused him of vandalism. For another, Bobby is also cause of Dallas's realizing that true love is not blind to the faults of the beloved. The ability to see the strengths and weaknesses, even the pettiness of the beloved is critical to the formation of a strong bond between a couple. Through Zana come some of the detours that add some measure of suspense, even drama, to this slow paced novel. The philosophical issue at the core of the novel is raised through the Lombard family; through them Robb forces her readers to question whether it is ever possible to say that one knows a person. Certainly, Bobby knows neither his mother nor his wife. This then raises the concomitant issue, if we cannot and do not know whom we love, then can we really love them?Though there are head feints to prevent the resolution of the crime, none is strong enough to counteract what Dallas's gut tells her about the identity of the murderer. Nevertheless, she cannot go on gut alone but must still build the case so that it leads to a sustainable arrest, must still has to follow the evidentiary trail and employ deductive reasoning to close the case.Through Dallas's insistence on standing for Trudy Lombard who abused the young Eve Dallas, Robb reveals the strength of character of both the protagonist and her husband Roarke. Even though Dallas despises Trudy and has no real enthusiasm for the case, she still pursues the investigation to its conclusion. This integrity in the face of provocation-the memories of abuse which would argue against Dallas pursuing Lombard's killer or rejoicing in her death-is reflected in Roarke who, though he would kill those who have harmed/would harm his wife, will not engage in action that would destroy Dallas and their relationship. This, integrity of character, then, points to their suitability for one another.Nevertheless, in the end, Dallas is almost despairing, which mood Robb builds through a judicious depiction of character, use of language and context. Other in Death novels have ended on a cheerier note; this one forces it. In the end, though, Robb has the wisdom to let her readers breathe, to relax a little after the high strung tension and ethical horror she depicts in Origin in Death.Great reading. Make sure and buy it."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Because this book deals with Eve's past, it's less of a suspenseful police procedural than some of Robb's books. But all the classic trademarks of her writing are still here; excellent dialogue, great characters and interaction between them, well-done sense of place and, lest we forget, hot passion. Personally, I prefer cases where Eve's past is less involved, but that certainly doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading the series. These are definitely books I read as soon as I receive them."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This was an interesting story blending Eve's past when she was a foster child, blackmail, Christmas celebration, and Eve's work troubles.What I considered interesting was the revelation of Eve's past as a foster child and how CPS failed to help a child in trouble and placed the child with Trudy, who was more of a professional money-collector than professional-mom for foster children.However, fitting to Christmas spirit, everything turns out well for Eve and Roarke, for Peabody and McNabb and all the other important and less important characters in this book. Also, it shows that even if you have had a horrible childhood and have bad memories, you can still turn out to be a good citizen and have a great life when you're grown up."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I just want to say that this story is above and beyond the last two - Survivor & Origin. I enjoy all of the \\"In-Death\\" books but some are definitely better than others. \\"Memory\\" takes place in the year 2059 and it is about a week prior to Eve & Roarke's second Christmas together. Eve is totally caught off guard when one Trudy Lombard, Eve's foster care mother from when she was 9 years old, just shows up in her office at Cop Central. Needless to say, Trudy was one nasty foster care parent and Eve's memories of her are more like nightmares. Trudy tries to blackmail Eve into wangling $2,000,000 out of her husband under the pretext that she owes Trudy for taking care of her when she was a child (of course Trudy's idea of care was starvation and cold baths). When Eve throws her out of her office, she goes to Roarke. That little meeting in Roarke's office is really quite amusing. The story takes off from there as Trudy ends up dead in her hotel room and the rest is a who, why and how \\"done it,\\" leaving our favorite Lieutenant with more to accomplish during the holiday season than just shopping. The supporting characters are all here, Peabody, not much on McNab, however, they are off to Scotland for the holidays and Peabody is a little anxious about meeting McNab's family for the first time. Of course, Mira and Feeney are highlighted as well as Baxter and Truehart. We see Eve's character developing nicely. When Christmas finally does roll around, Eve doesn't even baulk at the elaborate gifts Roarke bestows upon her (a total change from her attitude in \\"Glory in Death\\"). Eve herself is quite the thoughtful gift-giver. As always, there is a lot of action and comedy and you can't help but laugh at Eve's way of looking at the world. Thank you Nora for another great \\"In-Death\\" book. I saw where some of your books will be made into movies for Lifetime TV.

The stories, though set in the 1950s, are universal in appeal, as witnessed by the fact that I have taught them to high school classes in British Columbia, New Brunswick, and now Ontario. The opening story, &quot;Johnson and the Cascadura&quot;, and the final story, &quot;My Girl and the City&quot;, are equal to any short story written anywhere by anyone.

From naval architecture to naval history, the story of the Pride of the Sea is more than one of survival, and comes together to present a great debut by a great journalist."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"The Baltimore clipper schooners, famous for their speed, pestered the British in the War of 1812. They were slender and fast, low in the water but with two extremely tall, swept-back masts. The city fathers of Baltimore in the 1970s figured the city needed something to be proud of. It had lost its football team, crime was up, and the docks were in decay. To boost civic pride, a replica Baltimore clipper was proposed, and eagerly funded, built, staffed and sailed. _The Pride of Baltimore_ was a gorgeous ship, looking smart in any display of the beloved Tall Ships. In fact, it was first proposed to be a dockside museum, but it eventually became a seagoing craft, spreading the good name of Baltimore (and business interest in it) to Europe. The plan to resurrect the Baltimore clipper was a resounding success. Unfortunately, lots of the clippers had sunk two centuries ago, largely due to their top-heaviness, and _The Pride_ did so, too, in 1986, in an unexpected storm as she was returning to Baltimore from the Virgin Islands. Four of the crew of twelve perished. In _Pride of the Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival_ (Citadel Press) Tom Waldron has given the story of the ship and the disaster, a story which ought to please true-life adventure fans. He also comes to some sensible conclusions about how the accident happened, beyond the simple explanation \\"freak storm.\\"When the proposal for a new Baltimore clipper was made, one of the first naval architects to consider the job wrote, \\"... an exact replica of an old sailing vessel is unlikely to meet Coast Guard requirements.\\" Indeed, the civic boosters and the architect who got the job made a conscious decision not to have _The Pride_ certified by the Coast Guard. It was risky to sail on her, but it was authentic, and it appealed to those who loved ships with sails. There was a crew of both old salts and rookies, none of whom were over thirty. Six of them were newcomers to the boat. A violent, unexpected squall of sixty knots simply pushed over _The Pride_; there had been a risky maneuver to bring the ship under better control, but the risk had not paid off. The ship rapidly took on water, and with no compartmentalization, sank quickly. The rafts failed to work properly; only one could be inflated, so that the eight survivors had to make do on a raft that would have been crowded with its recommended crew of six. Waldron expertly describes the chaos of the sinking and the hellish five days on the raft afterwards. Time after time, ships passing near enough to see them did not see them, until a Norwegian supertanker picked them up. The only lightness in the raft comes from a couple who had fallen in love on the boat. The young woman said matter-of-factly, \\"I don't want to go through life without being proposed to.\\" Her boyfriend, taken aback, issued one of the strangest proposals ever: \\"Sure, Leslie, if we survive, we'll get married.\\" And so they did, after funerals and investigations and recriminations, all recounted here._The Pride_ and its four lost crewmen were sacrificed to nostalgia, a dream of the romantic days of sail without recalling the nightmares the sea can bring. Nothing symbolizes this as much as the hand-held radio beacons that would have sent signals to satellites when the ship was in danger. Both beacon devices were available to anyone who could grab one, but they were inaccessible, mounted on the inside of the doomed vessel. The reason? They were too modern to be kept out on deck and detracted from the vessel's historic aspect. Waldron's terrific account of the loss of _The Pride_ recounts many such lapses. _Pride of Baltimore II_ has been built, and to modern standards this time. But as a survivor reminds us, the most modern of boats are going down, too: \\"When you go out to sea, it's a big place out there and the sea has all the power.\\""},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"Having lived in Maryland until just a couple of years ago, I clearly remember the Pride and when she sank. I was at Martin's Airport with a friend the day the survivors returned, and it was a moving experience. I cried seeing these people, whom I had never met, yet knowing what they'd been through and seeing the sadness on their faces. It's one of those moments in time that you know you'll always remember, but life goes on and it fades into the background. But seeing this book at our local book store brought it all back to me in vivid color. I shared the experience with my husband, told him about this beautiful beloved ship that we were all so proud of and the pain every Marylander felt when we heard the news that she was lost, and that some of its crew were lost with her. This book is a moving, loving tribute to our beloved Pride and her crew and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the sea."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"This book is a page turner. Very well written, with both historical information regarding this type of ship, and this ship in particular. Those parts of the book discussing the sailing characteristics of the Pride were highly interesting from a technical standpoint, and when applied to the storm situations described, made pretty exciting reading.I found the backround information on the ship's crew, the story of how the ship was built, and the aftermath of the sinking, added greatly to the books interest. The story of the crews stuggle to survive after the Pride sank rates with any survival-at-sea saga that I have ever read. The details provided are just amazing, and make you feel like you were right in the raft.This book is as good a read as you will find in current literature."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"Having grown up on the Atlantic Ocean, this story was captivating to me. It is almost unbelieveable how dangerous the ocean can become in a matter of minutes; the author, Tom Waldron, did a great job of describing the fury of the ocean at it's most violent.Waldron put the story together in a logical, readable format. He included a lot of interesting information about how the ship was built, the history of sailing ships, especially clipper ships, and even included numerous pictures, so one is able to attach faces with names in the narrative.Interesting to me was the description of the life on board the Pride -- lack of space below, lack of showers, etc. A very primitive existance. The vivid descriptions of the storms were captivating -- made the book hard to put down.Finally, the section about the aftermath was most compelling. Waldron described in detail the suffering and emotional roller coaster the survivors went through until their rescue. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"This is an amazing book. I absolutely loved it. I loved it because it really made me feel like I was there. It made me cry when the ship went down, made me elated when they were saved.Getting the background of the Pride was another good element of this book. Knowing the background allows the reader to make her own decisions about who is at fault for the sinking of the Pride, if anyone.I strongly recommend this book. It's just, well, great.

My husband and I were only a blip on the sea when this sad incident happened, but I recall the news with a jolt. We were anchored at Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, when a very unusual storm surge rolled in from the wrong direction. It was a small part of the same storm that took the Pride some 250 miles north. This book is the well-told story of each of the crew's background and how they came together to sail on this coveted journey. I appreciated the book's true facts up to and surrounding this event, instead of merely speculating about what really happened. A great book with unfortunate circumstances, but with the construction of the Pride of Baltimore II to carry on the tradition, it is a salute to all who were affected."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"Many years ago, the Pride of Baltimore visited us here in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and as a history buff, so began my fascination for this beautiful, unforgettable ship. I will always remember the sight of her masts soaring above the parking lot and the trees, her pennants and topmasts looking down on our little city as though she was above us all. In many ways, she was.I'm going to be yet another person who gives this incredible book a 5-star rating, and if I could give it 50 stars, I would. It takes a lot for a book to make me cry, but this one did. Indeed, there were times that I had to actually put it down because the tears were rolling down my face. This is an unforgettable story, and one that stays with you, indeed, even haunts you, long after you turn the last page.Pride of Baltimore lives once again through the author's gripping account of this beautiful vessel and those who loved her. Thank you, Mr. Waldron, for what, for me, has been the best read of the year."},{"Title":"Pride Of The Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival","review":"This book is a very good technical read, with strong research, interviews with survivors and those directly involved with the accident to back up the historical account of the PRIDE's loss. It is adventageous to have had a reporter from Baltimore write this story, yet not have had direct involvement with Pride Inc. or the tall ship community, thus a plus. There are however conclusions drawn by the author that lead the reader to believe that tall ship projects which replicate historical vessel's are not worth the risk or potential loss of life. Many with in the tall ship industry disagree. Mr. Waldron was tugged at the readers need, especially in today's society, of &quot;always looking for someone to blame&quot; in any accident. Where were the quote's of the majority, of how great the vessel was? Sadly, there is a constant tone laid out in the book from interviews and quote's from documents that people doubted or simply did not have a handle on Pride's stability and that the vessel was not safe. The author, by viture of his need to make sure the book would sell to the masses at large, leaves you with the impression that the adventure of such projects is not worth the risk, someone is to blame. The USCG and NTSB investigations of the accident found NO negligence or fault on behalf of the organization, crew, vessel or the design under the range of the vessel's operations AND her mission. Acts of Nature happen and often loss of life with those violent acts of nature. The fact that PRIDE II exists, brought to life by the citizens of Maryland, with the same if not stronger mission, proves it is worth it."},{"Title":"Start Your Business: A Beginner's Guide (Psi Successful Business Library)","review":"This is more of a small business start-up tool, a must have for small business beginners.

By studying projects which failed, and figuring out why they failed, it might be possible to learn how to avoid making those mistakes again. Thus was born a long-running column, in \\"Computerworld\\", I believe, and eventually he collected the columns into a book.No one wants to admit having had a failure, especially a big one, and so the names were all changed. All that remains is the lessons to learn - of which there are plenty.This book is an easy read, and amusing, even if the stories, now four decades old, may seem dated today.This book should be required reading for everyone who might ever consider managing, or working on, a software project of any complexity at all. Taken together, it is an outstanding list of reasons why projects fail, and warning signs of a Project in Trouble, one that has a very good change of becoming another Project Which Failed."},{"Title":"Meher Baba: Avatar of the Tortoise","review":"This is the story of an unusual spiritual master named Meher Baba, who was born in India in 1894 into a Persian Zoroastrian family. But it is much more than that-it is also the intimate story of how the author awakened to the search for truth in response to the charm of Meher Baba's personality, the power of his message of divine love, and the intellectual challenged posed by his teachings.The book provides an excellent introduction to Meher Baba and various aspects of his life, such as his work with the mad and the \\"God-intoxicated,\\" his establishment of a center in South Carolina, and his warnings to American youth about drug use. In addition, it is distinctive for being the first personal memoir by a second-generation Baba-lover who never met Meher Baba in person.A political activist and a psychology professor at Indiana University in the sixties, Kenneth Lux was skeptical when he first heard Meher Baba's claim that he is the \\"Avatar of the Age,\\" that same Ancient One who came before as Zoroaster, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, and who had returned to redeem the world-a world very much in need of redemption. Also fantastic was the fact that Meher Baba had kept total silence since 1925 and told his followers to prepare for the breaking of his silence with a divine Word, an event that would signal his manifestation as God in human form and the advent of a New Humanity.Despite the fact that Meher Baba died in 1969, seemingly without having uttered the Word, Lux continued to be drawn by Baba's extraordinary love and compassion, which not only were reflected in his life's activities but also continued even after his death through a deep inner relationship with his devotees. The detailed story of how this inner relationship took shape for Kenneth Lux-a process marked by synchronicities, transformative encounters, and important insights into his own attachments, weaknesses, and psychological makeup-makes for fascinating reading.Even though Meher Baba had stated that the mind had to be \\"annihilated\\" in order for spiritual realization to become possible, Lux felt that his intellect grew more effective after coming into Meher Baba's orbit. A keen observer of his own mental and emotional processes, Lux is able to show us specifically how he wrestled with the koan that is Meher Baba-examining, questioning, reasoning, contemplating, and ultimately arriving at an understanding that is as satisfying to the mind as it is to the heart. The significance of the book's subtitle-\\"Avatar of the Tortoise\\"-comes as an interesting surprise toward the conclusion, tying together the threads of Lux's longing for a revolution of consciousness to bring redemption to our suffering world."},{"Title":"Meher Baba: Avatar of the Tortoise","review":"The timing of this book is quite striking. I received a copy on the weekend before the aweful events of September 11. During the aftermath of this crisis, I found this book to be extremely meaningful and thought provoking. This is a multi-faceted book that deals with the story of the author's spiritual awakening and his perspective on Meher Baba and his meaning and message to humanity.This book is an excellent introduction to Meher Baba but I think that it would be also very valuable to people familiar with Meher Baba and have contemplated or struggled with the issues presented in this book. I found the book to contain many important insights and while reading it I often found myself staring at the cover or off into space while I contemplated a particular point. One quote from Meher Baba has remained with me since I finished the book and it has helped me come to terms with the recent tragic world events: \\"The wave of destruction must rise still higher, must spread still further. But when, from the depths of his heart, man desires something more lasting than wealth and something more real than material power, the wave will recede. Then peace will come, joy will come, light will come.\\""},{"Title":"Meher Baba: Avatar of the Tortoise","review":"Nov. 30, 2001A Book Review by Eva Smith from the Center for Esoteric StudiesMeher Baba - Avatar of the TortoiseBy Kenneth LuxKenneth Lux a clinical psychologist and social theorist takes us on a journey within a journey. He begins by taking us back to 1967 where he was first introduced to the name of Meher Baba. He describes how Meher Baba's literature and the \\"Baba Lovers\\" (those who follow Baba's teachings) impressed him and how be became a believer. This begins his long process of personal spiritual development. He gives us accounts of the various people he meets along the way; how the more he got involved with the Baba Teachings the more his philosophy and spiritual developed changed; how he had to come to grips with the Avatar; the Baba teachings played an important role in the vocations he ended up choosing and creating and his psycho-spiritual transformation as a person. The coincidences of meeting Baba Lovers at every turn on the road through all the years confirmed for him that he was on the right track. His experiences are both engrossing and revealing.All this is done while simultaneously giving us an account of Baba's life, from his beginnings in what was then Persia, his move to India, and the development of the Baba establishments and teachings. The story of Baba's life is most captivating and engaging. From the moment that Kenneth describes Meher Baba's life through stories and through descriptions of Baba's experiences with his followers, the reader recognizes the quality of this man.As an esotericist I particularly enjoyed the various quotes of Baba's teachings derived from the Meher Baba Discourses. The Teachings parallel very much those offered by other evolved beings and so as the reader I enjoyed how Baba expressed his truths. His intention is to reveal the ONE Supreme Self which is in all. He says he was Jesus, he was Krishna, he was Buddha, he was all the other Avatars who have come to bring love to humanity in the past. He professes to be here again. \\"Come All Unto Me.\\"Baba spends the majority of his life in Silence. His followers and believers keep waiting for him to break his silence, which is his promise. He assures them that the right time will come and he will do so. Unfortunately to the chagrin of his followers, right up to his death - the dropping of his body, he does not break his silence.The premise in the book is that Baba was an Avatar, being the total manifestation of God in human form. \\"As an Avatar he brings a new release of power, a new awakening of consciousness, a new experience of life-not merely for the few, but for all.\\"The rest of the book is spent on justifying why Kenneth believes that Meher Baba was in fact the Avatar. He addresses questions like, \\"Was Baba only a spiritual authority? Was Baba a Charlatan? Was Baba an ordinary man? Or Was Baba in fact, the Avatar?\\"Upon reflection, as a spiritual person, teacher and lover of the Ageless Wisdom the Kenneth's presentation that Meher Baba is God is somewhat difficult to swallow. Kenneth leaves the reader with having to decide whether Baba, this spiritual figure, is God or whether he is not. Had the author presented Baba as an extremely evolved being, representing the principle of love, (which is what an Avatar does) the extreme polarities, of either or, would have been diffused.The book itself offers photos of Meher Baba's life, which has helped this reader have a sense of almost knowing the man. It involves one to the point that often I would just look at his picture and almost feel the energy jump off the page. I found the size of the book a bit awkward especially for carrying around as well as the print on gray paper difficult to see.Kenneth's writing is intelligent, totally honest, goes directly to main issues, inspiring and captivating. The message of love is extant throughout the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

I've read all of Woodward's major works and this rates as one of the best because, throughout, you can see his engagement intellectually with difficult theories and histories. The sections where he engages \\"the ironies of Southern history\\" are fascinating because he completely challenges the American myth of success in global affairs. His addendum on the aftermath of the Vietnam War is timely as well.His sections on William Faulkner, John Brown, Southern identity, Populism, and Reconstruction are first rate and describe histories as concisely as anything in print. His also goes into some of these issues very well in \\"The Origins of the New South.\\" I cared less for the chapter on Robert Penn Warren because I don't think much of his work has aged well and the chapter on the Guilded Age is less coherent.In sum, this is an important part of Woodward's canon and speaks very well to his importance as a thinker."},{"Title":"The burden of Southern history (A Mentor book)","review":"This is a collection of essays on then contemporary southern culture and history. The essays generally deal with the transformation then taking place- the end of segregation, the civil rights movement, and surging population and industrial development.The essays have a sentimental quality I don't find in more modern writings. They are short in the quality of thesis ('Southern Identity lies in a common memory', 'The country made ambiguous moves towards racial equality during the civil War and reconstruction' but is long in the quality of its prose. It's not a bad read, even if there is little new. Of course, you shouldn't be reading books from 1960 for new material in the first place.So what was Woodward trying to tell his audience? I saw two themes. To the south he seemed to be asking people to let go of segregation as another lost cause. He doesn't condemn it in moral tones, but rather that fighting for it against the tide of history was futile and self destructive. To the north he asked for patience, pointing out that virulent racism persisted in the north well after the civil war. So the theme was getting people to deal peacefully with the concept of racial equality.While most of the essays stuck to this theme, the last two essays stuck out.'The Populist Heritage and the Intellectual' is an analysis of criticism of the populist movement by then contemporary historians. I've never heard the term Populist used in anything other then a derogatory fashion, Woodward suggests there is a lot more to it then that. Woodward suggests populism was an agrarian protest movement that failed to find intellectual support, and was consequently pilloried. He cites it as the one movement that sought to bring back civil rights to the south in the 1890's. It definitely warrants further reading.\`The Irony of Southern History' is a thoughtful essay comparing the cold war of the 1950's to the slavery conflict then incipient in the 1830's. The author cites the closing of discussion, the end to the great debates and experiments of the 1930's that challenged capitalism. The south in the 1830's similarly closed debate over slavery, it became treason to question the institution. Woodward sees southern intellectuals as obligated to comment on the cold war from the perspective of people who knew from experience that history does not take sides.Recommended mainly for the last two essays."},{"Title":"The burden of Southern history (A Mentor book)","review":"C. Vann Woodward was a fine historian with liberal sentiments when it came to race while still loving his native South. \\"The Burden of Southern History\\" is a collection of his essays that has now gone through numerous editions. Woodward is sometimes excellent (\\"The Irony of Southern History\\" is perhaps the finest essay in this collection) but some of his pieces are flat. Woodward is good on the works of Robert Penn Warren and on how three Northern writers viewed the South in the Gilded Age. His piece on the reaction to John Brown's raid and changes in the South in the aftermath of Bill Clinton's victory in 1992 are not up to the same level of quality. Nonetheless, this is a fine collection from a humane spirit and a good writer."},{"Title":"Personal Property: Wives, White Slaves, and the Market in Women","review":"The perception which permits males to traffic women, as opposed to women who volunteer their own services in prostitution is the key and central issue of debate that is the overlapping result of primogeniture laws that govern both women and children, apparently hard habits to break. It would not be too harsh an extension of this philosophy to suggest that the idea of housekeepers, babysitters, or waitresses are merely a modern day reflection of these same attitudes. The worst result of allowing the attitudes to go unchallenged are that the idea of sexual services as well as the image of domestic services are fused into a perception of wives as the \\"subservients\\" if not servants, they become where male superiority is allowed to reign and take root. The self indulgence at the expense of females comes not from birthing but conditioning after they are birthed which condones the subrogation of all women, particularly those deemed marriageable, and in fact, because they are subservient to male desires. The ideal mate becomes therefore not a companion, but a servant who is permitted to communicate with her \\"master and commander,\\" and forced to suffer the indignities of perhaps also being subject to violence outbursts if she is not properly submissive, or silent. The evolution of female social and economic privileges have actually been reduced or sacrificed as a result of trading the Victorian respect of females with regard to property rights into disrespect of females because they are capable of being judged to have property rights. This divisive personal choice of women having to trade their dignity for property rights is one never reached in most women's literature, and remains a contentious sore spot in gender rights and equity, usually resulting in the refusal to recognize women's economic rights of advancement for the subtle discriminatory effects of female opression as a choice by men, aided by the second tier scrutiny of gender discrimination rather than first tier scrutiny of minority rights. Since perception permits the use of women in this manner by male society generally, all other women's participation rights and privileges flow from this attitude, and their expectations with regard to men."},{"Title":"Sleeping Beauty and Other Fairy Tales from the Old French","review":"This is a reprint of the book first published in 1910.

The truth is that even reading Cliffs Notes from cover the cover will not actual bring a reader into context with the text. Instead, they fill them with words and phrases that the typical high school student or college underclassmen has no idea what they mean.With that said, Cliffsnotes can be a very useful tool in teaching a novel or as a reference in attempting to understand a confusing piece of literature. I recently learned this when teaching LORD OF THE FLIES to my high school sophomore students. I've read LORD OF THE FLIES several times, but did not have the time to read the entire thing again with my students. So, instead I used Cliffsnotes as a tool to remind me of exactly where certain things occurred in the story. I also gained some background information that proved useful during the first days of class while teaching the book. Cliffsnotes is a great tool. However, as those who failed the unit because they just read Cliffsnotes and not the LORD OF THE FLIES itself can attest, it isn't a good substitute for the novel itself."},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"This book changed the way I view life in general; I think it is more important to read than The Odyssey, even.

It is about a group of boys who has been stranded on an island and try their best to establish an efficient and fair society, while trying to avoid the troubles at hand until they can be rescued. This book never has a dull moment and is great for those who love a classic thriller."},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"William Golding displays the innocence of children and savagery of man. The id versus the super ego causes a group of boys on an island to tear apart at their humanity, civilizaion and morals. A surivival of the fittest, this book is a must-read. A great lesson to us all, Lord of the Flies teaches us that the human being can revert to savagery as easily as civilization is instilled"},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"This piece is one the literary staples of young adolescent literature. As a result, many of America's youth get the opportunity to witness how even the most civilized can be broken down and resort to savage behavior. The various themes of leadership, organization, and law and order are present as this book progresses. The author's portrayal of the events and how they develop display the very essence of man and how we thrive."},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"Grandmalulu was supposed to send me the Lord of the Flies Cliff Notes I ordered on July 3rd and it is Aug 7th and I still do not have the book.

I most likely never would have read the book if I hadn't needed to for school.

I am finding that I enjoy the book. I find that Piggy should be the leader because of his intelligence. Although he would need leadership skills, and confidence if he did become leader. One thing that I do not like about reading this book, is that you can't simply enjoy it. There are 4 parts that you must do to go along with each chapter, so the teacher says. I wish I could read the book from beginning to end. However, you need to do a symbols chart to follow the book, otherwise you cannot understand what Golding is saying."},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"I had to read this book over the summer for an advanced placement english class and it was very confusing and boring.

It's about children who get stuck on an island. They have to learn to survive on their own without adults. Many of them struggle to survive. You notice they go from playful children to savages and hunters. Most of them must learn to grow up quickly in order for survival. Ralph is the leader of everyone, while Jack is in charge of hunting. There are two classifications the biguns and the littluns (I think you can understand it means the bigger ones and the little ones). To find out everything that happened you need to read the book. We had to read it for english class this semester and I thought the book was pretty good. Some parts may be hard to understand right away but if you really think about what you read and analyze it you'll get it."},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"I have heard both good AND bad about Lord of the Flies, and when I found out I had to read the book for our 9th grade English class, I didn't want to be biased at all so I kept an open mind. From a sociological aspect, it was a wonderful book. It points out all of mankind's faults and uses symbolism very well. However, there were some things that I really didn't like about it. One example was that Golding used only English boys on the island... a possible mistake that could have made the book take a quite different turn. It also was a little deep for some high school freshman classes; I understood it well but many of my classmates were completely lost. I urge everyone to pick up the book and at least try it. Thanks...."},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","review":"Clearly this book while controversially to some has become a pillar for literary works.

I have enjoyed this novel everytime I read it, never got bored or tired of the twists and the ending, and I've read this book 6-7 times now. Golding had also used clever language and setting in the novel that will keep the book in your hands, hold your breath and you'll want to speed up the pace at which you're reading. Digging and digging to reach the end. Trust me, if I read for a book 6 or 7 times without getting bored of it, it had to be great!

With its cartoons, limericks and humourous anecdotes, the book is a really fun read.More importantly, it's full of excellent description of the BVI's best restaurants and wateringholes. We made full use of the freebees (drinks and food) by presenting the booked whereever we dined and so, at only $12, the book paid for itself many times over.I'd recommend it any visitor to the BVI who enjoys the odd tipple. Imagine what fun the author had in researching it!"},{"Title":"The Drinking Man's Guide to the BVI","review":"I have known Julian Putley for over a decade and greatly admire his strong sense of camaraderie and humor. The second edition of his Drinking Man's Guide to the BVI is even better than the first.As a charter captain for more years than he would like to admit, Julian knows, firsthand, every watering hole, not only within the BVI but most probably within the entire Caribbean. This newest edition reflects his vast knowledge plus it is chocker-block full of funny short stories, limericks, cartoons, drink recipes, sketch's, poetry, jokes and descriptions of the BVI's best bars. There are also some very valuable coupons, good for FREE drinks and meals included. With its humorous anecdotes, the book is a really fun read and I mean this sincerely.What I recommend to cruisers is that you purchase the book locally when you first arrive for your chartering vacation and take it with you everywhere you go. If you do this, you will pay for the book many times over, before you leave, using the coupons in the back. The Guide is also the perfect gift for all BVI Bar lovers out there. Send it wrapped, with a note and a toast to our watering holes!Julian is also the author of Sunfun Calypso, which I had the pleasure of reviewing for All At Sea when it came out in 1999. Hey, the guy is a funny Caribbean writer who, if you have lived here long enough, tells it like it is. So if you really want a good read - purchase both books and enjoy your holiday - but be careful with the recipes though - remember that moderation is the key!!!"},{"Title":"The Drinking Man's Guide to the BVI","review":"I purchased this book for my husband after returning from sailing in the BVIs.

People heard Suzanne and thought, &quot;Oh, I hear this guy's a poet, too; I wonder what he writes...&quot; This book was published to appease such sentiments. And it does a good job of it - covering all of Leonard's poetry books released up to that time, featuring the highlights from each, as well as a good slew of new poems. Although some of Leonard's best poetry (and lyrics) were published after the release of this book - and this omnibus itself has been rendered largely unnecessary due to the release of Leonard's career-spanning collection, Stranger Music (although this does contain several works that that doesn't) - it is still a good collection, and an accurate summing up of Leonard's career up to that point. Reccommended for Cohen fans, if you can find it."},{"Title":"Leonard Cohen: Selected Poems","review":"This volume contains the full lyric of Suzanne, here called \\"Suzanne Takes You Down\\" and an embryonic version of True Love Leaves No Traces, a beautiful song from his much maligned album Death Of a Ladies' Man, here called \\"As The Mist Leaves No Scar\\" ( I also love the breezy pop version by Dead Famous People on the tribute album I'm Your Fan). The poem The Only Tourist In Havana Turns His Thoughts Homeward (1961) reminds me of his song \\"Stories of the Street\\" on the album Songs of Leonard Cohen that also deals with a visit to Havana. Queen Victoria And Me appears on the album Live Songs as just \\"Queen Victoria.\\" The poem It's Good To Sit With People mentions the obscure 60's singer Tim Hardin (the same guy or a relative inspired Dylan's album title John Wesley Harding). I won't try to venture into literary criticism (my frame of reference is limited to Beats like Allen Ginsburg and Confessionals like Robert Lowell, John Berryman and Anne Sexton) but I love Cohen's imagery and I enjoy most of these. The book concludes with an index of first lines. This is a must for all Cohen completists."},{"Title":"Leonard Cohen: Selected Poems","review":"There are a lot of books of Leonard Cohen poems that focus on the ones that have been used as lyrics in songs. As incredible as those are, one is missing out if they do not explore the early poetry of Cohen that did not make it into music. Short of going back and collecting the original smaller books, this is the best anthology of these poems I have found. The later blue book, the exact title escapes me, does not include some of the poems from here that, in my humble opinion, are his best. \\"It is good to live between a ruined house of bondage and a holy promised land.\\" From the poem \\"Credo.\\""},{"Title":"Leonard Cohen: Selected Poems","review":"These poems have a special beauty of their own music. Cohen writes as a lover of poetry of song and of romantic experience. It is possible to perhaps object to his accumulating experiences with one woman after another, but he shows appreciation of most of them. He is insightful and intelligent and readable. But he seems to wander all over the place though often bringing a poem home with strongly poetic lines.One cannot not think of music when one thinks of Leonard Cohen but for him the Poetry preceded the Music and has Music in it."},{"Title":"The New World Order","review":"A decade ago the term 'New World Order' was a commonly-used expression. Now - at the beginning of the twenty-first century - the contours of this order are less clear. How can this international order be described and interpreted and how can it be explained from contrasting theoretical viewpoints? Ten scholars in international politics, many of them experts in the field, offer penetrating contributions to provide a survey of the ongoing debate surrounding the new world order."},{"Title":"Is It a Sport?: The Answer to everything from Archery to Yachting.","review":"This is a wonderfully written romp through the sports world, with humor, history and critique. It will provoke debate, especially when it challenges the sports we all treasure. It will interest even the casual sports fan with its opening stories of how sports impacted our family.I say \\"our\\" family because Paul is my brother. And, although I'd dispute some of the details of his wonderful stories, I wouldn't change a word. This book has been a joy for our family and I think it'll be a treat for yours."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I read this kind of books while commuting with the train to the office.The book was recommended in the Dutch list of best thrillers.

It draws you in quickly, keeps you reading non-stop, and has interesting characters and excellent suspense. But it also has some holes in the plot and a killer and motive I spotted fairly early on.

An excellent book! You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I read this book and couldn't put it down.

I hope he can turn out the books fast because I'll be waiting for them!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Gone but not forgotten was one of the best suspense novels I've ever read. Margolin rivals the likes of a Thomas Harris. The plot was thick with thrills and the characters had you going. I loved the twists that the book held from beginning to the very end.

Clever use of regional USA differences, namely New York state and Pacific northwest. Psychopath well and frighteningly developed. Strong female heroine."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Since I just trashed Heartstone, I thought it only fair that I praise Gone But Not Forgotten. I absolutely loved this book. This wasn't just a good book. It was absolutely fascinating- rivetting even. The character development was incredible. Mr. Margolin lost momentum in Heartstone by introducing useless characters. He has obviously fine-tuned his character development skills. The pace was perfect in Gone.... The ending was intense. Two thumbs up and a plea for more books like this one to Mr. Margolin."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"It is really exciting as the pliot presents so many twists and turns. I simply cannot put this book down! Though the first two chapters seem fragmented but they will start to fall into place.

I enjoyed it so much that I recommended it to my wife and she loved it also."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I have never read a book of Margolins that I did not completely enjoy. He has an extremely dark mind, which is quite similar to Steven Kings. He assunes an air of innocences as he entangles the plot into an unstoppable read. The endings always seem to surprise me."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This is the second book I have read by Margolin and he sure knows how to keep the reader interested throughout the entire book. The villian\\\\s in this book were truly some of the baddest bad guys I have ever read in a suspense book. In fact, I think Darius could give Hannibal a run for his money in the torture and cruelty department.The only reason I gave this book four stars as opposed to five was, unlike his last book I read, I had this one figured out sooner than I would have liked. Also I thought that the response in Hunter's Point was a bit unrealistic. If a serial killer has abducted and possibly killed three women in a city, a small one at that, you think the response from the public would be a strong one and the kidnappings would be in peoples thought for a while. Instead, in an early part of the book Page, a DA, calls Hunters Point and asks about the kidnappings that occured ten years before and the cop says he had only been on the force for five years and he THINKS he MIGHT have heard something about it.....I am pretty sure a cop on a small counties force would have heard about the biggest case that ever occured there.Anyways, I was really streching to find those two instances because overall this book was a great read and I killed it in one sitting. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Very good plot - full of twists and excellent tension building scenes. Sometimes the tension was so tight that I almost couldn't stand to read on. A good job of building up to the answer to who dunnit. Complex, but believable. If you want to curl up with a good scary read, read this book!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Gone, but Not Forgotten was the best mystery thriller that I have read in months (if not years). The author kept the plot twisting until the last page. Very good book - with just enough scare in it to make you jumpy."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Great read, one of the best and sickest mysteries I have read in a long time. It keeps looking like the story is going to be predictable and then Margolin throws you off track. Very complellig, you will be engrossed from the moment you start reading it."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"THE PLOT IS SO MOVING AND TO THE POINT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GUESS WHO IS SPEAKING OR WHAT IS TAKING PLACE. THE CHARACTERS YOU CAN REALLY GET INTO THEM AND THEIR POSITION WITH THE CASE. THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I have always loved the John Grisham books, someone else who reads them suggested I read Phillip Margolin's books also. I live in Portland, OR where Mr Margolin lives and he shares pieces of the city and state in his books, making them seem more real to me. He has a real knack for twisting plots! You think you know where the book is going and then as you read on, the book twists in a new direction. I love to read, but his books I have simply not been able to put down! I have to know what's going to happen next. Gone but not forgotten is one of his best at this. He is truely a one of the great writers. If you like mysteries and intrigue, read this, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Very gripping.., like driving a race car at fast speed in a road with many bumps, twists and turns. This is my second Philip Margollin book, my first one was The Last Innocent Man and what I see in both of them is that the author is centered on the going of the action and very skillful to create packed suspense out of the most simple circumstances. However. In my opinion as a reader, Mr Margollin should develop more deeply all his characters (lawyers, cops, judges, criminals), I mean, to give more dimensions to them besides their role in respect of the action, and also to provide more vivid and colorful descriptions of the settings (Cities, Houses, Courts, Cars, Whatever) where they play. In some chapters the mistery is not worked enough and in some events the situation is so simple that one can anticipate what is coming (I will not mention them for the benefit of other readers), so it is necessary to add other false clues to confuse and deceive the reader. Overall, is a good book in terms of action and suspense, I like it very much and took a weekend to finish it. Great company for a rainy day at home or a cloudy day in the beach."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Phillip Margolin is a talented author and his \\"Gone, But Not Forgotten\\" is a fantastic psychological mystery suspense thriller. This book was so good in fact that I read it at one sitting, thought about it, waited about a month and then picked it back up and read it again in one sitting. It is a fast paced, 376-page gem that fans of this genre will not want to miss. I would rate it in the top 10 of all the books I have read over the years.The pace, transitions and character development in this novel was exceptionally good. It begins in an affluent neighborhood in Hunter's Point, New York where several women, one at a time, disappeared from their homes. No evidence of any kind was found at the scenes. The only clues at each scene were a single rose, died black and a card saying \\"Gone, But Not Forgotten\\" left at the bedside.Starting off with a bang, the pace picked up when Peter Lake, a wealthy criminal defense attorney, called 911 to report that he found his wife, Sandra and his six year-old daughter, Melody murdered in his home with the signature black rose and card left behind.Accordingly, the Hunter's Point Police Department formed the \\"rose killer\\" task force and worked diligently find and bring the killer to justice.As the result of an anonymous tip, the task force discovering signature evidence and one of the missing victims body, brutally murdered, in the home basement of a convicted sex offender who was shot and killed trying to flee the scene, the case seemed to be closed; however, original task force member Nancy Gordon was never satisfied that the real rose killer was dead.Some 10 years later, Nancy received a tip that a new series of women missing with the rose killers signature black rose and card had surfaced in Portland, Oregon. Gordon makes her way to Portland and promptly disappears, but not before she tells Portland district attorney, Alan page the identity of the person she thinks is the real \\"rose killer\\" and the reasons why.Betsy Tannenbaum, who gained fame by successfully defending women that murdered their abusive husbands, accepts a hefty retainer from a mysterious real estate developer, Martin Darius before he becomes the prime suspect, a decision that will change both of their lives forever.If you are looking for a compelling top-notch thrilling suspense mystery that you will find hard to put down, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"The author has an interesting plot but the story doesn't rise above the routine. There are abundant novels about serial killers nowadays and grisly descriptions galore. This one doesn't stand above the crowd.I won't give anything away but toward the end of the novel one of the victims has a gun on the serial killer. She describes what she is going to do to him. The reader's reaction is, \\"Oh, for Pete's sake.\\" Every reader knows what she describes is not going to happen. If this scene was meant to heighten suspense it did not. A very careless and silly blunder by the author. It would have been so much better, and a shocker, if the lady had actually fired a bullet into the killer's kneecap. Or both kneecaps. THAT would have been a surprise."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"\\"Gone, But Not Forgotten\\" are the words on a note written on plain white paper and left, along with one black rose, on the pillow of four women over a period of a few months in a small upstate New York town, each the wife of a successful businessman. Horribly mutilated bodies are eventually found. When his wife and daughter are found murdered, Peter Lake is suspected of the killings and the earlier crimes. Ultimately another man was arrested, but that man was killed at the scene of the arrest and never tried. Now, years later, the crimes are being duplicated with three new victims in Portland, Oregon.Betsy Tannenbaum, mother of a six-year old girl she adores and suffering through a \`trial separation from her husband, Rick, is tapped by Martin Darius to represent him when he arrested by the Portland police in connection with the current disappearances. Betsy has made a reputation defending against murder charges local women in abusive marriages, and though she has doubts about his innocence, her quest for the enhanced reputation this high-profile case will bring her, as well as her sense of \`everyone deserves the best possible defense\\" overtakes her and she agrees to take on the case. The question is put to her \\"Can you imagine a case you wouldn't take? A client you might find so repulsive that your conscience would not let you represent him?\\" Her answer: \\"That's the question you confront when you choose to practice criminal law. If you can't represent that client, you don't belong in the business.\\"The attempt to find a \\"tag\\" for this novel was frustrating: \\"suspense novel,\\" breathtaking thriller,\\" \\"legal drama?\\" Each one, or rather all of them, apply. The legal scenes are realistic [the author is a longtime criminal defense attorney] and the characters well-drawn. This hefty novel read very quickly, with suspense mounting till the thrilling conclusion."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Margolin's mysteries and trials are the greatest.

You will really zip through it."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This audio book kept us enthralled on a long road trip. Even at the end of our journey we had to finish the book while we were unpacking. Margolin can weave a masterfull plot and keep you on the edge of your seat.

It will bring you to want more of Phillip Margolin's brand of suspence."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This book was one of the best I have ever read. The big twist half way through the book was original. Some of the situations lacked some believability but the book always kept me on edge."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"If you like this genre - mystery/thriller - then this is a great book.It's not so much the whodunnit premise but the predicament that you're put in - and even though the predicament is happening to the characters in the book, you do find yourself asking yourself what you'd do in their place. And in this book, 9 times out of 10, you have trouble deciding and are glad that it's in the book for them to take the consequences."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I love this book. it was the first, but not last book, I have read by Philip Margolin. The characters are brought to life right in front of you. The scenes are real and heart pounding. If you don't or do like to read, please, read this book. I have never, in my entire life, read such a good book. Keep up the good work, Mr. Margolin!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Gone, but Not Forgotten by Phillip Margolin was one of the best mystery novels that I have ever read. Once I opened the book I could not put it down. After reading Gone, but Not Forgotten I had to read the rest of his novels and I have to say that this was my favorite. I like Phillip Margolin's style, he knows how to write a good page turner. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"The book started as a great page turner, but ended with as a dud. The author had a chance to nail an awesome, less predictable ending, but choose to wrap the book up neatly and quickly. I would call it more of a story than a mystery. The mystery is over half way through the book."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Other Amazon reviewers have summarized the plot more ably than I can even attempt. The underlying themes/ questions raised in the book intrigued me. I find myself thinking about those ideas at least a month after I finished the book. Who has the right to decide whether it is better to save a few people, and risk many other lives, or to protect an undefined number of people, thereby abandoning a small number of people to death? Who has the right to pursue justice? and how is that justice defined? Which security decisions should elected protectors keep from their electors? Is this an retelling of the Oliver North weapons/ hostage exchange? Is honesty ever wrong? or too late? I don't usually like books that revolve around serial murders, but this book is an exception. I really believe there is more going on in this book than an attempt to entertain. This is one of the most thought provoking fictional books I have read in years. I did not like some of the plot twists, and some of the events seemed contrived, but the wake-up calls and social commentary are not to be missed."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I could not put this book down. Phillip Margolin has done a great job in having the reader guessing on the identity of the Portland killer . There are times when I thought I knew the whole story behind the murders which occur, but then a new twist comes up which makes the plot even more interesting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a suspense and who won't mind staying up late at night turning pages"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I really loved this novel, my first by the author. It was a book that could not be put down. The plot and story-line were so different from any other that I've read. The cover-up was such a shocker to me and this is what kept me on the edge of my seat. Thank you for something unfamiliar and something that doesn't exactly fit all murder-mysteries"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Women are disappearing in Hunter's Point, NY, an affluent commuter suburb with a population of slightly more than 100,000. Four married women from the same town, all wives of wealthy professional men, all childless, with luxurious lifestyles, go missing without a word to anyone. However, a note was left on the pillow of each, along with a rose, dyed black. The notes read, \\"Gone, But Not Forgotten.\\" Then, prominent young attorney, Peter Lake, comes home one evening to find his wife, Sandra, brutally beaten and strangled to death. A black rose is by her body and a note in her hand. The message is the same as the others. At the top of the staircase, on the second floor landing, the corpse of Melody Lake, the couple's 6 year-old daughter, is also discovered. Apparently, she died quickly. Her neck had been snapped. An FBI profiler briefing the assembled task force, says the killer is probably an organized nonsocial - a sexual psychopath, unable to feel pity or empathy for his victims. After a lengthy investigation, the serial killer is identified and during the apprehension process, shot resisting arrest. He died before interrogation was possible.Ten years later, in Portland, Oregon, women are disappearing. All are wives of distinguished professional men. The pattern triggers memories in the law enforcement community, especially when a black rose and note are found on the bed of each of the disappeared. Long kept secrets are revealed which could reach the highest levels in the country's judicial system. And defense attorney, Betsy Tannenbaum, a rising star, has been hired to defend a prominent developer for the probable murders. He looks guilty as sin. (pardon the cliche).This is a legal thriller that provides a riveting and entertaining read. I must say I was three-quarters of the way through, glued to the page, and still didn't know whodunit! The author, Phillip Margolin, worked for 25 years as a criminal defense attorney, representing 30 homicide cases, 12 of which involved the death penalty. His knowledge of the subject, as well as his psychological portraits, make for a richer than usual narrative. The two primary female characters are strong and competent and they, along with the male protagonist, are really believable, three dimensional individuals.JANA"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"\\"Gone But Not Forgotten,\\" were the words left at every crime scene, andA black rose, in the book titled, Gone But Not Forgotten, by Phillip Margolin. Thisis a murder mystery book about killings that took place ten years ago, but start upagain in a new place. This book is very easy reading and I really liked the book.There are many characters in the book, but they all join together to find the \\"RoseKiller\\". One of the most important characters is, Betsy Tannenbaum. In the book,Betsy is the attorney of Martin Darius, a very prominent man. Martin is beingAccused of the murders, but he claims he's innocent. The \\"Rose Killings\\" first took place in a little town called Hunters Point,New York. The Police Department for Hunters Point set up a task force for the\\"Rose Killer\\", on that task force was a woman named Nancy Gorden, I think sheis my favorite character. Even after the police named a killer, Nancy knew theyhad caught the wrong man and after ten years travels to Portland, Oregon whereshe has had word of the new killings. Her determination to end the case bringsjustice to all who suffered. One of the books main themes is false identities and raises the questionOf who can you really trust? Many characters raise that question. I think theBook was absolutely great, it kept me wondering, and who's the real killer? TheAuthor, Phillip Margolin really knows how to write about murder, lies, andMystery. Not only does he write a good novel, but most of the facts come fromHis own life. Phillip Margolin is a criminal defense attorney, like the characterBetsy, he has many high profile murder cases and was first lawyer in Oregon toUse Battered women's syndrome in a homicide case. The book doesn't use too much description, but enough to let you knowWhat's going on. The characters each have their own personalities, when heDescribes what they feel, it just fits the kind of person the are. One of theMost exciting parts in the book is when Betsy starts to doubt her client MartinDarius. Being a lawyer she has always believed that your own beliefs can't getIn the way of the person you're defending and if you can't handle that you shouldn'tBe a lawyer. With this case, couldn't help the feelings she had, she didn't wantTo be know as the lawyer who let free a serial killer. There are many more eventsThat takes place, like when they travel to the place where the first murdersHappened and find out the truth. Another scene is where they find the missingWomen.

Technically (as a police procedural or plotting ), this book doesn't work at all. The first technical flaw that raised my eyebrow occurred around page 60 when they allowed the husband of the last victim to become part of the investigational team. No police department in the country would allow that to happen - I don't care how well-connected someone may be. Unfortunately, I can't specifically comment on the plotting without giving away the &quot;surprises&quot; (which, by the way, there were none). Suffice it to say that I didn't find anything in the book based in reality or half-way &quot;believable.&quot; The psycho-babble just didn't ring true. I labored through this book and I couldn't wait to get to the end just to see if I had it figured out. Well, there wasn't much to figue out; and the ending? Please. I didn't buy any of it! It was a lousy book."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I really mean 'unbelievable' or silly or u get the idea.On a scale of ten with ten being best - this book would get a two from me; and that two is because it is quite readable but the overall story is ridiculous.

A great mystery thriller. I did not want to put it down. Every page I read held my mind in suspence. Who was leaving the Black Rose and the notes? Why did they start again? If you like a book that will leave you on the edge of your seat, make you stay up late to finish it, and make you want more, then this is the book for you. I really like Sandford, Parker and Pearson but Margolin ranks right up there with them. If I knew the rest of his books would be this good I would try to find them tomorrow."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Usually an excellent story teller, Margolin has relied on a completely predictable &quot;plot twist.&quot; Worse, the twist depended on his experienced and other-wise intelligent protagonist doing something that not even a half-wit attorney would do (nor would even a half-wit reader believe)."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"just relax and read this book...it's fun and exciting."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.

I could go on and on but just had to get this off my chest."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Gone But Not Forgotten has more plot holes than a sieve. The characters do either stupid or unlikely things. The courtroom and police procedures seem contrived and illogical. The prose is simply mass-produced palaver.Perhaps inspired by the sadistic scenes in the book, I forced myself to finish this painful experience. Ouch!Why does such tripe appear on the bestseller's list? Has the American reader become this formulaic and unsophisticated?"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Margolin was the first criminal defense attorney to use the 'battered woman's syndrome' as a defense in court. The defense lawyer in this novel is Elizabeth (Betsy) Tannenbaum, last name of the last book I reviewed prior to this one. Betsy professionally represented a battered woman who was forced to kill an abusive husband. The judge told her, \\"I hope you can put this behind you and get on with your life.\\"There are many kinds of abuse besides getting physically hurt. Emotional abuse is just as damaging in the long run; the wounds are not visible but lie just beneath the skin, near the surface. After the victim has endured as much as she can take and has no other alternative except to fall into the parass of physical violent retaliation for her pain and suffering. \\"He hurt you. Men are like that\\" so they can live out their fantasies. Other men discard you (like yesterday's newspaper).A black rose, a note which proclaimed, \\"Gone, But Not Forgotten\\": a conundrum not ever to be figured out. Where'd Vicky go and why? Some women are better gone and forgotten. Divorce is always a painful process. For most of us, once is enough, but I have known some who went through five or six divorces. One man bragged, \\"All they got from me was their name back\\" until the last one who was able to take (with the Court's help) almost everything he loved and legally owned. He was left an empty shell.When one has been hurt in the process, she will find some way to be \\"not ever forgotten.\\" No abuse is ever forgotten, either, even if the victim represses the worst parts. He will someday suffer greater agony than he dispensed.Margolin has written HEARTSTONE, PROOF POSITIVE and TIES THAT BIND."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Most sadistic and upsetting book I have ever read in so many years, 25 +. Never passed 40 pages. Pure evil towards human beings. I bought it new (2 stories, CostCo, any kid can pick it up and buy it, both bestselling, both the same scheme and disgusting, I checked the contents and some samples) and then threw it into the garbage (no recycling, someone might pick it up and read it), because my conscience does not allow me to pass it on to any sane person I know of or even sell it at a garage sale feeling OK. It's just fine in the garbage. Never before threw a book away, they were always treasured. But may this one rest in peace (I doubt it, with the contents). What happened to ratings to protect innocent and sane children, teenagers, and normal adults? If I knew my teenager would read a book like that, I'd be off to find a GOOD counselor and get that author into jail. Why do we have strict ratings with movies and magazines, but my 14 year old teenager has access to a junk book like this? Parents, we really need to watch out for these things. Our family is open and free-minded, so it is even more a shock. I will NEVER buy a book by Phillip Margolin again for myself or my family. Personally, it seems he is in real trouble and needs help. I'm a very involved reader ever since I could read, from Solchenizyn over Agathe Christie to Jon Krakauer (and everything in between). Never seen something bad like this. Be careful and know there are many books out there that will enrich your minds and lives Everyday lifeid difficult enough already, we don't need more (hopefully fictional) events to ruin them. Enjoy your summer and cheers!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This was my first book by Phillip Margolin as well as my first mystery in the lawyer-as-detective genre. I thought the story was immediately interesting. The author introduced a lot of characters quickly but usually did so in a nonconfusing way while still writing the kind of details that make a fictional character come to life. I felt I knew a lot about them within a few paragraphs. Everything was written in the third person, and the action jumped around a lot; that made things move fast and it was interesting to read the experiences of several lawyers and detectives, a killer, a private detective etc. Characters were complex but in general I liked the good peple and didn't like the bad ones, and I like that. The story also moved around in time and this was done well.In the book, we learn that a serial killer had murdered in New York state ten years prior. The killer always left a black rose and a note -- &quot;Gone, But Not Forgotten&quot;. (One disappointing aspect to the book is that this idiosyncracy is never explained.) A decade later, the same M.O. is being used in a series of crimes in Portland, Oregon. This story is about how the people in Portland are looking for the killer and how people from the earlier investigation become involved.This was an intelligent read and enjoyable. I will definitely read other books by this author."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I am now a fan of Mr. Margolin, and will seek out his other books to read (I went out and purchased Sleeping Beauty this weekend.)This was my first book by him, and noted that it has been compared to The Firm. I consider this much better, here's why. For me, I prefer thrillers to be thrilling. I prefer a little mystery with the horror that goes along with it. I really liked that he didn't make any part of this a romance and the characters were likeable (except for the killer of course!)One thing that really struck me about this story is something that I cannot mention in the review so as not to give away a twist or the end, but there is a part of the tale that will shock you.I highly recommend this book, and look forward to more by Mr. Margolin!"},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Margolin does an excellent job of combining the legal thriller with the suspense thriller. You feel that Margolin stands on his own and doesn't become an imitation of other popular authors. If you are like me you have probably read all too many books that center around serial killings. You may feel that it's been written way too many times. Don't let any sentiment like that deter you from reading this book. Margolin does a very good job of portraying his characters and keeps you entertained throughout. The rewarding thing about this book is that it has a different twist to the killer concept. If you are a fan of Grisham or Cornwell you should like this book, so give it a try."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Phillip Margolin has constructed a complex and exciting thriller with enough plot twists to keep the end in suspense until the last page. This is the first of his books that I have read, and I do not see why Margolin does not get the recognition accorded to Grisham or Ludlum, as he is clearly in that league.In Gone, But Not Forgotten, two related crime stories, separated by 10 years and 3000 miles are unwoven simultaneously. In the New York and Oregon cases, the perpetrator is clearly a cunning genius, killing and kidnapping wives of prominent locals, but is it the same perpetrator in both cases? And if so, why was he able to move on to the second venue and repeat the crime spree?Key characters are involved in both cases, but some have moved on and some are not able to let go. Why did the accused in the second case pick an unknown lawyer to represent him and who is that journalist that is bird-dogging the case? Even to the most casual observer, the ending to the first case would not be satisfactory to professional detectives and prosecutors, yet the case was definitively closed ten years ago.In the end, it all comes clear and Margolin has added some unique legal twists. In what must be one of life's toughest choices, prosecutors and politicians are forced to decide quickly to what extent crimes can be forgiven in exchange for information that might help the living. We had a similiar case in Philadelphia fifteen years ago, where a DA was criticized for reducing charges against a child molester in exchange for information."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Excellent book, I could not put the book down. Non stop suspense.Loved it.Fast, fast going book."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"You've probably already read a synopsis of the book, so I won't waste more of your time. This was the first book I'd read by him. I had never heard of Philip Margolin before I read the book, and now I can't understand why. This book was written so well, and I just couldn't put it down until I finished. It's not one of these books that drags on and seems to go nowhere until the last minute. This book catches your attention and keeps it. Later after I'd read it, I still found myself returning to the story and thinking about some of the characters."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This was the first book by Phillip Margolin that I have read. It was mostly a thriller, but some reviews hinted at a courtroom drama type thing.It was defiantely a suspense/thriller. While the book was a very entertaining read, that moves along at a very quick pace, it is also very predictable.Margolin throws in plot twists that, you, the reader, will find yourself suggesting before they happen. Still, this was a very exciting read. I unfortunately have this knack for plotting and development that ruins most mystery books and movies.And for the ending, it was well drawn out and somewhat believable. I have read that Margolin should be compared to Grisham, but I don't think that is true. Grisham would have built up some suspense, and then ended the book on the last 2 pages. The endings have always been the worst thing about a Grisham novel. He always ends his books so abruptly, like running as fast as you can to the edge of the cliff, and then just falling.Gone, But Not Forgotten is a fun book to read. If you like thrillers, or suspense books, then you should definatley read this."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"The first question I asked myself is why did I wait so long to read Phillip Margolin. We've had this book in our home library for years, and I've finally gotten around to it! Wow...did I waste some time! This is an outstanding, well-written and terrifying book. Margolin has captured a lot of \\"personality\\" within most of the characters in this book: flawed, driven, ambitious, and of course with the killer, actual demonic qualities. The book is filled with many surprises, including some really nasty ones, too! I especially liked the characters of Alan Page and Betsy Tannenbaum---lawyers that seem to have a true sense of justice, fighting even their own demons. Betsy's failing marriage to Rick at first seems cliche, but as it evolves and it's final dramatic resolution, we can see how two people who love one another let jealousy destroy their lives. The character of Nancy Gordon is also a good one, and one has to wonder during the proceedings if she could perhaps somehow be involved in the killings. But at the heart of this book is Martin Darius and Peter Lake----these guys are truly villians in the worst sense of the word. No remorse, no compassion, evil to the core. A stunning book that certainly made me go in and put the rest of his books on my wish list; hopefully, my wife will have such a hard time deciding which ones to get me for Christmas, she'll get them all!HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"This was my second Phillip Margolin mystery and it was better then the first one that I read which was The Undertakers Widow.

His plotting is complex but understandable (if you pay attention), his characters are very true-to-life, and the action is nicely-paced. In this case, it's a serial killer (sort of), a lady lawyer who becomes his attorney (without at first knowing what he is), a D.A. who tries too hard, and a governor about to be confirmed to the Supreme Court with a secret in his political past. This would probably make a terrific movie, but I don't know what you could cut to get it down to size. I'm definitely going to be reading more of Margolin."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"I'm one of those readers that only reads his niche genre.

This story is about violence, kidnapping and serial murder. Rich housewives in are disappearing without a trace and in each case the clue is a black rose and a note. Truly you are kept at the edge of your seat with Mr. Margolin's style of writing and I am amazed at how he portrays his evil character and the way he incorporates a legal thriller with tons of suspense to go with it. This particular novel and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" are two of the best books around to date."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"While there is a certain formula to Philip Margolins books, they have never failed to keep me up reading to find out 'whodunit' and why. There is always a good mix of court room, cop, evil do-er and innocent victim to keep me entertained.This story is a little more far fetched than some other plots and a not as much court room as I like but it was still a good read- I had it figured out before the end but that didnt stop me from reading it till way too late at night."},{"Title":"Gone, but Not Forgotten","review":"Like all Margolin's books this was very entertaining and so smoothly written you are hardly aware you're reading.

Mostly, I don't like the tough-guy attitude that goes with these books, but the techniques, while unorthodox, can work if you practice them, and the underlying principles are almost always sound. This is probably Macyoung's most technique-oriented book, and covers mostly targets, devided into general areas (head, neck, limbs). I like the fact that Macyoung addresses the often avoided question of what part of the fist to strike with, and offers several options without really playing favorites. I still don't really think his &quot;hanging punch&quot; is all that great, but it did open my eyes enough to tweek it a little bit to fit me. I'm also not too sure some of the body targets would be available in a stand-up fight. The chapter on &quot;blows&quot; (only hand techniques) only addresses the mechanics of the arm, and not stuff like &quot;tuck in your chin&quot; or &quot;get your hips into it&quot;. It's almost a start-up book for fighting, but is kind of limited in it's scope, technically speaking. The only chapter on defense is all about shedding, which is an OK idea, but in order to roll with the punch, you have to get hit first, which isn't exactly my idea of fun. I think of this book as being the unwritten chapter of &quot;Cheap Shots, Ambushes, and Other Lessons&quot;, and it's a great companion piece to that book. If you are a &quot;hard&quot; stylist looking to expand your horizons, or a guy trying to get a clue about how to put a hurtin' to someone, it's an alright book on it's own, just not in my personal top ten list."},{"Title":"Fists, Wits, And A Wicked Right: Surviving On The Wild Side Of The Street","review":"Being the author of several books on the martial arts and fighting, I am always looking for books of exceptional quality to add to my library. If I have a book in my library, it's definitely worth owning. One such book is Marc \\"Animal\\" MacYoung's, \\"Fists, Wits, and a Wicked Right.\\"Once again, Marc gives you a no-holds barred look at the reality of fighting and surviving on the street. This book is simply loaded with sound principles and easy to learn techniques for making the most of a bad situation. Marc's not-so-politically correct way of explaining things is always refreshing in today's society where everyone wants to sugarcoat everything so as not to offend anyone. In some ways, I would compare Marc's method of teaching to the comical rants of George Carlin. You may be offended by what he says, but by golly it's the truth. And yes, sometimes the truth hurts.If you are a strict traditional martial artist with a closed mind then (although this book would definitely be good for you), don't waste your time or money buying it. However, regardless of your training background, if you have an open mind and are willing to look at something from a slightly different viewpoint, then I would highly recommend that you add this book (and others like it) to your personal library.I am a traditionally trained martial artist in both Karate and Tae Kwon Do, as well as being ranked in several other disciplines. However, unlike a lot of schools that have degenerated down to teaching a diluted \\"sport\\" version of these arts, I was fortunate enough to be taught the practical version of each technique alongside the traditional version.Although a lot of what Marc teaches in this book I already knew, there were just as many things that I didn't know, or was shown from a different view point.Remember, if you think you know everything, you actually know nothing!"},{"Title":"Fists, Wits, And A Wicked Right: Surviving On The Wild Side Of The Street","review":"Having read most of Marc's books,it interesting to note how he's matured throughout his writing career. This was one of his first in the early '90's. It probably reflects the hight of his irreverent yet very insightful style. His presentation of close quarter street combat princples & technique is unsurpassed. The grim reality & consequences of street combat is stressed in his usual grim but darkly hilarious style. Recommend highly."},{"Title":"Fists, Wits, And A Wicked Right: Surviving On The Wild Side Of The Street","review":"this book shows where to hit to get the most results for your effort plus you also learn commen sense as to when to use strikes so you will not end up with large lawyers fees to keep you out of jail."},{"Title":"Fists, Wits, And A Wicked Right: Surviving On The Wild Side Of The Street","review":"Very good, very informative, without overloading the reader with too much unecessary information.

It offers a \\"blow by blow\\" guide to punching in a non-grappling street fight. Now it is a bit wordy, but if you know how to read in-between the lines you are getting some useful street fighting information. There are some hardcore punching techniques *Hanging punch, read this and practice. There is more to a street fight than connecting your fists against somebody's head.

I can understand how it may be read (superficially) as a typical fifties/Star Trek 'omigosh-the-machines-have-taken-us-over&quot; novel. I do think, however, that Vonnegut has a lot to say in this book about the scaryass, stupidass ways we order ourselves in the pursuit of social status. He has created in this book a society of rigidities and absurdities: how different are the formalized executive games in _Player_ from the informal good-old-boys golf game...no women invited...that occur every weekend in the real world. How many proteges are groomed or rebuffed based on their conduct during those golf games? This is an example of the commentary on conformity that I believe Vonnegut created in _Player_.There's a lot in this book for the modern reader, especially if you like Vonnegut (which I obviously do...)"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano is one of Vonnegut's longest novels. And though very enjoyable, I figured out what was nagging me the entire time I read it - Player Piano is an extrapolated retelling of the plot of Fritz Lang's classic silent movie Metropolis (1926). Nonetheless, Vonnegut took the 115 minute silent movie, which would probably translate into a 40 page book, and wrote in detail and additional subplots to fill out an additional 300 pages that are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Very funny. Not quite as good as Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse-Five but hilarious just the same."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is the first and only Vonnegut book I have read. I was unimpressed. The dialogue was mediocre. The characters were mediocre. The plotting was mediocre. Character development was poorly executed. Plus he's a horrible futurist. His &quot;future&quot; has held up worse under time than virtually any other SF book I can think of. It's completely unbelievable."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The future is always fun to think about. Flying cars, moving sidewalks and automated cars were all part of the future at one point. Let us face facts, Americans think many problems can be solved by science. The problems of crime, helping the poor, spreading the wealth has all been solved a million times within the books created by sci-fi authors and political thinkers.To me this book seems to be the counter point to A Planned Society by George Soule. Engineers, managers, numbers, machines and vacuum tubes can only go so far. Planning everything, assigning numbers and values, putting everybody in their tiny slot in the big picture of civilization is not going to work. It will never work. What works in war time does not work in peace time.The only reason I took a point away was the age of the book. And the death of the kitty."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I'm slowly working my way throught the Vonnegut library; I've read about 12 books so far. Player Piano is far, far below the rest. This is Vonnegut trying to be a pure science fiction writer, devoid of much of the wit and satire that make his other books so wonderful. Looking for some Vonnegut to read? Try Slaughterhouse Five, Hocus Pocus, or Timequake. Only read Player Piano if you're a Vonnegut fanatic and won't feel complete until you do."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"As a fan of Vonnegut's writing, I was extremely disappointed with this book. It has a good story premise but it doesn't really go anywhere. The basics of this story: Vonnegut depicts America as a land run by machines. All the humans must have a doctorate in order to be considered qualified for any jobs because machines have been built that efficiently replace lower workers. There is very little mention of children, but the few that are brought up merely point out the struggles of trying to pass tests for degrees and then fighting 500 others for the one job opening available. The protagonist, Dr. Paul Proteus, gets fed up with his machine dominated environment but doesn't have the will to commit himself to opposition until he is forced into it. There is a second story line with a diplomat from another country touring America as his host tries to convince him of the need to replace humans with machines in his own country. The host fails in his mission as things fall apart in the end.Basically, I thought there were too many strings left hanging in this book. Vonnegut would start off on a tangent, with such extreme description, but then there was no real resolution. Like, what happened to the farm? I was especially disappointed in the ending, expecting more out of Dr. Proteus than was given. So many things were left unexplained that I felt like I was wasting my time reading this book. I would become interested in one aspect only to find myself filled with more questions left unanswered."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I started reading this book with an open mind, but by the end, I could not wait to put it down. It drags its feet through the beginning, however the middle is a bit more interesting. Whatever the middle does is crushed by the sour ending. It seemed this book could have made its point in a 5 page essay without being very repitive.Previous to reading Player Piano, I had read 1984 by George Orwell. Player Piano seemed to be struggling to be 1984, but didn't come to the same level. 1984 was a fast-paced book with a spectacular ending that made it's point by being subtle. Player Piano pretty much hits you over the head with its point from page one.If you are interested in this kind of thing, buy 1984 and forget this one."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"At the beginning it started off slow and then it just got pointless. The society ended up the way the society was fighting to end"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Somewhat uncharacteristic of Vonnegut's work, Player Piano is a bit more serious, a bit more science fiction. The way it makes you feel when you read it is something like when you read Fight Club: you're stirred up, you have to DO something, but you don't know what, because the waters are muddied. Is technology bad or good? Which is more important, being a good person or having know-how? This book is a terrific read, is thick with detail and plot, and is one of my favorites both by Vonnegut, and in terms of fiction in general."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Many consider Slaughter House Five to be Vonnegut's finest work. I respectfully disagree (although I do like that one as well). In this, Vonnegut's first published novel, we get the story of Paul Proteus who strikes out against all he was raised to revere and protect.Anyone who appreciates that sub-genre of Science Fiction that takes theposition that technological advance isn't always all it's cracked up to be owes it to himself to read this book."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano was Kurt Vonnegut's first novel, so it does not exactly fit the style he later developed. In many ways it does contain classis Vonnegut humor and irony, but it is not on the same level as Cat's Cradle. This book is an amazing attack on corporate bussines and technology in general. The whole way we replace men with machines, then turn the world over to the companies with the machines, is examined. Don't like Microsoft? Well this book shows just what they might do if given the chance. An excelent book, just do not expect the same Vonnegut style you found in his later books."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"What immediately struck me is that this book is not chopped into neat little portions that make the other Vonnegut books so easy to digest. Also, the chronology of the book follows a conventional time line of events that Vonnegut seems to avoid in his later books. Besides that, this is wild science fiction. America has been taken over by a computer and everyone has an employee rating based, predominately, on an IQ score. Engineers and executives rule the corporate world as most jobs have become automated. Engineers have become great by making other people's jobs obsolete. The corporate workers don't see what they are doing. For example, when one of the company's long-standing and self-important secretaries (with a Ph.D. - many people in this futuristic setting have been made to get PhDs) is told her job is not necessary because a computer can do it; she becomes upset and can't understand why anyone would tell her that her job wasn't necessary.This crazy culture is oddly observed by Shah of Bratpuhr who hails from an obscure but rich, unindustrialized society. The Shah prays and cajoles the computer to answers his riddles about the meaning of life, but it can't. The shah, despite admonishments by his tour guides, perceives all humans in the society to be \\"slaves.\\"My favorite part of the book is the Executive team building camp. Complete with adulterous affairs, roaring team anthems and silly adult competitiveness, the setting nails corporate suck-ups and purveyors of the corporate line. But watch out, the ghost shirt society is out to change it all!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"\\"Player Piano\\" was Kurt Vonnegut's first novel, and it's a far cry from his later work, which made lavish use of humor -- including broad humor -- and unconventional narrative, including the crude drawings Vonnegut did himself for \\"Breakfast of Champions.\\"The target of Vonnegut's displeasure -- and, thankfully for us, he was always displeased about something -- in \\"Player Piano\\" is the corporate/technological power structure, or what Eisenhower referred to as the \\"military-industrial complex.\\" For the most part, the novel is very straightforward, compared with KV's other works. The style is more lyrical and, arguably, more literary (I'm not denigrating his later works when I write that).In fact, reading this novel, it's kind of hard to believe it was written by the same writer who penned \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and \\"Slapstick.\\" As several commentators have pointed out, \\"Player Piano\\" has as much, perhaps even more, in common with Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" or George Orwell's \\"1984\\" than it does with some of Vonnegut's other novels.If you like this book, don't miss \\"Deer in the Works,\\" a brilliant short story of Vonnegut's that appeared in his collection \\"Welcome to the Monkey House,\\" but was written and published in the same time frame as \\"Player Piano,\\" with which it shares several themes."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Welcome to Ilium, New York, a dystopia where machines have overtaken the usefulness of the common worker. Vonnegut follows the standard formula in his offering to the dystopian genre: the protagonist, trapped in a severely flawed society, tries to overcome his plight and ends up, more often than not, as just another casualty of the system. In this case, the hero is Dr. Paul Proteus, an engineer and one of the big wigs at Ilium Works. Education and money divide the city into the haves and the have nots, with the highest paying jobs going to those who have earned at least a master's degree (those with less than a bachelor's are assigned manual labor). Proteus feels stifled by the boring life of social functions and parties, and often goes slumming in the poorer parts of the city. Here, he is witness to the life of the \\"common people,\\" the undereducated second-class citizens who have lost their jobs to machines, and soon comes to empathize more with them than with his own class. When he is contacted by the infamous Ghost Shirt Society, an underground organization that seeks to overthrow the machines, he is given a chance to change the face of society itself. It's not exactly an original idea, but it is a classic one in science fiction: what happens when man's role in society is replaced by the very inventions he created to make his life easier? Piano Player is a timeless book about modern man's fear of technology's possibilities, and the universal worry that society as we know it will change beyond our recognition. This is a very funny, sarcastic vision of the future that any lover of classic science fiction is guaranteed to love."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"It is hard to believe that this novel was written over 50 years ago. I remember that I was working as an engineer back when I first read it. This was appropriate since most of the main characters are engineers. I remember being struck at how close Vonnegutt's predictions about society actually were. Now that I've reexamined them 20 years later, I am even more impressed.The basic premise of the story is that American industry is run by a tiny group of wealthy and powerful managers and engineers, while the vast majority of the population are stripped of their well-paying industrial jobs and forced to live as poor, powerless menials.This elite of managers and engineers live in closed, gated Orwellian communities, where they watch each other closely for the slightest hint of nonconformity or disloyalty to the system.Vonnegut shows how most managers and engineers have always had a contempt for the average American worker and have been looking for a way to replace them even before WW2. He thought that this would primarily be by automation (as opposed to simply shipping the jobs out of the country.)Vonnegut also assumed that agriculture would be totally mechanised by large corporations and the small farmer made extinct.There is also the eerie prediction that the President would be a man of low intelligence who would get elected on the basis of a \\"three hour television show.\\" It would make no difference because there would be no connection between who was elected and who actually ran the country. Remenber, this was in 1952....Oh yes, he also prdicted that no one would be able to get any job worth having without a graduate degree.I know that some people will say that this novel is dated based simply on the repeated mention of vacuum tubes (transistors were not in commercial use in 1952.) However, if you substiute \\"integrated circuit\\" or \\"computer chip\\" for every place he uses vacuum tube the obsolescence vanishes. Simularly, a modern reader may laugh at the idea of a computer large enough to fill Carlesbad caverns. Believe me, even today the Cray supercomputers and their support equipment take up quite abit of space.My only real criticism with Vonnegut's projections is that he thought that engineers would have alot more power and influence than they actually have. From my own experince MBA's, CPA's, and lawyers have much more power."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"_Player Piano_ depicts a dystopian American society in which machinery runs everything. These instruments were not designed to assist mankind, but quite the opposite: mankind exists as servants of these gigantic leviathans. Human initiative has been permanently stiffled. Managers and engineers exist as mere handmaids to these machines. Anyone who dares speak up may be accused of sabotage or worse. Doctor Paul Proteus, the brilliant manager of Ilium works in New York State inadvertently becomes, through the efforts of others, the pawn in a nascent revolt against this mechanized dictatorship. What results is utter chaos--but what fun!Kurt Vonnegut's satiric and disturbing novel is a cross between _1984_, _Brave New World_, _Oedipus Rex_, and Custer's Last Stand. The novel even includes a group of Indians, a Ghost Dance Society, as well as a bemused Shah and his befuddled interpreter as observers of the resulting confusion. Revolution has never been as enjoyable nor as frolicsome.The theme of man being replaced by machines is an old one and perhaps a touch cliched, but in our age of computer domination and the sinister out-sourcing of American jobs to foreign companies, Vonnegut's apocalyptic novel is as fresh, relevant, and aptly cynical today as it was in 1952, the year _Player Piano_ was published."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book offers an interesting view of social politics as they were in the 50's, and still are. This book tells us what we are all rather blind to see, which is that we really do have very little control in what we do any more, whether it be in education, employment, or any other area. Revolting against the government is eventually what became of it and may...&quot;Those who make peaceful change impossible make violent revolution inevitable&quot;"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Man versus machine is this book's timely theme. &quot;No more spput, puttt or rrrrut!&quot; says Kurt Vonnegut. Player Piano is well worth reading; Vonnegut is the unique author who succeeds in making a reader ponder deeply and laugh heartily all on one page. His main character, Dr. Paul Proteus, is humanely and expertly portrayed in complete contrast to the unfeeling mechanical inventions he has helped to build. Paul is the unpretentious, laidback, and wise electrical engineering manager of Ileum Works near New York. He becomes painfully aware that these repetitive 'musical' monsters have taken over worthy folks' careers and lives. His concern, and that of Vonnegut's main characters, is sensitively portrayed amid clever irony and spontaneous humor. Kurt makes us feel their loss of dignity, not only in their name, Reeks and Wrecks, but also in their low wages, indifferent dress, and separation from managers and machines. Though everyone, regardless of I.Q., has a number, Kurt makes us fell these are prisoners without freedom, escaping from problems in their Homestead pub.Vonnegut's irony runs throughout, one incident involving Paul when his old beat up Plymouth 'dies' on him while visiting Homestead. Though a renowned manager, he couldn't fix it. Along came a rough laborer who not only found the trouble, but also made a new gasket for the car, and instead of putt putting after that, the car purred smoothly.The husband-wife relationship is another irony where romance is a matter of mechanics: \\"I love you, Paul!\\" \\"I love you, too, Anita!\\" Their contrasting characters are very interesting; Paul, desperate to get back to his roots and to nature, buys an old rundown farm where he hopes to work with his hands. Anita, on seeing it, arranges for all of its old tools and old-fashioned articles to become electronic. Paul's depth and integrity are contrasted with her shallowness throughout the book, like two antagonists purging with swords.Vonnegut's supreme irony has to be when Paul is ready to quit, even turning down a Pittsburgh promotion, and is requested by the big boss to infiltrate The Ghost Shirt Society (really the Worker's Union), a cause to which Paul has already (unbeknown to all the upper crust managers) committed himself. So the \`used' becomes the \`user' unbeknown to them all. Thrust into the honor of the title, Deliverer of The Ghost Shirts, he joins the rebels to overthrow management and machines. Build up and climax are great. Though Finnerty, Hasher, and Neumann seemed content with results, despite the fact that they did lose, Paul stood apart thoughtfully and sadly. As he gazed at twisted wires and wrecked machines that were once man-made invention, he pondered that one day, disregarding thee emotionless egg-heads of evolution future inventors and programmers would be born to create stronger, more challenging and, though emotionless, mind-controlling machines.The one distraction is the Shah visiting American technology. But it is so hilarious that it's an asset especially when he meets Epic Ac XIV, the machine wiser than the wisest man. The Shah, though we laugh at him, is the wise one. He thinks American citizens and army soldiers as slaves because only slaves would do as they're told.I found this book to be uncannily accurate, especially since it was written in 1952. As an aspiring engineer, it made me think of how advanced technology will be by the time I have reached my goal. I can't even imagine what it will be like in two or three years, while Vonnegut, somehow, knew what life might be like 50 years later. It's a must read!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Having wrote this book decades before many of his better known works, it has a different personality and vibe than the others. There are no references to other planets or aliens, and this seems more of a philosophical and political book about a universe that is easily envisioned even for our own future should one have utilitarian tendencies in their thoughts. A fascinating premise, interesting universe, but a bit of a disappointing ending. A character with vague but strong anti-establishment convictions loses everything and is so willing to be led by an eccentric man he met at a bar and a college friend, yet gives up after a brief struggle. This didn't make a lot of sense to me. Notwithstanding this, it was one of my favorites by this author if only for the fascinating universe he creates, but also because of the compelling story which ends quite anti-climactically."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is only my 3rd Vonnegut reading. I started with Welcome to the Monkey House and then proceeded to Mother Night. Both were very good but I enjoyed Player Piano even more so. I lost interest a little toward the end but then it picked up again. This would be a great book for a HS or College english class with discussion. I also think it pairs nicely with 1984 which usually gets paired with Brave New World, but I like the contrast that Player Piano offers better."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"If you are responsible for the creation, maintenance, or some other aspect of technological innovations, I highly recommend reading this novel. An amazing insight into what could happen. A deliriously wonderful tangled web of societal woes. Truly many messages can be read from this story even if Vonnegut did not put them there on purpose. Vonnegut's style enthralled me and pulled me into Ilium. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is my first Kurt Vonnegut book and certainly will not be the last. Vonnegut's book the \\"Piano Player\\" is a social commentary disguised as a science fiction novel. His choice of mixing religion and man's need to be useful with the ever-progressing technological evolution is genius. Even if his ideas of technology are a little out of date, the way it affects people's way of living definitely is not. His writing is very light and almost comical at times he doesn't burden the reader with extremes he merely comments on them in short excerpts switching back and forth from different view points and finally having them all come together in the end, proving that each point to characters are making are universally the same. Man needs to be needed. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano is an interesting book about technology being mankind's ultimate undoing. The book really does not get much credit for being ahead of the curve especially considering how popular the novel 1984 is. I find this fear towards technology very fascinating. There is a great deal of fear of the unknown and change. This fear manifests itself in all forms of culture.While not as good a Slaughterhouse-Five Vonnegut's Player Piano is a great book about total control and manipulation. It is funny and well written. For anyone that is a Vonnegut fan this is required reading."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"His writing style was not fully developed, and the series of events went in order, but for his first novel, Player Piano is a great book about a totalitarian soicety, a revolt against technology and machines, all with hints of Vonnegut's wit and humor."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is Vonnegut's first book and is not the typically satirical comedies it is more of serios view of a second industrial age. The book is very thoughtfull and worth a read if your a Vonnegut fan you need to get this book because it provides intersting difrences from his later works but I would not suggest this as a first read of his books."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"A good quick read about an American Society where machines take care of all the work for us humans. After all the mahines are more efficient than man could ever be. Thoughout the book the question is constantly posed &quot;if machines do all the work, what is a human being for?&quot; The question is mainly left unanswered by kurt, I guess he leaves that up to us to figure out. All in all it was a good book that kept my interest and i would recommend to anyone, especially someone who is a fan of Kurt Vonnegut's work."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book is Vonnegut's view of how technology would transform society. Because it was written in the 50's, Vonnegut looks at technology as a force for repression by the elite (i.e., keeping the wrong people in their place). Of course, technology in general (and computers in particular) have had just the opposite effect. Despite this, this book is worth reading if only as a study of how politics are played in a bureaucracy (this, at least, hasn't changed much with time). Especially interesting is the main character, Paul. He a man who, despite having everything on a silver platter, is a malcontent at heart. His pathetic fall from grace is fascinating, funny and nauseating at the same time. His fatal flaw is in thinking his effortless rise through the system entitles him to be mankind's Savior from the tyranny of technology."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I've read a couple of Vonnegut novels and have fallen in love with his style of writing from the very beginning. He's is the first author i've had the pleasure of reading where i'm not consistently looking ahead to see how many pages are left in the book. Every book that i've read by him i find myself upset when the story is done. Player piano is no exception. Since I enjoyed Vonnegut's books so much i figured i'd start with his first published novel. This book started off slow but it wasn't tough to follow the story line and stay somewhat interested. By the end of the book i found myself in awe of Vonnegut's insight of the human race. He seems to be able to see the world from a much higher plateau. One part i found particularly interesting was after the rebellion the only listed injuries to the immediate crew were caused by them trying to tame their own people from causing too much harm to the city. Overall a very enjoyable reading experience .... now it's on to Sirens of Titan."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The book is as much a novel as it is an insightful glimpse into what Vonnegut saw as the devaluation and dehumanization of the American worker in the early 1950s. Those who criticize this Player Piano as dated must remember that the transition taking place in this country in the early 50s was as significant as the Industrial Revolution was to the English in the 1780s. American society was undergoing a monumental metamorphasis-- the birth of a consumer culture that, for example, makes things like Amazon.com, and the fact that you are reading my opinion, possible. 10 years before this book was written, sugar and gasoline were rationed and bread came unsliced because the machines built to slice it were scrapped to build tanks. Suddenly, after the war, Americans were deluged with electric hot dog cookers and automatic garage door openers and the like. The world of Player Piano is the logical conclusion of that process, had that process gone unchecked. Where machines once merely augmented man's abilites, they have come to replace them. It's about more than a loss of pride, Player Piano is about a loss of purpose, and about mankind's tendency to make himself obsolete. Look at Player Piano not as Vonnegut's best novel (it's not) but as the very real concerns of both he and a large group of people who witnessed this dramatic change in how we, as a people, lived."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This Vonnegut novel is about a futuristic world that is controlled by machines and engineers. The main character of the book, Paul Proteus, is an engineer himself, and in the course of the novel he starts to question his job and the society his peers have created. It is a very funny and entertaining critique of modernization and the ever increasing role of machines in our lives. The only problem i had with the book was the ending, which seemed rushed and too short. It seemed as if Vonnegut was not sure where to take the story anymore and therefore decided to end it quickly. Other than that, the book is excellent; it is definitly worth reading."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Kurt Vonneguts books (the ones I've read, anyway) range from very good to great. This book, his first, is not one of the great ones, as it's satrical prose is not yet refined to the perfection that he would achieve in his later works. Also, the book starts out a little slow. However, once the plot is apparent, this is just like any of Vonnegut's books in which it reads very easily and smoothly and leaves you wanting more at the end, with nary a dull moment. Not as jaw-droppingly entertaining as Cat's Cradle or Breakfast of Champions, but Player Piano is a highly interesting book with a message. Kurt is one of literature's most famous Luddites, and this book proclaims the theme, not as good as 1984 or Brave New World, but probably as good as anything since, and with the satrical view, cynicism, and biting wit that only Vonnegut could deliver. Vonnegut fans will certainly enjoy this book, as will those looking for dystopias with a little less pessimism and a little more humor."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Vonnegut's debut novel, published in 1952, is a little constrained. There are hints of Vonnegut's sardonic wit, wild imagination, and unconventional writing style, but only hints. Unlike virtually all of Vonnegut's other novels, Player Piano tells its story in a linier fashion. It starts at the beginning and ends at the end. There's nothing really wrong with that, but for fans of the author, accustomed to Vonnegut's eccentric voice, it feels a little too conventional.Vonnegut is a humanitarian and the message of Player Piano is that people need to have a sense of purpose, and that if you take that away from them - their lives will be empty. Throughout the novel, a leader from another country tours the cities of the United States and having no similar word in his own language, confuses \`civilians' for \`slaves'. The message of course, is that the civilians, in this machine dominated world, are in-fact slaves.Similarities between this novel and Brave New World are inevitable, as both novels explore the relationship between technology and happiness, and the role class structure plays in our society. In both Player Piano and Brave New World, the protagonist is unfulfilled by the trappings of the privileged class and longs for something \`real'. Player Piano is arguably more hopeful than Brave New World (and certainly 1984) suggesting that people will band together to fight for their freedom, however futile, even if it means that they are doomed to repeat the same mistakes again.Player Piano is admittedly dated. It is evident from this novel, and others of the era, that people were wary of the advent of computers and the proliferation of machines and technology. As for predicting the future, neither Brave New World nor Player Piano (nor 1984 for that matter) proved to be a reliable crystal ball. These novels are far more reflective of the times they were written and the author's commentary on those times, than of any actual or likely future.Player Piano is far from Vonnegut's best. Cat's Cradle and Slaughter House Five are two of the best novels ever written and there are close to a half dozen other Vonnegut novels (he wrote 14) I would recommend before Player Piano, but it's still worth reading.3 stars (almost four)."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"An interesting early novel by Vonnegut. Not as fun-filled or imaginative as later works, but contains the seeds of later themes. The main character, Paul Proteus, manages the Ilium Works. He has doubts about the technological advance that seems to value output and efficiency above people. In the story there is a writer, husband of a woman who turns to prostitution rather than have her husband compromise his artistic integrity by writing a book that will sell. The writer's first book was rejected because it was &quot;27 pages too long&quot;, and had an anti-machine theme. The wife remarks, &quot;cmy husband says somebody's just got to be maladjusted; that somebody's got to be uncomfortable enough to wonder where people are, where they're going, and why they're going there.&quot; An insight into Vonnegut's views, perhaps. Although the book is more about ideas than character or dialogue, yet both character and dialogue are competently handled. Paul questions the absolute value and benefice of technology, because of what he feels within himself as well as what he sees happening to people around him. Yet Paul never fully joins the revolutionaries either, whose fanaticism and amateurism lead to their downfall. His difficulties are compounded by the fact that he has no-one in whom he can confide, and in addition, he is being considered for promotion, and his wife is very ambitious. There is quite a lot of symbolism: Paul frequently crosses the river into Homestead where the &quot;workers&quot; live. This is seen as a socially downward move. Paul comes into contact with an underground movement, &quot;The Ghost Shirt Society&quot;, and later actually joins them in an underground bunker where he is hailed as a messiah. The alert reader will recognize echoes of Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot;, HG Wells' &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (with its division into 2 races), and George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, a world where machines and technology rule. Not as much fun as Vonnegut's later works, but solid fare, and food for thought: although the descriptions of Ilium seem dated, the theme of a technological &quot;utopia&quot; gone wrong is one that continually crops up in the popular culture, cf movies such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Fifth Element&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, or even &quot;Terminator&quot;."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Who among us has not heard of Slaughterhouse Five? For so many years, I avoided it simply because the title made me think he was a horror writer. But I read it recently, leading to a wonderful odyssey of reading all twenty or so of his published books. I absolutely love this guy's writing. And his way of thinking. The early stuff was wonderful, the later more undisciplined but somehow even better. A phenomenal talent.Now let's talk about Player Piano. This was his very first novel, and it is probably the most underrated thing he's written. Remember, it was a late fifties product. How he got it past the censors, I'll never know. And by that, I mean that the underlying theme is so true, and so subversive.All the characters are well-conceived and expertly drawn for us to enjoy. The plot is all-too-credible. The story is entertaining and gripping. The man's grasp of the truth of human existence is obvious even here, in his very first of many novels. This is a book that everyone simply must read. Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is absolutely my favorite Vonnegut book, being a science fiction novel wherein the world has become a Player Piano. No one has a real job except those with doctorate degrees who can program the machines. Everyone else is sent to the army (it's a world-government so there are no wars and guns are illegal so the soldiers have wooden rifles) or the Weaks and Wrecks (road repair workers, with ten or twenty being sent to do the job of one kind of like it's becoming today). Dr. Proteus is a doctor who goes through an \\"enlightenment\\" and sees the tragedy of the way the world has become, and is inspired to lead a revolution. Though some view this work as a \\"developing\\" Vonnegut, I actually laud it above all of his others because of the stark social criticism and excellent prophetic voice. Vonnegut may have been a rougher writer at the time, but his first work is much better than the average writers fifth or sixth. He's a bit wilder and less liberal than he was in later years, speaking against socialism and communism as well as the merchantilism he criticized more vehemently in his later years. The characters are more vibrant and believable than many of those in his later works, and his experimental writing is is a joy for dated eyes. What's more, I'd have to consider this an early post-podernist work to some degree because of it's ending, which I won't tell you now.Also, I've always wanted to hear the \\"symphony of machines\\" that Dr. Proteus imagines in the first chapter actually played liked it sounds when you read Vonnegut's description."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Some books I can plow through in an afternoon, regardless of the number of pages. However, every time I read something by Vonnegut, it becomes so deeply philosophical and thought-provoking that I can only take it in small bites.It's about the future of America. It was written in 1952, as his first novel. In the book, a computer takes over the U.S. and most of mans' work has been taken by machines. Citizens are split into two groups: the ones who have high IQs and the ones who don't. In an almost communist society (where the government takes certain steps to ensure a person's well-being through provisions), a few people decide to call for a revolution against the machines, with surprising twists and an ironic ending.It made me consider how much of my life seems automated--wake up, go to work, go home, repeat--and how much more I need to be less mechanized and more human.This is a book that I think I'll buy so I can re-read it."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This was the first book of Vonnegut's that I have ever read and I found it to be a very well written, interesting book. When I read the description of the book, I did not think I would like it. But once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Vonnegut does an excellent job of always keeping the reader wondering about what will happen next. I liked how the book had a few different stories that it followed and how they all came together in the end. For me, this added to my curiosity as I was reading because I was trying to figure out how everything tied in together.This book really got me thinking. Vonnegut wrote it back in 1952 about a world dominated by machines and how people were getting replaced in their jobs by these machines and felt useless, like there was no point to their lives. Today, as technology is advancing, computers are becoming more and more a part of everyday life. Are we headed in the direction of a world dominated by computers? Are we already there?Lastly, I think Vonnegut did a good job of emphasizing the importance of fighting for what you believe in, no matter how bad the odds are against you. The first half of the book really just built up the feeling of people being dissatisfied with the way things were. The second half of this book really showed what people were doing to try and fix their lives. Although the Ghost Shirt Society may have lost the physical battle against the machines, they still came out winners in the end. They took their chances and stood up for what they believed in.I think is a very good book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Somewhat uncharacteristic of Vonnegut's work, Player Piano is a bit more serious, a bit more science fiction. The way it makes you feel when you read it is something like when you read Fight Club: you're stirred up, you have to DO something, but you don't know what, because the waters are muddied. Is technology bad or good? Which is more important, being a good person or having know-how? This book is a terrific read, is thick with detail and plot, and is one of my favorites both by Vonnegut, and in terms of fiction in general."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The great Kurt Vonnegut's first novel is, well, great.This was nothing short of excellent; a strong cast of characters and a vividly imagined world, yes, but where Player Piano really shines is in its rich social commentary. In this world, America has established a sort of minor utopia of ease within which regular, everyday people don't have to do much of anything. Everything is done for them.And boy does that make people miserable.At times funny, at times heavy with satire, and at times straight and serious, Vonnegut manages to keep all the plates spinning at once. Dr. Paul Proteus is a near perfect protagonist, even though he doesn't DO much of anything really. He's just along for the ride, observing the modern world in which he lives and realizing that a life of ease and convenience has a down side. And what an ending!Player Piano makes it clear that Vonnegut was mining gold from the very start."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Perfect read in today's society. I'm an engineer and it is very humorous, yet enlightening."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I honestly would of never have read this book if I wasn't in honors English. It is required summer reading, so I had to read it. I am not sorry that I did. In fact, this book is one of the best books that I have ever read. I could hardly tell when it was written. It told the story of the future, where machines had replaced most human actions and the managers were starting to take over the job force. Paul, the main character, is mad over the system and wants to quit his job as manager of the Ilium works. Before he can, he has run-ins with people from his past and from his future."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"As I said in my heading, this is probably the greatest Vonnegut book, but it doesn't have the odd and recognizable prose that most of all of his other books have. This was his first book, a satire on society, technology and the future. I wouldn't call it science fiction, I would just call this book 'true'. It has some very interesting and provokative points and really makes you think about where you stand in this world.This is the story of a man named Paul who is very high in a society where it's all based on social skills and your IQ, who is influence by an old friend and breaks away from society loosing everything. It's an amazing book, the only down fall is the length, but I'm not complaining. It's one of those books that when you are done you feel compassion for literature, life, what you have and the fact that Kurt Vonnegut is one of the greatest writers ever. God Bless you Kurt Vonnegut...that's all I have to say."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is the great one.Same phenomenon is still continuing, although the decade is differenent.This is pretty much a glory of engineers, but are they so good in other way.I appreciate it.You go to your office and you will notice that the piano player sits right there.This is one of the greatest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"We musnt sit idly by and let the world go astray. Put your mind and your hands to use. Just a few more lessons from a mind that was far ahead of his time. His visions are as crystal, if not clearer, as they were in 1951."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I enjoy all of Vonnegut's book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who appreciates his writing style and humor. Don't expect a mind bending adventure or sci-fi thriller, it's thought provoking and worth a read."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"If you have never read Vonnegut, I would not recommend starting with this one. It's his first novel, so his not as sharp or constantly funny as his later work. But if you are a fan of this author, Player Piano is a good book to read to get the first novel in this bizarre universe. As a Vonnegut fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This novel, Vonnegut's first, is a more traditional narrative than his later books. The story is told linearly, the chapters are much longer, etc. However, the unmistakable Vonnegut themes are very much present, and make their first appearances here. \\"Player Piano\\" deals with the ideas of the danger / dehumanizing effects of technology and how that interacts with basic human dignity. Writing in 1952 about the \\"false gods\\" of technology, one need only look around today to think that Vonnegut was a prophet foretelling our doom.Frankly, I have a hard time nailing down \\"Player Piano\\" because I think it meant something different in its original context than perhaps it does now. There are times when the novel seems very anti-communist and anti strong centralized government. The line is even uttered by a government official \\"Are you against us?\\" implying that the State knows what is best for all. Clearly Vonnegut does not think that is the case. There is also a very intriguing character, the Reverend Lasher. Of particular interest to me was a scene in a saloon where the Reverend gives a lovely speech on the dangers of class warfare. Moments such as this seem tailor made for the early 1950s and what was happening at the time. They come across as a defense of capitalism and American values. If one has read Vonnegut's biography they know that despite the image many people have of him, these were issues that he cared about deeply.I don't want to give away plot points, but the text left me with the distinct impression that Vonnegut had a negative opinion of the impetus and results of most revolutions. The novel is full of contradictions, showing the good and bad aspects of capitalism, communism, messianic leaders, uprisings / revolutions, technology, the advances of science, etc. I don't see where the novel comes down decidedly in one camp or the other. However, one thing the book seems definitive about is in its belief that the general population are nothing more than sheep that easily drift from whim to whim. Like Shakespeare Mr. Vonnegut, in this book at least, seems to have a low opinion of the masses. You only have to pay attention to the \\"common man\\" during an election season or during the midst of the latest pop culture fad to see that Vonnegut's pessimism is justified.\\"Player Piano\\" is not as brilliant as Vonnegut's later books. It meanders at times and could have been edited into a \\"tighter\\" novel. However, there are many moments scattered throughout that make it worth your attention. It is thought provoking and timely, despite being 60 years old. It endures, and that alone is reason enough to read it!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This a great mind-opening book. I recommend it to all distopic literature lovers and the ones who want to discover it."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book did not appeal to me. I have read many Vonnegut books and this one was just boring. Unlike other Vonnegut Books, this did not hook me. It was not interesting or weird, thus boring me to death. To tell you the truth, I skipped many pages just to get done with this book.Like I said, if you hated this book or are about to read it, do not judge Vonnegut by just reading this book. I would rather suggest reading Cat's Cradle, Galapagos, or Breakfast of Champions. This book does not include any of vonegut's black humor, or sheer bizzarity (I have no clue if that is a word) well anyway, The back cover may seem interesting, but the book rarely touches this subject."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"V. wrote this when computers were just starting to change the way people live and I think the themes of the novel deal with many of the questions that come out of our (now omnipresent) use of computers. Plus, its very funny"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The test for a great novel is the test of time and how well it retains its relevancy. When \\"Player Piano\\" first begins, the reader is presented with an alternate reality of the 1950s/1960s in America, who has just fought the \\"Last War\\" and where the common masses are subsidized by the federal government and all industry has been centralized and streamlined by a massive bureaucracy. The new factories are fully automated through a conglomeration of vacuum tubes, wiring, and machines. A technocracy of engineers and managers rule the country, as the President is nothing more than a highly-paid actor.Some of the notions are laughable, such as a supercomputer comprised of millions of vacuum tube that is housed in an enormous network of caves. The great technical computers use punch cards and use standardized tests that determines a person's fate. Indeed, the computers make all the decisions, as the middle class has ceased to be relevant.The central theme of the novel, that of the dangers of relegating factory jobs to machines, has become a reality today. Of course, that has been a positive development, as these lead to new and higher-paying jobs. Indeed, it turns out that the main threat to the factory job has not been the development of technology, but the outsourcing of the manufacturing to overseas factories. Perhaps novels like this and others helped to ensure that technological development always helped to improve the human condition and retain a personal touch to any new technology. Or maybe these novels were just anti-technology hysteria of a bygone era.So now that I've dispelled the central theme of man becoming enslaved to machines, what is the point to read this? It turns out that the anti-machine tone is just one of several complicated themes in the novel. This could just as easily be interpreted as a novel about the perils of the corporate structure and the struggle to belong to a cause. Indeed, the novel's protagonist, Paul, is seeking to find himself. He is the son of the national head of industry, and he is trying to find his own path in the shadow of his father, a father who he resents deeply. His wife is nothing but a hack who attaches herself to a person she thinks will give her the most money and biggest house. The characters surrounding Paul could just as easily be taken from any major corporation, as there are the faithful workers, the brownnosers, the unheralded engineers, and the malcontents. Throughout the novel, the character of Paul evolves as he attempts to \\"find\\" himself.A larger issue presents itself in the idea of a revolution to restore \\"power to the people.\\" The revolutionaries are presented in a conflicted nature, as they are not as idealistic and pure as they seem at first. In fact, each of the leaders of the new revolution have their own reasons. It seems as if life would not be any better even if they succeeded in overthrowing the yoke of machines and technology. There is a moral lesson that we should not engage in change unless one is willing to accept that change, as the characters in this novel are not.Overall, this is a great novel and lends an air of suspense. Although some aspects may be outdated, Vonnegut does a good job in relaying a story of power, corruption, and revolution in a thought-provoking manner."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book is entertaining, thought provoking, and funny. Lately, I've read a lot of Vonnegut, and after most of his novels, I finally picked this one up. I must say I rank Player Piano as one of my favorites. This is a book that makes you wonder, as a lot of what was happening in this future Vonnegut's describing has started to happen to us.Set in a future where most of American jobs have been automated and efficiency is extremely high. The skills of yesterday are no longer needed. The people are divided based on IQ, is that better than a class division based on wealth? Maybe a little. At least we have the very brightest running the country right?I had a lot of fun reading this book, it throws a lot of ideas at you without being too serious.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano is set in a futuristic America where a supercomputer slots human beings into jobs on the basis of one criterion: IQ. It is written both as a satire of modern knowledge economies and as an exhortation to future engineers and leaders that they be certain to always preserve the inherent rights and \`humanness' of humanity even against the boon of technological progression.A man of many talents, author Kurt Vonnegut acquired his love for science fiction and his understanding of the nature of scientific advancement from his undergraduate education studying undergraduate chemistry and mechanical engineering as well as from his time working at General Electric. His social commentary on religion is founded on his experiences in the Unitarian church and his military insight is derived from his experiences fighting in WWII. Furthermore, it is no secret that Vonnegut was a secular humanist, meaning that he holds to, as the American Humanist Association defines it, \\"a naturalistic philosophy that rejects supernaturalism and relies primarily upon reason and science, democracy and human compassion.\\" The existential nature of Vonnegut's philosophical belief system is echoed in his commentary on human happiness and capability.The theme of Player Piano can be summarized as an exhortation from Vonnegut to the reader: \\"Engineers, think about what technological \`progress' means for humanity. Managers, think about what it is that makes humans \`human' and decide whether or not it is something worth preserving. Make certain that each new technological advancement doesn't strip humanity of its humanness, because once technological progress happens, it can't un-happen.\\" This emphasis on \`humanity' and \`humanness' throughout Player Piano is no doubt born out of his personal belief system. One character reflects on the automated \`Player Piano' across from him in the bar where he stands and says, \\"makes you feel kind of creepy, don't it Doctor, watching them keys go up and down? You can almost see a ghost sitting there playing his heart out\\" (Vonnegut 32). Vonnegut uses this imagery throughout the book to discuss the feeling of unhappiness inherent in human idleness and feelings of unimportance when being replaced. But rather than focus entirely on the dangers of scientific advancement, Vonnegut makes sure to portray the good that technology brings in a positive light. The tension between the good of technology and the bad (reflected in the ending of the book) is masterfully done.Vonnegut captures the essence of a knowledge-based economy in an automated future. His wit and sarcasm are simultaneously light hearted and haunting. This book is a must read not only for Vonnegut fans, but for anyone who enjoys a good, funny-yet thoughtful read. After all, the \`value of humanity' is a universal idea, is it not?"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The story takes place in upstate New York where most tasks handled by humans have been programmed and perfected by engineers to run on machines. Everyone who isn't a manager or an engineer is confined to one area of the city and forced to either join the army or public works. It follows the struggles of the main protagonist - Paul Proteus, top engineer. He slowly wakes up to the reality that something's wrong with the whole scene. What follows is his downfall into the center of an uprising which (hopefully) threatens to return America back to the way things were.The central theme of obsolescence and human usefulness is very relevant, possibly even more now than it was at the time. The constant reduction of scrap and refinement of technology is something all engineers are pretty familiar with, and this book highlights how it can be taken too far.On it's own, it's a well done work of sci-fi, but compared to Vonnegut's other work, it feels a bit lackluster. There is still a subtle sense of humor present, but it doesn't have the ever-present ear to ear maniacal grin that you expect from him. Overall, it's a quick read and enjoyable throughout, but I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to Vonnegut. Let this one stand on it's own legs."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"It wasn't the greatest dystopian I've read recently, but it was still pretty good. I felt that the society Vonnegut created was believable, and he did a great job of displaying the emotions of the people made useless by machines."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"So, the incremental cost of an Kindle e-book is zero, but it is priced higher than the paperback version. RIP OFF! Not only that, but the Kindle version is chock full of typos. It looks like they shoved the book through a scanner with OCR (optical character recognition) and never bothered to clean up the scanning errors. Anyone who reads the book cannot miss all the typos, some of which are in critical passages. Ridiculous. If I'm going to be overcharged for an e-book, for god's sake fix the scanning errors.Complaints about the Kindle version aside, this is a great book to read...- 5 stars for the writing- 1 star for Amazon's pricing and pathetic typos in the Kindle version- Resulting overall score: 3 stars"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"For what it is worth, my copy is the 1966 \\"new edition.\\"Having attended many meetings featuring a futurist nut as keynote speaker, I would have to say that Vonnegut, Jr. had a better sense of the matter than the nuts.We have almost arrived (2012) at the point of the author's future, although perhaps having travelled a different path to achieve our destination.In \\"Piano Player\\" a few of Those Who Rule Over Us used automation to divorce the American populace from meaningful employment when in real life Those Who Rule Over Us used the One World Market. Instead of being inducted into the military or becoming Reeks and Wrecks, our children are to be inducted into the military or become a greeter at a box store, perhaps now less Vonnegut's minor financial provisions for his characters.I wish Kurt had been wrong...The uprising was hokey and Dr. Paul Proteus failed to understand how to work the system.Almost a documentary, but still a fantasy."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"A friend recommended I read this after rereading 1984, Brave New World, We, and Fahrenheit 451, I must say that I am happy I took my friend's advice.This is a slightly different twist on the dystopian novel genre, and one that has a bit more of its plot rooted in fact rather than fiction. The world in this novel centers around industry and consumerism with a huge gap between the impoverished and the upper class. The protagonist, Paul Proteus, is an upper class elite industry leader with a PhD and a very secure and promising future. Things get interesting when Paul begins to identify himself with the 'wrecks' and begins to lose his focus on the posh future laid before him and begins questioning the way the world works.Unlike many other dystopian novels of the era, Player Piano has a ring of truth to it (much like Fahrenheit 451 does). The vanishing middle class and the loss of jobs to machines is a very real problem facing the world today. This is a very eye opening novel to be sure.Despite being the first novel written by Kurt Vonnegut, it reads very well and is no less polished than his other, later works. The writing style is very fluid and Vonnegut displays a wonderful grasp of prose. The characters are well portrayed and very likable. There is no real 'villain' other than the mold of society, so even characters on both sides are likable and interesting. I would put this up there with the aforementioned novels as a must read for those who enjoy well written, darkly humorous, dystopian novels."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Vonnegut has a couple of stinkers, Slapstick & Deadeye Dick, in his more than one dozen novels, but Player Piano ain't one of them.Kurt wrote Player Piano while working for General Electric. He saw a machine that was programmed to do the work of a bunch of people and came up with the idea for this novel, set in a time when most of the population have lost their jobs to machines. It's an efficiently run society but not too enjoyable for all those lowly folks with no jobs. Great socialist Vonnegut teaches us we all need work and that we're simply not human without it in this beautifully written, entertaining story."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"player piano is vonnegut jr.'s first novel describing the completely automated future of illium new york. the machines have taken the jobs of the people who were not the best and brightest and left those people to work either as the highway repair crew known as the reeks and wrecks or as soldiers in the army .for the few who were extremely talented or extremely smart there were jobs as managers or egineers in the factorys of illium. these people were considered upper class and rarely came into contact with the lower class because there societies were divided by a river. the upper class striving too make things easier for man kind and the lower class looking for a place where they are needed. the lower class secetely organizes a revolt through an underground group known as the ghost shirt society.after succesfully destroying most of the machines in their city they begin picking through the wreckage thinking up machines they could build with the severed pieces.basically they were chomping at the bit too rebuild there dilema that caused the revolt in the first place.it just shows human nature . vonnegut jr was very creative in his depiction of the future.the main character doctor paul proteus is a up and coming manager at the illium works and through the book he begins too sympathize with the common people eventually he quits his job and joins the ghost shirt society after the revolt began ended succeeded and failed proteus turned him self into the police who were surronding the city"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book was really thought provoking, and despite my suspicions that it would be just another 1984 type book, it wasn't at all. It presents a very unique and interesting way in which humanity can go screaming from the track into oblivion. It isn't as funny as other Vonnegut, though, so I deducted a star. good stuff. this book should be on school reading lists."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano was not as imaginative, not as funny, not as well written, and not as good as most Vonnegut novels. His second effort, Sirens of Titan, is much superior and much more enjoyable. Player Piano is, however, a decent story with an interesting vision, fairly well-developped characters, and some funny bits as well. Perhaps the book's greatest value is that it shows Vonnegut developping his style and improving his craft. The major detraction: the book is slightly dated."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Although I consider myself an avid reader of Vonnegut, I was surprised to find that I couldn't help finding this book kind of childish in the simplicity of it and its message. Don't get me wrong! I love Vonnegut. I'm just saying that this book happens to be an exception to his great work, possibly because it was his first and his style hadn't fully matured then. The true Vonnegut books that I recommend reading, are 'Slaughter-House-five' and 'Mother Night.' Please don't dissmiss Vonnegut as a bad writer if you don't like this book or hear that it isn't good. It is not in any way representational of what Vonnegut can do. Go read 'Slaughter-House-Five' and you'll witness the true power of Vonnegut's art."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The book was pretty good. I can see how Vonnegut was just forming his style in the book, just becoming comic, \\"sci-fi\\" and all. As far as the \\"great condition\\"/like new, I have had books in better condition from this category. But it was still very cheap and readable, so that is all I needed!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book is a very interesting book. Anyone who decides to buy this book will be done it in about a week. The premise of the book focuses on a person who inadvertantly messed up they sysytem and tries to make it right. This book has almost every type of subject matter ranging from drama to war to machinazation of idustries to the social impact of machines on people in everyday life. This book may seem to be technically, but once the book starts it grabs you and every page gets better and better."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"You can definitely see some of the raunchy, outrageous writing the Vonnegut is so well known for. The story is very linear, which is very uncharacteristic of his later books (i.e. Bluebeard, Slaughterhouse Five, Breakfast of Champions). His anthropological influence is as strong as in most of his work, which calls to mind his characters' struggle of man versus society. The science fiction aspect of the book is quite imaginative, even in the contemporary sense. He reflects what society would be like with machines doing all of our dirty, repetitive work, but not in the typical, glamorous way that sci-fi usually portrays. Usually robots and machines either help mankind to achieve impossible feats of stregnth or they tend to kill all humans. Vonnegut simply has them as the unknowing innocent bystander, sucking the purpose of life away from us all.Its really a great read if you are a Vonnegut fan. But, if you haven't read any Vonnegut before, his first book isn't the one to start with. Choose from these three, you can't go wrong: \\"Cat's Cradle\\", \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\"."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I read PLAYER PIANO because Kurt Vonnegut is by far my favorite writer, and because I'm a completist. I'm glad I did. It's a decent post-pulp-heyday, Eisenhower-era dystopian sci-fi work, and as a period piece and an example of early Vonnegut, it's fascinating. It's not, however, terribly GOOD. It's clearly an author's first novel, and Vonnegut could have used a better editor, because it seems the one he had was writing this off as a dime-store novel by an unknown. A more exacting editor would undoubtedly have torn apart the more glaring problems: Dangling plot threads, a lumbering first third, entire themes forgotten for chapters at a time. Still, even the best editor in the world could not fix other problems, such as the fact that Vonnegut had yet to find his voice (although echos of it are there, particularly in the characterization and the subplot involving the Arab visitor). And nobody could have seen how dated the novel would look today, given that the 50's-era brand of mechanization has given way to the 80's-era brand of digitization, an entirely different dynamic. PLAYER PIANO is not a BAD novel, just a decent one. It's fun for us fans to see Vonnegut develop as a novelist over the course of his next three novels, each of which is progressively better: THE SIRENS OF TITAN, MOTHER NIGHT and finally his masterpiece CAT'S CRADLE. For Vonnegut fans and sci-fi historians, this is essential. For casual readers, I'd recommend skipping straight to MOTHER NIGHT."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This book is a 5-star book for engineers and technologists, particularly those working for big corporations, but probably only a 3-star book for anybody else. (You can guess from my rating what I do.) Vonnegut creates hybrid eu/dystopia brought about by the ultimate success of American ingenuity and capitalism. Dr. Proteus is brilliantly and complexly written as a successful technologist desperately aware of his relationship to his corporation and of the corporate's relationship to the world. Feels more like Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\" than Orwell's \\"1984,\\" but is more humane and sad and beautiful both in its hope and despair in humanity than either of them."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano is the story of an unlikely uprising against an over-industrialized society, which proved to be too successful and reminds the reader to &quot;be careful what you wish for.&quot; Doctor Paul Proteus, manager of the Ilium Works plant responsible for the industrial output and energy production of Ilium, New York and the surrounding area, sought to escape his predestined vocational life. One of the people he encounters in this quest summarized nicely the disenchantment Proteus and his cohorts felt with technology, and the trail of obsolete men left behind in its wake.&quot;The machines are to practically everybody what the white men were to the Indians. People are finding that, because of the way the machines are changing the world, more and more of their old values don't apply any more. People have no choice but to become second-rate machines themselves, or wards of the machines.&quot;Proteus' rebellion against his industrialized world starts quietly enough, with the acquisition of a farm and the conscious sabotage of a promotion he deserved. However, he eventually crosses paths with radicals who saw fit to not only stem the tides of mass-production, but to destroy all of the machines in the process.Interesting enough story-line, right? Yes, but the story's potential is better than its execution. Many great ideas are left unpolished. Besides Dr. Proteus, there are no sympathetic characters in this tale, which made it difficult to root for the revolution's failure or success. Plus, things spiraled so badly out of control that you don't even know if success was achieved by anyone's measure. This book was one giant crescendo, and the actual revolution occurs in about five pages at the end, hastily described and leaving way too much to the imagination. There were many characters introduced independently who eventually met at the end- not in a logical way that sewed everything together, but in a chaotic assembly of random people (e.g., the Shah of Bratpuhr- what was that guy's purpose other than comedic relief?)."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I agree with a professor of mine when he told me that Slaughterhouse Five is better written, but Player Piano is more entertaining. This book is not at the peak of what Vonnegut is capable of, but it is a well done piece of satire that is wonderfully entertaining. One thing I enjoy about Vonnegut is the model T writing. By this I mean for him it is the bare essentials. He writes only what is necessary for either plot or character. Now I do enjoy the verbose nature of some of the grand old novels or the stream of conscious experimentations, but when I settle into a Vonnegut I love every moment of it. This isn't his best novel, but I give it five stars because of the special affection it holds to me as being one of the first novels I read growing up. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes good entertaining satire."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I have been a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut for many years, and I've enjoyed several of his books immensely. This one got lost on my overstuffed bookshelves for many years until I recently found it. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the many other books I've enjoyed by this author. That's not to say it wasn't good; this man vs. machine story set in the future is dated and relevant at the same time. The description of &quot;future&quot; machines is unintentionally amusing, considering our computerized world, yet the theme of man being displaced by machines is still timely.The books starts off slowly; if you can make it through the first third, you'll do OK. It never really builds beyond that point, but it's never boring, either. Still, fans should take a look at this one, because it's early Vonnegut, and he's beginning to show the style and humor that have made him so popular."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"My kiddo got this book as a required reading book for her advanced middle school English class. It started out OK until page 10 when the swearing (profanity) started. It's a great book showing an alternate society and the science fiction is fantastic considering the publish date, but the content is not really for younger readers who will end up bored and exposed to unnecessary language. Needless to say we requested an alternate.Highly recommended though for adult reading. I finished it in just a couple of days because I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I got this book for a class but I ended up really enjoying it. Reading about a possible future written in the 50's about the 60's is always kind of hard to swallow but we live in a world like the book. Most American's don't work in factories anymore and in the book that is because of machines and for us it's because of overseas labor. Although the reasons are different some of the reactions are the same and is a good read and relevant to today's world."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"The scenario of Player Piano is just a little unrealistic, when compared to today's reality: yes, computers seem to be taking over much of the work formerly done by humans (or other animals). But, humans keep finding other things to do. They seem always to stay one step ahead of the &quot;machines.&quot; At least so far.Therefore, the world of Player Piano didn't really &quot;grab&quot; me. I can't see it happening. Oh, there is classism, as in this book, here in the good ol' US of A, but the system seems also to keep evolving, thus preventing the &quot;revolution&quot; that takes place in this book. People complain widely about the &quot;trickle down&quot; theory, but there seems to be something to it.The women in this story are pretty sad. You can tell they're from the 50s, when women, I suppose, seemed to lack original thought of any type. Paul's wife, Anita, seems a prototype in this regard, same with Kroner's wife, &quot;Mom.&quot; How many &quot;Moms&quot; have we known?The idea of the Reeks and Wrecks, though, I think is workable. It was workable, with the Civilian Conservation Corps, and now we have the Job Corps, state Conservation Corps, and such. CETA was that type of program, but not all of the jobs were &quot;make work.&quot; This just means that the government is the &quot;employer of last resort.&quot; There's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't imply a ruling class of scientists and engineers, and it really has nothing to do with Marxism. CETA or CCC jobs can satisfy a person just as much as other jobs, and from that job they certainly can move up, if they have the ability to do so.Another point: Notice how the good ol' boys got together on an island and did competitive physical activities (with their wives at a separate location). This also gives Vonnegut's time period away: pure 50s stuff. Today, people don't compete so much one or two weeks a year, but they go to a gym and work individually in a non-competitive atmosphere. Times have changed? For the good, I'd say, otherwise, you get poor fools like this Shephard fella, who lives to compete (and seems to enjoy losing also....masochistic?).Anyway, except for the date and time &quot;stamps&quot; on this novel, it still does hold up well today, and it's certainly intellectually stimulating, makes you think and take a position regarding &quot;encroaching&quot; technology, so-called &quot;technocrats,&quot; and, what should we call it, &quot;Neo Ludditism&quot; today. This will probably be an ongoing conflict throughout human history, or at least for a long time, so Vonnegut touched an archetypal chord there, and his book may still be relevant in 3004, who knows?Diximus."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Vonnegut is a humane, funny, and unpredictable writer. I have read all of his books and short stories, and this is the only one I just did not like. The style is very straightforward, and in a word, boring.If this is the only Vonnegut you've read, it is not representative of his work as a whole. Try &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; or &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; to discover his simultaneously hilarious and heartwrenchingly (what a word!) prose. Read Vonnegut's &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; for one of the best collection of short stories around."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I have read three Vonnegut books. I loved Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five, so I decided to read his first book, and was disapointed. It was good, but it took me many tries before I could really sit down and get into it, and that doesn't happen to me very often. It has a really slow start, and I can't decide whether it ends up being worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this book while I was studying Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic. This book is very well written and the story is fantastic. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the engineer engineers himself out of his own job. Classic! kind of remind me of my last IT project."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"After reading this book, I was amazed at how someone during that time period could write something so drastic and get it published. Before reading this book, I had never read anything by Kurt Vonnegut. However, once I finished it, I decided that it was so intriguing that I wanted to read other works of his, so I bought Slaughterhouse-five. After only reading part of Slaughterhouse-five, I found that these two books are quite different and that I actually like Player Piano more than Slaughterhouse-five even though Slaughterhouse-five is better known. I believe that being an engineering student affects that opinion greatly because I can better understand the concepts of machines doing work that regular people once did. The main character in Player Piano provides such a great portrait of what happens to a lot of engineers and other people in such technical fields. The stress that Paul Proteus undergoes and the effects that it has on his well-being matches almost perfectly some engineers and other technically inclined people that I know. Based on this experience, I think that this book would be a great read for anyone who has some sort of technical background, but that it is definitely not for the younger, less knowledgeable group of people. I think that it actually might help people in Proteus's situation because it will give them an outlet to relieve all the stress that is created in such an environment."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This novel, now more than half a century old, does not hold up, except perhaps as an indicator of what people were worrying about when the novel was published. The problem is Vonnegut's tendency to sketch so many of the details of a society run by machines. As a result, there are too many set pieces where a character whose skills have been (or are about to be) replaced by a machine ruminates, rather predictably, on his loss of purpose and dignity. You will find your eyes skimming the page.I found myself thinking a lot about that other depiction of the triumph of the scientists and engineers, \\"Brave New World.\\" Both novels have rather obvious plots that serve primarily as vehicles for the authors' ideas about the future, but Huxley is content to mostly suggest the domination of machines through an apparatus like the Feelies or games like Obstacle Golf, without pages of detail. And the philosophical meditiations he gives to characters like Mustapha Mond are far more interesting (and frightening) than the evidently mindless boosterism of Vonnegut's Dr. Kroner. Some of \\"Player Piano\\" actually sounds like the earlier book (\\"Brave New World\\" was published in 1932), particularly Vonnegut's description of The Meadows, with loudspeakers blaring cheery songs and suggestions the way they do in Huxley's [...] Porgy scene.Ultimately, \\"Brave New World\\" is the bleaker (and, to me, more troubling) book, since it predicts that human beings will always give up their personal freedoms in order to be comfortable through an abundance of consumer goods, readily available drugs, and promiscuous sex. Vonnegut, on the other hand, is more optimistic, since he seems to suggest that there will always be people to question the role of machines and even smash them up if need be (if only to turn around and build them again). In Huxley's world, life is so pleasing that dissent is almost umimaginable---and certainly doomed, as the swinging of John's feet to all points of the compass suggests. If you want to read a dystopia about the triumph of machines and engineering, start with \\"Brave New World,\\" then check out Margaret Atwood's three dystopias, which are more compelling and better written than \\"Player Piano.\\""},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This year is the 50th anniversary of this novel. I remember that I was working as an engineer back when I first read it. This was appropriate since most of the main characters are engineers. I remember being struck at how close Vonnegut's predictions about society actually were. Now that I've reexamined them 20 years later, I am even more impressed.The basic premise of the story is that American industry is run by a tiny group of wealthy and powerful managers and engineers, while the vast majority of the population are stripped of their well-paying industrial jobs and forced to live as poor, powerless menials.This elite of managers and engineers live in closed, gated Orwellian communities, where they watch each other closely for the slightest hint of nonconformity or disloyalty to the system.Vonnegut shows how most managers and engineers have always had a contempt for the average American worker and have been looking for a way to replace them even before WW2. He thought that this would primarily be by automation (as opposed to simply shipping the jobs out of the country.)Vonnegut also assumed that agriculture would be totally mechanised by large corporations and the small farmer made extinct.There is also the eerie prediction that the President would be a man of low intelligence who would get elected on the basis of a \\"three hour television show.\\" It would make no difference because there would be no connection between who was elected and who actually ran the country. Remenber, this was in 1952....Oh yes, he also predicted that no one would be able to get any job worth having without a graduate degree.I know that some people will say that this novel is dated based simply on the repeated mention of vacuum tubes (transistors were not in commercial use in 1952.) However, if you substiute \\"integrated circuit\\" or \\"computer chip\\" for every place he uses vacuum tube the obsolescence vanishes. Simularly, a modern reader may laugh at the idea of a computer large enough to fill Carlesbad caverns. Believe me, even today the Cray supercomputers and their support equipment take up quite abit of space.My only real criticism with Vonnegut's projections is that he thought that engineers would have alot more power and influence than they actually have. From my own experience MBA's, CPA's, and lawyers have much more power."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"A lot of people, even Vonnegut fans, probably haven't heard of this book, for whatever reasons. Vonnegut really doesn't discuss it that much, mostly because he dislikes the label of science-fiction, which this book, along with The Sirens of Titan and even Slaughterhouse-Five, clearly is.Still, this book is a must for Vonnegut fans or even those interested in old science-fiction in the style of Orwell or Huxley. Those looking for Vonnegut's classic deadpan black humorist style won't find it here. The beginnings of it are here, however and Vonnegut's tale of Paul Proteus' rebellion against the oppressive government is still as entertaining and fascinating as it was years ago. Read with the aforementioned 1984 and Brave New World, this book provides a slight contrast by using a different tone and more humor, but the message is still the same, that technology will ruin us all and bring about our ultimate downfall.Fortunately this book has been reissued so that fans can see how Vonnegut started out, and fortunately, unlike most writers' first novels, Vonnegut's initial effort is just as readable as his later works"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I am only 25 and already burnt out and disgusted with the corporate world. This book really hit home with me. Vonnegut mocks and satarizes corporate life, which, after reading this book, obviously hasn't become any less discouraging or frusterating as it was 47 years ago. Player Piano is a must read for anyone who is appauled by the reality that, with few exceptions, one must completely sell out and conform in order to advance in a large corporation. Anyone who is currently mired in corporate America will recognize at least one or two of the characters and/or situations in this book as ones they themselves have had to (or continue to) deal with regularly, and therefore will feel a strong bond with Paul Proteus by book's end."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This was the first Kurt Vonnegut book that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It was also his first book, since I was reading them chronologically. At first, it was a bit slow-going and a little confusing. But after the first 20 pages or so, you're taken into this world that is completely believable and utterly fascinating. This book was ahead of its time; describing the life of one man living in an age of machines. It's funny and poignant and absolutely wonderful. If you've never read anything by Vonnegut, I recommend starting here; it's a great way to see how his writing style has developed over the years. If you have read some of his stuff before and just haven't read this, READ IT. I tell you, it'll suck you in and you won't be able to put it down. I know that's an annoying cliche, but it's true. Kurt knows what he's doing. :)"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Some books I can plow through in an afternoon, regardless of the number of pages. However, every time I read something by Vonnegut, it becomes so deeply philosophical and thought-provoking that I can only take it in small bites.It's about the future of America. It was written in 1952, as his first novel. In the book, a computer takes over the U.S. and most of mans' work has been taken by machines. Citizens are split into two groups: the ones who have high IQs and the ones who don't. In an almost communist society (where the government takes certain steps to ensure a person's well-being through provisions), a few people decide to call for a revolution against the machines, with surprising twists and an ironic ending.It made me consider how much of my life seems automated--wake up, go to work, go home, repeat--and how much more I need to be less mechanized and more human.This is a book that I think I'll buy so I can re-read it."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"I think most of the reviewers missed the boat on this one. This is probably one of the most accurate predictions of the future I have read. All it needs is an update in computer nomenclature, and this could have been written yesterday. Think about it: How many craftsmen have been replaced by the kind of machines he describes? How many &quot;engineers&quot; are walking around today, who have never physically built anything? How useless is a high school diploma in today's job market? Planned obslescence, artificial economies-The only thing he got wrong was the world war (at least for now). And yes, I realize the irony of writing this review on a computer."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is the first Kurt Vonnegut book I have read and I definitely enjoyed it. This story effectively tells how man is becoming more and more reliant on machines to perform work, and as a result most people are left only the most menial jobs such as painting the little used roads that run from the wealthy neighborhoods to the poor. This book parallels the American society in which the educated tend to get the $57,000 a year jobs which call for the employee to put other people out of work by creating new machines. The poor, unfortunate people are allowed to live a life in which everything is provided for them but they lack pride because there are no meaningful jobs for them. I also found Vonnegut's comments on how testing people for intelligence can be misused to be rather interesting. A variety of tests are given to the characters in PLAYER PIANO to determine their worthiness in the business world. Hmmm, kind of reminds me of the SAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, and the wide va! riety of state tests. The title is also very fitting. A piano used to require a person to push the keys in order to work. Then came the automatic player piano and people were no longer needed. Those who comment that Vonnegut's book about the future is unbelievable, apparantly fail to see that Vonnegut wasn't really talking about the future, but was really talking about the present, albeit a rather exaggerated present."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano, by Kurt Vonnegut, is an interesting novel, especially considering it was published in 1952. The basic plot centering around Dr. Paul Proteus, the flawed City of Illium and his struggles with the dominant machine-centered lifestyle is solid enough to hold someone's attention, and the humor peppered through the dialogue is a welcome compliment to the traditional science fiction theme. Paul's casual &quot;To hell with you&quot; remark to his colleague Doctor Kroner showed his cynicism but was still humorous nonetheless. There's some interesting exchanges as well, notably the encounter between the Shar of Bratpuhr and the super-machine EPICAC XIV. One of the reviews I read mentioned loneliness as the central theme of the book and that the science fiction surrounding played a secondary role. I wouldn't go that far, but there is a certain amount of validity in that theory. Vonnegut himself, being so anti-technological, might agree with this as well. Obviously, he wanted to show the destructive and negative affect mechanization will have on society as a whole. But the ill effects of a machine-dominated society come at a personal level just as much as they do on a grand scale. Toward the end of the novel, Proteus comes to the conclusion that he is alone in his grasp of reality (the true evils of Illium) as the revolution ends. From his hatred and struggle against the machine-dominated society to his &quot;automatic&quot; relationship with his wife, Doctor Proteus was emotionally isolated. He doesn't want people to perceive him as a &quot;stuffed shirt&quot;, and he struggles with this throughout the book. Vonnegut wants people to see how excess technology can harm and potentially destroy both the fabric of society and the inner-person as well."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"\\"Player Piano\\" is Kurt Vonnegut's first novel. It was published in 1952, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1953. It was republished under the title \\"Utopia-14\\" in 1954. The story seems to hold up fairly well after 50 years, although there are a few aspects that are a bit dated. Overall I highly recommend it, as an excellent satire of our society. In discussing the book further, there are some spoilers, so only read on if you don't mind.It would be easy to categorize this book as simply one of many science fiction novels where machines threaten to destroy man's way of life, but there is much more here. This is a satire of American society. The story is set in the future, where only a few men have decent jobs, with most of the rest of the work being done by more efficient machines. There are shades of \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" in this book, but there is more as well.Most of the book concentrates on the harm that the machines are doing to man's spirit. We have a highly polarized society, where those who have been judged to have high potential get the good jobs live in entirely different areas than the rest of the people, and they consider the ordinary people ungrateful for the good things that are being given to the common man. The hero, Paul Proteus, is pulled away from the upper society by a friend, Ed Finnerty, who also was once part of the intellectual elite, and away from the wishes of his wife and his boss.He eventually decides to quit his job, and buys an old farm where he can live simply by doing honest hard work, but before he can quit, he is setup to spy on his revolutionary friend by being fired. Once he is brought into the revolutionaries' meeting, he becomes convinced that their cause is the right one, and decides to commit to their cause. The revolution results in the destruction of almost all the machines, even those that are beneficial to man. Ultimately, we see that society will start to rebuild and use machines again, and so in many ways we are in a vicious circle."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"This is one of my two favorite Vonnegut books (along with Galapagos), but I disagree with those who have posted the opinion that the true value of the book is Vonnegut's earily prophetic vision of social dinamics in post-industrial America. I believe that Vonnegut's intent was to convey his opinion of what constitutes fundamental human dignity (usefullness to others, in Vonnegut's opinion). Read in such a way, this book flawlesly illuminates the indignity of social welfare and mechanization."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"As corporate managers realise the power that they weild over those that they purport to serve either as shareholders of cutomers their behaviour becomes more and arrogant. The narrowness of personal value and vision that got them to where they are, raises no objection to more and more extreme action in defense of their power. The elevation of consumption to culture that fueled their success leaves them frustrated and unfulfilled at the pinnacle. To give their success meaning, they begin building a new culture based on their shared experience of success through slavish obediance to superiors. Underneath this culture, oppossition inevitably builds against not only the managers but, mistakenly, the systems of production from which they draw their power. In the ensuing revolution, the best and the worst are lost together."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano was the late Kurt Vonnegut's first novel. Published in 1952, the novel is set in an industrial dystopia where the engineers are the top rung of the ladder. In the name of progress, the engineers create machines that can do the work of men. Only the best and brightest are allowed to attend the colleges necessary to secure doctorates. The rest of the population is consigned either to the Army or the Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps (Reeks and Wrecks). The main character is Dr. Paul Proteus, the head of the Ilium Works in Ilium, New York. Proteus is the son of one of the men who led the mechanization of America, thus he is well-respected and expected to rise to the top. But Proteus is decidedly unhappy with the system, particularly the way the common working man has been disenfranchised. The main thread of the novel follows Paul as he attempts to sort out his loyalties, while a side story follows the Shah of Bratpuhr, who's being given a tour of America.While the technology in the book is quite dated, the story itself still resonates strongly, especially in this age of computers and outsourcing jobs to foreign countries. The people in the story have become enslaved by technology. The people at the top need to be able to create and control the machines in order to maintain their elite status and the people of the bottom have been excluded from making a meaningful contribution to society by being replaced by machines. The people at the bottom are either in the Army, the Reeks and Wrecks, who do very menial tasks, or they just do nothing. They are segregated from the elite managers and engineers. The elite don't seem to have it much better as they spend the majority of the book spouting useless propaganda and jockeying for position. This is the America that causes Proteus to question every value he once held dear.Despite the somewhat bleak circumstances of the story, Vonnegut tells it with a wry humor and a sharp sense of satire. Player Piano is perhaps the most conventional of his novels and written linearly as opposed to the nonlinear jumping around he would use in later books. This was the first of his novels I ever read, given as a high school assignment back in 1994. I enjoyed it then and I still love it today. I've read some reviews that have said that Player Piano doesn't hold up when compared with his later work. I couldn't disagree more. The story is still relevant to modern times and it's told beautifully."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"What vision!Vonnegut writes this amazing novel from a pre-Internet, pre-Information Revolution, pre-Overautomated era. It is based a post-war society that is run by technocrats - an elite group of managers and engineers who year over year gradually improve and automate society.The story explores the moral choices presented to a society, and the institutions required to maintain an ever-improving status quo. The protagonist is a budding technocrat struggling with his place in this dehumanizing society. He struggles with a wife he claims to love, a duty he feels obligated to live up to, and a sense that something is deeply wrong.The agitation, and revolutionary action in the novel speaks to many times. It speaks to a fear of automation in a pre-technical society. It also talks to the activism in the 60s, with a message of \\"Rebel even if you can't succeed\\". It also speaks to today's world, where every choice presented to us seems to be filtered through numerous technologies...This was a very quick read, a very entertaining read, and a very insightful read. It put words to ideas that it drew from within me. It's timeless message does great justice to the author's reputation."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Kurt Vonnegut does an amazing job of integrating his vast knowledge of science and technology with the harsh realities of society. While his work is science fiction, it is truly believable as it speaks of many of the problems which plague American today. When the novel was first published in 1952, Vonnegut cleverly predicted a society, which would be led by technology, and would one day devalue all human thought. The amazing thing about this is that this concept may seem even a bit outdated today.Not only does he deal with issues of technology, he also incorporates ideas of female roles through the inception of Anita into the plot and the restraints she feels as a result of being a woman. Most importantly, however, Vonnegut is very \\"Thoreauesque\\" throughout his novel. He is quite successful at leading the reader to realize how important a simple, individualist life is away from many of the confines which society tries to place on people. In this way, I would highly recommend the novel to anyone interested in the culture studies or society as it was in the 1950's."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"When Vonnegut wrote this novel, I was a young lad and lived in the same upstate village of Alplaus, NY. Kurt was a PR person for General Electric. And, so because of this he became associated with GE scientists. When I first read Player Piano, I was amazed at the similarity with that small village. As I read, the fictional characters became evident. Local village scientists. I won't name names..I found this somewhat interesting having know some of them as a youngster. Kurt used to rent a room above a nearby home. Mrs. Cheney's. Just to go and write. And, remove himself from his house which overlooked the Alplaus Creek.This is just a bit of literature history that few know. Just an insight. Trust that you enjoyed it. And, how great authors get their background for novels. Yes, he did use my mom as a very brief character. They were friends."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"When Vonnegut wrote &quot;Player Piano&quot;, he was primarily a scientist interested in literature. By the time he wrote his next book, the cult-fave &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;, he was a writer interested in science. The transition is contained between these pages; obviously very influenced by Orwell and showing a society turning itself over to technology. The Frankentstein-comparisons and government-as-fascism schemes are hardly original, but his use of humor is already evident and his characters already rich and full of ideas. Don't overlook this terrific novel, a sort of seperate universe from the rest of Vonnegut's nadir. The situations may not be familiar, but anyone with an appreciation of the author will be thrilled"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"One of Vonnegut's best novels; certainly his most traditionally narrative and coherent. In the glorious future, machines have freed man from most types of labor, and simplified the categorization of people. Everyone is tested scientifically for IQ, personality, and aptitude; everyone's life determined by the tests. Most people spend most of their time bored; they cannot compete for the few real jobs available, most of them in engineering, and must choose between the Army and the Reconstruction &amp; Reclamation Corps. Only the few, like Dr. Paul Proteus, have IQs high enough to make them more useful than computers. Proteus gets involved in a minor revolution, but it is ultimately to no end. Progress is inevitable, but what is good for the body may not be good for the soul"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Written in the 1950's just when people were starting to envision computerized machines (ie. Robots)Vonnegut presents a dark look at society divided between the priviledged engineer class that designsand runs industry and the passive dumb masses that are either directy supported by government welfare or assignedto the Reconstruction and Reclaimation Corp (Wreaks &amp; Wrecks) - a work fare program with no real aim or agenda.All funded by robot manned factories where the machines are taxed. Able to produce massive amounts of cheap productsthat allows the welfare state to survive. Look around folks, it's happening here today!"},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Player Piano is Vonnegut's first work. It's also quite different from most of Vonnegut's other works. The writing has much less &quot;Vonnegut punch&quot; to it than Vonnegut's other novels. However, that's not to say that it wasn't as good.Player Piano is a story of the world in the future, seen from the eyes of Paul, dissatisfied leader of Illium works. Everything is run by machines. Because of this, there are only two types of people. Educated people who work running, regulating, and designing machines, and un-educated people who perform manual tasks machines cannot (ex-road repair). These two types of people live on different sides of town, with very different life styles. They associate with eachother as little as possible. Paul soon realizes that the creation of machines has ruined the lives of many people that could have become something. If only the people would unite, and the machines be destroyed, quality of life could be improved- that is the general theme of this book. Of course, the plot has more depth and is actually very entertaining at parts.There were quite a few &quot;side plots&quot; put in by Vonnegut to stress the theme and make the story more interesting. At times, they did just that. At other times, they seemed unnecessary and just distracted me from the plot. (So be sure to concentrate when reading this book). My only other complaint was that Vonnegut almost used the entire first half of the book to introduce the characters and set the scene for later &quot;action&quot;. This is both good and bad.I DO recommend you read this book. It's entertaining, and the moral of the story is very true. Begin reading Player Piano when you have some sort of energy to concentrate, so you can pick up on the characters and story line. You'll get the most out of it that way. Overall, it's a good, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Player Piano","review":"Vonnegut's first novel is an excellent piece of writing that represents the author's fabulous potential. Do not, however, read this book simply because you enjoyed Slaughterhous 5. While the most famous of Vonnegut novels deserves every word of praise it has recieved, it does not, in my opinion represent the gist of his work. Player Piano does. It includes all the classic elements--vivid and fresh characters, clever and careful plot, and, most importantly, the satirical wit. Vonnegut's style changed substantially throughout his career, and this is a shining example of the first phase."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"I'm a middle school science teacher. We study viruses in 8th grade. We read this book aloud each year. Peg Kehret is a children's author who had polio when she was a kid. She tells the story well giving the kids an insight into the disease and it's place in history as well. The 8th graders really are engaged listeners when we read it. Parents who have read it tell me they enjoyed it and learned from it, too. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"My son will read this in school this year in 6th grade, so I read it when we purchased it. I could not put it down.

It was a disease without a vaccine or antidote that meant excruciating pain, followed by extensive physical therapy assuming that the patient didn't die from complications. There are three main variants: spinal polio, which causes rapid paralysis of the arms and legs (generally asymmetrical), bulbar polio, which causes difficulty breathing and swallowing (and frequently requiring the use of iron lungs as breathing muscles and mechanisms are greatly weakened), and respiratory polio, a combination of the above two. Peg Kehret was twelve years old when she contracted respiratory polio; she was the only victim in her small Minnesota town that year.Peg recounts her terrifying illness in a very matter-of-fact yet gripping narrative. Paralysis set in rapidly, and she had a fever of 102 for nearly a week as her muscles weakened, requiring her to use an oxygen tent. But Peg was lucky; once her fever breaks (aided by a contraband chocolate milkshake), her recovery is much more rapid than her fellow hospital and rehab roommates. Even though Peg is nearly a teenager, there are small poignant touches of the remnants of childhood; her brother Art sent her a teddy bear that had to be burned once she left the polio ward, and her mother recommended that she donate her old books and toys to the children's polio ward. Peg resists, recalling happy memories with her old books and toys, and is dismayed to find that her parents have redecorated her old room as a surprise.Peg is an engaging narrator who brings a distant era to life through radio dramas such as The Lone Ranger and the simplicity of a time where books and friendships filled our hours instead of electronics. Her rehabilitation is tempered with humor and spirit; no self-pity here, only the desire to become the best she can be. The Sister Kenny method of polio treatment is described in detail, along with physical and occupational therapy exercises. Peg has a crush on Dr. Bevis, a handsome doctor who makes her feel special by painting her toenails when she's still in intensive care, and promises him that she'll return to walk for him. She makes friends with several other girls recovering from polio, including the bitter Alice, who's lived at the rehabilitation center for ten years after her parents couldn't care for her. The girls are brought together by their shared experiences as polio survivors, and Peg is apprehensive about rejoining her school and the outside world.The novel is brought full-circle by the sad mention that Peg, along with her former roommates, suffers from post-polio syndrome; around 25% of childhood polio sufferers develop additional symptoms decades after the initial infection, including muscle weakness, fatigue, or paralysis. After working so hard to overcome polio, she's certainly not giving in now. There are also vintage photographs of the author and her roommates scattered throughout. A marvelous introduction to polio's debilitating effects and the power of positive thinking on recovery."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"My daughter, age 9, was assigned to read this book as part of a Reading Olympics program in her school. I found it at the library and read the first chapter to her while we were still in the library. She did not want me to stop reading. We read it together every night after she had finished her homework. She was so fascinated with Peg Kehret's story that she would work hard to finish her homework in order to leave time for reading before bed. I highly recommend this book for older elementary and middle school age children. The author offers a very engaging glimpse of her experience as a child their age going through an enormously difficult and challenging ordeal. Her courage and humor in the face of her disease will give children insight into coping skills they can use someday."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This book is a must if you are looking for a book for your Mother/Daugther book club.

It is an autobiography about peg Kehret, and when she got polio in the seventh grade. It started on homecoming morning; she was building the seventh grade float. Then in the hallway, by her locker she all of the sudden she fainted and woke in the hospital not remembering how she got there or who changed her clothes. Then she went home and fell asleep on her bed for about two hours than woke up and she couldn't move her parents took her back to the hospital to get tested the doctor asked her parents to leave after her parents left the doctor said \\"After multiple tests... we have came to the conclusion that you are paralyzed from the neck down\\". What they did to find out if she had polio was to drain some fluid from her spin and tested it for the deadly disease. This all happened in the late 1940's back when there wasn't a vaccine to prevent polio. In 1949 Peg Kehret turned 13. In her long years at he Sheltering Arms hospital she eventually took therapy and started to move her fingers, then parts of her arms then she could move both of her arms. After she could move her upper body she started to exercise her upper body. After about two or three yeas of therapy she started to move her feet and her legs. After another year of therapy she started to walk a little, then a little bit more each time she had therapy. I believe she got to meet Shirley Temple in the ten to twelve years at the Sheltering Arms hospital.

Peg didn't go to the parade that day instead she laid in her bed awaiting a doctors visit. Peg was diagnosed with three different types of polio. Peg struggled with many battles breathing, sitting, eating, and walking, but through it all she was a very strong little girl. The author (Peg) tells just how she fought the long hard diseaseI liked how this book was a true story. Since polio is such a hard disease to get over you become to respect Peg (the author) for what she went through. The writer truly knows how to write. With every ending of a chapter she would leave unanswered questions that you would only be able to answer if you went to the next chapter. Peg would end chapters like \` I fell asleep when I woke up, I was paralyzed.\\" Her writing style is very easy to follow, and her vocabulary is easy to understand. She explains things so well, that you can simply build a picture in your mind things like \\"I tried again. Nothing happened. I tried with my left arm. Nothing. I tried to bend my knees so I could roll on my side, but my legs were two logs\\"... This book was very thought out when writing it.I would recommend this book to all people who like true stories. Unlike nonfiction books this story is how life truly is one day you can fell fine, and the next you're diagnosed with three types of polio. I really think this is a great book. It's well thought out, and well written. Peg wrote in a matter that is easy to read and follow.

This truly wonderful book will help others who have never had polio to at least have somewhat of an understanding of the freight and truely horrifying disease that polio truely was and, unfortunately, still is. It has never been fully eradicated. This touching gem will help those who've never had polio to get a better understanding of exactly what polio is and at least some of the emotions someone will go through not only at the time that they are informed of their disease, but some of the emotions that will take place as the killer stalks them and little by little destroys them emotionally and physically. The lady, Peg, is truly fortunate that she lived. Many did not. She gives a wonderful accounting from the point when she was informed of her disease all of the way to the point where she is now free from the disease. Did I say free? Once one has polio, you're never free of it because many who had it in the 1950's are now experienceing a renewal of their pain. I did. I did not have to use crutches again, but at one point a few years ago it was back. Some have to use the crutches one more time, even after fifty years. It can come back.

In the book, Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio, Peg comes to find that she has three different types of polio. She started off with just a muscle spasm, thinking it was no big deal. She later finds out she has polio. Then she finds out that not only does she have polio, but three different types. She meets a few people in her journey through different hospitals. This story is a page-turner; it's amazing to see how strong some people really are, not on the outside, but on the inside as well.This book is incredible. People think that their lives are so terrible, but really when you think about it, and you read this book, you realize things aren't as bad as they seem. I mean, I am not one that loves to read, but to hear someone else's story, and about there life, it's shocking. I honestly, would never be able to deal with what she went through. She went from hospital to hospital; she dealt with the mean nurse that made her put hot rags on her skin to help loosen her muscles. I would never be able to handle the stretching, and the hot rags or any of that. It shocked me to hear that polio can kill you. Some of the girls in the room that she stayed with had polio also, Alice has had it since she was little, and her family didn't want a blob sitting/laying around all day. One of the other girls had to lay in an iron-lung, because her lungs were not strong enough to let her breathe on her own. It's sad how none of them can walk very well because of polio. They either walk with walking sticks, wheelchairs, or they walk very slowly with out anything. I could not put the book down. I thought about my life compared to Peg's and the other girls, I would be stupid to try to make people feel bad for me considering what other people go through.

Enjoy! :0)"},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"A Review by ErikaCan you imagine being a young child in the hospital unable to move any part of your body? This happened to Peg after she got a disease called Polio. Peg was put in an intensive care unit at the nearest hospital and soon moved to another hospital for more intensive treatment. Peg was trapped inside a machine they refer to as the Iron Lung. After a few months she was released from that hospital only to go back to the one she was at before. But before she left she promised the doctor that she would come back and be able to walk for him. Will peg ever get to walk for him?I really liked this book because you want to keep reading and its full of excitement and disappointment like when Peg takes her first steps with her new walking sticks. As the story is being told Peg, the patient and the writer, is always telling her feelings and giving you insight to how she felt during that time. The feelings that you have for Peg go from happy to sad and excitement and anticipation, like when Peg first learned that she had Polio. I really like how Peg uses descriptive words and phrases to describe times like her Physical Therapy sessions, she called them Torture Time because the stretching was so stressful and hurt her very week and unused muscles. I personally don't have any complaints about this book, it was great!I would definitely recommend this book, \\"Small Steps, The year I got Polio,\\" to teens and older. It's a great easy read and awesome if you like to read reality books. If you like how this book sounds then go check it out!"},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"The first chapter gives you that feeling that you don't want to put the book down. My dad and I were reading before I went to bed and he said, \\"I'm reading the 13th chapter and I loved it already! I can't believe it.\\" There is one boring chapter, but other wise that this book is the bomb! Yes I do say that word. Anway back to the book. It inspired me so much that I read it in 3-4 days. The way I found about this book was from B.O.B. Also know as Battle of the Books. I loved this book so much that I want to buy it! (that doesn't happen very often). I saw the word \\"Polio\\" in the title and I said \\"oh this looks good!\\" Hopefully you will feel the same way. Read it! It is ofcourse a true story! good Luck!"},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Although I've of course held of polio, and gotten polio vaccines for my boys, I knew very little about it before reading this book. After reading it, I am eager to find out more about the world of polio. This book brings to mind other hospital stories such as the wonderful but now out of print The Plague and I. It's interesting how the author adjusted to life in the treatment center and has trouble re-adjusting to &quot;real life&quot;. I loved hearing about what happened to her friends with polio in their later life, and felt truly sad to read the author has post-polio syndrome. I would recommend this book for both older children and adults."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This was an excellent book that very accurately described what children experienced when they contracted polio in the 1940's and 1950's. It was well written to be read quickly by an older child or by an adult to any child or just for their own education. Peg Kehret's memories will help as a base in any discussion of polio; what happens, how it was treated and in some cases overcome, and what health problems reoccur many years later."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"I really liked this book because it told you what it meant to have polio. Peg Khert told you in her own words what it was like to be a child with polio. She writes how deadly and dangerous polio was in 1949. It was heartfelt and she made friends along her hard journey. I think that kids and adults should read this book."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Peg Kehret has updated her memoir about the year she contracted polio and the aftermath. The body of the memoir has not changed but the epilogue has been updated. It has been 10 years since Small Steps was first published. She tells about her search for some of the inhabitants of the book and even asks readers to help her. Poignantly she tells of her husband's death and how her experiences with polio have helped with her grief. If you have not read this book, pick it up. If you have read it, read the updated epilogue. You will revisit old friends."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"I purchased this book for our home library. As I do with every book, I looked through it to check it over before handing it off to the kids. I began to read the first page. I couldn't put it down. A few chapters into the book, I was crying. A couple of hours later, I had finished the book.This book made me so thankful for the immunizations we have to protect our children from disease. I grew up in a generation of children who did not have to worry about polio, but I recall seeing a friend of my mom's who limped because of polio. Though that did make an impression on me, it was not nearly as enlightening as reading what a sufferer of polio went through as a child. The fever, the pain, the loneliness, the fear!It's an enlightening book for children as well as adults."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Thank you, Peg Kehret, for writing a very moving story of your battle with polio. I was 10 when I was diagnosed, and went through much of what you did with the addition of 6 months in an iron lung. Your book brought back many memories of those months in the hospital. I was so terribly terrified and saddened when several of the children on my floor died - I guess we had to grow up much more quickly tnan many of our peers. I know that your story will make many children understand the devestation of the disease and understand how incredibly fortunate they are that it has been eradicated. Good luck, too, with your post-polio symptoms - I am undergoing some of the same changes, but our hearts will remain strong and resilient. We will, I hope, overcome polio again."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This book gives a child's account of a very devastating illness. For most young people today polio is not a threat. This telling of the times will help youth know what a positive outlook, support and love of family and friends, and dedicated medical staff can do to help overcome serious illness. It also strongly has the message that we must be kind and helpful to others. Peg Keret gave so much just by telling of her experience.thank you for such a meaningful story."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Not only did I enjoy this story, but as a sixth-grade teacher I can tell you that my students raved about it.

It is a real eye opener for today's children."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Peg Kehret has written an out-standing book that I will always treasure: Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio. This novel has won 4 awards! The setting is mainly at Sheltering Arms, a hospital, but the book starts out at Peg's middle school, when she first gets the impression something is wrong. Being only 12 at the time, she never mentioned anything to her parents. Tragically, that was a big mistake. Eventually, they found out and called a doctor. Peg Kehret was soon diagnosed with Polio. While on the way to recovering, the main character finds her-self in a room with four roommates, Alice, Dorothy, Renee, and Shirley, and they soon become family. This is a true story that taught me to be thankful for my health; it made me see that not every one's totally healthy, and that some of us get the short end of the stick. Because of those issues mentioned, grades 6th-8th would most enjoy this book. While reading this story, I never stopped. I read the whole thing in one sitting. This could be a weakness of the book; I ran out of pages to read. All in all, this novel was one of my personal favorites.

She found lasting friendships with six other girls who shared the same illness. It was filled with compassion, grace, and true to life experiences."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This book was actually rather good, but it almost sounded as if it was narrated by a child. It lacked good description, and it jumped around too much for me to enjoy it to its full potential. It was a very good story though, and a good insight into what it's like to have Polio.I usually don't read books like this, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I do recommend it for children and people wanting a first-hand account of someone affected with Polio."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This book that is called Smal Steps is a very good book for all kinds of readers.

I think that you should read the book because if you ever get polio you'll kind of know how it works. Another reason you should read the book is if there's someone in your class or grade that has polio, you should not tease them. If you read this you will know how it might feel for people who have polio. That's why you should read the book The Year: I Got Polio."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This book is an awesome bibliography. This author is coming to my school and I'm really excited. Before I read this book I didn't know what bad things polio could do in fact I had no clue what polio was. By reading this book I found out in a fun way what polio was. I would much rather read this book then sit down and read an encyclpodia. If you haven't read this book, READ IT!

A must read for all who had polio."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Peg Schulze Kehert was stricken with polio in 1949 on Friday early in September. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put down the book Small Steps. This is one of my favorite books. I loved that it was a true story. The author Peg Kehret makes you feel a part of the book, and she describes the characters very well.For example, in Chapter 8, Peg quickly becomes acquainted with her new roommates. Dorothy is fourteen, a cheerful girl with a shy sweet smile. She is sitting in a wheelchair when Peg arrives, and she waves a welcome. Peg likes her immediately. Shirley, who is also fourteen, is fighting a double problem. She has been born with arms that only straighten halfway. Now polio has made her situation worse. After seven months in the hospital, she still has no movement in her legs. Because of back weakness, she can sit in a wheelchair for only brief periods. She also has breathing problems. Renee, petite and dark-haired, is twelve, like Peg. She tells Peg she is learning to walk with leg braces and walking sticks. She will probably always have to use them, unless physical therapy works wonders. Peg's last roommate is in a wheelchair, Alice, who is thirteen. Alice is a sturdy-looking girl with wide eyes and soft curls.I didn't like that they put the pictures of the characters in the middle of the book. It broke the book in half and it ruined what I thought the characters looked like. I wish they had put pictures at the end with the epilogue. When I finished this book I wanted to read it again. If you like true stories and a happy ending you will love this book. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Like I have said before in a prior book review, I am not much for factual books, or non fiction books. However, I like to read what my children read with their classes, and other such things. This is a book that he has brought home, and I managed to finish. I enjoyed reading it. It really taught me how people coped with polio before the vaccine even came about through the eyes of a polio survivor. It was a story full of hope even when one may think all hope is lost, and they thought they were near death. But this author proved that miracles do occur. This is definitely a good read for young readers, especially to grasp their attention on subjects they may not otherwise want to really learn about. I loved it. Peg, you are a wonderful author. Thank you for authoring books that I think are a great educational tool for my children."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. It made me cry, laugh and be sad and happy in the same book. It's awesome. The story was really good. If you like medical dramas, you will definitely like this book. It is all true.-JK, age 10"},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Peg Kehret is a well-known and respected children's author. The book is a memoir about her life when she was diagnosed and treated for polio before the polio vaccine and improvements in disease prevention. Peg was one of the many thousands of children patients diagnosed with the cruel disease. She easily writes about her experience which includes the illness, pain, treatments, and the hospitals.At the hospitals, she had made friends with other polio patients also children who were stricken with the disease. In some case, they needed an iron lung to survive and breathe. Peg describe the oxygen tent and the pain of having precious items burnt after she is no longer quarantined. This book is fine for young readers and adults who are interested in the subject of polio.Be thankful, that the disease is pretty much eradicated by modern medicine. Peg fondly recalls her friends with polio in this book."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This book is fantastic! It will make you laugh and cry as you go on the journey with Peg and her experience with polio. A definite page turner. It is hard to put this book down (as is true for all books by Peg Kehret). This is one of my most favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Her writing style is simple and feels like the time period it represent--1950's. An adult may be left with a few unresolved questions at the end of the book, but a child--about 3rd grade to 7th, boys and girls--will love this.Since polio will likely mean nothing to a young reader, there is some mystery involved with the story. The inclusion of black and white photos only adds to the interest level. And at the core of the book is a survival story that makes a young reader root for the protagonist."},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"I'm a Jr High special education teacher & I purchased this book to see if I wanted to use it with my class. I thought it was a great book and an easy read & I will definitely use it with my class this year. Of course after I purchased it here (for about $4 w/shipping) I found it in the book warehouse near me for $1, but $4 is still a good deal :)"},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"Small steps was an enjoyable book and i would definatley recommend it to all of my friends. During this story, a polio patient named Peg, changes, not facial or look wise but mentally. At first she would worry about winning first in something however when she gets diagnosed with polio those worries change. Now she worries about whether she'll make it or not, and she realizes how lucky she really was without the polio. One of my favorite things abobut peg is that she can always take a sad thing and make it better, such as whenshe needs a wheelchair, instead of outing she learns how to wheelie on it! there is one thing i would warn you about; there isnt a lto of dialoge. If you love dialoge and cant get enough of it, then you are just like me! I dont really like books without dialoge. however, when i read this book I realized it has enough dialoge to keep me coming back for more. Although i really like the way it was written too. When in saw that this was a biography, i hesitated to pick it up. But when i started to read, i realized that this wasnt one of the ordinary boring biographies, but a biography written in fictioin form! Also, if your looking for a book written by the author then that is anothter reasen for you to, go out and get this book. Small steps is written in frist person. The plpot of this book is very easy to follow now read carefully; a 12 year old girl named peg is diagnosed with polio, and is taken to many different hospitals. While she is being transfered, she is fighting with all of her gut to kick this polio out of her system. That is as far as i am going with that.Wait there is more, if you are also not a fan of long expositions; this book is probably the best one or you. Tyeh exposition is npt long at all. It simply describes where Peg lives how old she is and what she like sto do, and then the action starts.p.s. if you are going to read this book i hope you enjoyed it as much as i did!"},{"Title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"I loved this book! It is about a girl named Peg who is stricken with Polio. My fav. part was when her temperature dropped by drinking the chocolate milkshake. I would recommend this book for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The First in the Dark Tower series, the Gunslinger Sets the stage for what will continue in the other books. The gunslinger, a cold, adventuring cowboy (the last of his kind), is on an eternal hunt to find the mysterious Dark Tower. To reach this destination, he must question a shadowy immortal of extreme power known only as the man in black. To this end, the gunslinger stops in interesting towns as he treks through a seemingly endless desert, the forest, and the ominous peaks that lead to the other side, where no mortal has set foot. He is completely absorbed by his quest, and has been trained to destroy anything in his way. For example, in Tull, a town in the middle of the desert, he brutally kills the entire town's population when a fanatical Christian convinces the rest of the generally friendly populace that the gunslinger is an agent of Satan. Another example is when he has the choice between taking his only chance to catch the man in black or saving his friend, a young boy from the past; he leaves his friend to fall to his death while the gunslinger catches up with the man in black.The plot is excellent and the ideas are fascinating. The many twists add a sense of uncertainty. The book eventually revolves around the concept of infinity, and the unerstanding of infinity by a finite mind. This concept leads into the Dark Tower, a representation of the entire multiverse in one, down to the smallest of possible dimensions.There are a few discrepancies in this book. One of them has to be the fact that the book rarely stays in chronological order. Suddenly shifting from a barren desert to a gallows in a remote part of the world twenty years in the past. Such shifts are common, but the book is usually not hard to follow. Another is the fact that is takes the reader fully halfway through the book before just to find his name. Even then he is referred to as &quot;the gunslinger.&quot;This is an awesome book!!! YOU MUST READ IT IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF ANYTHING OF A FANTASY FAN!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"To tell the truth I am not a huge king fan. I have tried to read a few of his books and just couldn't do it. Then one day a saw this book and thought that I might give it a try since it looked more like a fantasy novel than his usual horror novel. I had to read only about 10 pages in and I was hooked. I really like how he kept a lot of the stuff having to do with the tower a mystery. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it seemed like I had read the first chapter in a mutch larger story. Anyway if you like or don't like King this is a good book and I will now begin to read the sequal. Great job mister King you truly have a lot of talent when it comes to writing storys."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Though the criticisms I have seen on this book are not entirely innacurate, there is something that everyone thus far has overlooked. Even though the pace of this book is not near that of the others, this book offers insight into what the Roland of &quot;today&quot; is. Without this book, there would be no meaning to Roland's insanity in The Wastelands, and also no measure of how much Roland changes throughout the series...So in that light, I think that this is one of the most functional and important books in the series.DO NOT try to read the series without this book...The rest lose a LOT of meaning without it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I started to read this book many times.

Never before had I read a tale so haunting, so eerie and engaging that I was forced to read it again and again. Brilliantly devised situations and desolate landscapes focus the tale about the inner workings of a troubled hero. King produces his most memorable character to date in the form of Roland. His quest, shady and romantic, urges the audience to read on."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower series is my absolute favorite literature. It's just good entertainment. If you think you don't like Stephen King, try this series. It's not horror, it's fantasy, and even a bit of sci-fi.

I lost a lot of sleap reading this book. He makes you wanting more when your done reading. This proves that King can write something extrodinary, if your looking for a good book to read, get this now!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first book of the Dark Tower series has got me wanting more. This was my first book by Steven King. For King to stick with this book for so long and let his vision fully progress that really has to say something about the author. This book is short but there is so much that is touched on that you just know that the series is going to be so deep and intriguing.The Gunslinger - Roland - is such an interesting character. King lets you into his mind and persona but there is still so much mystery to him that he really is a character that you wonder what he is going to do and just makes you want to keep reading even more.Reading the introduction it was very interesting to learn that he read The Lord of the Rings and it really inspired him to write his own epic. The juices really got flowing at a screening of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly which King says was an inspiration to create a land/world based on the western. Might I say some really good stories to get your motivation from.Not going to lie I'm really excited to see where this quest goes. There are so many questions that are presented in this first book that I really want to figure out in these next books."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The best part of this book for me is Stephen King's Introduction and forward. He talks about what it was like to be a young writer composing The Gunslinger. He writes about the changes he made to the book in this revised and expanded edition. Not surprisingly, the purists have lambasted this version, which is probably good for King and his publishers, since this negative attention has made me (and presumably many other first time readers of the Dark Tower series) want to read the original rendering.The story itself is ok, but for me, not great. It is in the fantasy (some call it science fiction, but I don't see the science) genre', but I still think King's strength is in horror. I realize this was King's start in the business and in some sense his life long project since it took him many years to complete the entire series. Therefore, to be critical of this work, is to be critical of Stephen King as a whole. Personally, I find this argument fallible, as I am a huge fan of much of King's work.This book just seems to be a frustratingly futile attempt of one man (the gunslinger) to find his purpose in life. His chase of the man in black leads only to an anti-climatic meeting in the end, especially in light of the very famous opening quote, \\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed\\".One aspect of this novel which is appealing is the development of the relationship between the gunslinger and the boy. The boy deserves much attention, since he gives the book something of an edge by inserting a scared, unsure boy to contrast the placid, cold gunslinger. This relationship also seems important in a narrative sense as it gives King reason to flashback to the gunslinger's own childhood. Whether these flashbacks prove important in later books in the series, I do not know.These unsatisfying resolutions and unknowns may give way to a larger truth, that is, King really wanted the Dark Tower series to read as one complete book. To give a somewhat poor review to a book before reading the entire series may be a bit like reviewing a book after reading only one chapter. I reserve the right to rethink this book (and the series as a whole) as I read further."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"My son picked up this book because someone left it under his desk in his Accounting class. My son is in 11th grade and is 16. He started reading it and couldn't put it down. He had never read Stephen King before, but he has seen many Stephen King movies and enjoyed them. My son doesn't usually pick up books for enjoyment, he only reads books if it is assigned for school. He read a lot of the book the first night, but realized that the person who left the book in his Accounting class, would miss the book, so he returned the book to school the next day. The next day I bought him the book so he could finish reading it.He enjoyed reading the book over Christmas break and now has taken out of the school library Stephen King's second in the Dark Tower series titled The Drawing of the Three. I recommend this book for anyone to read, but I especially recommend you get this book for a teenage boy to get them to read for enjoyment which is the best reason to read!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I read this book over the last week and it was the best book i have read in a long time. If you like to read then you would like this book, The story and the way Stephen king writes just makes you want to keep turing the page. This book is a good read for teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I stumbled across this book...Looked interesting enough, so I bought it. At first I had doubts, it starts a little slow, but soon found my eyes addicted to its pages. Get this first of four books, read 'em all, they're awsome."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"First off I'm sick of all the wannabe writers who have to wright a huge reveiew so lets cut to the chase. This book is great with a great story and a great character that keeps you turning pages. Yes this book does leave you asking a lot of questions but it's supposed to do that for the sequels. I already started the next one which is already great and I am already looking forward to the next two."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"It took me a bit of scepticisim and some hard work to get through this book, but by the end I was convinced that there was some hope, and that Stephen King wasn't a bad writer after all. I read On Writing first by him, and was hooked, by line and sinker on that one. His poetry freed my mind and taught me a little something that I didn't know before. Something different. I really liked Roland to be the bad guy in good situations. I didn't know how to respond to that! I was touched and I was intrigued all at the same time. I liked a lot how King depicted the people he met along the way in Tull, and then the way they died...very vivd I might say. 4 Thumbs up Mr. King!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I finsihed this book during exams and was sorta dissapointed. The novel is very slow moving and hard to get into. There are constant flashbacks and I eventually became very confused. I'm starting the second book in this series and am glad I was able to get through this one. The second one is a lot faster paced and has a better plot. Read this book only if you have intentions of reading the rest of the series. If not, be prepared rereaed parts to understand it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have no words. Just read it. The Dark Tower serie is the best (if any) of Stephen King"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Oh, he is one of those that writes the kind of book that you're afraid to open, but know you have to and in the end, will be so glad you did! Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In this first installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, we're introduced to a desert landscape where, as King cryptically explains, the world has moved on. For reasons unknown, the gunslinger, Roland Deschain, must find the dark tower and to do that he must catch a nefarious and enigmatic character from his past: the man in black. It's all pretty vague, and the narrative tends to be as thin as the volume itself, particularly when Roland's pursuit leads him out of the desert with a young companion, Jake, who he stumbled upon along the way.This isn't to say The Gunslinger is a bad book, and it certainly can't be called boring. As simple as The Gunslinger's premise is, it's extremely effective at keeping the reader engrossed, and King sets up some really terrific scenes along the way.Unfortunately, King appears to be fumbling to figure out what his story is about. Mashing elements of fantasy and western together turns out to be an intriguing concept but, between bland flashbacks that provide plenty of action but paltry character insight and a complete lack of limitations on what this fantasy world cannot be, The Gunslinger feels undercooked.In his introduction King seems to be aware of this and comments that he has gone back and tuned the story up a bit, but clearly there's only so much that can be done.Ultimately, the book's small size is its greatest asset and liability. Rather than the first installment of a series, The Gunslinger feels like only the first few shaky chapters, establishing little more than a basic premise. But if you're on board with the premise, you're sure to pick up the next installment."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"So, I'm giving The Gunslinger the literal, Goodreads version of two stars which means \\"it was ok\\". And it was, for the most part. I'm just not into Westerns (and The Dark Tower is sort of a Western), but I am into Stephen King (hence why I even picked up The Gunslinger). But, my God, 219 pages have never seemed so long to me (I'm not counting the Afterword since King's are always amusing). I really couldn't bring myself to care about the book.I only started caring about the book about forty pages before the end. Before that, I just liked the relationship between Roland and Jake (one big reason why I kept reading). I was just so bored throughout most of The Gunslinger. Boredom caused by reading rarely happens to me, but when it does, it really becomes the death of the book and most of the time if it's a series, I don't bother picking up the next installment (as the Mistress of the Art of Death sequel knows too well) and that's if I even finish the first installment.However, I did finish The Gunslinger so that has to count for something, right? Granted, had I not owned books 2-6 of The Dark Tower series, I probably would've put The Gunslinger down unread and readily swappable. Another reason why I finished this (which ties into the first reason) is because I've heard a lot of people comment on the fact that The Drawing of the Three (the second book in The Dark Tower series) is infinitely better than the first installment. In fact, I've heard of some people who disliked The Gunslinger yet loved the rest of the series. So, maybe I have to plod through the first part (which left me less than impressed) to get through the awesomeness that is the rest of the series. Here's to hoping that's the case."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In this book a \\"gunslinger\\" follows a man in black across the desert. We learn a bit about his past, and that there has been some sort of time disturbance. There are mutants and other strange things and a \\"Dark Tower\\" that has something to do with the gunslinger's destiny.I liked the book and I'll read the next one, but I would have preferred that it provide more information about the scope of the series or what the larger plot is. As it is I was left feeling that I had been led on and ultimately not quite rewarded.Also, while the gunslinger is an intriguing character, I was surprised that King didn't develop him better in this first book. The reader learns enough about how he is, and about what made him that way - but we don't learn much about how he \\"feels\\" or what his personality is like - unless he is in fact a automaton without much in the way of personality or feelings, which may turn out to be the case.So, I'll read the next one, but if it leaves me feeling the same way I won't read the 3rd in the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"When I was younger I read alot of Stephen King's work. However, as I've grown older I have real trouble reading his books. I always find them rambling.After reading the reviews for this book and being told by friends it's a good read I decided to try it. I never really knew what was going on in the book at all. I'm still so hopelessly confused and even though it does read a bit fast, I wasn't happy with the book. It just didn't grab me and make me want to read anything further in this series.If you are a King fan, I'd recommend this book if you haven't read it yet. If you aren't a King fan, I'd suggest not reading it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Roland is the last living member of a knightly order known as gunslingers. The world he lives in is quite different from our own, yet it bears striking similarities to it. Politically organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social characteristics with the American Old West, as well as bearing magical powers and the relics of a highly advanced, but long vanished, society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to either be, or be located at, the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is said to have \\"moved on,\\" and indeed it appears to be coming apart at the seams -- mighty nations are being torn apart by war, entire cities and regions vanish from the face of the earth without a trace, time does not flow in an orderly fashion; even the sun sometimes rises in the north and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals, and even his age are unclear, though later installments shed light on these mysteries.This series was mostly inspired by the epic poem \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\\" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in an appendix to the final volume. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, the Arthurian Legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's \\"Man with No Name\\" character as one of the major inspirations for Roland. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language abstract to our own, are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.The Dark Tower is often described in the novels as a real structure, and also as a metaphor. Part of Roland's fictional quest lies in discovering the true nature of the Tower. The series incorporates themes from multiple genres, including fantasy fiction, science fantasy, horror, and western elements. King has described the series as his magnum opus; beside the seven novels that comprise the series proper, many of his other books are related to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book does an excellent good job of creating a fantasy world, that can easily be recognized as our own future. Very engaging, mysterious and well written, this book spured me to read other steven king books, which I also, for the most part, enjoyed. The gunslinger has a dark tone of cynicism and hoplessness with a mix of action, thoughtfulness and suspense."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Having spent 300 bucks on the original limited edition almost 20-25 years ago, this has been a series near and dear to my heart. It's probably some of my favorite King work next to The Dead Zone and The Stand; the charatcers are crystal clear even if many things in the book are not.Only upon rereading it again after finishing the 7th book in the series do many things make sense. I'm not saying it's a hard book to follow-it's certainly not, and at under 300 pages or so, it's a quick read, but it's lasting impressions have stuck with me for all this time. While some of the following in the series stumble along the way (song of susannah) it's still the most moving on many levels. I even have the magazine the first few chappters were originally published in, and while I understand him wanting to clean it up somewhat in the recent replrint, I'll go back to the original every time. Needless to say highly recommended from me."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first volume in the Dark Tower series might not be as good as the rest, especially in the raw writing of Stephen King's earlier days, but I still loved it and had fun with it. I gave my only copy to a friend my freshman year of high school, and now I kind of regret it. The thing I love most about this book is it's fantasy elements, and the Man in Black is a great character."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The only problem with this book is that it is too short! I really wanted to know more about Roland and the Man in Black. Its a great and entertaining read which seems to lead to a fantastic series. I can't wait to read the rest of the books."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I really loved the Dark Tower series. The first book was not as good, a bit slow and hard to get into, but King does mention this in his introduction. The rest of this epic adventure was amazing. I loved it...although my husband wasn't happy to have an unresponsive wife for a month (I HAD to read them all!). It was well worth it. I must say that I was a bit disappointed with the illustrations. I wish they had not been included in the hardback editions."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"What a read this book is. From the opening sentence to the final word it is gripping and disturbing. Painting a world that the reader is glad to not be apart of, yet fascinated to read about, the story creeps along slowly revealing the protagonist and his intention. Only in the last chapter do we find out what has been happening to him and why he is on this journey. If it is a success is up to the reader to determine, but it definately fullfills its potential with a spellbinding conversation that is as provokative as Aurthor C Clarke's 2001: A Space Odysse. A remarkable tail of travel that's a combination of magic, mystery and journey, a mysterious hero and a dark and equivicol villian. This is just the begginning of the remarkable tale of the dark tower that King has yet to complete. Four episodes have been released so far and i have just started the drawing of the three. Hope you dig itr as much as i did."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is the first novel of this epic series, The Dark Tower. The Dark Tower shows stephen Kings's excellent achievment.I recomend reading this book.A few of the characters are Roland and Jake Chambers. Roland was Jake Chambers predecesor and a gunslinger. Jake is the boy that Roland met at the Way Station. Jake was hit by a cadillac in the other world,because Roland chose to pursuit the man in black rather than save him.Other characters are Cort, The Man in Black. Cort was Roland's teacher in Tull. The Man in Black has no true identity. I really enjoyed reading this book, when you start reading you really get hooked into it and dont want to put the book down."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is one of King's first works and shows a little less polish and direction than some of his later works. In particular he became more direct about spelling out the bad news and building the creepy feeling. I do not intend to sound negative, I am very pleased that I read the book and immediately ordered the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"&quot;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.&quot; For whatever reason, it's the most memorable opening line I've read.This is the first book in King's post-apocalyptic/parallel worlds Dark Tower series. The gunslinger is a character inspired by the Man with No Name that Eastwood played in the cinema. Certainly he is one of King's best characters.This story melds magic and firearms in an unforced, entertaining way. It's written in a dry, dusty style that suits the gunslinger perfectly.Aside from the fact that the book is very entertaining in its own right, King fans simply MUST read the Dark Tower books, because these days, ALL his other books at least make reference to the Tower, if they aren't extremely intertwined, like Hearts in Atlantis and Black House. These references in other books are like big fat Easter Eggs; you're finding unexpected rewards everywhere!This book is one I'd never do without. Go get it!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was one of King's first, written his senior year of college and it has all the flaws of a budding novelist. The language is sometimes verbose and the imagery is a bit abstract, but all in all this is a good first chapter to the Dark Tower Series and a must read, if only for Walter's diatribe at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is a very strange book. Stephen King can write strange stuff but this is way out there. It takes place in a parallel unverse to ours, I think. This book is an introduction to the Dark Tower series of which there are 4 books so far. This one tells part of Roland's (the last Gunslinger) journey across a vast desert to catch up with the man in black. He meets a boy, Jake, from our world and befriends him. Most of it is the Gunslinger reflecting on some of his journey and some of his childhood. There isn't too much action until the last 50 pages or so. Alone it isn't too good but it fits in with the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first volume of the Dark Tower series. The main hero, the gunslinger, is nearly dead on a beach, attacked by some monster crabs or lobsters, dying of some kind of fever in a world that is under our own world. This gunslinger has to cross a door somewhere to be able to find, in our world, the drugs that will save him, but also to have the idea of building the team he will need to go to that Dark Tower that should represent the resurrection of his world, the epiphany of our world. So it is the beginning of the trip across some vast country toward this tower, with some crossings into our world to get the antibiotic he needs and to discover the people he will need on his trip. This underworld is not explained, except that it lies under our world. We don't know why the hero is in the situation he is in at the beginning of the novel. We don't really know why he has that strange mission to go to the Dark Tower, to save his world. We do not know who he is and what he was in that apparently ruined world. This first volume just builds up the character and is an excellent appetizer that will make us feel famished for the next volumes. We must note we find the same pattern in The Talisman by Stephen King and Peter Straub, a pattern that was to be found too in The Eyes of the Dragon : a ruined world lies under our own world and our own world's survival depends on the saving of this underlying world. We can also compare this book with IT and some other books, where the underworld is the haunt and home of some monster that lives upon our world by vampiristically drawing its food or vital energy from our world. This duality of Stephen King's imaginary world is fundamental in his fiction. The point is that in the present book, this underlying world is not really feeding on our world, though what happens in it is both caused by what happens in ours and determines what will happen in ours.

However, I was intruiged by the title of book 4, so i bought it and when i realized it was part of a series, i ran out and bought books 1 &amp; 2. I started book one and was immediately drawn in to the world that he created. The character of Roland seems to be very deep--i never know when something from his past is going to come up. I didn't like the character of Jake. I don't really see what overall purpose he served--other than the one he did. I can't wait to start the next book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I must admit that I am used to Kings books being faster paced with a lot of information about the characters. This book was not like that. Roland is a gunslinger trying to get to The Dark Tower. The book leads you through the desert of Rolands world with a few flashbacks to younger times. The flashbacks were interesting as I was always feeling that I wanted more information about Roland, the main character. I guess I will have to read the rest of the series to find out more. All in all this book is an ok start to the series \\"The Dark Tower\\" and I will read the next book \\"The Drawing of the Three\\" to see where King leads Roland."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was not a pleasure to read, nor did it have a particularly strong plot, but that's okay, because those aren't the point here. This novel is about a character (the Gunslinger), and an idea (the world has moved on). The world is surreal and involving, invoking the imagination and the mind. This book is more than an anthology, but less than a picaresque -- it's a series of occurences which are related but separate, each further defining and revealing the gunslinger, his past, his world, and his quest to find the mysterious &quot;man in black,&quot; who will somehow guide him to the magical Dark Tower. This is actually the first Stephen King novel that I've read that I've liked. It is alluring, refreshing, and thought-provoking, marred only by spelling and grammatical errors -- glammer rather than glamour, etc."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The gunslinger, Roland, moves through a world that has \\"moved on.\\" This is not a typical gunslinger story a la spaghetti western or Louis Lamour; it is a story of a quest, more of a knight's tale of morality, adventure and hardship. Most importantly, it is the first door to a fascinating series of stories making up the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. This series is, in my opinion, his best work, and \\"The Gunslinger\\" is the first in the series.Each of the characters in \\"The Gunslinger\\" is well established and fully created. The situations encountered by them draw you into their individual stories, and you also grasp their importance in Roland's quest, to a point. There is much foreshadowing, although you won't know this until you read the subsequent novels in the series. The book stands well on its own, although you will be drawn to continuing with Roalnd's quest in the following novels. After all, Ka will lead you to finishing the series if you are a knight at heart.This book has it all, interesting characters, a fascinating plot, creative setting, and a cast of characters you can both identify with at some level and really care about as you travel with Roland on his quest for the Dark Tower. The CD version is particularly good for listening to as you travel or just sit and enjoy the creative story-telling skills of Stephen King.Although George Guidall's performance in reading \\"The Gunslinger\\" is very good, I would have preferred hearing Frank Muller, who reads subsequent novels in the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"obviously this book was writen so many years agoand doesn't compare to his brillant writing now, but this book properly kicks of the dark tower series. anyone who loves his work will find when they finish book one, you have to finish the series. starting with the gunslinger and moving through to number four (wizard and glass)you'll find it so addicting that books 5-7 can't come out on print fast enough. i loved the adventure this series took me on and found myself upset that it ended. you'll want it to keep going. out of all is books (which i've read and own) these were the best and hardest to put down. i recomend this book to all of those fans that love to get lost in a stephen king book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I enjoy the Dark Tower series immensely BUT...The start of the Dark Tower series, The Gunslinger, is rocky, but interesting. The goal of reaching the Dark Tower doesn't come out until the end of the book; reaching the man in black seems to be the goal, the end, not the beginning. Though the book is absolutely necessary and introduces my favorite character, Jake, it just isn't as well written as the following books. That also means the series gets better, so if you like the first book you'll love the second. The dark and gritty overall style of King's writing is evident even at this early juncture, but the flow of the stories is broken due to the fact they were all short stories written to be read one at a time. In part the fantasy adventure story of the Gunslinger reflect a creativity King would use through out his later career (stories were written very early in his career). I have always thought that King was best when writing fantasy novels like The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon. Part of these and other books he has written appear throughout out the series.I recommend reading this series, though it isn't as enthralling at the start, the series is first rate."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I think alot of the other reviewers have already hit on this, but I might as well say it again.Most people will scoff at the idea, (Hell, I scoff at the idea) but this book should be placed among the Masterpieces. The whole concept and ideas behind this book are awesome. Somewhere in all the trials of age, shootouts, and long descriptions of the wastelands, something in this book touched my heart. I've read this book at least 10 times and I love it every time. It's obvious that King put a little of himself in the story, that he's never come close to replicating, even in his attempt with Wizard of the Glass.For the people who say they found the whole story boring...well this book isn't written for you. Try some of King's other more action oriented stories."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"One of the few King novels I've ever had trouble getting into was The Gunslinger. But persevere, because so much depends upon this first book when reading the following volumes of the series. The Oracle's prophecy, the dark man's vision, the sacrificial child who becomes increasingly important as the series grows. Perhaps it was the sparse writing that put me off to begin with - so different from the rich, textured feel of most of King's novels. It's also difficult to empathise with the lone gunslinger. But again, as the series goes on, it's intriguing to watch this obsessed man change and develop further. One needs a starting point, and the cold, single-minded man that Roland is at the outset is a noble one. Still, I was glad when I watched him gradually change and begin to love more than just his Dark Tower"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I got the first three books in this series in a gift pack and I have to be honest. I read this book and thought &quot;I have two more of these books to read. Maybe later.....&quot; but I did read the next two books and they are terrific. Which is why this review is so difficult. This book introduces the main character of the series, Roland, a gunslinger whose world has &quot;moved on&quot;. As I understand it, gunslingers are supposed to be like the knights of old (or at least the old we were taught about in my day and age). They are chivalrous and protect the weak. The problem with this book was that I couldn't really sympathize or feel anything for the character. However, you kind of need this book to get along with the next two (or three or four....).So let me put it to you this way - the next three books are terrific and will be reviewed shortly. This book is iffy, but you really need it to understand what Roland is and why he does what he does - so whether or not you like this book, you'll need it to really enjoy the next set in the series. After reading the second book, I realized the worth of this one. I guess this is a backhanded recommendation - get this book so you can really be entertained by the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger, written over the space of twelve years, is perhaps King's finest, most poetic tale. No other character in all of his work is as well-crafted or mesmerising as Roland of Gilead. We not only learn of his heartache, and motivation, and humanity, but we live them through clear, descriptive writing (despite the abundance of adverbs).Many people struggle through the beginning. I urge you to push on. The reward will come. The gun battle in the town of Tull is furious, written with a precision for detail achieved by few writers. Roland's battle with his teacher Cort, for the right to be a Gunslinger, is easily the most triumphant scene of King's I have ever read.By the time you reach the end you will be eager for the next three books, and urging King to write the fifth, sixth, and seventh installements, as he has promised. You will wonder how you have gone without Roland of Gilead for so long, and the Dark Tower will be part of you."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the beginning of a tale, that is still not finished, and may not finish before I die. If it ends before King's dispare, I wonder....As I started on this one I was litterly pulled into a new world. Never have I been so absorbed bij a book. I 'ate' the complete saga in a month. The book(s) wanted and confinced me to keep reading. I was addicted to the romantic but harsh world of Roland. The combination of present, past and future are magnificant. You will live the life and adventures of each character. This men is the King of story-telling. I read at the cost of my own health, almost like drug. I didn't sleep, but read for a week, when I noticed that THAT was a tad odd. But I read them where and when I could. School, work, home, at my FORMER girlfriends house. People would call me crazy. And it was. I hope I'll never run in to a saga like this one again."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book, and the series(so far at least) is pretty different from much of SK's other works. Ive recomended it to many friends and relatives, and most of the time get that question &quot;Whats it about&quot;. Thats a really tough one with this book, and series, basically its about Roland and his quest for the Dark Tower, but explaining much more than that in an understandable way is hard.Someone compared it to Lord of the Rings, and I dont think thats an unfair comparison, they're both fantastic tales of fantastic journeys, and they're both absolutely incredible to read.Read it, you'll be doing yourself an incredible favour, trust me(or if you dont, trust all the other people who also love it)."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'm not a big fan of Stephen King-- as far as I'm concerned, he's one of the most inconsistent authors around. Books like &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; however, show him to be an undeniable talent. The dreamlike and bizarre world the gunslinger, Roland, inhabits is one of the more original creations I've ever heard of. For example, it begins like a Western: A man with no name enters a small one-street, inbred town in the middle of the desert. You know that something is weird, though, when the tune being played on the piano in the saloon is &quot;Hey Jude&quot; in ragtime. The book is essentially four short stories, each of them totally bizarre, and completely enveloping. There are recommendation below to skip this book, and start at &quot;The Drawing of the Three.&quot; DO NOT DO THIS! I have yet to finish DOTT, but it does not in any way establish the world of the gunslinger, nor does it show exactly how sad, lonely and ruthless the gunslinger is. This is not a book with a clear narrative-- it is more about setting up a world and an enigmatic character. You won't finish the book and be at all clear on what has just happened, which makes it all the more intriguing. I must say, however, that the second book has, thus far, been a disappointment. I haven't finished it yet, however, and even if it is bad, I'll still read the rest of the series, simply because I so enjoyed this first book. By the way, I think the reason that some people didn't like this book is because most King books follow a fairly clear narrative, which this one does not. Don't go into it expecting a plot; if you do, you're sure to be disappointed. But if you don't feel that books *need* a clear plot, then get this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As a huge King fan, I finally decided to start reading the Dark Tower series. Unfortunately, this first book is pure drivel. I had to force myself to read beyond the next word. While I was hoping for a saga on the level of The Stand, instead all that exists in this book is an incredible disjointed series of stories that go nowhere and are so intensely boring that they are impossible to follow. Epic fail."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is probably the worst book I've read since 'Atlas Shrugged'. I think he wrote it during commercials while watching TV. The writing in the first half was on par with most high school creative writing courses.

WHAT?????? after that i just quit and punched the picture of his face on the back of the book.i then had an important decision. should i throw this book out again or just burn it? i decided i didnt want to waste a math of this peice of crap so i then threw this book out for the second time. DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is very good. This book is the fist part of a series of books. Stephen King has written forty really goo books. He lives in Maine and Florida with his wife. She has written a couple of books herself. The book I read was, The Gunslinger. At the end of the book he wakes up to be ten years older and his hair is grey. Then he looks over at his fire an it was gone, the fire pit and everything. The he walks out to the ocean and screams out, &quot;Jake, Jake I love you!&quot; The he looks down at his waist and looks at his father guns and starts telling about how he got them from his father. The gunslinger went on a long journey.&quot;A real gem, a journey to go on...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Gunslinger is the worst book I have ever had the mispleasure of reading. DON'T believe all the gushing reviews that praise this trash. The characters are flat, the story is skeletal and the book reads like fan fiction. It was probably King's grade school writing assignment -- no kidding. The grammar is awful. The book abounds with errors and incosnistencies. I couldn't wait for it to be over."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I purchased this book because of all of its glowing reviews. Imagine my surprise when i began reading it to find it repulsive and not the least bit entertaining. King has had many wonderfull works in his career but this series is deffinatly not one of them. Boreing and not worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've just got to say, this has to be the best opening sentence to a book EVER written. And it wasn't just a great book, but a wonderful series as well.This is the first book of the Dark Tower Series. This is an introduction of two of the main characters of the series... if not the two main characters. Roland (The Gunslinger), who is definitely the main character, later on meets and befriends Jake along his travels as he pursues the man in black. In fact, Jake becomes more of a son to Roland than a friend.There were two versions of this book. The first version was one of the first books ever written by Stephen King and dealt with the time line of this story with slight glimpses of Roland's past. This new version was released before the series was finished and some of the story was re-written while adding several flashbacks to help the reader learn and understand Roland better. I have read them both and I think if you are going to go the distance with this series the background story is helpful. If you are only going to read one version, make it the latter one.The main object of Roland's desire is The Dark Tower. He does not know why he needs to go there only that it is his destiny (or ka, as this and subsequent books call it) to do so as told by a pink orb he acquired before the events of this book. It is not only his quest to find the Dark Tower but to understand its purpose as well. This book sets up nearly all of the events of the future books of this series.In the end, Roland is tested. Is he willing to give up everything for this quest? Is he willing to go the distance even if he must sacrifice the objects he holds most dear in his life?A note on the series: I began reading this series in junior high school but became disheartened with the cliffhanger ending of the third book and the long delay until it was resolved in the fourth book (6 Looooooong YEARS!). I vowed to not read this series until it was completed. Well, ladies and gentlemen, the series has been completed and resolved. Count yourselves lucky that you did not have to wait 17 years for the conclusion as I did (I restarted it after book seven was announced). It is a long ride for the dark tower is far away and there is much to be done before Roland reaches it. Is it worth the journey? Oh yes, this is one of the best series ever written.It is hard to categorize this series, however. My local library has it listed under Science Fiction. But there are bits of horror, bits of western lore, bit of fantasy, and bits of pure drama. So if you like any of these categories, there is something for you to be found in this series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The entire Dark Tower series of books are my favorite Stephen King works. I've read them all (several times, I might add) and can not put them down.When I first read The Gunslinger, I was so impressed with the difference of this story from all other King books I have read. I only recently read The Stand and I see that this has some similarities but it was a new style to me at the time.These books are not the typical Stephen King horror stories that so many people expect. This, along with all of the others in the series, deals with the epic tale of Roland, the last of the gunslingers. Roland lives in a world where time has moved on and is on a journey to the Dark Tower in order to attempt to stop the end of time. Each book takes you a little farther on his journey and opens Roland's character to you even more. This epic tale is a wonderful read and should be included in everyone's library.I have tried to get my friends who are not King fans to read these but have been unsuccessful. They all expect some gory tale (I love those too) and sadly will not give the books a try.As for me, I want to thank you, Mr. King for taking me to another world and introducing me to Roland and company. I have never found any other books that I feel so drawn to."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger by Stephen King was a surprise for me. I haven't really read any King since junior high school; I kind of came to see him as too mainstream for me early on. This was in no way based on his merit as a writer - I was just a know-it-all kid who scorned all that was popular.That being said, I was blown away by the scope of this first volume of the Dark Tower series. It is right up there among Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter (and Stephen King would be honored by the comparison, I know). In particular, I loved the way that the language of the Gunslinger was just oddly different enough from our own to cause the reader to know definitively that this knight of Gilead was related to us in some distant way. An example of this is, \\"I cry your pardon.\\" It's enough like \\"beg your pardon\\" to understand its purpose, but just off enough to signal alienation from our own society.The Gunslinger's Mid-World is reminiscent of Tolkien's Middle Earth in that each is a heretofore unknown piece of human history. Unlike Middle Earth, which is our distant past, Mid-World is in our distant future, as evidenced by this exchange between Walter and the Gunslinger:\\"Gunslinger, our many-times-great grandfathers conquered the-disease-which-rots, which they called cancer, almost conquered aging, walked on the moon.\\"By the Roland's time, however, the world has moved on. He cannot even believe that Walter speaks the truth.The story of the Gunslinger follows Roland across the desert in his chase of the Man in Black. As he crosses, he meets several different odd characters who help and hinder him on his quest, the most memorable of which is a doomed young boy named Jake from our own world.In case it isn't yet evident, I highly recommend the Dark Tower series to any person with the slightest inclination to read science-fiction. The Gunslinger is probably the most difficult of the series to read, just because King doesn't spoon-feed anything to the reader. Hold on and let him take you along this epic journey."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower is probably my favorite series and if you are to follow what King says and see it as a whole novel, then it's my favorite novel. I don't really see it as a whole novel in the same way that I don't see Lord of the Rings as a whole novel. As in both, there are books in the collection that are much better than others.The Gunslinger is the beginning. It's Star Wars before it was Episode IV: A New Hope. It's flawed, the effects are out of date, the characters not completely fully-realized, the narrative a little stilted sometimes, the dialogue a little clunky, but all in all, the beginning of a great saga.Even with the new revised edition, the Gunslinger has its flaws. I agree with King that he didn't find his voice until Drawing of the Three. But Gunslinger is still good. It's still very, very good! We meet Roland and we don't like him for most of the book. We meet Jake and we love him. We cry for him. We are introduced to a world that \\"has moved on.\\" It's a wasteland of a world that doesn't even hint of the wonders to come (monorails, giant robotic animals, glass castles, fields of roses, and the Tower itself). This book sets the stage, introduces some of the characters, and with the revising, hints at the things to come. In the whole series, it's the weakest of them all. Nothing can ever change that. It's the nature of the tale, the setup for the story to come. The Gunslinger is like a long prologue. It's what you have to get through to get to the meat!But it's worth it. It's good to finish the book, close it's covers, and leap into Drawing of the Three. Because, trust me, that's when it gets going. That's when the story starts to cook!The Dark Tower is the greatest fantasy collection of our times. Like those before (LOTR, Chronicles of Narnia, Oz books) it is about right and wrong, what makes us humans, love, wonderment, evil of the utmost, living our lives to the fullest, and never ever forgetting the faces of our father.It's about Ka."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is not your typical Stephen King book (though to use typical and Stephen King in the same sentence seems a tad odd at best). The Gunslinger is one of those novels that you have to be concentrated to read, it has it's own language (kinda like Lord of the Rings in that sense) and will given even the most determined reader difficulty. I say all of this not to deter you but, just to warn you. In general it took me awhile to get through this book as it took me awhile to get through Fellowship of the Ring by Tolkien. The book overall I'd have to say is one those books that grows on you as time passes, and your exhausted somewhat by the end of it but, not really in asmuch a negative way."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The Gunslinger\\" is a very nice suprise compared to the beginning's of a great many series out there, though this Revised edition is not what was originally published back in 1982.It follows the story of Roland Deschain, a gunslinger and knight-errant, and his pursuit of Walter O' Dim (The Man In Black), who is supposed to to guide Roland to the object of his quest, the Dark Tower of existance. Quit stylized and nicely languaged, a large part of The Gunslinger is told in a series of flashbacks of his early years growing up in Gilead, as Roland moves across the desert and later under the mountains with a boy from 1970's New York named Jake.If you want a well paced, intriguing, and cool new series to pick up, The Gunslinger is the way to go for anyone starting on The Dark Tower series.NOTE: The Gunslinger's ending is very very well done!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is the start of the arguably greatest series of books ever written. The GunSlinger starts us on a journey with Roland, a man who is looking to find the Dark Tower to stop his world from decaying into debris. This book gives excellent detail, back story, gun smoke action and horrific underground creatures. A perfect book for Horror and Fantasy fans alike."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This revised version of the Gunslinger makes for easier reading. I really flew threw this one enjoying every obstacle along the way. Roland is definitely a Clint Eastwood type. I wouldn't want to be his road buddy though and if you read this book you'll find out why. The Crimson King spans his power out everywher, and Roland is on a quest to stop it.The Dark Tower is where he can make everything right again. Time is unbalanced and just plain weird. Roland doesn't have all the answers but he will find out. The Man in Black is another quest for Roland. Roland is willing to give everything up to seek the Man in Black; he is willing to give even more up to get to the Dark Tower.Read this series it is worth devoting your life to. Besides Stephen King is finished with the series. Let Roland and his ka-tet take you beyond your own world."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Let's face it: King is just too good an author, has too much going on, to simply stick to writing novels his whole career. I'm not saying that his stand-alone novels aren't good, far from it,(even though I've only read two) but it is even better for King to do something bigger - in a word, a masterpiece. These Dark Tower Dark books appear to be just that. I guess, at the core of the story, its a fantasy. It has all the elements - a quest, final battle approaching, a great civilization now gone to ruin, etc... But I'm sure this is unlike any fantasy that you've ever read. It's got a definite western setting, but to classify it as a western would probably be just as bad as the other. I'd say its a fantasy/western, with smatterings of science fiction and horror as well. But, when it really boils down to it, its an epic. It definately has some strangness, but its strange in a good way. There's something extremely evocative and intriguing about the whole setting that makes me eager to finish the tale.The book opens with the gunslinger, Roland of Gilead, chasing the man in black across the desert in a world that has &quot;moved on.&quot; The author is intentionally vague about what that phrase means, as well as who the gunslinger is and what his purpose is. More will be revealed throughout the book, in pieces, but only a little, because there'e six more books to go. Since it starts off this way, it may take a little getting into, because at first all you know is that this guy is chasing another guy, but it definately gets enjoyable pretty soon. There are flashbacks throughout the book, but they don't slow the plot down. Part of the beauty of the story is discovering all the back history piece by piece. This book really was quite enthralling. The ending will definately throw you for a loop; it gives a hint of just how big the whole story is, but at the same time I found it very anticlamatic, and when the story ended I was left with a sort of emptiness that I did not like. But, aside from the very beginning and very end, this book was quite good.Now, on to Round Two..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"&quot;The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.&quot; Never before has a more succint-cum-intrigue introductory line been printed. (not since the opener to Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 that is: &quot;It was a pleasure to burn.&quot;)The Gunslinger is one of the most romantic (think Hemmingway, Nelson Algren) novels of all time. Our hero is the last of the Mohicans, so to speak, in a land where shi--err--stuff has happend and the world has moved on.Desolate disaster and death lies behind every town's facade and there is one man who can possibly put an end to the wrong; a true man that can but try: the gunslinger. He escapades across desserts and mountains in search of the Dark Tower--the eiffel that holds the worlds (Earth, his world, and the existing others) together. Along the way he meets a boy named Jake. Jake is a piece of the puzzle that the gunslinger must solve, a pawn to the Dark Man's chess game.It is a blood-sworn journey the gunslinger is on. His past, his training, and lost lovers are stops along the way. The only solution he knows lies in his Sandalwood grip pistols crisscrossing his midsection. It is a sad tale, but a very palatable one if you reflect on how our world too has moved on.If you love King or hate him, let The Gunslinger set the record straight. It is the first in a (currently unfinished) Dark Tower series and is like nothing King has ever pinned. It is a dark novel which exists in sour dreams. The best, the best King has done. It's straight from the hip of his drug-addled past (a fact that is evident in the novel).This book is one that has been overlooked by movies, universities, demagogues and egotists, but mark my words: The Gunslinger will emerge in the 21st century as a powerful novel, as evident and poignent in society as Romeo &amp; Juliet; once dissected, will be served in High School along with sloppy joes, John Steinbeck.Kevin Burns"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first installment of Steven King's fantasy series, The Dark Tower, which follows the story of the Gunslinger Roland, the equivalent of an Arthurian knight in the world King has created, and his quest to reach the Dark Tower in order to make the world right again.This installment tells the story of Roland's search for a mysterious stranger who may be able to help Roland find the Dark Tower. It is long on atmosphere and short on action. Therefore, fans of Steven King's horror works will find this book a distinct change of pace. However, the book will not disappoint you if you try it, especially if you are a fan of fantasy series such as the Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, you will find in later books that elements of King's horror world also exist in Roland's world, and therefore, to have a full understanding of King's horror villains, you have to read this series.The Gunslinger offers several intriguing views of Roland's dying world. The book is not devoid of action; there is a dramatic shoot out for shadowy reasons which one hopes will be better explained in the concluding volumes of the work. There is a lost child who provides the first direct evidence that Roland's world is connected to our own, and there is the introduction to Roland himself, a man who is capable of fantastic violence but still comes across as human and quite possibly kind (a fact which becomes more clear in later books).I recommend this book most highly to anyone who enjoys stories involving quests such as Arthurian legends, the Chronicles of Prydain and the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"At under 300 pages, \\"The Gunslinger\\" - the first book from Stephen King's \\"The Dark Tower\\" series - may seem oddly short, especially when compared to the latest volume from the epic, weighing in at around 700 pages.

He wrote the opening line, \\"The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed\\" while an undergraduate, the middle portions when \\"\`Salem's Lot\\" was going bad, and was inspired with another concurrent writing: \\"The Stand.\\" For King to have kept the Gunslinger, the Man in Black, Jake, and the other characters - and really the entire world of the Dark Tower - alive for so long in his mind is a testament to not only the power that this held over the author, but holds over us - his Constant Readers. Moreover, since the first publishing of \\"The Gunslinger,\\" around twenty years have passed, a number of newer volumes in this series have come and gone - yet with this first, partially inspired by Robert Browning's poem, \\"Childe Roland,\\" and partially inspired by reams of green paper (read the afterword to the book), you know that this was a very special creation indeed.I am not a fan of King's horror fiction. But when he gets down to writing about \\"other worlds than these,\\" such as \\"The Stand,\\" \\"Insomnia,\\" \\"The Green Mile,\\" and \\"The Talisman\\" (co-authored with Peter Straub) - there is no one better. His is an imagination to be jealous of. There is always a feeling that alternate universes exist, next to our own. King imbues his other worlds with just enough of our own so that we feel a tantalizing connection between our own perceptions of reality, and those that King entertains us (Constant Readers) with.At any rate, \\"The Gunslinger,\\" at under 300 pages, is just right to introduce us to the world of The Dark Tower, and keep us on course, with a desire to continue (and to wait, ever so patiently for the next volume in the series) the journey the Gunslinger started many years ago."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The hype surrounding the Dark Tower series finally got to me and I picked up The Gunslinger, unsure of what I would find. What I found was a stark, fresh, somewhat surreal and demanding (yet light!) experience that left me wanting more, much more.This first novel in the series finds the hero (for wont of a better word!), The Gunslinger, slugging across the desert in search of the mysterious Man in Black. The desert is bleak and so our the words - yet they have a definite beauty. Along the way The Gunslinger meets a couple of people (are they alive or dead?) and reveals some of his back history - a strange massacre in a town, his childhood friends and mentors and hints at a Dark Tower.Death permeates this book. We're not sure who's dead or alive. Something strange has happened with time - the main search right now is for this cause - and strange fragments of the &quot;real&quot; world appear through the fog - Hey Jude playing in a Western Saloon is one of the strange and wonderful images we encounter. Time itself is an illusion it seems and still the Man in Black is ahead of us.My one reservation about the book is that the final meeting with the Man in Black is a little anticlimactic. Perhaps that's because it's been building up but after the meeting we wonder why he was running at all. However, there is a lot of backstory missing in the book - obviously slated for the later books - so perhaps issues like this will be resolved. All in all a most strange but powerful book - well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Lots of five stars here. Lots of one stars, too. Comments like &quot;hard to follow&quot;. &quot;Boring.&quot; &quot;No plot.&quot; I would argue that the plot is so big, some are not seeing the forest for the trees. The books of the Dark Tower cycle are King's most important, not because they are the easiest to follow, not because they are quick reads, but because with these novels not only is the author is tapping into a collective mythology, but is tying all of his works (see &quot;Insomnia&quot;, &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Stand&quot;, and many others) together. In other words, these novels stand at the center of King's entire body of work, connecting them to itself and one another, and thereby lending deeper meaning to the whole (kind of like the Dark Tower itself, no?). This is an ambitious attempt, and one in which I believe that King is unique. And the guy is pulling it off.Now, as for &quot;The Gunslinger.&quot; If you are one of those that were unimpressed by this offering, please follow this advice: Read the whole thing. All of it. That includes the &quot;tributary&quot; books like &quot;Insomnia&quot; and especially &quot;The Stand.&quot; Get a feel for what King is trying to do. Then go back for a re-read. You'll be amazed. Admittedly the pace is disjointed, and if you have read King's other stuff, you won't be prepared for this. But realize that the sparseness of the prose, the disjointedness and abjectness and disaffection of the novel mirrors the desolation and madness of Roland's soul (which is in turn reflected by the desolation of the desert and the madness of the man he chases). Realize that in this novel, King is setting up payoffs that don't come until years down the road, that won't hit you until the second reading (and if that isn't the mark of a great story, what is?). Just to take one example out of many: Roland's massacre of the shanty-town of Tull seems excessive, until the end of Book IV, when we get the payoff: Tull is the remnant of the village that burned Roland's love, Susan Delgado, at the stake. The massacre can be read as Roland's revenge on the town. &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; is a book of subtle shades and undertones, and is not the best of the bunch (that would be &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot;), but it is a perfect and impressive foundation to an ambitious and excellent tale."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first in a wonderous series about Roland the Gunslinger.

Unfortunately, by the time we meet up with Roland, the world has moved on.Roland is following the man in black. We don't know who this mysterious figure is until the end of the book, but we do know that he holds the first clues for Roland on the quest for the Dark Tower.What is the Dark Tower? Amazingly enough, a lot of it is explained in this book, though it's hard to grasp the concept until one has read further into the series. The series opens us up to the concept of multiple worlds in multiple universes, all held together with beams, which are breaking and thus, the Tower is being destroyed.The Dark Tower series is also held together by beams. These beams are other King works. Any King fan should read this series because it opens up so many treats for the &quot;constant reader.&quot; There are tie-ins everywhere. The Gunslinger is linked to the rest of the books in the series, which are linked to other King books such as Salem's Lot, The Stand, Insomnia, From a Buick 8, and Rose Madder (which is linked to Desperation and Regulators).Wow!

As relentless as the gunslinger (who we come to know as Roland) is in his pursuit, it's also a little slow going. King does not give you much back story in this slim novel, although as you read the rest in the series you will learn the past of most characters revealed here (and many more).Roland follows the man in black through a small town, where he is forced to make a final, violent decision to save his own life. As he continues on his long journey, he meets a boy from Earth, Jake, who died in our world and has somehow appeared in this one. Roland and Jake continue on together, but somehow Roland knows he may have to lose the boy, as much as he has come to care for him, to finally meet the man in black.The Gunslinger is only the first of many in the Dark Tower series. It is not as long, as involved, or (in my opinion) as well written as the others. It introduces you to Roland's world, but you don't get to know much about it or him. Keep reading.

It is a classic story of good vs. evil and only begins a race to the mythical Dark Tower. This book is a short fast read that sets up the plot for the Dark Tower series. The characters are imaginative and interesting, although King leaves allot of holes in the puzzles their pasts (to be pieced together in later installments). As a stand-alone book, it's average King but it's obviously essential if you want to try on this epic multi-book quest. A decent read that will leave you scrambling for answers in Part 2."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I did not find The Gunslinger itself to be an enjoyable read, at all. The pacing was odd, the voice was bleak, the writing rather juvenile, even after a clean-up attempt by a much older King, and the ending was nigh incomprehensible to me. After reading it, I had absolutely no plans of pursuing the Dark Tower series further.But!A friend (to whom I am eternally indebted) practically force-fed me the second book of the series, The Drawing of the Three, and from there I was hooked. The rest of the series captivated me. It made me laugh and (toward the end) cry so hard that I occasionally had to put the book down and compose myself before I could keep reading. These days I'm an evangelical DT fan, pestering everyone I know to try the series.

But, never judge a story when it has just begun. And this is merely the beginning of King's largest work (in fact, it ties together most of his other stories as well). So I read on. And after the next books (especially after &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;) I understood why Roland has become this &quot;Tower-Junkie&quot;. So I went back to reading &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; again. (In fact, I listened to the audiobook read by Frank Muller. If you like the books, buy the audiobooks, you will love them!) And now that I see this whole work as one, I like &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; as much as the rest of the story. Altogether, it makes up the finest story I have ever heard. I can't wait for the final trilogy to be published in 2001, 2002 and 2003, if King stays to his word. If you like this series as much as me, don't forget to read &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot;, &quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, for all of them are very good, indeed, and crucial for the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Not being one who normally reads fantasy, I was surprised when I picked this book up. This was definately a new road with Mr. King. I was further surprised to discover that it was based on the poem Child Roland to the Dark Tower Came by Robert Browning.If you are looking for fast paced Stephen King horror; this isn't it. You won't be disappointed though.At times it seemed a little hard to keep up with who was who and where they were from. This book encompasses everything you can imagine. There's Roland (a knight like figure), Jake Chambers a young boy (becomes a protege to Roland), and there are Susannah and Eddie. All chosen to travel to the Dark Tower and save the world from evil.Being one who rarely if never reads fantasy, I can only compare this book/series with J.R.R. Tolken's Lord of the Rings Trilogy.If you like Stephen King, or if you like fantasy this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is one of my favoite authors. In his career he wrote many famius novels and this is one of them and so is the whole Dark Tower series. It is set in the world of ominous landscapes and evil menaces. A tale of good vs. evil, in the book is Stephen King's most powerful creation The Gunslinger. A figure who embodies the qualities of the lone hero though the ages from ancient myth to a western legend. His pursuit of the man in black, aklso the sexually ravenous Alice, his friendship with a kid from earth called Jake. This book is a great tale of action, sex, and murder. If you want to read a book with those things in them, read The Dark Tower the Gunslinger."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"What you must remember is this is a prolog. A long prolog, but a prolog just the same. It is an introduction of characaters. I read the books and listend to them on audio, ( mom has gone blind and can not read any more, she gobbled the 4 book series up. Mom liked W &amp; G more then me.) and I really like Frank Muller. F.M. is an excellent reader, If you are going to do the series, you have to do 1. Its a little slow and when I first read was disapointed not realising it was a prolog. but I would suggest you read ( or listen to ) first before going to 3 which is great. By the way book 2 is also a prolog!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King's novel The Gunslinger is a book I want to enjoy. I was given a copy of the fourth book in the series and thought it was quite well done. However, I had not read the earlier books. I decided to amend the situation and quickly got used copies of the previous novels. My first comment is: Mr. King, you claim outlines are something bad novelists cling to. Does &quot;making it up as I go along&quot; work any better? I counted a multitude of errors that all point to one thing: inconsistency. Now, the world that Mr. King has designed allows for some inconsistencies. However, the mythology and history of the world seem to change without warning. I find this rather sloppy for a magnum opus. I believe Stephen King's strongest talent in writing is characterization. Unfortunately, the reader learns precious little about any of the characters in The Gunslinger, and so this talent goes to waste. The later books are better, but I must say that I would never have been hooked on the series had I read this novel first."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Hmmmm. I got talked into starting The Dark Tower by several friends who (a) know I have read most of Stephen King's work and (b) have taste that I largely agree with. So I've now made it through the first (short) book that makes up the seven-book series. I had started it many, many years ago and quickly abandoned it, finding it not up to his other works and just not interesting enough to make up for that. Having now finished it, I can say I think both of those facts remain true for me. It's too purposefully mystical and I think largely kind of silly (though not fun-silly). However. I'll continue with the series. I'll read the next book (which I've been told is infinitely better) and eventually probably read all seven. Because I'm that reader who, once he starts, finishes. Unless they start to feel like the kind of head-spinning fun-less work that this one was. At that point, I may abandon my quest. But for now, I'll give the impossible dream a shot."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger, the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series, is a strange tale, a sort of post-apocalyptic western with magic. The elements are rarely seen together and I can't say that they mesh all that well.The book bounces back and forth through Roland's life. The flashbacks to his childhood were infinitely more interesting than his present chase of The Man in Black. Seeing bits and pieces of what makes Roland chase this man beyond all hope of survival is the only thing that makes the story bearable.Sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow and always too confusing, The Gunslinger is not an enjoyable read. As much as it pains me, I have to admit not liking this book. The afterward by Stephen King describing his writing the book and his plans (or lack thereof) for the series make the reading worth it. I've heard many promises of good things to come in The Dark Tower and can only hope that struggling through this book will be worth it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Since a trip with the Dark Tower series is a 7 book, 3000 page marathon, it only makes sense to review the whole series before someone commits themselves to such a massive undertaking. I've found most people fall under one of three categories:1) Couldn't get past the Gunslinger.2) Liked the first four Dark Tower novels, didn't like the last three.3) Loved it and made it their new religion.I fall closer to #2. I did like it up through Wolves of the Calla, but then it feels like King got antsy and wanted to unburden himself with this story. The last two books really turn it into a farce. The author plays too much of a central role and the characters and story suffer for it. The writing style changes, characters become inconsistent, earlier parts of the series are contradicted or ignored entirely. The ending is nonsense. Based on what I've read, King had the Wolves story somewhere in his mind before he had his accident. The storyline begins to change at that point and not for the better, in my opinion.If you are an uncritical fan of everything Stephen King writes, by all means, take the plunge. Otherwise, I think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have been reading the Gunslinger series for quite some time, but I have never been able to buy them and read them order. I'm almost there now,and I would recommend them to anyone, Stephen King fan or not. I've been a fan since 1975 when I first read Carrie, and I'll be a fan till the end. But please, Mr. King, stay away from the side of the road a little farther when you take your walks. When you had your accident, you almost lost a fan, because I thought I'd have a heart attack, and I was also worried about your family. Best of luck to you all, and thank you so much for the enjoyment you've brought the world."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged.
