This series is a great way to bring you closer to God. Lynn Austin has a special writing talent that uses Holy Scripture and inspired fiction elaboration to weave a story about the ancient Kings that will bring you into the hearts of those who truly loved and served God. You will also clearly see how rejecting God's will for His people can destroy a nation. But God's love is great for His people and his grace and forgiveness are plentiful for those who love him. Our government leaders and our entire nation could learn something from this series if they would just open up their hearts to the truth of the word of God and reject the sinfulness that they have been promoting."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"Another great book by Lynn Austin-it made the scriptures come alive.

If you want to really understand the basic geology of the country that you are traveling through, from the North West Territories to the Yucatan, then this book is for you. Several decades ago, this was my college textbook for Geology of the U.S. In my opinion there has never been a better single text written to take its place. King was an old time classical field geologist- he knows this continent like the back of his hand. I usually just leave it in my suit case as a permanent reference.The basic organization of this book is as follows: 1)The Natural History of the Continents, 2) The Canadian Shield, 3) The Interior Lowlands, 4) Appalachian and related Systems, 5) Lands and Seas South of the Continent, 6) The Cordilleran System, 7) The Eastern Ranges and Plateaus, 8) The Main Part of the Cordillera,and 9) Later Modifications of the Cordillera including the Coast Ranges.The real strength of the book is the many extremely well-done maps and cross-sections. There is even a full fold-out geological map of all of North America in the back of the book- along with a full index."},{"Title":"The evolution of North America","review":"I read the 1977 edition when it was recently published and learned a lot of geology along the way. It is organized to take us from the oldest geology to the newest. By covering the material in this way King shows us how the continent evolved while taking us on a complete tour. I could never get through a geology textbook, but the story King told held my interest all the way though this one. I still have my heavily-annotated copy, and I recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The evolution of North America","review":"I have to agree with oakshaman--this is one of the best books on the geologic evolution of North America that I've come across. First published in 1959, the edition that I own does not deal with plate tectonics (a subject that was hotly debated at the time, and generally not taken very seriously), so at least some of the continent-building forces that elude King have since been identified. Nonetheless, this book is still a wonderful introduction to the landforms of North America. As oakshaman notes, the maps and geologic cross-sections are particularly informative. Any books on the subject published since this volume came out build on the solid foundation that Philip B. King laid so many years ago."},{"Title":"The evolution of North America","review":"I read the first edition of Philip B. King's \\"The Evolution of North America\\" 38 years ago when I took a course in \\"Tectonics\\" from John W. Shelton as a graduate student at Oklahoma State University. I reread it in the second edition (which contains an outline of plate tectonics) a few years later while I was in industry. I reread the book again in 1990 when I was putting together a course in historical geology at University of Missouri-Rolla. I purchased copies for two of my children when they graduated (as newly minted geologists) from college. In my opinion this is the best written book on the subject of geology that has ever been published. Philip B. King was arguably the greatest field geologist of the 20th century and had a wealth of experience that he shares in a relaxed, conversational tone. The book reads like a novel; it is as though he is in the room talking to you! King's illustrations are classic and in some respects \\"fine art\\". I was told by geologists who knew him (unfortunately I never met Dr. King) that he would sit on outcrops for hours making sketches, many of which ended up as illustrations in this book. Even though the book is in many respects dated, it still contains a great wealth of observations and data that are as important today as they were 40 years ago. So if you are a geologist and have never read \\"The Evolution of North America\\", it is time that you did. If you are just an interested non-geologist, you will enjoy the book too. It does not require specialized training to read this book."},{"Title":"Messages for the Heart: Selected Readings from the Message","review":"do yourself a favor and buy this on tape. listen to it while driving, or whatever, and your heart will dance!"},{"Title":"Messages for the Heart: Selected Readings from the Message","review":"This abridged edition of selected passages is well done.

It was thrilling and adventreous. It felt like I was right there with Alice going through the adventure with her every step of the way. I would recomend this book to people of all ages not only because of it is adventures but because it had a wide varity of caracters that were funny and some that you can relate to. Some of the characters are, the white rabbit the queen of hearts, the white queen, and my favorite Alice. Alice is very curious and likes to explore wonderland. Alice's adventure in wonderland and through the looking glass is a wonderful book and is full of adventure and wondering."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I feel that this was a really good book. Like most people, I'd seen various versions of the movie Alice in Wonderland and was curious about the books, particularly Through the Looking Glass, which is never mentioned anywhere. The movies are based on a combination of elements from both books, includnig quirky poems with imaginary words.There were a lot of concepts that aren't in any movies I've seen, such as the talking chess pieces. Instead of one queen, there are two queens and two kings, just as in chess. This isn't just a children's book. I feel it's interesting for all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"A prophetic tome which foretold the gathering storm of the 20th century: moral relativism, social disintegration, lethal authoritarianism, the absurd. A dark, haunting and disturbing masterpiece masterfully disguised as a nursery tale. Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"A traditional child'book but it was a lot of fun and a change of pace to read as a grown-up. I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I would argue that this text offers more than WONDERLAND. Political, social, economic satire as well as deep, deep philosophy wrapped nicely around a figurative game of chess with a guest appearance by Caroll as the White Knight bidding fairwell to his title character, she having finally grown up."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I just love this book, I remember reading the story as a kid but it's much more than a kids story when you read it as a grown up..."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I purchased this verison of Alice you were not able to &#34;look inside!&#34; so I gambled.

Unfortunately I bought this book solely with the intent to photocopy and enlarge the images for a Alice themed party so it makes the purchase moot, but the story is nice..."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"As a child I pretty much hated ALICE and all the other works of Lewis Carroll. To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work. The Signet paperback contains all the Tenniel illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I bought this volume because several of the reviews mentioned that there were illustrations by John Tenniel. Unfortunately I failed to read the small print: keep in mind that most of the reviews posted to this edition refer to other editions. The edition I bought was the CreateSpace paperback with the pink and white cover.This particular edition has NO illustrations. It is also cheaply made -- the cover is flimsy and the binding is poor. Finally, the quotation-marks printed in this book are all straight, not curved -- as if it were typed up and printed from Wordpad.I was not satisfied with this volume.

This is a book that will find a place close to the heart of a reader of any age that has a place inside reserved for whimsy and childlike wonder.

Dreamy watercolours with several fold out pages to give full scope to hers and the author's inventiveness.Difficult to find; a very fair price; good, strong, stitched, paperback binding."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in WonderlandThe joy of this book definitely holds through for me as an adult. I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed. Those who wish to read a delightful children's story that will enchant and entertain readers young and old need look no further.ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS have very little in the way of plot - little Alice is thrown into a strange world where nothing seems quite right. She changes in size, is confronted by the imperious Queen of Hearts, has tea with a number of quirky characters; each new situation she encounters is \\"curiouser and curiouser\\" than the next. What the stories lack in plot, they make up for twentyfold in character. Carroll created a whimsical world for his young readers, and its charm spills over to entertain even the old. One cannot help but be charmed by his extraordinary imagination and fast-paced yet fun-filled writing style.ALICE AND WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS do not disappoint - they are cherished treasures among children and the young at heart - anyone who still has yet to discover their own \\"Wonderland.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The White Rabbit.

Recently, I stumbled upon the book and started skimming it and I was completely blown away!!! There are so many brilliant layers of wit and humor between the lines which I never noticed as a kid. There are twists and turns and endless puns and word games with every turn of the page. This is as much a novel for adults as it is for kids, maybe even more so! Lewis Carroll was a creative genius and I can't think of another writer who has ever created characters more colorfully endearing and comically puzzling at the same time.

When I first read this novel, I wanted to go through the same thing Alice went through in the story. Following a rabbit, going down a rabbit hole, drinking a potion that makes you either larger or smaller, meeting such wonderful and strange creatures just seems as such an amazing and unforgettable experience.This book is a must read novel for everyone, and it shall continue to be a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to this classic children's story was when I watched the 1951 Disney version, \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" I remember as a kid, loving it, but actually feeling a bit scared by it. As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page. Overall this book could use a better plot, but it keeps the reader interested with great characters and odd twists."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"i think this book is very good for girls in my age..because sometimes i also would like to flie out of this stressy world and alice is able to.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Puchased for my teenage daughter who loves the classics.Book as described - good seller"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school. Reading it as an adult was no better. It was possibly the most warped and perverse story I have ever read in my life.

There are many other \\"classics\\" out there more enjoyable and logical than this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is my fifth tarot deck and I have to say that I just love it. It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing. Due to the whimsical nature of the card, you might want to use it for more whimsical readings. But, like I said, if you ARE a fan of tarot decks with unusual design you should DEFINITELY get this deck and use it for those &quot;special&quot; occasions."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I bought this edition because I was so horribly disappointed with the free version, which had no poetry.

The many drug references, however, are extremely amusing, and add to the story very much.Alice is asleep and dreaming up a crazy world. The characters she meets are all eccentric, strange, and frightfully funny. Whether we're thinking of the Mad Hatter, the rabbit, or the Queen of Hearts herself, this book is truly a child's happy adventures through a completely ridiculous fictional land (unless you are firm in your belief that this book is completely about drugs, but even then it's still funny and ridiculous).Even though this book is known as a children's book, it is hilarious to all who read it. Enjoy! I just hope you remember to breathe while gasping with laughter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was so enjoyable! I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable. I almost wish it were a little shorter, like each story only 100 pages so it would go by faster, but it was still very enjoyable. I actually have to say I like 'Through the Looking Glass' the best. I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'. The end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland' was better because: 1. I read it first, and 2. It was just better and I was very surprised by it (guess I haven't seen the movie \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" in a while!).

From the beginning when Alice falls down the Rabbit hole and leaves Dinah, it captivates the reader and enchants the reader.

It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read. If you you're read it already, why not read it again?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Nice presentation of the two books with the classic illustrations.

My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Its hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this brilliant book. Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

Lewis Carroll is a magnificant author and the story he writes is wonderful. Alice is a little girl who journeys to a magical land where everything is full of non-sense. She incounters many people and creatures along the way. She is told many stories and riddles while she travels through wonderland. My favorite thing throughout the story, was when Alice kept saying that she would have to write a book about this place when she got home. Even though it was a dream, Alice still loves her world of non-sense."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll provides us with a twisted view of our worldthat provokes hours upon hours of thought. This novel may seem like anovel for children, however, it is filled with more literary devices than a truck-load of Hawthorne! Beautiful imagery, puns, malapropisms, possible drug innuendoes and grammatical devices make this a masterpiece to be reckoned with. Be prepared for deep thought upon a close examination of this seeming children's novel, because it is certainly a work for the more experienced reader. By far my favorite book!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glassis a FAIR choice - 3 stars. This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland HTML Editionis a POOR CHOICE - 2 stars. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago. A nice pair of books, but I personally find the Macmillan facsimile editions to be much nicer to handle."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Although the pictures are great I'm sure, I'd like to warn those searching for a copy with pictures not to get a paperback copy.

I remember having my own quite similar book as a kid and bought this for my (at the time) five year old son.Contains both 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' in one volume.

And I have re-read it at least once a year since.I'm not interested in why it was written or what deep, dark psychological quirks of the author underlie its imagery. It's enough that, from the time I fall down that curious rabbit hole, swim through the sea of tears, dance the lobster quadrille (Can you walk a little faster?), I seem to be retracing every step of my life. Every one of Alice's adventures has its echo in the real world, and they aren't hard to match.So, my much-worn copy sits comfortably on the shelf nearest to hand, and my grandchildren-to-be can expect to find a copy of their own in their very first Christmas stockings. And, hopefully, we, too, will one day &quot;talk of many things -- of ships, and shoes, and sealing wax; of cabbages and kings,&quot; just as I did with their parents when I first recited for them the dire warning &quot;Beware the jabberwok, my son!&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Don't buy the Kindle edition hoping to see the wonderful illustrations described in the product information.

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book...

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius.

Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters.

The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful. Everyone should read it once in their lifetime---it's worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some ways, then dipped down so suddenly that Alice had no time to think what's was going on before she had founden herself falling down a very deep hole (Pg 2). Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts. If you would like to know what happens to this to alice in her crazy adventure then you should read Alice in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The famous clasic kept me reading for hours.

As entertaining and totally bizarre as ALICE is, I can&#8217;t help but wondering if the whole of it is structured in any meaningful way. The experience itself is like a dream, or more probably also like a drug induced high, and the story is infinitely fascinating. It seemed to me (I had never read it as a child) that adults can appreciate this more than a child can, since the child can probably find the plot more humorous than illogical. I am curious as to what Lewis Carroll&#8217;s math lectures were like."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland with color photos from Hallmark TV movie, and also color photos from it on the dust jacket."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My children and I just finished this book and it was a lot of fun. The chapters are a reasonable length for reading one an evening. The stories were, according to my 9 year old daughter, goofy, weird, and interesting. We were never bored, and even my 7 yr old son enjoyed it. At times, the children requested another chapter because the previous one was a bit of a &quot;cliffhanger.&quot; This book makes for a wonderful read-aloud for the 6-10 year old set, and would be enjoyable for a proficient reader to read alone, as well.

MacDonald was a friend of Carroll's and when Carroll finished the book he asked MacDonald to read the book to his children to see if it was any good, and of course they loved it. George MacDonald later published some children's books of his own including &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and many others which are fantastic and every child should read them. This is a great book, is easy to read, is quite short and could be read entirely in a few short hours.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book everyone has heard of but relative few have read.It's amazing how film versions, including Disney's, mix up elementsfrom either book like it doesn't matter -- or they didn't really understand what they were doing.But one of the most thoughful yet unsentimental moments I've ever read occurs in the closing paragraphs of &quot;Wonderland,&quot; as Alice's sister dreamily muses on the innocence of childhood and lazy summer days, and how we grow up and take on new cares.

It also makes you wonder and wish this could happen to you. Take a walk through Alice's imagination and read this book.(I'm so cool.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of the most clever and entertaining books yet written. The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words.

But the book is 100% better than any movie.As a writer myself, I can only hope to write a book half as imaginative and charming as this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is my favorite book, and it has the sequel Through the Looking glass. This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting. The unorthodox type setups (such as the mouse's tale) are mostly preserved and the illustrations look good. One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book. And I noticed the table of contents link in the item menu does take you there. I never thought to look for a table of contents at the back of the book. My error. The poetry lines breaking in the middle of words persisted throughout the whole book. This was distracting and disappointing."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography. Adding insult to injury, the layout of this edition is easily one the worst ever for a reprint, with all words that originally appeared in italics for emphasis printed here in big block caps, as if the typesetting was done by an abrasive kid trying to get attention in an on line chat...IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN.If you really want to explore and experience Lewis Carroll's classic, getThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition-- for the price on Amazon, it's the real bargain. I also highly recommendAlice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland. Both of these books are a must for serious Alice fans as well as those just getting into Carroll's classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven because I thought that I might be missing out on something if I didn't. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland kind of boring but still good. Then I read Through the Looking Glass, and I loved it! I memorized all of the poems (jabberwocky being my favorite poem in the world), read it about a million times, and recomended it to people. Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book. The poem at the very end of the book was so sad in way. it really summed up about how I feel about the magic of childhood."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares!

Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

The way Lewis Carrol wrote it has to do a lot about politics and the way of reality. Alice always thinks what's the point of a book that shows nothing interesting whatsoever? Well later on she discovers that there are a few reasons why s some things are not nonsense. These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing. Some of the things Alice does can be thought as lessons, the sentence \\"Curiosity killed that cat\\" is used in other ways in the story, starting with chasing a rabbit down a tunnle.

But it was a bargain and such things are always a bit of a crapshoot."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Contrary to the reviews I've read, Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass is a great children's classic. A little girl falls asleep on a hot summer's day and dreams all the rest. I read this when I was a child and still love it. Relating it to drugs, etc., is absolutely absurd! Just goes to show how far our culture has deteriorated (no child likeAlice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glassimagination). The book should be understood \\"as is\\" nothing more, nothing less. It's a wonderfully funny fantasy I love it!! and so does my granddaughter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is a classic that every person should read. What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life! I strongly recommend getting this version of Carroll's classic story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass hold a special place in my heart. After my father died almost ten years ago, I purchased a copy for my mother. I suggested she read it and see that Alice, no matter what she went through, how bizarre and disturbing, always found a way to come out on top. She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book. (On an interesting side note, there's a camp of thought about it actually being written by Queen Victoria...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It appears that many of the reviewers of this particular edition of the book are not actually reviewing the product. Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child. Taking this perpective, readers will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This Book Brings out the best of both words.

I was surprised how short the stories were, having chosen to read this book after reading the Twilight series. I haven't read the added features, just the Advenures and Looking-Glass stories, so I cannot comment on their content. The illustrations were very nice. My only complaint was that the printed text was poorly spaced on the page, the inner edges being close to the center of the book, making it somewhat uncomfortable to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is really cool because it has a lot of kid's stories characters like the white rabbit, humpty dumpty, and Alice of course. it would be a good story for like fourth gaders who are barely starting to read chapter books.

It's a thoroughly enjoyable must-read/classic of nonsense and imagination.This Illustrated Junior Library edition (as really all IJL editions) displays and distributes the original Tenniel illustrations awesomely. Great cover!Only one criticism - sometimes these editions don't list the publishing date of the original book which I don't quite understand. Also, because they are junior editions they don't have introductions, give author backgrounds, etc. - although I don't believe any of the IJL editions are abridged except for The Three Musketeers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Another favourite book from childhood is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (or Alice in Wonderland as it's sometimes called) by Lewis Carroll.The novel was written in 1865 and tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantasy world called Wonderland. Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

Rereading it made me more aware of the intoxicating dreamlike quality of the story line as well as the incredibly tongue-in-cheek writing style. BUT... I was very disappointed to open it and find it contained NO illustrations whatsoever! Reading A.I.W. without the John Tenniel drawings is like eating plain dry bread. I know the drawings by heart so I could imagine them, but it isn't the same. Also -- many many typos! Avoid this edition! I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes. The Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter would have to be my favorite characters in this whole story (besides Alice herself). Its a great book and I'd be happy to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover.

It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER!

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts. To find out what actually occurred pick up the book and read it. Alice is a young girl who wishes there were more things in life and one day when she was out side with her sister she spots this white rabbit with a coat on and a pocket watch. She starts to follow it. She followed it through a rabbit hole and as she hit a soft spot on the ground Alice falls into a hole.

And perhaps it's folly to even try.I grew up with a hard backed copy of Alice in Wonderland and remember going through the pages countless times, gazing at the magnificent pictures--especially the Jabberwock--and giggling at the poetry. \\"Father William\\" and \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" still occupy parts of my brain as snatches and shards that want to pop out at awkward moments.That battle worn, orange backed book, handed down I'm pretty sure from my Dad, and read by him with equal enthusiasm when he was a kid, is long gone, and now that I'm armed with a Kindle I downloaded a copy to enjoy a fine book from my youth. If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself.

It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book ''Alice in Wonderland Through The Looking Glass'' was an interesting book.

Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around. Some of the most interesting and important characters appear in the second book included in this volume."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My 10 year old grandaughter is the owner of Alice in Wonderland and so far she loves it. I sent it to her because I loved it so much when I was her age. She does spend time reading aloud to her little brother, so he loves it too. My son tells me he listens in to the reading quite often so it is a hit all around."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Mervyn Peake (1911-1968) was one of the most original and wildly talented English artists of the last century. Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

They are well done and interesting. It is a 291 page story with fine print and notes and explanations after that! There are notes and an introduction at the beginning of the book as well. It is very different than what I was expecting but I do like it. I bought it for a 5 year old granddaughter who has a 3 year old brother and a 10 year old sister. Mom or Dad will probably read it to the three of them in the evening.

In rereading the book, I laughted loudly at times of the cleverness with which it was constructed. As a very 'mature' reader I had remembered such from my youthful reading of it. Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence! This book really is a must for anyone's collection of childhood classics read and enjoyed, even if one is older."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The author wonderfully re-creates the unsettling and illogical happenings of the dream world.

The book was also in very good condition and I will deffinatly be ordering from here agin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alices' adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass written by Lewis Carroll and is illustrated by John Tenniel is a story that has lived on and is enjoyed by both young and old. The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Daddy, can we read Alice tonight?\\" I just finished reading this book to my 4 year old girl.

Through Alice's adventures she comes across many characters who are both hard to get along with and hard to understand. Many of these characters have a significant meaning, such as adulthood and their constant changing of rules. Alice in Wonderland is a great book if you want a nice change of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"A different edition than I got last time. but still the best version of the Alice stories."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"i am 11 and the 1951 animated disney classic ALICE IN WONDERLAND is my favorite movie and the same with the book.the book is better than the movie because disney left out a lot of charecters when he made the movie(like the ugly duchess,the grython,MR.mouse and many more) that is why the book is just a little better. this book is full of colorful rich words that make you want to read more from both ALICE stories also it has very well balck and white drawings."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"As I listened to an audio recording of these two books, I thought back on all the literature I have enjoyed that was filled with puns (Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series, or - when I was an adolescent - Piers Anthony's Xanth books). Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

To find out who and what she meets, I guess that you will just have to read the book for yourself."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Possibly. Chalkful of vivid images, philosophy, language, and satire, Carroll makes one want to give up hopes of writing anything that might be labeled &quot;literature.&quot; Highly recommended.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her. If you sometimes feel that things are not going your way, you might want to pick this book up. It may work, just like for me and that professor."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The Modern Library edition is a nice choice for the adult reader, featuring all the wonderful original illustrations (by British political cartoonist John Tenniel), a thoughtful forward by A.S. Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll. The book itself is not worth your money. The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf?

My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was one of the first English novels I read, and I loved it. I went on to read Through the Looking Glass and loved it just as much. I think that it is a perfect book to read to children. The language was clear enough for me to understand, and I am not a native English speaker, so it would be easy for a child to understand.

What other mistakes have they made?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an extraordinary book that mixes the world of imagination and the world of reality. It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better. This story perfectly explains the racing imagination of a child in a light-hearted and imaginative way."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The pink flamingos are adorable, which makes it all the more disappointing when they start rubbing off from the second you remove the price sticker."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews.Alice is an inquisitive, and very brave girl, who observes the world around her, and attempts to understand what is happening and how to handle it.

That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

A smoking caterpillar and a disappearing cat may be absurd, but they're really imaginative. And I do believe that \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Looking-Glass\\" are open to interpretation, since the word play and the riddles found here are too silly to be scientific.I don't mind Hugh Haughton's annotated texts, as long as just enjoy reading these two children's tales peacefully.A"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a complex book disguised as a childrens book.

It's not cleverness - its just randomness disquised as cleverness. It just tosses a bunch of nothing together, shakes it up, mixes in a curious and rude little girl who's rudeness pales next to the characters she encounters in Wonderland. Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters. And Alice just skips off at the end, leaving her sister to forecast a bit of standard drivel about the day when they will be grownups but always have their childhood inside. Meh."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking glass are two interesting stories. When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me. The only point I got from it was an internal conflict of whether to take one road or not, like whether to take and drink certain things and what she should do with the moment."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree. The branches keep expanding until they end in fruits and seeds, the seeds thereoff will fall unto the ground and transform into another tree wich also has seeds and the cycle will continue ad infinitum.One of the most important symbols is the transformation trough eating pastry or drinking liquids, wich will make one bigger or smaller. The pastry or the liquids as clusters of thought wich will transform ones shape in nonphysical reality. Have you ever encountered someone who was very short or small in appearant reality yet he/she displayed a posture of magnificent greatness? Well, it is not a wild argument to state that he/she took a bite of the cookie or a zip of the magick potion....Another thing very important are the playing cards. The metaphor as life as a game, yourself batteling a whole armada of playing cards spades, hearts and diamonds alike!Then there is the eloquent buffoonery one engages upon in the teaparty of life (remember the rabbit and the hatsalesman?). This reminded me very much of the people one encounters in everyday life who seem to not be able to think clearly, to be out of syntax with the axioms of logic. These people will resort to various kinds of practices like palmistry or speaking with angels, they have postulated their delusions into actuallity.But of course, to transcend beyond this and to show you a way out one has to engage upon our magickal cat (but usually one will just bumb into him at the least expected moment).

Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly.

I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"One gets very bored for something good to read. This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him. I always saw the movies but this was the first I actually read the book. I thought it quite better than any of the movies.

The characters created be Lewis Carroll are fantastic, you can see people of all shapes and sizes. You can see many people such as the King and Queen of Hearts and the Duchess, but mostly you see many creatures roaming around. There is the white rabbit who wears a waist coat, or the caterpillar who sits on a mushroom, or the beloved Cheshire Cat: a cat who causes mischief wherever he goes, he also has the talent of dissapearing and reapearing.

I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again.

I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained.

Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing.

I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The stories in this book are familiar to most, but are incredible to read nonetheless. Carroll's ingenuity is wonderful to behold, and his sense of humor is marvelous. The layout of this book is great, and the price for two books in one can't be beat!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I would rate this lower if the rating were based simply on how I felt about the book.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was easy to read, mildly entertaining, and terribly familiar. I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have an avid young reader in my family and it is not always easy to guess what kind of book she may enjoy.

Originally published under the titles Alice's Adventures Underground and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, these books were the work of an Oxford mathematician named Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, using the pen-name of Lewis Carroll. According to Charles H. Sylvester (editor of Journeys through Bookland): \\"One day . . . he took three of his little friends, Alice and Edith and Lorina Liddell, for a trip up the river, and on that afternoon he began telling them about Alice and her Wonderland, continuing the story on other occasions. He had no intention of making a book, but the story pleased little Alice and her sisters so well that they talked about it at home and among their grown-up friends, who finally persuaded the author to have it printed.\\" Note: Songs are composed by Field, although the opening poem \\"All in the Golden Afternoon\\" is missing from this recording.

This latest version is ok, and it's brand new but not what I was expecting, what I was expecting was there there would be the usual 19th drawings of Alice, the rabbit, and all the other characters would be there, but unfortunately there are no drawings. It's sadly missing a good part of the charm of the other editions I read and have owned. I currently have a lovely complete works of Lewis Carroll leather bound which includes Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass, with the original drawings which I've had in every edition I've ever had including other paperback versions, but sadly not this one, if I'd realized that this one was missing such an essential ingredient as the drawings, I wouldn't have bought this particular edition. I bought it with the assumption that it had the usual charming Victorian drawings that every other edition hardback or paperback has it, but as my other copies of Alice have disappeared, and the leather bound edition is too frail to sit down and read, I'll make do with this one, but I'm not happy with it.I think may well send it back, and get another with the drawings."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fun and pleasant reading. The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit.

Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story. The book is well-written, surreal with bizarre, fascinating characters (whom a little girl has to figure out), unique situations, word play, puzzles and a mocking irreverent tone towards high society. Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I read the book, \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up. This book is really good, give it a try it will take you into a magnificent world and you will never want to come back!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"THE ULTIMATE FAIRYTAIL.

When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really. Um... so... anything you want to tell me about \\"The Jungle Book\\"?[The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine, Issue 2.]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition.

From the outside, they're stunning. It feels good in my hands, the color is fantastic, and the graphics are so well-selected. My gripe is with the spine of the book, which is almost too tight - these aren't the most comfortable editions to read without cracking the spine.

One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words.

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

The main plot of both books is quite simple; a girl named Alice stumbles upon another world filled with many different characters as she explores and meets many people and creatures alike.

Its filled with many different perspectives on many different things, some are very insightful while some are just silly. At some points, it will have you thinking while at others you'll find yourself laughing up a storm. This is what makes it great for kids and adults alike. The books are also very easy to relate to, not literally but in its theme: being thrown into something new and trying to fit in.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter. Buy this book for yourself, or for your child, or your friend, or whomever...anyone with a sense of humor and fantasy will delight in these two classic, unforgettable tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book in my opinion. I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself. With all of the facts that I just stated, my conclusion is that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book and I would recommend it to any readers that would like to know about a little girl and her bizarre and exciting adventures in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in wonderland is a great story for all ages. it is full of adventure.

This nineteenth century classic has been credited variously with being a complex mathematical puzzle, a dream, a cynical allegory on modern civilization, a drug-induced hallucination, or just a fanciful child's tale. I lean toward the latter. Whatever the truth, the book has stood the test of time, and continues to intrigue children even today. I highly recommend this imagination-stimulating story, but not without the pictures. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of BIG ICE."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book. The edition to get is one with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"'The Annotated Alice' with annotations done by Math and Games writer, Martin Gardiner may be the first, and is certainly the best known annotated edition of a popular classic, followed by annotations of other major popular classics such as the complete Sherlock Holmes and 'The Hobbit'.It is especially interesting to compare the Alice stories with Tolkien's novels, as both series of works are enhanced by their authors' love and professional involvement with language studies. The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you long to be carried away to a world of nonsense and magic, talking beasts and flowers then Alice is the best tour guide you can employ.

Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares.

I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Roadside History of Oregon","review":"Fantastic book- I was on a road trip through Oregon when I found it- it's a book you can pick up and read at any point and it will still be quite interesting.

They do this using only the example those adults supply by speaking. While adults do simplify their speech when talking to very young children, we rarely have a formal program of language instruction in mind. Rather, we simplify our speech so that we can be understood. From this input children are able to learn to distinguish words, understand the meaning of words and combine them into sentences. In no time a child is speaking his language and speaking it correctly.How this process occurs is the topic of Steven Pinker's monograph &quot;Language Learnability and Language Development&quot;. He focuses on how a child can learn the grammar of his language. His approach is quite formal and technical, as is fitting for a professor of linguistics writing for an audience of professional researchers. The ultimate goal is to define a set of algorithms that processes the input (the sentences heard by the child) and creates a set of rules that define the grammar of the language the child is hearing.Pinker's description of this process begins with the question of word order. A child must determine in what order his language puts words. Should he put the subject before the verb (He runs. vs. Runs he.), should an adjective precede a noun (white house in English, casa blanca in Spanish)? Where should an indirect object go? This isn't easy work. All the child has to go on are the sentences she hears and some non-verbal signals (pointing, tone of voice, the context of the utterance). Actually, the child has a little bit more; Pinker argues, as do many linguists, that we are all born with a mental framework for grammar. This can be imagined as a series of rules with some blanks to be filled in. All of the world's grammars can be described by filling in the blanks differently. So the child is not without some guidance.Once the child has identified the basic meanings of some of the words this framework for grammar and the algorithms Pinker proposes work together to determine how sentences are constructed. As the child learns more words and more of the basic grammar rules, more difficult notions can be tackled. The text proceeds through topics such as noun-verb agreement, verb forms and irregular verbs, auxiliary verbs (including the troublesome word &quot;do&quot; in English) and the formation of passive constructions. For each issue Pinker describes a framework and a series of rules for filling the blanks.The fundamental constructs and the nature of the rules require the reader to have some understanding of formal grammars (the transformational grammars of Chomsky or the LFG that Pinker bases his arguments on). Your understanding doesn't have to be deep, but it would be difficult to work your way through the book without some familiarity with the subject. Further the algorithms are given reasonably formally (not purely mathematically, but certainly it requires some effort to piece them together). In some sections of the text you may be forced, as I was, to simply skim over the details in an attempt gain some understanding.This is an older text (1984 for the first edition) and Pinker was trying not only to present his results, but--and perhaps most interestingly--develop a method for analyzing any theory of language acquisition. He even uses these criteria to judge his own theories. He can tell us where his ideas on language acquisition succeed, admits where they fail, and hypothesizes how they can be improved. This methodology defined a successful research program that continues today Pinker makes his case through careful, clear, and compelling arguments. This discipline isn't easy. Most of the experiments one would need to run, in order to validate the theory, would be highly unethical (let's speak to a child only in the passive voice, let's never ask a child a question and see what happens). So the theories have to be verified by the sentences children speak and a few experiments, usually with made up words. Unfortunately, the sentences children speak do not unambiguously tell us the grammar they used to construct them.I am no expert in this subject matter. I picked up the book because I had enjoyed the books Steven Pinker has written for the interested layman, such as &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, &quot;Words and Rules&quot; and &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;. I did have to work hard to try to understand the text and I am sure I didn't fully understand some of the more technical arguments. However, as a soon to be father of a new language learner, I will watch with heightened appreciation my child's fascinating ability to learn English."},{"Title":"Language Learnability and Language Development: First Edition (Cognitive Science Series)","review":"Well, maybe it is like wise mana from heaven to other linguists. But I am a parent in a trilingual household who was looking for some insights into how my 3 year old's language development was going on. I will now pull two phrases out of the book COMPLETELY AT RANDOM to show why I gave up:&quot;Braine concludes that in every instance in which a child frequently utters both possible orders of a pair of categories, either (a) both orders are found in the adult language, and the child has learned the two orders separately (evidence for this is the fact that one order typically predominates at first and then is supplemented by the alternative order; or (b) there is independent evidence that the utterances reflect a pregrammatical &quot;groping pattern&quot; in which the child wants to communicate a semantic relation, lacks the grammatical means to do so, and strings words together randomly in the hope of being understood.&quot;That one is not so bad, actually. How about,&quot;When a paradigm is split in response to a violation of the Unique Entry principle for a given cell, the child in effect &quot;expects&quot; to find alternative entries for each of his or her other existing affixes that do not already have alternatives with strong lexical entries&quot;.Having three post graduate degrees and learned to speak a second language fluently as an adult, so I actually know something about the subject of language acquisition and am not afraid of dense prose. But this book defeated me after a few pages.It is in my view supremely ironic that, given their field of study, linguistic scholars seem to be abominably poor at communication."},{"Title":"Language Learnability and Language Development: First Edition (Cognitive Science Series)","review":"At first glance, this appeared to be a more formidable effort than &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, which seemed aimed at a very wide (and perhaps more credulous) audience.However, the argument seems fairly simple:1. A grammar can be abstracted from speech (in this case, English speech) based on observed regularities.2. We can observe a change in a child's speech as he/she moves from simpler to more complex grammatical forms. So we can identify each such change in terms of the starting and ending forms.3. For any such changes, we surmise the child has come up with one or more rules to enable him/her to acquire the more complex form.The focus seems to be predominantly on the lexical and syntactical forms. Semantics seemed to be mentioned but not much of a concern here. Behaviorists, on the other hand, tend to emphasize the function of speech (although not discounting the importance of syntax).So, as a probably very naive example, consider a child who can say &quot;Give me the apple&quot;. Pinker may have noted that the syntax is correct but omits the use of an adjective. Skinner may be wondering whether the child's statement will be reinforced by being given an apple. Now suppose at some later time there are two apples in sight, a red one and a green one. The child now says &quot;Give me the red apple.&quot; Pinker has never heard the child use an adjective before and notes that as a development in language acquisition. Skinner wonders if the child's statement will be reinforced by being given the red apple and may be pleased to see that child was able to request that red one.The child's syntax, for whatever reason, was correct but it happened in service of the child's request for an apple. It's wonderful he/she was able to say it in that way, but it also seems wonderful that he/she got an apple.In such a situation, one can really see the red apple. One can really hear the child ask for it and really see the child get it. One really heard the request. How real was the syntax? Well, it may not be explicit in the sense the child or listener are aware of it as syntax. But it may make a big difference if the syntax were wrong in that the child's request could fail. So perhaps we can say the syntax is real (and diagram it if we like). Now can we say that the rule is real that allowed the child to go from the request without the adjective to the request with the adjective. Maybe, but it seems less clear. It also seems less clear how the child made the step. Did he/she create the rule somehow using an innate langauge ability? Or did he/she imitate something he/she had heard? But what if the child had heard a request for a &quot;green apple&quot; and could tell what &quot;red&quot; was but had never heard of a &quot;red apple&quot;. Or what if the child had heard of a &quot;red apple&quot;.Now I've gotten myself into trouble. Do I turn to Pinker or Skinner for the answer? Is it an either/or? Does it matter that the child wants something to eat or only that he/she is demonstrating an innate capacity for grammar?So where did the syntax come from? Where did the rules come from? Who ate the apple?Grammarians find grammar. Cognitive scientists find mind. One way or another, the child got the apple.

I thought the premise sounded interesting and some of the reviews I encountered on this site made the book appear promising.Briefly, the writing is brilliant. The book is filled with insightful thoughts. The descriptions of the dead and how they live are intense, and quite gruesome. The concept is inventive, to say the least.Let's see, what's wrong with the book? Oh, that's right. No plot! This book is really a great piece of descriptive imagination. It's powerful and fascinating. I just don't really understand what the point of fiction is, however, unless it also includes some semblance of a plot.I wish I had read ALL the reviews more carefully before reading How The Dead Live. It gave me everything that was promised, but a lot less as well."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"This is my first time reading Will Self's work and while the novel didn't have me running to check out everything else Self has written, it did leave me curious enough to explore his other works.The story centers around Lily Bloom who dies from cancer and passes into the afterlife where one must get an apartment, attend 12 step programs and what not in order to learn how to live again if you will.I loved the idea of Bloom being stalked/attached to one of her children who died (Rude Boy), and the Fats (all the weight she had lost/gained in life.)However, my main problem with the novel was the fact that the characters come across as people who I couldn't sympathize with even though they were interesting. I understand Bloom's cynicism and Self's writing possess' a particular wit. The bluntness, I liked, and the character that I found most interesting was Lily's drug-addicted daughter Natalie. It came to the point where I really didn't care what happened to the characters, but I had to finish the book just to see. Maybe Self did this intentionally, but as mentioned before, this is my first time reading Self and maybe I should just get used to it.It's a good read for the idea of such a world after death. Lily is reminded not to dwell too much into her daughter's lives after her death, and I don't want to do the same with what turned me off with this book.Will I read Self again? Yes. But would I recommend this for a first time Self reader? No."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"I wrote a first, relatively negative review of this book and realized only afterwards that I had been shocked by the lack of sentimentalism, rather than by a lack of feelings in this book about death (my excuse is that as a cancer patient myself I had a hard time reading about somebody dying of cancer described with so little compassion). But, I have to admit that Will Self writes beautifully and that -- in an English way -- he does explore the depth of the human heart.

Although I found the writing amazing...one really has to study his words...I constantly had to look things up..(that's good, by the way), in the end I guess it just went on too long - the first half of the book concerns the woman who is dying, her relationships with her children and various men, all with brutal honesty and I enjoyed that. The second half I struggled through. I mean once you can adapt to the idea that the dead are really \\"living\\" on the other side, the way these spirits roam around doing essentially nothing....was just too too far for me to get into. I finally gave it up about 3/4 of the way into the book."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"Derek Raymond was better than Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, Richard S. Prather, Hammet, James M. Cain--or even Edward Bunker. He was better than John D. McDonald, better than Roger L. Simon...et al.Derek Raymond was tops."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"More than anything, Self's new book focuses on the final death of modernism, through the despiritualization and commodification of every aspect of human life, including procreation. More an idea novel than one concerned with character and plot, the book explores this theme in the context of the Tibetan view of death, that one's perils in passing to the afterlife are the products of one's own mind. Lily Bloom, the main character, living in death much as she did in life, watches from the grave her two daughters fall prey to empty worlds within and without in the aftermath of modernism's failed optimism. Lily notes in appreciatively subtle ways that life, even within its extreme mundanity, makes less and less sense. As grim as this view is, something within Lily fights to be reborn, even as she knows the future grows more uncertain. It is this elusive impulse that gives hope to an otherwise dark, depressing read."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"Considering some of the unredeemed grotesqueness Self has penned, it's nice to know that he's capable of redeemed grotesqueness. This book is overlong, particularly in its final pages, which seem mostly to be a compendium of unrooted observations Self couldn't bear to let go of. It is dense and unpleasant (no problem unless it's perversely so--which it certainly is at times). It is unresolved at too many points, not through any apparent intention but seemingly through authorial amnesia. And yet...it's compelling. And, perhaps more surprisingly for Self, it declares its worthiness not in the form of a challenge--which he certainly has mastered--but as an invitation. He's not yet as comfortable with the notion of offering work that's rewarding in terms other than those of the masochist, yet this book proves how extraordinary even a cautious step in this direction can be, for both author and reader."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"This book is the third Derek Raymond novel in as many weeks. It has all the components of the previous factory novels: a sardonic sergeant whose only concern is the truth, a twisted tale of corruption and deception, and an ending that laves the reader in the same position as the detective. Now I'm looking forward to the last novel in the series."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"It's sometimes hard to figure out Derek Raymond, well most of the time. Since he was born Robert Cook but went by Robin and then changed his name (for his english publications) so as NOT to be confused with Dr.Robin Cook.Reading his books will sometimes stretch your credulity as to whether you are reading 'noir' or satire, but probably both.When his unnamed detective sergeant is sent to the 'country' to look into the disappearance of a woman it's almost as if he's being exiled to Siberia. The town of Thornhill (subtle huh!) is filled with more punters, ex-military and villains then you'ld expect to find in an East End Pub. Our \\"Hero\\" first makes his presence known when he get into an argument with the local constabulary because of where he parks his car, and then has it off with the desk sergeant.After asking around about this well known neighbor that has been missing for six months, everyone plays the dummy. Though no one, including the local detective inspector, seems to care that she's hasn't been seen for a long period of time. Our Sergeant, goes to the local gambling establishment and with two hands of cards proves the place crooked and closes it down all by himself. At two other times he is faced by a shotgun and totally ignores the danger and of course wins (he even makes one of the contract killers cry).So if you read this as a send-up of an Agatha Christie or P D James novel you will enjoy it immensely. Even if you read it as a straight mystery you will be surprised at some of the turns of events (he breaks the jaw of a 'Serious Crimes' Inspector who he thinks is trying to screw up his case). All-in-all the whole story is a 'hoot', from the language to the characters he creates, Raymond is an original.NOTE: on the inside cover of the paperback is a picture of Cook/Raymond in a vegetable garden with a knife in his hand; if you look at the picture quickly he could be Malcolm McDowell in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" sans the make-up."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"Will Self is renowned for being the &quot;bad boy&quot; of fiction and this book follows that reputation. No novel about the afterlife can fail to make large obvious ideological statements about the living. Still, that doesn't take away from the pleasure of this book. Self is makes some moving statements about the female and Jewish identity. He is harsh to them because our culture is still racist and sexist in many ways we don't consciously recognize. You'll find this novel very enjoyable because it is filled with a lovely kind of dark humor."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"As a fan of Will Self I was deeply disappointed by his latest novel. I have admired his acidic prose and thought that Collections such as The Grey Zone, and Tough Tough Toys for ... Boys was equally brilliant. The novel I most enjoyed was Great Apes. Will Self seems to write best when he adopts an analytical tone that goes beyond weird. The works of his that I most dislike, such as this one, suffer from a lack of self-control. This book degenerates into a thinly disguised rant against the things that Self most dislikes about the modern world. The most irritating feature is the profligate use of the \\"f\\" word that is always a cheap trick to substitute for the lack of substance. The orginal plot idea was great - the execution isn't. I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"Yes, it seems that this book is a triumph of theWill and an act of unbridled Self. It is a tour deforce, no doubt. Racy, witty, inventive, impressive.What it is not is much of a story. It shows all ofthe massive ego of a writer at the peak of his powerbut none of the willingness to entertain thatbelongs to a good story teller.The plot involves Lily Bloom (Molly's sister no doubt)who finds herself a sudden citizen of the land of thedead. Now you might think that this would be a startingpoint for an intricate piece of speculative fictionabout a topic that's engaged everybody's mind fromtime to time: what happens to us when we die?But Self doesn't take the opportunity. Instead, weget 400 pages of cranky self-indulgence of Lilyalong with a dose of British literary anti-semitism.The ending, which could have restored some narrativegrace to the 'story' is tacked on hurriedly. Given thechance to make a satisfying 'once upon a time' ending,the author goes for an act of Will and a display of Self.On the other hand: the Will and the Self in question arepretty impressive.

Yes, it's one big rant. But do we really want to waste our time reading several hundred pages of it? I don't. It perhaps would be acceptable as a short story but this book is unreadable. No plot, no dialogue that makes any sense, no descriptions a normal person could relate to; skip it. Mr. Self seems very proud of his famous drug-influenced reputation and he needs to get a clue. What makes for a good newspaper story about a writer with serious self-esteem problems does not make that writer's work good.He's capable of much better. Let's wait until he writes something worth reading, this is not."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"At first, I thought this novel was going to be about a problem that Britain now faces. With ever-greater life expectancy, there are many more old folk around than there ever used to be. Current pension advice seems to consist of saving every penny you have, and not wasting any cash on that deemed to be 'luxury'. There's also a perception, which Self kind of touches on here, that there are so many old people around that they've become invisible. This literally happens to Lily Bloom, the novel's narrator.However, Self does not take this obvious approach. Characterisation, on this evidence, is not really one of Self's strong points. You get the feeling that Self does walk around in Lily's shoes, as Harper Lee would have it, but everything she sees is through Self's eyes. Maybe it's my prejudice, but I'm pretty sure that most old people would never be as coarse as Lily is, in thought and in language. This novel does nothing to address the perception that much of life nowadays revolves around 'yoof' culture. One example of this is Self's amusing comparison of car design with that of Nike style trainers (which he repeated, almost word for word, in his recent appearance on Brit TV programme 'Room 101'). How pervasive does George Orwell seem now, with the recent success of 'Big Brother' around the world. It's not long before the whole focus of the novel seems to have shifted to Lily's daughter, Natasha, who seems to be Self's junky alter ego.Anyone expecting great characterisation from a Self novel would have to be quite dumb, since this is not how he writes. Self's voice is ever present. His dictionary too, probably. I wasn't fazed too much by the language. It never interrupts the flow of the book, and is almost always understandable in context. I love the fact that Self lets rip with words, the fact that he dare play with all the notes. I suspect that he also makes up words, which makes me like him even better. In his use of guttural language, Self's text almost approaches that of Chaucer or Shakespeare, a reverential devotion to garbled Anglo Saxon. It could be that this book will stand the stead of time, whatever that means, as a result of his distinctive use of language.Not everything's perfect in paradise. Though Self's outspoken prose is admirable (he's not a Sweeney Todd of words), there are moments when he is extraordinarily insensitive. This novel was reportedly borne from Self's own grief, yet he stomps on the mourning of others' with all the might of a skinhead's DM. I have witnessed the public grief of someone who was directly affected by one of the notorious massacres that Self unthinkingly throws into the cauldron, and it deserves more respect than Self allows here. God help Self if he ever runs into anyone from the Hillsborough families who has read this book. In this uncaring procession of nineties' bloodletting, the novelist most lives up to his name.Self delivers a bizarre cul-de-sac treatise of death. Lily ends up in purgatory, black cab driven to a part of London called Dulston, where all the dead hang out. She's no Marley, is Lily. Although she keeps a close tab on what her daughters are doing, she has no gift of foreknowledge and chooses not to manifest herself. When Natasha does see a vision, it more about Lily's past than her future, and she's too stoned to make much sense of it. Lily is surrounded by her ghosts, the fat selves she dieted to death, the son she sent to death, and all singing, all dancing lithopedien which is only released with her passing. There 's also a mysterious narrator, who spits out italics from Christmas 2001.When I wrote a novel, I had to have a self-imposed deadline. Since it was about Soccer, I chose the first day of the 1998 World Cup, and I just about made it. Will Self wouldn't have needed to be a rocket pen scientist to have worked out that all things Australian would be in vogue at the end of this year. Lily's death guide, Phar Lap Dixon, is an aboriginal. Anyone dull enough to want to escape the Olympics won't find refuge with Self. He has an amusing turn of words, a keen sense of observation, and he utilizes 'Schindler's Lifts' in absolutely the correct way. Although the constant repetition of 'd'jew' dulls in comparison. On a personal note, one of the highlights of my trips to the old East End when I was a kid was seeing 'George Davis is innocent, ask O'Mahhoney' daubed on a bridge, and Davis gets a brief mention here. If Self had been more considerate of others' grief, and had mentioned O'Mahonney, I might have given him full marks."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"He knows the brass hates him as he is a British bulldog with no regard to his superiors, procedure, or the media when it comes to solving a case or for that matter keeping apolitically correct silence when some Home Office idiotic suit lectures.

The rambling narrative would crank up and then lose its focus, leaving us an an audience to flounder for 15/20 pages at a time. I appreciated the development given to our main character Lily as we go with her through her illness, ultimate death and boredom with death itself. Few authors can turn a phrase or link words together as interestingingly as Self and for that I am appreciative of the book.

The narrator has suffered some horrific tragedies in his personal and family life, sees little hope for the future for himself or anyone else, but what gets him out of bed in the morning is the promise of being able to put away people who take harm other, innocent people - whether the villains be crooks or crooked cops. Raymond is often credited, along with Ted Lewis, as being the originator of British Noir; I can't quite put him up on the pedestal with Ted (very, very few reach that height, in my opinion), but these are certainly some of the better pulp novels I've read. Start with the first two Factory books, He Dies with his Eyes Open and The Devil's Home on Leave, then get this one."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"There comes a point about midway through Will Self's new novel when one realises that his prose isn't actually going anywhere--but stick with it. This is one, long, vile rant from the dying and then dead protagonist, Lily Bloom, who is undeniably a product of her times (coming of age in the '50's, hedonist in the '60's, etc.) and her experience (upper middle class Jewish/American living abroad, several marriages, etc.). It's a pretty repugnant, though darkly, darkly humorous, depiction. She's dying of cancer. Then she's dead. But every page just crackles w/ Self's boundless (and almost blinding) verbal energy and dexterity; the author is never self-censoring though his wordplay does get a bit cheeky. Self also doesn't do himself any favours having his anti-heroine summarising her life through an endless list of historical events that doesn't shed any light on either subject. But overall, it's a provocative and imaginative reflection of the anti-thesis of the title: it's about how we live (an alternative title: It's a Not So Wonderful Life). The novel sprints to the finish line in it's final quarter w/ a fascinating and well-written account that can only be described as Carlos Castenada Goes To The Outback; the reader suddenly and unexpectedly starts to realise the riches of this work, primarily, a bizarre meditation on the nature of parenting and the responsibilities inherent in being a mother and a child. HTDL is merciless and compellingly unsentimental. Well worth reading-a must for Self enthusiasts, a great place to start for newbies."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"If you enjoy Self's surreal mindscapes and jackhammer wit, you will appreciate this addition to his literary canon. All of the Self trademarks are here: the awesome imagination, the caustic commentary and the subtle and ingenious wordplay. And, for me at least, there were several added bonuses that make this easily my favorite Will book: a fully drawn character (narrator and protagonist Lily Bloom) with whom to identify and empathize; and a certain level of authorial compassion for the character that wasn't evident in previous works like &quot;My Idea of Fun&quot; or &quot;Great Apes.&quot; The result is that, as a reader, I found myself drawn to the character rather than simultaneously fascinated with and repelled by her...which is a more typical response to previous Self characters. The &quot;plot,&quot; such as it is, is described ad nauseum here, so another summary isn't necessary. Let me just say that as a reader, I was captivated from start to finish, and find myself recalling certain bits of narrative and imagery even as I've moved on with my life and read other books. I'm actually looking forward to attaining a little bit of objective distance from this book and reading it again, maybe in a year or so, with the hope of discovering new insights and nuances I didn't catch in my first reading."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"This book was listed in some brainiac's list of 1001 books to read before you die. It was one of the entries listed under the 2000s and I liked the set up of the story, what little I skimmed, before I picked up the book.Never having read Self before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was willing to give it the old college try. I loved the intro. That was about it. I'm sure there's a place for work like this in the world, but it isn't in my head.I read the first 60 pages trying to figure out what exactly was going on and if I needed a cultural reference book to understand it. But I was able to figure it all out. The protagonist, Lily, didn't have a good life, nor a good death and she holds it against everyone she's ever met. They tolerate her, she silently (and sometimes not so silently) hates them. Nevertheless she wants another go around.I read the next 40 or so pages, got to know the characters better, got to know Lily better and then realized I didn't like any of them. I struggled with whether I should be a literary snob and slog through to the end because One Should Finish Books, or should I give it back to the place I got it from? I gave it back.I could have spent a week or so finishing the book, but I just didn't want to. Life is too short to bathe oneself in that much vitriol."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"That comment about Kerouac's 'On the Road' being not writing but typing applies to this long novel as well. A sort of modern day Ulysses (hell, the heroine is even called Bloom) narrated by Lily Bloom, cancer raddled old lady who finds that Hindu spiritualist metaphysics have kicked in after her death and she finds herself in a grubby basement flat in Dulston (a suburb of North London where the dead live).The novel develops the conceit first outlaid by Self in his short story 'North London Book of the Dead' (in the collection 'The Quantity Theory of Insanity'). Whereas that story is a master of literary originality and economy, this novel, over the 400 page long hall is a bloated rant on just about every topic under the sun pertaining to 1990s London culture and society.Lily is a half Jewish, American woman of high middle class culture whose observational eye is like a camera - there is nothing she doesn't miss. And despise. She rants movingly against her cancerous condition, the yellowy sickly nausea of her incipient mortality. Her mind and family are sick too - her daughter Natasha, a sort of Kate Moss figure, a junkie with translucent skin and blue black hair who just has to rub up against a man to get laid. In her mortality, and beyond, Lily has opinions on London traffic, aboriginal bars, contemporary fashion, interior design of basement flats, politics in the UK and beyond. Just about every cultural incident of significance in late 1990s Britain. Will Self has always liberally slathered his pages with cultural references, but the result here is like a very, very rich oil painting. Too rich to pick out the individual tones and colours. The voice is the same, high intelligent diatribe throughout the novel.To my mind, novels of the formless, ranting style, all voice no structure don't really suit British novelists too well. There are some masterful examples of the kind in America - Portnoy's Complaint comes to mind. Even Martin Amis's 'voice' novel, Money, also a fantastic book, had to be set mainly in New York to achieve it's effect. American culture is rich and beserk enough to sustain such a book. 1990s London, much as Self would wish it to be, just wasn't. The best British novels of the period (to be fair to Self, there aren't many) had to work hard to dredge up some interesting narrative, as contemporary life was pretty much flatlining, just new bars and restaurants opening, trouser legs up in the spring, down in the autumn, a new instillation causing controversy here, a minor political scandal there. Self unleashes all his satirical canons at once in this novel - the ambition is huge, but the effect shows that much of his powder was damp."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"One of the darkest, saddest, and yet funniest books I have ever read. In the third book of the Factory series, Raymond's Nameless Detective is more relentless than ever in his no-compromises pursuit of justice as he travels to a town outside London to investigate the disappearance of a woman after the local police have failed to do so. There is a compelling mystery at the heart of the book, and it has all the noir trappings a reader could ask for, but that isn't the point. The most important parts of the book take place in the Nameless Detective's head as he spins soliloquies about life, death, loss, and redemption and in the long quotations from the husband of the missing woman. The Detective's basic methodology for resolving the case is to hilariously insult everybody he meets--with a few notable exceptions--and to reject the help of anyone, except for his trusted reporter friend who shows up halfway through the book. He is like Hammett's Continental Op in his ability to stir a whole town up for his own purposes.But this book doesn't take place in the real world at all. It is just as fantastic an atmosphere as Poe's Fall of the House of Usher, which it closely resembles in many ways. The descriptions of the decaying mansion at the center of the book, and, just as fantastically, the way the Detective stares down death at the hands of a rifle toting mother or a hired killer, are something out of a fever dream. On top of the noir and the Poe, there is also the poetry--poems, songs, and prose--that runs throughout the book, often as part of dreams the Detective, as first-person narrator, recounts. So the equation here might best be described as Dashiell Hammett + Edgar Allan Poe + Thomas Wolfe = Derek Raymond. But even that can't do justice to what Raymond has achieved here. For all of its influences, it emerges as a unique, visionary argument that, in the midst of corruption and chaos, one man's unalterable quest for justice can still mean something.If you try to read this as a regular mystery or piece of detective fiction, you are doomed to miss the point. And if you fall into sync with Raymond's and the Nameless Detective's way of thinking? Then maybe you are just plain doomed. But we don't have to go down without breaking a jaw or two."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"About 3/4 of the way through this novel, one gets the definite impression that Mr. Self is detailing *something* here, how much of it I am or should be understanding is unclear. The first half rather reads like any dismal account of the horrors of death; Lily succumbs to cancer, presenting her uncaring daughters and her entertaining, if ceaseless, bitterness. Have the dictionary ready, English and Americans alike, unless you're in that lucky 'Supra-vocabulary' demographic- Mr. Self means that you come to his text on his terms. I think I agree that the novel has something to do with the death of modernism. The mother/children relations surely seem to point in this direction, as do the constant references recent events, commodities, etc.. And of course there's a little mysticism thrown in for good measure. I found myself lost in the semoitic sea the second half; the &quot;plot&quot; is muddled, but I think to criticize it on those terms is to grossly miscalculate what the novel sets out to achieve. Your mind works feverishly to connect strands and characters and relationships and finally, once accomplished, the teetering house of cards comes crashing down to be reconnected in new and interesting ways by new elements of the narrative. Not nearly as obvious as &quot;Great Apes&quot;, this novel is more akin to Self's recent short story collections in its ambiguity. I think Self is prodigiously talented- not as funny as &quot;Great Apes&quot;, but surely novelly entertaining."},{"Title":"How the Dead Live","review":"Blurb (or foreword, I can't exactly remember) of this book, presents it as a satire...In a certain way, it is right.

Here you will find only an old, overweight women, whose thought resemble our own in a scarry manner... All wordly struggle of good and evil does not make a sense once you are dead, all that is left s longin...longing for daughters, longing for sex, longing for food, longing for everything that makes life what life actually is... and in a ceratin way that is all satirical that this book has.

Mirek Scriber is a Major in the Polish Secret Police when he decides to defect.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Name of the Father","review":"What a plot! The Vatican, a little known Polish intelligence organization, a plot to kill Andropov, a defector and a nun... A story so complex and imaginative, it leaves you unsure of the fact that it is really fiction. It is, to me, beyond comprehension that such a book should go out of print. Being the only Quinnell work I have ever come across (since I rarely search out a particular book), I can offer no comparisons. Nonetheless, if you enjoy tales in the genre of espionage, you cannot pass by an oppurtunity to experience the wonder of Mirek Scibor's ironic journey. Set in the mid-1980's, we experience through this character worlds which we knew little about... the religious persecution in the homeland of the Pope, the evil underworld of the Catholic Church, the terrorist training camps of northern Africa, and the political elite of the Eastern Bloc. Even more, we see first hand the inner-struggle of a woman who has dedicated her body and mind to God; and how that commitment to holiness enables her to act counter to all of her instincts in an effort to realize His &quot;apparent&quot; will: The death of the Soviet Premier. Should you read &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; once, you will surely read it again. It is both haunting and liberating, and I would prefer to believe that it is not entirely fabricated.

A.J. Quinnell, the author, was the REAL DEAL. As he himself explained, he had been an intelligence officer--a spy. That had been his job. And THAT is why his book seems \\"so real,\\" aside from the fact that [get ready!!] Mr. Quinnell himself clearly stated--in several television interviews that I witnessed when the book was first released--that his book was taken from FACTS that he had heard in the intelligence circuit. He appeared on all the morning talk shows for about a week.He said, in fact, that the world of intelligence--just like any other profession--has its coffee houses, \\"after-set\\" joints, etc. It's a circuit. And ON that circuit, he learned that Yuri Andropov had been MURDERED by an employ of the Vatican. He decided to write a novel about something that REALLY happened.To us, it all sounds like conspiracy theory. But he said that it was very natural, during the Cold War, even for enemy spies to meet in Vienna [a well-known gathering place of spies of all kinds, for you young folks who may not have known that], and have dinner, drink liquor, and generally exchange news that they'd heard. It's a profession. They hung out, exchanged ideas, shared news, etc., just like people in any other profession.He said that he could easily tell, by the pattern of information he was receiving, that the rumors were on target. He would know!I LOVE this book!! I'm 53 years old. The book came out in the 80s, and I still read it--over and over again. One reviewer hear hit it on the head: the book is, in a sense, very inspirational, in that you feel like anything can be done.The leader of the Soviet Union, at that time, was the most guarded human being on earth. Yet the Vatican [well, or so the \\"fiction\\" goes] was able to plant a fake \\"kidney specialist\\" right inside the Kremlin...well, I can't tell you the rest of the book! Read for yourself.If your life is very busy, and you have many things on your plate, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!! Because, if you do, you'll be HOOKED! You'll be reading it once a week.Here's what REALLY, REALLY bugs me: How on EARTH has Hollywood missed this novel!!!!! The Cold War is finished.

This is an interesting story line. I did not think it would work as well as it did. After all the Vatican is not really known for this type of activity. Never less, the author pulled it off. I think the excellent work on the story line did it for me. There were no cheap, convenient moves here. You believe each twist and turn would \\"of course\\" be there.

Rene Burri is one of the twentieth century's foremost photographers in league with notables such as Capa, Riboud and Bischof. He created some of the 20th century's defining images. He was trained under Finsler and Willimann in the 1950s at the renowned Kunstgewerbeschule Zurich, and the author makes frequent reference to the influence of these masters on Burri's photographic vision. It is not always easy to find certain published works of Burri; this book assembles a representative sample with a very well-written, informative commentary on the historical context, background to and photographic aspects of the images. The book is quite well printed with satisfactory layout, a minor annoyance being the need to turn the pages sideways to read the captions. This of course should not deter anyone from acquiring a copy of this important and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"but who paid for the bullet.\\"Compact, amusingly cynical little sentences such as the above bubble up throughout Eric Ambler's \\"A Coffin for Dimitrios\\" and, in fact, throughout most of Ambler's books. That is just one reason why Ambler's books are so enjoyable and have held up so well over time.For those not familiar with his work, Ambler was to the modern British spy novel what Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett were to the American detective novel. Ambler transformed the spy novel from a simplistic black and white world of perfect good guys versus nefarious bad guys into a far more realistic world where sometimes the difference between good and evil is not all that great.Typically, Ambler would take an unassuming, unsuspecting spectator and immerse him in a world of mystery and intrigue in pre-World War II Europe. The result was a series of highly entertaining and satisfying books that many believe set the stage for the likes of le Carre, Deighton, and, most recently, Alan Furst. A Coffin for Dimitrios was one of Ambler's best known works. (It was made into a movie starring Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.) It is a very entertaining read.The plot is relatively easy to follow. Charles Lattimer is a British University professor who retired from academia once he discovered that writing mass market detective stories was far more lucrative. While on holiday in Istanbul he makes the acquaintance of a Turkish police inspector who is an admirer of Lattimer's work. Lattimer is invited to the policeman's office where he is provided with ideas for a book the police officer is writing. While there he is invited to join the officer in viewing the body of a master criminal, Dimitrios, who has just been fished out of the Bosporus. Lattimer, fascinated by sketchy but lurid details of Dimitrios criminal career, decides to trace Dimitrios steps in the hopes that he will obtain new material for future detective stories. Lattimer travels from Turkey to Greece, Bulgaria, Switzerland and France in search of background information. Of course, anyone seeking such information in the corridors of the criminal underworld immediately becomes the object of attention, some of it quite dangerous. The story of Dimitrios' life is peeled away like an onion. Bits of information are revealed at each stop. Lattimer discovers that Dimitrios' actions sometimes had a sinister political connection. As the novel reaches its climax the final bits of information needed to complete the puzzle that is Dimitrios are revealed.A Coffin For Dimitrios made for an excellent read. Some readers may find it a bit quaint. Some may find Ambler's prose a bit old-fashioned. But when one considers that Ambler's books were written close to 70 years ago I don't think it particularly fair to harp overly much on a writing or prose-style that doesn't quite match that of a le Carre or Deighton. A Coffin for Dimitrios and most of the rest of Ambler's works have been re-issued in new paperback editions by Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Press. They are in print and readily available. I don't hesitate to recommend A Coffin for Dimitrios or any of Ambler's works. They are perfect for leisure reading whether at the beach or elsewhere. Last, if you have enjoyed the works of John le Carre, Deighton, Ian Fleming, or Alan Furst, it is worth a trip to Ambler to see one of their literary ancestors in action."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"It's amazing how quickly the books of second-rate writers become dated. I'm partial to thrillers, and my bookshelf groans with stories, set in the Cold War, that I will never read again. Their settings are as strange to me now as the Roman Empire or renaissance Europe. Their time is past. No so Ambler. 'Dimitrios' is based on people, not place. He created so many memorable characters: the Turkish secret policeman, clownish off-duty, ruthless and cold-eyed at his work; the Bulgarian good-time girl, whose head and heart told her different things; the hen-pecked offical in Belgrade, with his greedy wife; the respectable cafe-owner who slides, without resistance, into the lucrative world of prostitution and drug-smuggling; the successful Swiss businessman whose business just happened to be selling secrets. These are not people I have come across in real life, but they all strike me as flesh-and-blood characters. I could imagine having a fascinating conversation with any of them. In terms of place, the end of the Cold War has actually helped Ambler. We (I'm British) seem to have returned to the Europe of the inter-war years: corrupt, amoral, nervy, and prone to occasional outbursts of horrific violence. The significant difference, of course, is that we have no Hitler around now. In 'Dimitrios', Hitler is never mentioned by name, but he is always there, hovering, as it were, just out of the corner of your eye. Ambler's prose is wonderful. He tells a complicated story so well, lingering just long enough to sketch in profiles of people and places, before getting on with the plot. Three passages linger in my memory: the massacre of the inhabitants of Smyrna; the entrapment of the Yugoslav offical; and Peters' description of how intelligent and worldly-wise people become addicted to heroin. Ambler's prose is spare and cynical, yet there is a dash of pity as well. Unlike so many novelists today who give the impression that their characters are no more than specimens on the lab bench, you feel that Ambler saw his characters as people. For a novel whose subject-matter is so dark, the reader finishes it feeling satisfied and enriched. An enjoyable and profitable read."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Ordinarily, I don't read thrillers, but since this was one of my mother's favorite books, I thought I would give it a try. What a surprise!Instead of some overblown macho stud like James Bond, the protagonist is Charles Latimer, a quiet English academic, who becomes intrigued by the death of an arch-felon, Dimitrios Makropoulos. He decides to find out more about this Dimitrios, and winds up traversing Europe from Istanbul to Paris.There are no gimmicks in Ambler's writing; he presents a mystery and unravels it. Supposedly, Ambler is responsible for the &quot;modern&quot; spy thriller. If so, he did it well, but the genre devolved after him. A Coffin for Dimitrios is a superb book whether it is classified a mystery, thriller, or whatever."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"To read or not to read the great spy novels of Eric Ambler? That is the question most people ignore because they are not familiar with Mr. Ambler and his particularly talent.Mr. Ambler has always had this problem. As Alfred Hitchcock noted in his introduction to Intrigue (an omnibus volume containing Journey into Fear, A Coffin for Dimitrios, Cause for Alarm and Background to Danger), \\"Perhaps this was the volume that brought Mr. Ambler to the attention of the public that make best-sellers. They had been singularly inattentive until its appearance -- I suppose only God knows why.\\" He goes on to say, \\"They had not even heeded the critics, who had said, from the very first, that Mr. Ambler had given new life and fresh viewpoint to the art of the spy novel -- an art supposedly threadbare and certainly clich&eacute;-infested.\\"So what's new and different about Eric Ambler writing? His heroes are ordinary people with whom almost any reader can identify, which puts you in the middle of a turmoil of emotions. His bad guys are characteristic of those who did the type of dirty deeds described in the book. His angels on the sidelines are equally realistic to the historical context. The backgrounds, histories and plot lines are finely nuanced into the actual evolution of the areas and events described during that time. In a way, these books are like historical fiction, except they describe deceit and betrayal rather than love and affection. From a distance of over 60 years, we read these books today as a way to step back into the darkest days of the past and relive them vividly. You can almost see and feel a dark hand raised to strike you in the back as you read one of his book's later pages. In a way, these stories are like a more realistic version of what Dashiell Hammett wrote as applied to European espionage.Since Mr. Ambler wrote, the thrillers have gotten much bigger in scope . . . and moved beyond reality. Usually, the future of the human race is at stake. The heroes make Superman look like a wimp in terms of their prowess and knowledge. There's usually a love interest who exceeds your vision of the ideal woman. Fast-paced violence and killing dominate most pages. There are lots of toys to describe and use in imaginative ways. The villains combine the worst faults of the 45 most undesirable people in world history and have gained enormous wealth and power while being totally crazy. The plot twists and turns like cruise missile every few seconds in unexpected directions. If you want a book like that, please do not read Mr. Ambler's work. You won't like it.If you want to taste, touch, smell, see and hear evil from close range and move through fear to defeat it, Mr. Ambler's your man.On to A Coffin for Dimitrios. During the pre-World War II era, it was common for ordinary citizens to be pressed into espionage activities, whether knowingly or not. Many people rate A Coffin for Dimitrios to be the greatest novel built around that theme. Almost everyone agrees that it is Mr. Ambler's best novel.Charles Latimer began his career as a lecturer in political economy at a minor English University and wrote three scholar volumes. Suffering from depression from his studies of the Nazis in the third volume, He wrote a successful detective story and was soon launched on a career as a writer that took him away from academia. A chance trip to Turkey after an illness in Athens causes him to meet a real policeman, Colonel Haki, who is a fan of his stories. They meet for lunch to discuss the colonel's literary ambitions. Casually, the colonel shares the dossier of a criminal, Dimitrios Markropoulos, to make the point that \\"the murderer in a roman policier [is] much more sympathetic than a real murderer.\\" The dossier is filled with probable crimes with lots of gaps in time and knowledge between locations and crimes. Latimer learns that Dimitrios is now lying dead in the morgue, and develops an odd compulsion to see him. The colonel complies and Latimer decides he wants to know all about the dead man. The bulk of the story relates to finding the man behind the dossier through talking with his former associates. As the detection follows, new mysteries appear and Latimer finds himself in the middle of something much larger than himself.For those who like complicated plots, this book is a delight. Each stage of the search for Dimitrios is like a separate short story that asks and answers a piece of the mystery. Some will undoubtedly see the links from one of these short stories to the next as sometimes being on the flimsy side. That's intended, rather than being a flaw. The larger theme of this book is about the weird appearance of the hand of Providence in our lives. But it's Providence viewed with a sense of humor. As the book begins, Mr. Ambler notes that \\"if there should be such as thing as a superhuman Law, it is administered with sub-human efficiency. The choice of Latimer as its instrument could have been made only by an idiot.\\"After you finish enjoying the delightful story, please consider where else you are comfortable reading books set in the past for their observations about that past that are universal and timeless. For instance, does King Lear, or Hamlet speak to you today even though their settings are long since gone?"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Ambler's book traces the story of Charles Latimer's, a British professor who writes detective novels in his spare time, descent into the world of international espionage and greed. Ambler is wonderful at recreating the recollections of an earnest and somewhat simple man who is hopelessly out his league as his follows the life history of a corpse he's been shown for laughs in a Turkish morgue.This is the real deal in terms of mystery/spy novels. It's a delightfully intelligent and engaging page turner by the author who invented the modern spy genre. The roiling, ethnically and politically complex Europe of the 1930 is nearly another character of the novel, but unlike the work of more contemporary authors, the reader never feels bludgeoned over the head with historical trivia.This is a fun, interesting, page-turning thriller. Great beach reading, but intelligent enough not to insult the serious reader of literature."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"\\"Inevitably, chance does occasionally operate with a sort of fumbling coherence readily mistakable for the workings of a self-conscious Providence.\\" And so begins the story of Dimitrios Makropoulos.Eric Ambler's fascinating novel, A Coffin for Dimitrios (also titled The Mask of Dimitrios), was published in 1939 as Europe edged toward war. Charles Latimer, a lecturer in political economy, had unexpectedly become a successful writer of mystery stories. By chance, an improbable fan, a Colonel Haki in Istanbul, offers Latimer the opportunity to see a corpse recovered from the Bosphorus the night before. Dimitrios was \\"scum\\" that had been associated with murder, political assassination, and heroin smuggling. The dossier on Dimitrios was fragmentary and dated back to 1922. His death was an untidy conclusion to an untidy life.For reasons even unclear to himself, Latimer begins an almost obsessive search for the story of Dimitrios. We readers become ensnared in a shabby, greedy, politically dangerous Central Europe that foreshadows not only WWII, but also the chaos in the Balkans of the 1990s. We meet unsavory characters in Istanbul, Smyrna, Sofia, Geneva, and Paris; the research into the life of Dimitrios is no longer academic.The historical setting feels authentic. I could not avoid being aware that this fictional story would be soon followed by a horrendous event. Eric Ambler, like many Europeans in 1939, expected war, but not a war of the magnitude that was to occur. One of his characters says: My latest information is that war will not break out until the spring; so there will be time for some skiing.Eric Ambler is recognized as a major influence on Graham Greene, Len Deighton, and John LeCarre and other practitioners of sophisticated political thrillers. Ian Fleming is even said to have had James Bond observe that Ambler was a favorite author. If some aspects of Ambler's story seem familiar, remember that it is others that copied him.Movie buffs might be aware that in 1944 Peter Lorre played the role of Latimer (renamed Layman, for some obscure reason) in a popular film version titled The Mask of Dimitrios. It was directed by Jean Negulesco."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"If you are a reader of mysteries and haven't read any Eric Ambler, start with this one. It combines a compelling story with a tight plot and very interesting characters. The writing is top notch as well."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Eric Ambler pretty much invented the modern spy thriller and Coffin for Dimitrios (originally published in the UK as Mask of Dimitrios) is his best known work - perhaps in part because it was made into a movie in 1944.Charles Latimer writes \\"detection novels\\" (romans policiers) and is slowly drawn into research on the story behind the murder of Dimitrios - who was Dimitrios and how did he end up floating in a Turkish harbor? Latimer begins to trace Dimitrios' known movements through Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Switzerland, France, and Croatia. What begins as mere professional curiosity eventually becomes deadly serious.The storyline gets pretty complex - Dimitrios is involved in a couple assasination plots possibly with the backing of an international bank, but those events are mostly kept in the background. Latimer meets Mr. Peters who has his own plans regarding Dimitrios (Sydney Greenstreet is perfectly cast as Mr. Peters in the movie).The highlight of the book is the lengthy description of Dimitrios' exploitation of a Yugolsavian bureaucrat's greed and sense of self-importance.The best book by the guy who started noir."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Ambler was the leading English thriller writer of his time and although now perhaps somewhat forgotten this book still has plenty to offer to those who take the time to read it. Ambler writes objectively in the third person in a style that is economical and is focussed on the plot. Every now and then you find a line in the book that reminds you that Ambler really was a master.The storyline here follows the journey of an English crime writer called Charles Latimer who decides to trace the life of Dimitrios - a ruthless criminal whose body has been found washed up in Turkey. As Latimer traces his way across Europe, his enquires about Dimitrios come to the attention of players in the seedy underworld of the late 1930's. Before he knows what is happening Latimer finds himself in the middle of some action far more real than that he has written about in his books. Overall this is an enjoyable and suspenseful plot with a satisfying ending.Those who enjoy reading thrillers should have a go at reading this great book from 1939. Time has taken little away from what Ambler has done here and it makes for impressive and rapid reading."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Charles Latimer is the unlikely protagonist in this classic work by legendary spymaster Eric Ambler. Latimer is a university professor turned moderately successful crime novelist. While visiting Istanbul, he learns quite by chance that the body of a career criminal named Dimitrios has recently been fished out of the Bosphorus. Latimer becomes fascinated by the extent and international flavor of Dimitrios' &quot;rap sheet&quot; and takes it upon himself to retrace the archcriminal's travels over the preceeding 16 or so years.This project takes Latimer from Turkey to Greece, from Greece to Bulgaria, from Bulgaria to Switzerland, from....well you get the idea. At each stop along the way more disturbing information about Dimitrios is revealed. Before long both Latimer and the reader come to appreciate what a sinister, ruthless snake Dimitrios must have been. To reveal anymore might spoil the fun.Written with understated wit, A Coffin for Dimitrios is well crafted, entertaining and, dare I say it, educational. Originally published 65 years ago, it holds up remarkably well. This is one novel of international intrigue you will not want to miss."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"This is one of the best mysteries I have ever read. It opens in Turkey 1938 (the book was published in 1939). where a mystery writer is invited to see a corpse of a known murderer and conman. The story follows the writers investigation of the life of the conman. It is an interesting glimpse of life in Eastern Europe between the wars. I liked it because it was written at a time when the author would not know the outcome of the Nazi Party. It also brings to life the drama of eastern europe between the wars."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I found a certain fascination with the serpentine meanderings of the plot as the protaginist made his way through the pre-World War Two Balkans on his way to Geneva and Paris searching for information on a criminal recently fished out of the Bosperous by Turkish authorities. Unfortunately Ambler spent too much space on recapitulating the shabby activities of Demetrios and the low-life history associated with him: Drug running, prostitution, even political assassination, but all this was largely in the shady past. Often the novel dragged. I wonder if Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre did much to enliven the movie version known by the British title, \\"A Mask for Demetrios.\\""},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Eric Ambler is one of the great spy novelist of all time. He had no real background in writing, but had a great natural talent. One of his outstanding books, often thought of as his best work, is \\"A Coffin for Dimitrios\\" It is a fascinating story beautifully written."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"The back cover blurb by Graham Greene hails Ambler as 'Our greatest thriller writer.\\" Tall praise from one of the greatest mystery writers. And well deserved. There are more twists and turns in this novel than there are in an Alpine road, with Ambler enticing his reader to try to anticipate the next one. He was always a curve or two ahead of me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly!"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I read The Light Of Day and liked it so I decided to try one of his best reviewed. Outstanding plot and characters again. I read where Hitchcock was a big fan of Ambler and you can tell. Ambler's book's remind me of The 39 Steps, North By Northwest, Notorious, etc."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Englishman Charles Latimer, ex-university lecturer and writer of detective stories, is on a continued-vacation in Turkey where he meets Colonel Haki of the Turkish secret police. Over a discussion of detective fiction, Haki says, \\"I wonder if you are interested in 'real' murderers, Mr. Latimer. I find the murderer in 'romans policier' much more sympathetic...artistic.\\"The real murderer is not artistic,\\" Haki continues pointing to a dossier before him. \\"Here is a real murderer. We have known of his existence for nearly twenty years. This man is typical. A dirty type, common, cowardly, scum. Murder, espionage, drugs...two affairs of assassination. Dimitrios. No government has ever caught him and there is no photograph... But we knew him...so did Sofia and Belgrade and Paris and Athens... A fisherman pulled his body out of the Bosphorus last night... There is your story. Incomplete. Inartistic. No detection, no suspects, no hidden motives, merely sordid.\\"\\"But interesting, nevertheless,\\" objected Latimer.As he views the body of Dimitrios Makropoulos and the neat pile of crumpled clothing at the mortuary, Latimer begins to wonder who is this man? This putty-coloured bulk at the end of an odyssey. Could someone follow his path? Answer unanswered and uncared about questions? It would \\"surely be the strangest of biographies.\\"Latimer curiosity has been bitten and though he thinks it \\"Unthinkably foolish...a wild goose chase,\\" he sets out to discover that biography.There is nearly no action or violence; a far cry from modern mysteries and thrillers. Latimer follows Dimitrios' life from city to city, country to country, studying official records and news accounts, interviewing those who knew the man. He is often despondent; again, questioning his reasons for this worthless task until he finds another fascinating tidbit to keep him searching.There are no really likable characters to care about--not even Latimer--to keep the reader going. Yet the trek itself is interesting. There is an especially haunting passage by a former drug dealer on addiction:\\"It begins as an experiment. Half a gramme, perhaps... It may make you feel sick the first time, but you try again...and next time... A delicious sensation, warm, brilliant...afterwards is not so bad; not nearly as bad as...too much champagne... Soon you are yourself again... Nothing has happened...except that you have enjoyed yourself amazingly. If you do not wish to take the drug again,...you need not do so...you are superior to the stuff. But this time...(y)our half a gramme is not enough... A trifle more; nearly a gramme, perhaps...the moment you detect any bad effects 'you' will stop. Only fools become addicts. One and a half grammes... Two grammes. It's four months now. You must stop soon. Two and a half grammes. Other people seem to get on your nerves... They talk so loudly. What are they saying?...about you. Vicious lies. Three grammes... You must pull yourself together. Three and a half grammes...\\" Worth an extra star for this scene alone.And there is that niggling, lingering question at the back of the reader's mind (at least this one's) from the beginning: is Dimitrios really dead? No photo of him existed in any government file; there is only the French carte d'identit&eacute; found on the body.That question brought to mind immediately one of my favorite films and books, THE THIRD MAN (1949) by Graham Greene: pulp writer Holly Martin travels to Vienna to visit his old friend Harry Lime, only to find that Harry is dead and buried and considered a despicable underworld criminal. Holly sets out on the backtrail to learn the truth of his old friend and discovers the death is more convenience than reality. How much did THE THIRD MAN owe to Eric Ambler's DIMITRIOS? One convincing argument can be found at a review of THE MASK OF DIMITRIOS (the film version of COFFIN) at the following website: [...]In the end, Colonel Haki was right--and wrong. Yes, COFFIN is a merely sordid tale with no detections, no suspects, no hidden motives; but it is totally artistic, totally complete--totally captivating and interesting, nevertheless. And not to be missed."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Eric Ambler manages to write in 300 pages what Ludlum requires 500! And, it's far more engaging."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Eric Ambler's fun and extraordinary tale of a mystery writer caught up in the intrigues of espionage in 1930s Europe is an exciting read. Catching up with the vacationing mystery writer Charles Latimer in Eastern Europe, the story begins with the mysterious end of the enigmatic Dimitrios Makropoulos. Intrigued, Latimer works backwards across a pre-war European landscape in hopes of putting to rest a simple question: who was Dimitrios Makropoulos? Simple questions, however, rarely have simple answers and so is the case with Dimitrios.Long praised for being a classic of the genre (See, e.g., Sarah Weinman's article \\"A Startling Spy Story\\" in the Wall Street Journal on May 23, 2009), Ambler's complex tale weaves in a number of colorful characters that can be amazingly insightful while, at the same time, lost in idealism. At one point, one of the characters remarks offhandedly that \\"great animal lovers are sometimes pathetic in their hatred of humanity.\\" Another character takes a few conspicuous events from the life of Dimitrios to interpolate an inwardly Marxist story of international business run amok.Between them both is the bumbling Latimer who, in unraveling the mystery of a despicable man, stumbles into an adventure that is as enjoyable as it is implausible."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"This book was originally copyrighted in 1939.

While visiting Istanbul he first heard of the mysterious criminal Dimitrios from Turkish Colonel Haki. Latimer's interest was aroused and he decided to follow the trail of Dimitrios from Turkey thru Greece,Bulgaria, Switzerland and France.

In his mid-30s he began to write detective stories, and became successful enough to make a new career. While traveling abroad in Turkey he was introduced to the Chief of the Secret Police. Colonel Haki told him about finding a body, and Charles asked to visit the mortuary for the experience. Intrigued by the history of this Dimitrios, Charles decided to follow the trail and act as a detective. Dimitrios escaped Smyrna in August 1922 and went to Sofia, Belgrade, Paris, Lyons, and other places. The police knew of him, but can't prove anything. Then his body was found in Istanbul. Charles Latimer traveled to these places to try to learn something. One unforeseen fact is that it is dangerous for a literary person to get involved with criminals; they don't appreciate the interest shown in them! But a Mr. Peters offered to help him in his research by referring him to a retired businessman in Geneva. Charles Latimer should have found a cause for alarm when told he had valuable information, but didn't know what it was! But he continued his journey without any fear.Chapter IX tells how a spy gained the friendship and confidence of a clerk in a government ministry. The clerk needed the money after he lost at a rigged card game. Peters told how he smuggled heroin to France in a coffin, but that couldn't be done regularly. The end of Chapter XI reveals the secret of Latimer's knowledge. [This is similar to Graham Greene's story \\"The Third Man\\".] Mr. Peters will profit from this knowledge. Their last meeting ends with rough justice. Charles Latimer decides to set his next mystery in an English country village. The ending seems unreal, forced by the need for Latimer's survival."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"This is a quite wondeful little book. It is hard to believe that a book that was written so many years ago could still be thrilling and exciting today. I now understand why Ambler is thought to be the father of the spy novel. It would be difficult to find a writer today that could build up this kind of suspense and intrigue. I couldn't help thinking as I was reading it that it would make a great black and white movie, and then I found out that it actually was made into a movie in the 40's. Peter Lorre and Greenstreet starred in it. It would be nice to see this old movie now that I've read the book. The book is set mostly in the Balkans, but Ambler takes the reader to Athens and Paris too. The story is about a mystery writer's curiosity to trace the life of a criminal that he first sees dead on a slab in Turkey. Charles Latimer gets pulled into all kinds situations while he pursues the truth. The story is action-filled right to the end. This has to be one of the best books from the 30's (at least in this genre)."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"This is an amazing yarn that starts with the violent death of a certain person found floating in the Bosphorus outside of Istanbul. That certain person appears to be the subject of this novel, or does he. Well, you'll have to read it to follow the twists and turns from Istanbul to Smyrna to Athens to Belgrade......to Paris. It will become all the more clear at each stop along the way. Your companion in this journey is the mystery writer, Charles Latimer, who decides; in somewhat of a voyeur like manner, to trace the life of Dimitrios from his \\"end\\" in the Bosphorus all the way back to his origin.This novel is chock full of classic personalities.

Were it not for Ambler, James Bond -- and by extension George Smiley, Harry Palmer, and the rest -- would never have seen the Light of Day.Ambler's style is bleak, his characters world-weary and gesture-drawn, sketchy types who steal meekly across the shadows. In the case of this novel, it is Leyden, a Dutch D.P., who finally exits his inner world, from where he draws the mysteries he writes, to enter an outer world just as frenzied. Starting from Turkey, he follows the trail of a nasty man, a killer and schemer named Dimitrios, via the Orient Express and several forays into towns destroyed by the Turks, by the Greeks, by, ultimately, the same History which has subsumed Dimitrios' past.Is Dimitrios a Greek or a Turk? A petty thief, an artist of crime, or a mobster? What Leyden discovers only propels him back into a safe, insulated world: the Britain whose own political and social boundaries will be compromised.From its beginning, &quot;A Coffin on Dimitrios&quot; overtly challenges its reader. Colonel Haki, head of the Turkish secret police, asks Leyden how real mysteries, as opposed to Leyden's inventions, are so banal, so dirty, in the end repetitive, violent, and mindless. A case in point is the murder of Dimitrios, whose drowned body attests to the final end of a daring crook. Leyden is inspired by this real-life happening and tries to chronicle, if not on paper, the life of this character. What he finds are shifting identities, motives, and allegiances, and a glimpse, but only by gun-flash, of a new crime which has legitimized itself, lives in bourgeois suburbs of Paris, and practices its metier through corporations and boards of directors. Rarely do these arch-criminals take matters into their own hands, unless on the eve of their own unmasking.These themes: corporate crime, gritty European locales, and a non-professional hero, were themes Ambler was to use again and again, exploring them from the other side of the law forty years later in The Siege of the Villa Lipp. It is a testimony to his talent and foresight that they were still valid and credible then. A Coffin for Dimitrios delivers, moves with effort, strains palpably to a climax, recontains itself and moves on, while leaving questions which could and can not be recontained. Ambler's definitive work"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Although over-rated and ultimately implausible, this &quot;seminal&quot; thriller begins and ends well (in the realm of crime). The middle (in the realm of espionage) is less satisfying. Dimitrios's career of violence and his connections to a financial cartel are plausible, but that a British professor turned mystery writer could learn so much so easily strains my credulity. That is to say, that his finding the pieces of the puzzle is contrived (and the ending is not very surprising).For me, the &quot;seminal&quot; British spy thriller is John Buchan's _The 39 Steps_. Although episodic and less taut, _Coffin_ contains some vividly and economically drawn characters and credible local color in the ever-seething Balkans."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I read this at the suggestion of a college professor, and was not disappointed.

He soon discovers that his idle exercise has elicited the attention of a mysterious man, who is apparently also interested in the career of this criminal. The path goes back in time to such lurid things as political assassination, white slavery, heroin rings, and blackmail. There is a big surprise late in the book (which shouldn't be much of a surprise at all) and a satisfying ending. While the plot is high on the improbable scale it is considered one of the fathers of the modern spy novel and is worth reading for that reason alone."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I must admit that until two weeks ago, I had never heard of Eric Ambler. I am quite well read and was curious about how I could miss an author that was regularly compared to Graham Greene, one of my all-time favorite authors. While not in the league of Graham Greene, A Coffin for Dimitrios manages to entertain and also show what is wrong with the thrillers that are being written today.Written before the outbreak of the 2nd World War, A Coffin for Dimitrios is an interesting tale about an author who by chance manages to see the body of a dead criminal named Dimitrios. Intrigued by this, the narrator decides to put off writing his next book and instead pursue the murky history of this dead criminal.The Good: the work manages to bring to life much of Eastern Europe, a fascinating land that is often overlooked in thrillers. The inquest into Dimitrios past is quite interesting and hints at the turmoil the region was facing during the interwar years. The writing is crisp and Ambler manages to move the action along with few dull moments.The Bad: While the excitement of finding out who Dimitrios is great, the climax is severely lacking and not very surprising. Also, the narrator is quite lucky on more than one occasion about meeting the right contacts and hearing the right stories. Some of the work seems like a cliche, but then since it was written so long ago, it would not surprise me to find out many have borrowed from Ambler since then.Overall: While the book wont be ever mentioned in the same breath as some of the great thrillers and ruminations on the life of man, it is an enjoyable enough thriller and better than much of what is written today. I look forward to reading more of Ambler's work when time permits it."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"You respect a 1939 Packard as a classic for its pioneering technlogy but you might prefer to drive a new Toyota. I feel the same about this brilliantly innovative 1939 spy thriller. I can see flaws in it which a modern writer would have ironed out. The plot is carried forward by unlikely letters and long speeches at times. Latimer is driven by his need to investigate the career of Dimitrios, and lands in trouble, but, until the taut final scenes in Paris, there seems nothing to compel him to keep going. He lacks plausible motivation. Promising characters in the earlier episodes drop out of sight. The whole thing needs tightening up and editing to bring it up to current standards.The atmosphere of Turkey, the Balkans, Switzerland and Paris in the twenties and thirties is vivdly coveyed and there are patches of wonderful prose like the description of Madame Preveza."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Classic suspense/espionage novel by one of the masters of the genre.A mystery writer becomes enthralled with the career of the mysterious Dimitrios, whose body is discovered in a morgue in Instanbul.

Luckily, both were prolific (especially Greene). While Greene remains popular, I have discovered that Ambler is hard to find in stock at most book stores. This is the best of his I've read yet, one of his great classics. Written and set in pre-WWII in the Balkans and Paris, with a tight, gripping plot of an accidental tourist tracking the past of a notorious villain. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Despite its reputation as a masterpiece of the genre, this is more than just a spy novel. It is part espionage, part murder mystery, part criminal intrigue, and part political allegory. While it succeeds on the first three counts, it fails on the fourth. Fortunately, this failure is easy enough to forgive.The story is taut and engrossing. Ambler skillfully weaves detailed back story and historical context with plot twists and moments of suspense as he pushes his protagonist, Charles Latimer, across interwar Europe in a quest to uncover the mystery of the dead criminal Dimitrios. In the process, Ambler deftly blurs the line between professional espionage and ordinary criminality. As Latimer eventually discovers, Dimitrios's world, like his demise, is sordid and dishonorable. His sins--murder, greed, betrayal--are not new. He is merely fortunate to have been born into a time when the base human instincts he embodies can be so easily rewarded. He is at once an asset and a liability: The same governments that pursue him within their own borders are more than happy to employ him against their rivals. In an amoral world, vices are virtues.It is here that we find Ambler's message: Dimitrios is a product of Europe's political and economic order, and thus a symbol of its moral failings. As one character tells Latimer, \\"Special sorts of conditions must exist for the creation of the special sort of criminal that he [Dimitrios] typified.... [W]hile might is right, while chaos and anarchy masquerade as order and enlightenment, those conditions will obtain.\\"Coming from someone like Ambler, who had grown up in the aftermath of World War I, this is an understandable sentiment. (He would later describe himself as having been a \\"very far left wing socialist\\" during the 1930s.) The attempt to maintain the balance of power in Europe had brought unimaginable slaughter while doing little if anything to change the nature of interstate rivalry in the 1920s and 1930s. In Ambler's Europe, nations pursue their interests by any means necessary, but there seem to be no real victories, only casualties. Thinking back on the saga of Dimitrios, Latimer comes to the conclusion that Good and Evil had become \\"no more than baroque abstractions. Good Business and Bad Business were the elements of the new theology. Dimitrios was not evil. He was logical and consistent; as logical and consistent in the European jungle as the poison gas called Lewisite and the shattered bodies of children killed in the bombardment of an open town. The logic of Michael Angelo's David, Beethoven's quartets and Einstein's physics had been replaced by that of the 'Stock Exchange Year Book' and Hitler's 'Mein Kampf.'\\"But this simplistic dichotomy between the ruthless, capitalist European \\"jungle\\" and some unspoken, though probably Communist, alternative was about to be made obsolete by the very different conflict roiling the Continent. Fascism barely registers in the novel, and plays no role whatsoever in the plot. Indeed, the only mention of Hitler is in the passage above, where Nazism is implicitly equated with capitalism. Thus, there can be no distinction made between Nazi Germany--with its poison gas and the shattered bodies that would be left in its wake--and liberal democracy. Yet in 1939, the year Ambler's novel was published, it was capitalist, democratic Britain that stood alone against Hitler, while Stalin made his separate peace and betrayed the workers of Poland. By the time America and the Soviet Union were drawn into the fight, it would become clear that the great war to be fought was not over capitalism but totalitarianism. Here was real, transcendent Evil in his midst, and Ambler can only lecture us about stock exchanges.At the very least this was a remarkable lack of foresight on Ambler's part. But it's hard to let him off so easily, given his demonstrated acuity on the subject of human nature and his knowledge of European history. One can't help but notice that the reality of the coming conflict is incompatible with the homogeneous and morally equivalent Europe on which his novel (and perhaps his ethos) depends.This is all a shame, but Ambler's aptitude for story-telling more than overcomes these flaws, so it's quite possible to enjoy the story despite them. Even the most politically sensitive should be able to pass over them with a roll of the eyes. If not, there's always Alan Furst."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"An average of four stars for this classic is ridiculous, although today's reading audience, saturated with blood, guts, and improbable plots, may perhaps be forgiven for not recognizing this novel for the masterpiece that it is. Nothing quite like it had been written before. It stands alone in its bleak background rendering of a Europe on the brink of war and, in its characterizations, of the juxtaposition of innocence and evil. Published in 1939 in England as The Mask of Dimitrios, here as A Coffin for Dimitrios, this book set the bar for those -- like le Carre, Deighton, and Furst -- who would follow. It has no hero; it is not a police procedural, an adventure or detective story, or a spy novel: it defies characterization, and therein lies its uniqueness. And its literacy will come as a shock to many of today's readers."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"When I picked up &quot;A Coffin for Dimitrios,&quot; I had no idea that the suspense level of a 60+ year old book would be so high. Needless to say, Ambler's book was a welcome surprise.Charles Latimer is a British writer of detective stories who, pretty much due to boredom, finds himself hanging out in Turkey in the 1930's. While in Turkey, Latimer hears from a Turkish official the story of an elusive, shifty criminal called Dimitrios. Partly to gather material for a new novel, and partly out of personal curiosity, Latimer attempts to trace the movements of Dimitrios during the past several years. In doing so, the writer learns that the career of Dimitrios includes much criminal activity including murder, blackmail, white slavery, and much more. The more Latimer learns, the more he must know. Latimer's journey takes him to many different and dangerous locations as he learns that knowledge of Dimitrios can itself be a very deadly thing.This is the first Eric Ambler book I have read. I hope it is not the last. Ambler has the ability to write about exotic locations and different cultures in a way that makes them come alive. The characters are believable and colorful at the same time, without becoming comic. I think I can honestly say that Ambler packs more suspense in every page than most thriller writers today can place in an entire book. The book is not a flashy story with lots of gimmicks, but a real well-thought out suspense novel that deserves to be read by anyone who enjoys a good suspense story."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"There are some things they just don't do as well as they used to and this book is a prime example.First of all, publishers seem to think that Americans will only read books involving Americans. Who would publish a book that has an expatriate Englishman trying to unearth the secrets of a dead Greek in sites including Turkey, Sofia, Athens, Geneva and Paris. Yet that is a huge part of what makes this book so special. It is a very &quot;continental&quot; tale. For me as a reader, it's the difference between great French cuisine and McDonalds.There's also the inevitable time difference. Even though the book focuses on much of the underbelly of life, it does so with an eloquent voice of its time. It's hardly a cozy, but the suspense is a product of thought and atmosphere - not gadgets and gore.This review is based on the unabridged audiotapes which are a treat with lots of different accents. Since much of the book is told as a series of verbal stories about Dimitrios, it seems all the more appropriate for them to be heard as stories.So, tired of modern cookie cutter mysteries and thrillers? Treat yourself to this classic and be transported to another world."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"A Classic novel, in typical Ambler fashion, an ordinary man, in this case a writer, is drawn into situations for which he is ill prepared. Fascinating characters, many of whom appear in other novels by Ambler. Remember the first time you watched Casablanca; the historical context of the book, the characters, dialogue, and death defying predicaments are remeniscent of that great film. How would you smuggle documents across a hostile border? Look for the sympathetic communist character. He seems to appear in all of Ambler's pre-WWII novels."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"It is a very good refreshing read which keeps you turning pages, however, there is practically no mystery element and some moments which border with unbelievable, otherwise it is simply excellent."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I have read Journey into Fear also written by Eric Ambler which was excellent and looked forward to reading A Coffin for Dimitrios. I was not disappionted.If you want to read a book filled with devious and amoral characters then this is it."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Ambler's novel is a beautiful departure from modern espionage thrillers and 30's pulp. While being a fan of both genres, I was pleasantly absorbed by this fine work which wove together a subtle yet haughty English timbre with a materialist, &quot;lost-generation&quot; kind of bent. As a reader stated above, the characters are wonderful, real yet absurd. The plot roves along with plenty of movement, not action mind you, but movement. This work is not terribly exciting, or overly political, or action packed, or hard-boiled. It falls through the cracks of genre labelling beautifully, and is a fine book in all aspects that a book can be."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I actually reviewed this book below, but wanted to add that the book was made into a good movie in the 1940's starring Peter Lorre titled THE MASK OF DIMITRIOS, now available on video."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Charles Latimer was a lecturer in political economy in England. In his mid-30s he began to write detective stories, and became successful enough to make a new career. While traveling abroad in Turkey he was introduced to the Chief of the Secret Police. Colonel Haki told him about finding a body, and Charles asked to visit the mortuary for the experience. Intrigued by the history of this Dimitrios, Charles decided to follow the trail and act as a detective. Dimitrios escaped Smyrna in August 1922 and went to Sofia, Belgrade, Paris, Lyons, and other places. The police knew of him, but can't prove anything. Then his body was found in Istanbul. Charles Latimer traveled to these places to try to learn something. One unforeseen fact is that it is dangerous for a literary person to get involved with criminals; they don't appreciate the interest shown in them! But a Mr. Peters offered to help him in his research by referring him to a retired businessman in Geneva. Charles Latimer should have found a cause for alarm when told he had valuable information, but didn't know what it was! But he continued his journey without any fear.Chapter IX tells how a spy gained the friendship and confidence of a clerk in a government ministry. The clerk needed the money after he lost at a rigged card game. Peters told how he smuggled heroin to France in a coffin, but that couldn't be done regularly. The end of Chapter XI reveals the secret of Latimer's knowledge. [This is similar to Graham Greene's story \\"The Third Man\\".] Mr. Peters will profit from this knowledge. Their last meeting ends with rough justice. Charles Latimer decides to set his next mystery in an English country village. The ending seems unreal, forced by the need for Latimer's survival."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Not your average 30s spy thriller! Most vintage spy thrillers are in the John Buchan mold, but this one was very different.Just a fun fun book."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"First, the review above is not for &quot;Background to Danger&quot;.&quot;Background&quot; is about a freelance reporter named Kenton who down on his luck agrees against his better judgement (but not financial need) to carry some suspicious papers across an international frontier. The story revolves around the difficulties of eventually delivering the papers.As with all Ambler's books set in pre-WWII Europe its interesting to read the author's explaination of the current world politics when he has no knowledge of the coming war. The plot of this story is actually pretty thin. We've all seen it before. However, the original copywrite is 1934. This must have been pretty heady stuff back then.This is not the best Amber I've read. &quot;A Coffin for Dimetrios&quot; is probably a better place to start with this author."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I read the trilogy in the mid-forties, when these were a new form of suspense story. Ambler was a masterful writer. On re-reading them, however, I think the style is very \\"dated.\\"In my old age I prefer the shorter, cleaner sentences of the top modern writers (from John D. McDonald, Spillane to Michael Connelly). If you haven't read them before, you may love them as a change of pace. A great writer, whose subtle, measured style is simply outdated."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"OK, this is a little creaky for a modern audience- making a guy a professor-turned-mystery-writer and explaining his nosiness with this simply won't fly- but clearly this book is a direct ancestor of the modern political thriller- certainly Graham Greene must have read it before writing \\"The Third Man\\". It's very well done and its picture of 30's Balkan politics is very enjoyable. It's perfect airport reading."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I'm a big fan of the novels by Alan Furst, and he is often compared to Eric Ambler. I purchased A Coffin for Dimitrios because Furst himself recommends it. Sorry. The novels of Furst are far better. By comparison, Ambler's prose lacks color and lyricism. As mystery novels go, this one is okay, but just okay. Lots of plot twists, which are not quite believable. A weak ending."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"A well written, page turner of a mystery that will keep your attention to the end. Foreign intrigue set in the twenties provides the backdrop. It's a shame many current writers do not possess Mr. Ambler's ear for the English language."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"This is my first Ambler novel and I am definitely hooked. The writing style is crisp, the plot development stylish, the characters real, and the novel itself is nicely complex! I liken Ambler to Patricia Highsmith in certain ways, except that I find Ambler's plot lines and characters to be much richer and real-life, without the obvious ethical/moral ambivalence that marks Highsmith's writing.As others have written before me, it is indeed difficult to believe that Ambler wrote this so long ago. At times, the reader feels the era of the 1930s but mostly the story could as easily be set in the modern era, too.This is a great read and one that can go quickly if you have several days to spend with one book. I highly recommend A Coffin for Dimitrios and am looking forward to my next Ambler novel!"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Charles Latimer wears his brain out in British academia, writing three egghead treatises on political science, and takes refuge in murder. Best-selling murder. The success of his detective novels allows him the luxury of travel between World Wars, and in Istanbul, he meets his biggest fan, Col. Haki, the lizardy head of the local secret police, \\"one of the people behind the scenes, if you get me ... There was something about torturing prisoners.\\" Haki is not only a fan, he's an aspiring writer. When Latimer's not sufficiently impressed by the colonel's prose, Haki gives him a crash course in true-life crime on a trip to the morgue to identify the body of master criminal Dimitrios. Birthed in the flames of the sack of Smyrna, Dimitrios has had his hand in political assassination, terrorism, the heroin and slave trade and just about every other shady double-dealing in the region. Latimer can't shake the idea of Dimitrios and decides to investigate the villain's life, following his trail across Europe. I'm glad this wasn't the first Eric Ambler novel I read as it's not a very strong one. The cover shows a rather prissy-looking man reading a newspaper. That's an appropriate image as that's what passes for action in this book. Unlike Ambler's thrilling \\"Background to Danger,\\" much of \\"Dimitrios\\" unfolds in eye-crossing info dumps, dusty research and windy recollections. Lengthy flashbacks don't necessarily prevent an interesting tale, but at the center of the novel is Latimer, whose shoulders are far too round to support much suspense. Latimer is a schlub who doesn't even have the sense to get suspicious while sharing a train compartment on the Orient Express with a watery-eyed fat guy who talks in a funny accent. \\"Latimer thought of his warm bed and wondered if he would catch a cold.\\" He does that a lot. He'd be much more at home writing dry poli-sci textbooks than tear-assing around Europe after sinister underworld denizens. And his investigation leads up to a \\"shocking\\" denouement that some of you reading this have already figured out. At one point, Latimer agonizes, \\"It is such a poor story, isn't it? There is no hero, no heroine; there are only knaves and fools. Or do I mean only fools?\\" It's nice when books review themselves."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"It took a long time to find this book. It's never in used book stores. I finally broke down and bought it online. Good story. Mr. Ambler does fine character development and builds suspense without unnecessary violence or profanity. Following Latimer across Europe in search of Dimitrios was unnerving at times. I don't, however, see how Latimer being the person who runs down Dimitrios' story is 'absurd'. Latimer's interactions with the various people who knew Dimitrios were interesting and moved quite logically. Overall, I'm glad I finally read this classic."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Ambler takes the reader on a voyage of international intrigue, full of exotic locales. What makes this story so engaging and timeless is the attention to character detail. These are not simply people you remember, these are characters you get to know as if they were flesh and blood.\\"The greek was a dark, lean man of middle age with intelligent rather bulbous eyes and a way of bringing his lips together at the end of a sentence as though amazed at his own lack of discretion.\\"Written in the late 1930's, we know something the characters don't: that europe will shortly be embroiled in war. Somehow though, I don't think it matters to some of them: they inhabit the shady underside of society, one that does not depend on the smooth functioning of the political infrastructure. In fact, I'm sure they would thrive in the impending chaos.\\"I have always been discreet. I am not interested in the real names of my friends.\\"A classic in the thriller genre, this stands up well many decades after it was written. It's not merely a pioneer in its field, it's actually still today an exceptional read. Good writing is good writing and then, as now, requires attention to detail. When an author combines adept skill with assiduous effort, the results can be riveting, as is the case with A Coffin For Dimitrios.\\"The wallpaper depicted a trellis supporting a creeping plant, a number of purple discs and some shapeless pink objects of a vaguely clinical character.\\""},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"For the sake of accuracy, the version of the book under review is the 1976 hardback reprint (by American Reprint Co.) of an Alfred A. Knopf edition, presumably the one copyright 1943, of A Coffin for Dimitrios. There is no dust cover; the hardback cover contains only the title and the author's name on a plain, light-grey binding. It is a well-made, though modest volume: serviceable but no collector's item.There are many excellent reviews on Amazon of this outstanding early spy novel in a paperback version. Please read them to enjoy much literate and amusing opinion about it. Suffice it to say that I, like the others, thoroughly enjoyed it.I reveled in the very correct demeanor, but delightfully ironic language, of the narrator, who tells the story of Latimer (note play on \\"Ambler\\"), an obscure professor at a minor English university turned writer of detective stories, \\"... one of the shamefaced few who could make money at the sport.\\" One occasionally emerges from following along into the accelerating gyre into which Latimer allows himself to be led, stopping while coming up for air to reflect on what great sport the author is having with the reader, leading one into ever more improbable, but thoroughly absorbing adventures. What a tour de force, that he can carry off this wild and exuberant trail of strange encounters, yet maintain his very British sang froid. One certainly wonders why seek, at such peril, for Dimitrios, who takes ever more formidable shape, despite being dead, apparently, almost from the outset. The author nails together the coffin, plank by plank, but who will wind up in it?"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"A writer of detective fiction becomes fascinated by the sketchy details surrounding the life of a real criminal and decides to learn the truth for himself as a professional, intellectual exercise. He will learn far more than he bargained for.

He is invited to view the body of a criminal that the police have been looking for for fifteen years. But no one knows much about him; even what he looks like. The writer travels around Europe trying to track down information on this man.How could you not like a man who will do anything to get money, and I do mean anything:-Kill a moneylender and implicate your partner leaving him holding the bag.-Attempt an assassination of a democratically elected prime minister.-Bring drugs in major quantities into France, and then rat out all your partners when the heat is on.-Compromise a government official to get secret military plans, and leave him to commit suicide from humiliation and embarrassment.-Murder an associate and make it look like it's you so as to throw off the police and interpol.And these are just the nice things that he did. Forget about the number of woman who he took money from and then left. The people who were hooked on cocaine and heroin to support his life style.The ending is almost funny, but it does leave you with some things to ponder, such as what would you do to stay alive and make money when you have no country and no loyalties. (To really enjoy this book you have to keep reminding yourself that it was written in 1938, before the beginning of WW2.)"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"One of the absolute best and most originalcrime/espionage novels. Ambler creates fascinatingcharacters and wonderful color. The plot isintricate and nicely paced. Ambler is one of thefew people in this genre who actually writesgood sentences, in the way one might say of thatF. Scott Fitzgerald. To be sure, he is not quitein that league, but he remains leagues above the norm.The book also manages to be something very unique:a form of popular entertainment that has a serioussocio-political point to it. This subtext is wovenseamlessly into the narrative so it never sounds likepreaching...at times I wish it was actually a littleless subtle. All in all, an wonderful book (especiallygrand if you can read it on a train travellingacross Europe--a feeling it is highly evocative of)."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"All of Eric Ambler's novels are worth reading, if you like the genre, and Coffin for Dimitrios is one of his best. The story is compelling and stangely believable and very enjoyable. Ambler was an engineer b/f turning to fiction and many of his books draw upon this expertise.He is right up there with Graham Green's and Somerset Maugham's thrillers.In his &quot;Cause for Alarm&quot; if you can get it as an audio book it will provide superb pleasure to overcome eight hours of driving!"},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"Slow paced and calm by today's thriller standards, but I was fascinated with the European illegal drug industry."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"The book jacket references that Ambler is the precursor to the works of people like Len Deighton and Robert Ludlum.

Most reviewers here hail the book as a \\"classic\\" and magnificent thriller, and many seem to feel that since Ambler is the \\"father of the modern spy thriller\\" they are duty-bound to beatify this work. I'll take a modern spy author any day. True, the plot moves steadily forward, the characters are fascinating and well-drawn, and the descriptions of pre-war Central Europe are delicious. But the book seems to move like a train -- you get on, you look out the window at the passing landscape, and then you get off. There was little if any excitement; the suspense was tepid; the plot turned on convenient contrivances aimed only at enabling the author to keep the book moving. The ending, to me, was naive and left me saying: \\"Is that all there is???\\" Like I say, in the face of all the rave reviews, I must be missing something."},{"Title":"A Coffin for Dimitrios","review":"I read in a piece on Ian Fleming, Eric Ambler's claim that \\"Ian Fleming should be read as literature.\\" The writer of the piece then added that this was high praise since, \\"Eric Ambler may be the greatest thriller novelist of them all, with A COFFIN....his finest.\\" So I had to check COFFIN out. And it was not even close to the finest thriller I've ever read. The plot is thin, and strung together. Granted, the writing itself is good, but it didn't accumulate into a satisfying whole. Not nearly.

What wasn't noted is that the illustrations are also not present in the online version to which you get access by purchasing the paperback, and that several pages are for no apparent reason blank - which makes reading the entire text online problematic.Save your money.

It got very heavy on travelogue and way too much on the poilitics of the region. These boring passages only accentuated the preposterous situations the protagonist got in and out of.I did like Neal Carey and some of his support team. Mr. Winslow's writing style was fine and I will try another Neal Carey, but will make certain it takes place in the USA.This could be an enjoyable series and lead character, but the setting for this book just bored me beyond words.

Saying that all pregnancies are different and that juggling two (or more) kids is a challenge isn't exactly earth shattering news. Very few of the subjects in this book are really explored in depth. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is like something you'd expect from a magazine. It hits on several good topics but doesn't really say a lot about any of them. I got more out of re-reading the books I had with my first pregnancy. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't really think it's worth the money."},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"I thought this book was reassuring and informative. It's been 5 years since my last pregnancy, so I wanted a \\"refresher\\" book and a book that commented on second pregnancies and how the first child feels. I thought there was some good information about preparing your first child. The section on working moms was nice too.I disagree with some of the other reviews that say the author is pessimistic about raising 2 kids. I did not get that feeling from her. Yes there were comments in the book that things will get more complicated, but that is, of course, TRUE. I thought the author had good information about juggling the pregnancy and the newborn period, while also having a toddler/school age child on your hands.Let's face it, most of these books all have information in them that are common sense and that most of us know anyway. The nice thing about the book, is that it is reassuring to just hear another person talk about the things that you're thinking of, questioning, and worrying about.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"I was not happy with this book. I did not think this book gave a very positive view of parenting two children. It seemed to be very pessimistic - instead of giving helpful hints on how to juggle everything, it talked about how difficult it was. The comments from various people all seemed to be complaints, not tips or hints to help othersin the same situation. I will be exchanging this book for one of the other ones - it was depressing!"},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"Not only is this negative about being a parent for the second time it's very anti-breastfeeding and anti-natural birth.

In the breastfeeding vs. formula section she completely fails to mention that breastmilk is full of nutrients that cannot be duplicated by formula. I'm not a breastfeeding fanatic but the book was in no way even handed with the way that it was treated.The entire book is very passive aggressive and at one point made me feel like I was being a bad mom, until I snapped out of it. This is what she says about choosing a nurse-midwife. \\"If you think not using all the technology available would represent poor care of your unborn child, then choosing a midwife is probably not advised.\\" pg. 25I will be returning it for something a little more fairly presented."},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"This book was about what I'd expect from a magazine; not much in depth information, and not many creative ideas for dealing with subsequent pregnancies/children. (This book isn't just about your second pregnancy; it also addresses third and fourth, etc.) It needs an update from the 1995 publishing date; apparently at that time there was no chickenpox vaccine. I rolled my eyes at the authors matter-of-fact statement that women have a 50-50 chance of having a girl or boy. Tell that to the family of 7 sisters that lived up the street from me when I was a kid."},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"I decided to give this book the benefit of the doubt anyways even though the reviews weren't great. The testimonials were interesting but not much else. And I don't usually write reviews but I had to chime in because: CAREFUL with the medical info in this book! It seemed outdated and erroneous in more than one section. I have gestational diabetes and the information she gives in that section was flat out wrong. You don't have to give yourself insulin shots anymore (there are pills) and sometimes it can't be controlled with a very strict diet (because of genetic predisposiiton). Also it made it seem like epidurals are some sort of amazing new technology...uhh welcome the future, lady?! It really made me question the validity of the other information in the book.All in all it felt like a bunch of anecdotal information threaded together and not backed up by much recent fact or research. And hey, I can get that kind of info on the internet for free!"},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"I bought this book when I was expecting child #2 a couple years ago and was surprised it was essentially a rehash of common pregnancy issues, which I had already learned about while expecting child #1. I would have liked it to address more fully issues of a second pregnancy, instead of just touching on such issues, and discussing medical problems that are already in books I read the first time around and still had laying around. I didn't pick this book up when I was expecting baby #3 because it was just not very helpful. I don't even loan this book out to my expecting friends.Too bad, as a good book that really gets down and dirty regarding parenting while pregnant, managing a pregnancy when one already has children and how labor may vary for a subsequent pregnancy, etc, would be really valuable to a lot of mamas. I volunteer for a mother's organization, and that's one of the main questions I get... how am I going to manage being pregnant this time? What is L&D; going to be like (which it did touch on, but not to a lot of depth) .... and having a good resource I could point mothers to would be great. But this is not that resource."},{"Title":"Your Second Pregnancy: What to Expect This Time","review":"This is a great book about being pregnant for the second (or third, etc.) time.

Both books I've read do give you good to know info about being pregnant the second time, but not the positive, \\"It's so great with two,\\" I was hoping for. I feel like it covered most basic questions with some good tips here and there, but never a \\"go ahead, two is so much better than one, you can do it\\" at all.

Katie Tamony's approach to becoming a second-time mom is extremely reassuring and confidence inspiring."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"Take a trip into the wonderful world of Randy. Henry Flesh allows the reader to experience the life of Randy, a gay erotic masseur who is drawn to abusive men. The reader is introduced, in amazingly haunting detail, to Randy's lovers past and present. Even Randy's memories of the evil pedophile Mr.Hewitt is so interesting that one finds it hard to put the book down. Randy's client Graham Mason is a deliciously demonic and skillfull torturer. We see Randy in the worlds of his youth, drugged insanity, hanging with the drag queens, AIDS (described by Flesh as &quot;the sweetness&quot;) and even (Surprise!) sobriety. I took this book everywhere I went until I had finished it. I felt as if I were experiencing Randy's life and living in New York City's East Village. &quot;Massage&quot; is extremely well written, Flesh has a way of making the most despicable characters some of your favorites and Randy is just plain loveable - I couldn't help wanting to just give him a hug."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"As do the stories of Salinger, Steinbeck, and the plays of Tennessee Williams, Flesh's Massage speaks through its ability to enable the reader to identify deeply with lost innocence, with corruption and with that which remains incorruptible, to open doors wide to illusions, to that place we see but cannot penetrate. Although Massage is set in an underworld that is fascinating and richly detailed in and of itself, even down to the subtleties of speech of very odd, though familiar characters...we are drawn into this world to understand what is missing...not simply to revel in the bizarre, the fascinating, the richness of &quot;oddity&quot; (which would be a more obvious, though hardly insignificant accomplishment) but to see beyond into emptiness, into what is longed for. That, to me, is what makes it worth it. Yes, this book is all that!The beauty and simplicity of Randy's yearning mixed with his unsettling passivity, his pathology, draws us into Massage from the start. In the end, we are disturbed and unsettled by his journey...but richer for having gone there, for having clearly understood that what can seem foreign is only so on the surface, and is really quite familiar to all from a certain point of view, startlingly so. The characters, ranging from the horrifying to the hilarious, seem oddly connected with each other, as if a projection of Randy's, Holden Caulfield-like. I came away feeling like a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; as the characters tried to relate through a profound sense of alienation, overcoming pain by eroticizing it or &quot;making it feel 'good'&quot;...drawing out a sweet, even &quot;innocent&quot; connection at best and bitter emotional violence at worst. Even so, the deluded, &quot;lost&quot; feeling of this world engendered a sense of muted anxiety, a dreamlike quality to the day-to-day existence which allowed the richness of perception found in dreams to creep in and underpin the events. The narrative style has an angelic, Cheever-like presence. I was constantly reminded of 19th century novels, particularly of Dostoevsky's, where one is reassured by the narrator's voice of some sweetness, an unidentifiable, subtle presence...trust, a reassurance found in tone. This is not to say that the whole thing doesn't have a dark sensibility...the ending is quite shocking!Massage is unexpected in many ways and deceptive in that it delivers on many levels. Overall, it is enjoyable, challenging, frustrating, shocking, amusing, moving, reassuring and unsettling. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"Massage is an incisive, raw, edgy and very gritty novel. Flesh never compromises his characters actions or the sexual relations that exist between them. The novel is full of larger than life, colourful and controversial characters - gym boys, drag queens etc. all helping paint a startling picture of life in inner city Manhattan and also helping to present an incredibly compassionate portrait of the lower east side gay community.Although at times the dialogue appears stiff and stilted, don't let this detract you from reading this novel. The issues raised here are what are important: Flesh raises the question of what constitutes socially deviant behaviour and the consequences of the casting off of ones sexual repression. Don't let the sexual explicitness put you off reading this novel either because the central character Randy takes us on an interesting journey. We witness his growth and are with him as he battles the interior demons of his past and comes to term with his situation in life.Often funny and incredibly heart rendering, Massage is certainly not the best novel I've read about gay Manhattan and the individual's voyage of self discovery. However, it is certainly one of the most frank and honest accounts to be published recently."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"&quot;Massage's&quot; prose is crystal clear, sparse and vividly evocative through it's precisely selected detail; it's seemingly effortless style and selective focus reminded me of the poignant clarity of Camus. Without a trace of didacticism, Flesh draws psychological and cultural connections that ring true. Connections that are unfortunately missing from most contemporary fiction. This author respects his reader. His main character, Randy, makes his way through the pages like one of Hardy's protagonist. I found &quot;Massage&quot; engrossing and moving in surprising ways."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"This novel blew me away. I'm a straight woman and yet I found this prose so sensual and engaging. Flesh -- like his name says -- really understands the workings and desires of the flesh. a must read. He's truly original as a stylist, as well - I can't wait to read his next novel!"},{"Title":"Massage","review":"I have to admit that when a friend recommended Massage, I was a little leary of the subject matter. But 50 pages into it, I was absolutely hooked and literally could not put the book down. Modern fiction, especially the stuff that gets called &quot;edgy,&quot; has an agonizing sameness that forced me to lose interest years ago. Flesh's craft is impeccable and his grasp of character is absolutely masterful. I want more!"},{"Title":"Massage","review":"Henry Flesh's Massage is about an erotic, intoxicating game of Russian roulette. The single bullet is AIDS or otherwise eerily named &quot;the sweetness.&quot; Flesh should be commended for his bravery to venture untrodden territory thereby creating a masterpiece.

The pages turned themselves despite the unseamly dreams that the book was provoking.

It feels like a documentary of degradation. I found myself at times just not liking this book, just hating it. But then realizing that it was the not the book that bothered me but that the pain is so truly depicted that I couldn't bear to look at it. So, why read it? Because there are real people here brought to life as only fiction can."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"I started to review 'Michael', the new novella from 1999 Lambda Literary Award winner Henry Flesh, but I could only compare it unfavorably to the novel for which he won the award - the refreshingly brutal and extra-creepy 'Massage'. 'Michael' is, sadly, poorly realized and the illustrations sucked. So, I changed horses.I reveled in the sordid pleasures of 'Massage', admiring especially its anti-feel-good attitude and unhappy ending. Despite a gravity almost automatically conferred on gay writing by the AIDS experience, there is a preponderance of gay fiction that's merely &quot;uplifting&quot; - smarmy stuff really not far removed from Gordon Merrick's jock-busting romances of the 1970's. Flesh's work is a welcome antidote that makes you feel like you've been up all night, chain-smoking and chewing the inside of your lip. Having AIDS or a horrifying childhood (the raw materials for so much gay writing) rarely makes you a better, more spiritually aware person. I'd say it more often makes you bitchy, confused, and depressed. So too are the characters that inhabit 'Massage'. There's no room here for plot synopsis, but be assured that barging selfishly around within its covers - and worthy of your love - are hustlers, 12-Steppers (the AA meetings had me howling), dirty old men, drug-blasted queens, and plenty of freaky sex. Flesh's writing is as black as your unfaithful lover's heart, but sensitive and true. His character's joys, like ours, are fleeting and compromised, their failings life-long.Love and life are messy and unsafe. Henry Flesh won't let you forget that. Read Massage."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"Henry Flesh's MASSAGE is quite a worthy read in that it does reflect the reality of clannish big-city gay lifestyles with all the harsh edges. I didn't feel like jumping out a window (as I did after reading Holleran's THE BEAUTY OF MEN or his GROUND ZERO) because Henry Flesh gives us the beautiful Randy to dream along with as he experiments with sex, drugs, and self-psychotherapy through personal writing. Just as reality is one of this novel's merits, the very same reality is unsettling to those of us who need to escape from the &quot;sweetness&quot; (one of Flesh's nicknames for AIDS) that is closing in us. Curiously refreshing was the subtle manipulation of Flesh's progression of character evolution. I found myself switching sides and opinions about the other characters just as Randy does and as we all do as our lives progress. Enjoy it with a Mona Lisa smile."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"I read &quot;Massage&quot; after I learned that it had been nominated for a Lammy, and although at times it disturbed and upset me, I was in the end greatly moved, in a way that I haven't been by a contemporary novel in a very long time, probably since the early '60s when I first became acquainted with the works of Hubert Selby, Jr. and John Rechy. This is a book that must be read. I hope it acquires a very large readership."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"I'm a latecomer to this wonderful book and cannot believe I let almost a year go by without reading it. Flesh is a master of style and emotion. The book reads like a Nineteenth Century tragedy set in the contemporary East Village. As we fall deeper into Randy's world of hustlers, pimps, ailing writers, and drag queens--some who are downright despicable people--we cannot help but be captivated by their stories and by Randy's struggle to make sense of the decaying world around him. This is a book about the devastation of AIDS, but it's also a book about the often impossible search for love, and it is that universality that makes it utterly heartbreaking. I've been told the book is up for a Lammy award this year--it would have my vote."},{"Title":"Massage","review":"There's a difference between crafting a dark and compelling story - and patching together a dark and sloppy one. Flesh stresses detail where it is not needed and omits it from verse that needs it most. His characters are lifeless, selfless and boring (perhaps that's the way they should be) but his dialogue is dreadful. If another character was quoted saying &quot;I...I...I don't...It's just...,&quot; I think I would have died. Characters did things so uncharacteristic it was comical. Main character Randy was &quot;shocked&quot; at nearly everything said or done to him and was, in fact, so shocked that he needed to pull out a cigarette at every turn. Yawn. Granted, I couldn't put the book down because I had grown to hate the people in it so, wishing they'd all die so I could forget about them and the time I wasted reading this book. By the grace of God, I was granted my wish. Save your money.

I would not call it \\"from zero\\" or for absolute beginners. This book assumes that you know how to read music, know where to put your fingers on the recorder for different notes, and probly that you are learning under a music teacher. For the self-taught, true novice like me, this book is useless. I ordered \\"Fun with the Recorder\\" by MelBay publications and learned how to read the music, where to place my hands for the notes, and learned one note at a time-- building. Now, as a second book of learning, I can appreciate this book, but certainly not from the beginning."},{"Title":"The Recorder from Zero: A Method for Beginners on Soprano Recorder, Vol. 1","review":"I've been using the revised edition of Volume 1 for almost a year now in my private teaching and in a University setting. Most spectacularly, I used it as an 'introduction to the recorder' for a music education class earlier this year.One of the commonest complaints I hear from music education students is that they don't know where to turn to find good repertoire when they want to introduce recorders into their classrooms. Students have been singing Hot Cross Buns since Grade 1, and are easily bored with it by the time they're in Grade 4! With Fischer's book, teachers can use authentic recorder material that follows the same sequence of notes as the earliest songs use, and a large class can be divided up to include percussion and movement.At the moment I'm introducing it to students in a Kod&aacute;ly Level 1 summer course, and the students are having a blast. After 30 minutes this afternoon, four very insecure recorder players were performing 6 Renaissance dances comfortably and musically.Volume 1 is a must-have for any music teacher who deals with recorders, and I can't wait for Volume 2."},{"Title":"The Recorder from Zero: A Method for Beginners on Soprano Recorder, Vol. 1","review":"I bought both volumes of this book for my daughter then 8 based on recommendations (...). I was intrigued by the idea of starting her with \\"real\\" music from the get-go.The books were a great success - it was a pleasure to work through the lessons with her and now she eagerly plays everything she can in both books.The books themselves are beautifully printed and easy to read. They are mostly just the music with little or no text interspersed among the pieces. This means that a beginner will need some additional help with some of the basics - holding the recorder, breathing, basic fingering, etc. There are plenty of method books that cover those details, but no other books I know of give you so much interesting music. It's easy for beginners to get the feel for what early music and recorder playing is really like.I strongly recommend these books. If you are an adult beginner with access to a teacher then I suggest you look for volume 1 for the alto recorder, if and when it is available. Altos are easier and more fun to play than soprano recorders if your hands are bigger than an 11-year old's."},{"Title":"The Recorder from Zero: A Method for Beginners on Soprano Recorder, Vol. 1","review":"Inspiration is a great motivator, to practice and to really play well. Charles Fischer, himself a performer of the recorder, has compiled such a beautiful selection of Medieval and Renaissance pieces,in characteristically eerie modes, that even beginners may be excited by truly beautiful music. This book is organized in step-by-step progression, from simple drills which very quickly graduate to really nice music, using simple finger combinations to more progressive, adding rhythm drills and theoretical instruction. Fischer has mastered the art of instructing with beauty, and artfully combined this with pure common sense. To combine artistic instruction with pedagogy is a challenge, indeed, and Fischer has done a beautiful job. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Early Music. --Drina Brooke, recorder instructor/performer, author, trained with internationally-acclaimed Eva Legene"},{"Title":"The Recorder from Zero: A Method for Beginners on Soprano Recorder, Vol. 1","review":"In praise of Recorder from Zero, the copia of authentic music was very stimulating and kept me busy for hours; Unfortunately, I think this text suffers from two flaws:As a method book, it is pedagogically useless unless accompanied by lessons: What little instruction is included, near the frontispiece, is vague to the point of nonexistence; further, it would have been stimulating--considering the nature of the collection--to have some brief biographical and historical information about the pieces, especially considering that several composers (Praetorius, Gervaise, etc.) are featured several times. This lack of text, pedagogical or otherwise, makes the book feel unfinished.Further, there are no long pieces included in the book, leaving the beginner without much of a sense of repertoire. The longest pieces offered are motets which take about forty seconds to play in allegro tempo, and only three or four in that category--the rest are extremely brief.In a word, then, the text feels incomplete. I will not be buying volume 2."},{"Title":"The Recorder from Zero: A Method for Beginners on Soprano Recorder, Vol. 1","review":"I'm halfway through, so I guess I can review it now. This method may not be for everyone, but it is perfect for me. I am working by myself, and I do have to supplement this method in order to use it successfully, but I love the results. Each lesson is a challenge initially, but is easily mastered. Lets look at some of the ways this method may differ from others.1) The book is based on music from the Medieval and Renaissance eras. There are a few folk songs and the like which sound familiar, but for the most part the music is ancient.2) There is no attempt to teach all the notes on the recorder quickly, rather the notes are introduced slowly, when they are needed to play a particular piece. Notes that are never used in the music are never introduced.3) While notes may be introduced slowly, complex rhythms are introduced earlier than they are in most other methods. This works fine for me.4) There is no attempt to introduce every single key and obscure fingering that one can use on the recorder. The method sticks to the main keys which are most natural to the recorder. This is authentic for the music that the method is centered on. Rather than trying to introduce distant (unnatural?) keys, the author tries to get students to think in terms of \\"modes,\\" the ancient musical system used in medieval times. I think this is a very cool way to introduce beginners to musical theory.5) If you have a teacher to teach you this method, you are very much in luck. The method is organized mostly as duets and rounds. If your teacher can play the more complex part, you can play beautiful music from the first day. If you play by yourself mostly, it would really be good to get someone to play the other parts occasionally, so you can hear how good you sound.6)While most of the pieces are quite short, many of them fit together nicely into \\"suites.\\" I usually play continuously for 30 minutes or so every day, hesitating only to turn a page.I've already bought volume 2.After you finish this method, you will be ready to quit your job, get into your time machine, and head back to 12th century Europe.

Strip mining, reading and nature poetry are some of the subjects covered in this short collection. The most important essay, however, is Discipline and Hope, in which Berry argues that we must adjust our thinking about the planet and our interactions with it. Berry asks basic questions that point to many of the fundamental problems we confront today. How can we be truly free if we depend on others for almost everything of value -- food, clothing, shelter? Why do we surrender ourselves to specialists whose great achievements are usually abstract and aimed at making us dependent upon impersonal schemes? How can we live honorably if we do not honor our neighbors or creation by treating both with respect?Berry is trying to temper the fast-paced, profit obsessed society we have become by asking questions about the quality of our lives. Why do those who call themselves conservative fail to see the importance of conserving the health of our families, our land, our communities? Are they driven solely by profit and power? How is it that &quot;compassionate&quot; liberals pursue policies that would make us all dependent on government, thereby forcing us as a society to surrender our self reliance and our dignity? Are they concerned about us our their own power base? If we reduce all of life to commodities and measure all worth by what is of value in the short-term, we will surely continue to squander the most valuable parts of life and creation.Berry argues for a better way. Learn to be truly self reliant. Have the patience to do good work and honor the land on which you live. Care about your community as much as you care about your pocketbook. Grow your own food. Buy from local providers. Learn the wisdom of everyday farmers and craftsmen that has been forgotten and derided in recent decades. If this sounds quaint, well, think again. Our society was built in large measure by men and women who respected and understood nature. If we lose that part of our heritage, Berry argues, we risk not only losing our past, but also our future. Berry knows of that which he preaches -- he is a farmer as well as a writer and has spent decades studying the example of those who have not forgotten that America has always had a loyal opposition that sought to temper industrialization and commercial interests for the sake of the permanent things conservatives like Russell Kirk and T. S. Eliot once fought to preserve."},{"Title":"A Continuous Harmony: Essays Cultural and Agricultural (A Harvest book, HB 301)","review":"This book should be read by every person concerned with the state of the natural world and the place that Homo Sapiens occupies within it. I was particularly struck by Wendell Berry's discussion of mankind's relationship with \\"nature\\". Mr. Berry says \\"I begin, then, with the assumption that perhaps the greatest disaster of human history is one that happened to or within religion: that is the conceptual division between the holy and the world, the excerpting of the Creator from the creation.\\" As he then explains, this leads to mankind's current attitude toward all life on Earth: \\"A man could aspire to heaven with his mind and his heart while destroying the earth, and his fellow men, with his hands.\\" There are many other important ideas in this book, but to me, the necessity for an attitude of reverence for this world that we all live in is the linchpin of Mr. Berry's philosophy.I am also impressed with how prescient Mr. Berry was. This book was published in 1970, but his description of the movements of that era could easily be applied to today's struggles with environmental and social causes. In his famous essay \\"Think Little\\", Mr. Berry accurately dissects the various social justice movements of his time. \\"For it seems to me that the Civil Rights Movement and the Peace Movement, as popular causes in the electronic age, have partaken far too much of the nature of fads....As causes they have been undertaken too much in ignorance; they have been too much simplified; they have been powered too much by impatience and guilt of conscience and short-term enthusiasm, and too little by an authentic social vision and long-term conviction and deliberation.\\"I strongly urge everyone who is concerned with the environment and other social justice issues to read this short gracefully written book (less than 200 pages) that is dense with cogent ideas for our times."},{"Title":"The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath","review":"The main problem of writing a biography of Sylvia Plath is the roadblocks that are constantly being thrown out by her husband's controlling estates. Unlike other biographers, Hayman has managed to be honest and critical about who Plath is, and how she was treated by people around her, including her husband and his mistress. Hayman addresses critically and honestly Plath's husband controlling nature. He controlled her life when she was alive, but worse still he controlled her totally after she died. There are many crucial works and correspondences of Plath that were destroyed, or mysteriously disappeared (presumable by her husband). Hayman argues that these materials are extremely valuable to understand more Plath's life as suicide."},{"Title":"The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath","review":"Ronald Hayman provides excellent insight into Sylvia Plath's life, effectively using much analysis of her poetry to tell her biography."},{"Title":"The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath","review":"Hayman is part of the first wave of Plath biographies.

It mirrors the title of \\"The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath\\".

It follows a very formulaic style to the point where as a reader, I was able to predict what he was going to say next.It was a very good book nevertheless and I do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath","review":"This is one dark book,it definitely not for light reading.

Method and Madness is the definitive, though somewhat dated bio on Plath. Also enjoyed Lover of Unreason."},{"Title":"Vampires Overhead","review":"I admit it- I generally loathe vampire books. Anne Rice, Twilight, etc, are all garbage in my book. To wit, the idea of a ravenous, blood thirsty semi-cannibal as a sexy creature of the night is simply a ridiculous subject for a book and generally ludicrous idea overall. This novel, however, written by a guy who's basically an unknown pulp writer from the 30's and takes vampires in an entirely different direction. The vampires in this book descend upon an unsuspecting Earth in hordes, ostensibly from space, draining every drop of moisture from people while setting everything ablaze. Vampires Overhead is really more post-apocalyptic than vampire novel as the vampires are totally alien creatures. As such, if you're looking for weak soft-core porn involving pasty faced Victorian-era Eastern Europeans, look elsewhere. If you want a great account of a fanciful apocalypse, definitely give this a read."},{"Title":"Vampires Overhead","review":"Vampires is told from the point-of-view of \\"Garry\\" Garrington, a former soldier in the British army who finds himself one of the last remaining humans in England. The story is set at the time of the book's writing, with plenty of British references and attempts at dialect. Not much is known about the author Alan Hyder; some people assume he was from Jamaica.At the beginning of the novel, Garry meets up with Bingen, an old army comrade who takes him over to his place of employment for old times sake, which happens to be brewery. Needless to say, they get plenty toasted on the proceeds of the vats, reminiscing about the good old days. When the brewery owner makes an unannounced appearance, the night watchman, also a former military man, locks them in an underground tunnel until the owner leaves. They sleep-off the drunk, unaware what's happen above them.Both men wake the next morning to find themselves still locked in the tunnel, with a bat the size of a pit bull hanging onto the outside of the gate. While they try to figure out what to do, more large bats show up, all of whom are trying to get to Garry and his friend. And the bats don't leave.When Garry and Bingen are finally able to leave the tunnel they discover the city of London has burned to the ground. The few bodies they can find are all drained of blood. It seems the bats are vampires and humans their prey. The bats also produce fire, but they themselves are immune to flames. They may not be all that large, but they have appeared overnight all over the earth in swarms. One giant vampire bat can be a nuisance, but swarms in the thousands, if not millions, are genocide.The first part of the book consists of Garry and Bingen scouring the remains of London, trying to find any supplies or survivors. They eventually locate an 18-year-old-woman named Janet who was shielded from the holocaust under a load of asbestos tile on a barge . Here's where the real tension begins, since Garry is concerned for her safety, whereas Bingen has something else on his mind. Soon, appearances of the vampire bats are becoming less and less common, although the three survivors constantly scan the clouds in expectation of a swarm.The giant vampire bats are a curiosity and the drive behind the novel. Hyder didn't do a lot of research into where they came from or how they function. We're told the bats have produced the heat which burned out civilization, but never do we see their incendiary arts in operation. They function in the daytime, although bats are nocturnal. The vampire bats can only be killed by decapitation, but a silver blade isn't needed. How they came to be in our world is not explained either, but Garry thinks they might have something to do with a comet which blazes in the evening sky.What few other survivors the trio locate when they leave London don't offer much in the way of help. Examining the ruins of a village, Garry finds a mad British office worker, complete with bowler hat, on his way to work. After settling into the remains of a remote village, they encounter a drunken tramp who proves to be an antagonist wanting Janet for himself.Hyder's descriptions of the world in ashes proved to be a glimpse of WW2. Although the book at times reads like an HG Wells imitation , the basic plot is quite unique. And this is why it is remembered years after the initial publication.(From my Blog:www.zyhq.blogspot.com)"},{"Title":"Vampires Overhead","review":"I have taken up the Wagner challenge. In 1983 Karl Edward Wagner put together a now-famous list of the 39 best horror novels of all time in three categories. One by one I am obtaining and reading these novels, many of which are very rare. \\"Vampires Overhead\\" made the list as one of the top 13 science fiction horror novels of all time. You know what? I think in this case Karl may have been right.This is a post-apocalyptic science fiction story in the vein of Shiel's \\"The Purple Cloud\\", and H.G. Well's \\"The War of the Worlds\\", and I believe that in sheer narrative drive and story interest it will hold its own with either of them.From out of the heavens a cloud of billions of creatures like enlarged vampire bats descends on the English countryside and swarms over all living creatures they encounter, sucking them dry of blood and leaving behind leathery, mummy-like corpses. But an even more antisocial trait is a kind of luminescent energy that they emit that eventually sets flammable materials - like the walls of houses - on fire. London is converted overnight into a flaming mausoleum.The story follows two ex-soldiers, Garry and Bingen, who were hiding in a gated tunnel leading to an old disused loading dock along the river to avoid discovery by the brewery manager. The vampire creatures throng the gate, but can't get to them through the bars. Garry and Bingen are almost starved and broiled from the heat emitted by the burning buildings around them before the vampires end their vigil and fly away in a vast cloud.The two begin a nerve-shattering journey across a landscape of flaming wreckage, desparately hiding from swarms of the vampires who periodically fly overhead. The desolation, and it effect on the psyche of the travellers, is evocatively protrayed. Garry and Bingen at first have no idea where to go - their main motivation is to avoid the vampires and to discover other living human beings. Finding food is also a challenge since almost all of the buildings and their contents have been charred to ashes.Things become more interesting upon their discovery of another survivor - an attractive girl of 18 whose father, a barge master, hid her under a load of asbestos boards before succumbing himself to an attack of the vampires. (Hyder pulls a one-up on Wells in introducing a love interest). As can be expected, a slow-burning but building rivalry develops between Garry and Bingen when Janet joins their expedition.Much of the book describes their apocolyptic jouney across this desolate landscape, occasionally encountering either critically injured or insane survivors who do no more than deepen their horror and depression. They learn how to effectively fight and defeat the vampires, although only Garry has sufficient courage to stand up to them when they attack. Bingen abandons the other two in shame after displaying cowardice to Janet during an attack of the vampires.Garry eventually leads Janet to his destination - a group of summer cabins adjoining natural caves in a nearby hillside. They take up residence there as help mates and experience a series of unpleasant but well-actualized adventures including Garry's nightmare fight with a vampire in a water well, and the duel to the death with a powerfully built, brutal vagrant named Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes has fallen in with them and understandably covets Janet, who to all appearances may be the world's last surviving woman.Garry and Janet seek out and find Bingen, who unfortunately has taken up residence curled up next to the liquor barrels in the basement of an abandoned drinking establishment and is now addicted to spirits. The rivalry for Janet continues once the three are re-united, and upon her selection of Garry as the man of her choice, Bingen goes off the deep end. After a drinking binge, he takes advantage of an injury to Garry to abduct Janet, carries her to his watering hole and has his way with her (as he terms it, \\"sharing the salvage\\"). This leads to the final, fatal encounter between Garry and Bingen.\\"Vampires Overhead\\" has every bit of the page-turning, can't-put-it-down intensity of a Dan Brown novel with, to my tastes, more interesting characters and a more compelling setting. I started out thinking this book would be a guilty pleasure. It ended up being a pleasure without the guilt."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Beautifully told. Please refer to Jewett62's review, she really says it all. I just needed to add my 5-star rating!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"At last, good lesbian fiction with a fascinating historical basis set in turn of century Russia. The characters were well developed and the story flowed beautifully giving an an uncomfortable but accurate look into the travails of women during this period.I only wish that Dovida's character had been broader. Perhaps a book based upon her life?"},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Elana Dykewomon (b. Elana Nachman) wrote a phenomenal book about Jewish life in the Pale, lesbian romance, and American feminist activism in the early 20th century. The book begins with the story of Gutke, a midwife from Kishinev, Russia. Gutke's mother was raped and she decided to leave her community and travel by foot to Kishinev rather than bear a child out of wedlock. Her mother found shelter and work with an observant woman, Pesah, who later encourages Gutke to become a midwife, a profession in which there is always work. Gutke had great skill in delivering babies and was frequently called upon by Jewish women. The non-Jewish women often shunned her. One day, Gutke meets Dovida, a woman dressed as a man, who works is a successful financier. The two fall in love.In the meantime, Chava, a woman whose sister Gutke delivered, grew up in Kishinev. Chava's life seemed typical of most observant Kishinev Jews until the day when a pogrom hit her village. Chava witnessed horrors that eventually led to her moving to the United States with her cousins. Once in the New York City, Chava finds a life that she often has to remind herself is better than the one that she left in Russia, which had since faced numerous progroms since her emigration. She lives with her cousins in squalor that she never endured in Russia, and rather than finding opportunity in New York, she finds herself spending her days manufacturing cigars, binding books, and fixing machines. In her free time, she attends feminist-activist lectures and meets with feminist women's league and union workers. She also falls in love with a close woman friend of hers and reunites with Gutke and Dovida who assist her in understanding her lesbian relationship.Dykewomon brings richness to \\"Beyond the Pale\\" with her sprinkling of Yiddishisms throughout the narrative. She weaves traditions from the Jewish holidays throughout the stories and brings to light the difficulties that traditional Jewish families faced once they became established in the golden medina. She skillfully describes the brutality of the pogroms and the sea travel from Russia to the New World. Dykewomon clearly extensively researched the living and working conditions in 20th century America. She tells the story of the hardworking, maltreated, malnourished women. She explains the origins of the women's suffrage movement and the unions. She also gives examples of families who left Russia for the apparently safer Warsaw and other parts of soon-to-be Nazi occupied Europe. Dykewomon clearly has a gift for teaching history through gripping stories that work together to make a phenomenal novel."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"I had to force my self to slow down and savor reading this book. Lawrence, Jewiitt and more have written great reviews that touch on my own thoughts. I am not a lesbian nor jewish. Not only did I find this book to be relative and important, it is now one of my favorites. I am looking forward to reading it again.The author's use of language moved me. A recent, first time, trip to the lower east side, just prior to reading this book, was a great coincidence. Dykewomon's commitment to researching and giving authenticity to these women, is inspiring.These stories are mesmerizing. I wonder at women immigrants now. I think of my ancestors, their immigration, their lives as mothers, sisters, daughters, and lovers. Their factory work. I think of the women in 2011 doing washing and folding at the laundry service while they listen to music from their place of birth. I think of the women in 2011 fighting for a voice, fighting for their children to be \\"American\\", fighting to be seen as human. I see the worker's rights, unions and politics of today in a new light. I found this book transformative.I wasn't unaware of what was happening in American history. I didn't lack knowledge or interest in these areas of immigration, industrialization, capitalism, suffrage movement nor civil rights. It is, that this book, has turned that information into a reality that is tugging at my mind and heart. A reality which is parallel to these times, to today.Not many books will tell a story, keep you interested and intrigued, educate you, inspire and then move you to change your own beliefs and actions. I have found that in this book, and I say this without any exaggeration."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"I loved this book. I've read it twice and have it in my collection to read again. This is a true mainstream novel that happens to be about lesbians. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"This is an overwritten fantasy by the author. It does not have an authentic voice for the time it is set in or the characters it portrays. It was a great disappointment and so is Ms Dykewomon."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"I read this book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"This is an important story which needs to be heard, which means it also deserves to be written well. Unfortunately, Beyond the Pale is over written, and the main romance unsatisfying. In the last half of the book, the frequent point of view shifts are distracting-- the hodge-podge seams of the book show through. Although the author captures Yiddish inflections in the dialogue very well, the dialogue itself is often unnatural, reading like a summary of political arguments in a classroom, rather than revealing innuendos of character and mood. The character of Gutke the midwife is the most interesting aspect of the book, but too little a part of it to be a reason to recommend it. I became quickly impatient with its sentimentality and wooden politics."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"This 404 page book, is somewhat overwritten, but does give an exceptionally good and detailed look at Russian Jewish life in the 1800's.The book begins in the first person, telling part of the story of Gutke a midwife, and lesbian. We get a flashback of when Gutke was a young girl, and how she and mother survived following the death of the husband---who was not the father of Gutke, as her mother was raped.Gutke has one black eye and one gold-flecked eye, which makes her unusual. She has a bit of gypsy blood in her, and sometimes seems to be able to see the future of certain babies she delivers.As a child, Gutke, and her mother surive thru the kindness of a woman who owns and runs a Jewish bathhouse in a small Russian town.There Gutke discovers the lesbianism of two of the patrons of the bathhouse. Later she goes and lives with one of the women, only as a friend, and thru her, meets Dovida.Dovida is a lesbian woman who has disguised herself as a man.She and Gutke continue this, coming to America eventually where they live as husband and wife.However, Dovida and Gutke's relationship is never examined in much detail. Nor are we ever privy to Dovida's youth and her experiences.Or how Dovida manages to get away with her disguise, and how it went for her entering the country of America disguised as a male. The fact this is not examined was disappointing to me as a lesbian reader.Featured more prominently in the book is Chava Meyer, and her cousin Rose. Chava's story begins when she is quite young, and it is some time before any lesbian romance or exploration of the lesbian side of her nature is explored or discussed at all.When Chava's parents are killed during one of the frequent &quot;progroms&quot; that attack Jews in Russia, Chava comes to live with her Aunt Bina (her mother's sister) and her husband, Isadore.Eventually Chava travels with her aunt's family in the hold of a ship ( a brutal crossing) to America.There Chava gets a job in factory, as does Rose. Chava and Rose FINALLY began their love affair. Once again, I felt somewhat cheated as a lesbian reader, the affair fails to ever consume as much attention as it deserves.Instead the author seems to have an intense interest in the problems of workers, labor unions, socialism, and politics. Since these particular subjects are quite boring to me, I found myself skimming some of those sections,Eventually the plot, such as it is, is tied into the famous shirt-waist factory fire--which is an actual historical event, in New York.At this point the novel trails off, without any definite conclusions regarding Chava's future, and we are left with the impression she goes on to help with labor unions, etc.Not enough lesbian content in the book to be truly satisfying, but does give a good view of Jewish Russian Immigrant life at that time."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"One of the most wonderful, beautiful books I have read in the last 20 years. The author has woven a lovely, touching -- and yet, horrifying -- chronicle of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement in Russia and the tenements of New York in the late 1890's and early 1900's. Some of the language simply takes your breath away. Ms. Dykewomon's command on the language is so outstanding I found myself stopping at sentences and marveling at what she had written. Obviously exquisitely researched, Beyond the Pale makes daily life in primarily rural Russia come alive: with all its beauty and all its horror. I have read no finer, more human-oriented account of a pogrom -- and this is an area of historical interest to me. Ms. Dykewomon's characters do not find the &quot;Golden Streets&quot; of the new world when they migrate to New York. Instead, they discover numbing poverty, bedbugs and rats they were hardly used to in the &quot;old country&quot; and the dehumanization of their lives by the factories and take-home piecework which were necessary for mere survival. The author shows these poor souls as the human beings they are and does a truly outstanding job of detailing how the love, kindness, wants and needs of such people can survive amid terrible conditions. Beyond the Pale is a song; it is a lament. While the major characters and author are lesbians, it would be inappropriate to characterize Beyond the Pale as lesbian literature. For those who would be offended and refuse to read this book because of that, it is your great loss. Read this book and cry when you finish. Both for what happens and because there are no more pages to read. I hope the author, who has published other works, will return to the general theme (or a sequel) in the future. She writes historical fiction at its best."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"This is perhaps the best novel I've read in years -- and I'm a college literature professor, so I read a lot. I'll admit that I'm a Jewish lesbian, so the book has tremendous personal resonance for me. But this is a novel that should greatly affect anyone who cares at all about women's history, the Jewish experience in America, the history of the labor movement -- or, for that matter, fine contemporary writing.I disagree with the earlier reviewers who characterize the book as either flat or overwritten; I can only imagine that as the reaction if you were looking for a hot but not-too-taxing lesbian romance. This is a different kind of book. There is love between women in this book--quirky, believable, and heartbreaking--but it is not a book that makes the drama of what happens in a couple the entire world. This is love immersed *in* the world. I found the book richly and elegantly written, with excellent depth and insight into the main characters. Elana Dyke! womon is also a fine poet as well as a novelist, and this comes through not only in the verse fragments within the book but also the way it circles around a number of recurrent, evocative images. Anyway, I cannot recommend enough that you take the time to immerse yourself in this finely-crafted, large-spirited, woman-centered novel."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"This was a book that I could not put down. The story follows two immigrant women from Russia to America, where they quickly learn that they have left neither poverty nor struggle behind. The characters face so much hardship and tragedy in this story, and yet the darkness is far from oppressing, as one might find with other authors who have attempted a story such as this.Yes, there is profound sadness in this book (the account of the Triangle fire is almost to hard to read), but there is also joy, understanding and an amazing sense of connection with the characters that will stay with the reader long after the book is finished."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Amazing story about amazing women. Also about the Jewish identity. The author mentions that she wanted to tell a story of Jewish persecution outside the Holocaust, to show that it was not an isolated event but the result of a worlwide hatred and she succeeded completley.This is a book that I felt brought my heritage, both as a woman who likes women and the daughter of a Jewish man into sharp relief, but I'd reccommend it to anyone, for the writing and the stories that need to be told that are braided into it."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Elana uses the themes of love, loss, family, tradition, and religion to weave a novel that tackles life's core issues and illuminates several historical time-periods. This book does not use the ho-hum traps most &quot;love stories&quot; employ to keep the reader from figuring out that the plot is recycled. The narration is poetic and the dialogue fresh. The characters are complex women, identifiable and yet unpredictable. While making the lesbian characters and their &quot;culture&quot; the central focus of the story, Elana incorporates the families, friends, and general society into the plot beautifully. Even they seem as real as your own mother and neighborhood Rabbi. The historical settings, of both Russia during the Pogroms and early industrial America, give the book great depth. There is no guilt in the pleasure of this novel."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"I finished Beyond the Pale more than 4 weeks ago, yet it is still resonating within me. The author's writing style is wonderfully rich. Her love of language is obvious as she writes quite poetically. I am neither Jewish nor a lesbian, however I thoroughly enjoyed this book. In many, many ways it is a great educational experience that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Opening in the early years of the twentieth century, Beyond The Pale by Elana Dykewomon is the engaging story of Gutke Gurvich and Chava Meyer -- two Russian Jewish women who go through hardship. Chava loses her parents to the brutality of a Russian pogrom, and then both women immigrate to New York City, where they find a new definition of cruelty awaits. The Triangle Shirtwaist Company Fire figures prominently in this award-winning historical novel which provides the reader with a superbly written tale of endurance, love, and stalwart courage."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Wow, what a great book. The story is quite captivating. It was interesting to me how the main character's lives ended up inter-twining. Not only was the story interesting but it gave you a peek at the atrocities that went on in Russia in the late 1800's and in America in the early 1900's. It makes you think, well it made me think, how far we have come as a nation and how far we have yet to go. I think the author focused not only on lesbian relationships but also on women as a whole. The relationships between Mothers and daughters, between Fathers and daughters, the relationships between women in general and the lot in life that women seem to perpetually get, each of these things added up to make the book as interesting and as appealing as it was. I cannot recomend this book enough. Whether you are a lesbian or not or whether you are Jewish or not, if you are a woman - this book is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Beyond the Pale","review":"Dykewomon's latest novel is intricate and well-researched.

I noticed several pages were wrinkled up by the salt in my tears that fell upon them. And still I'm left with the same feeling all over again... this is the best book I've ever read! It is a story of struggle, love, loss, and perseverance through the eyes of many characters. It is an incredible journey that is so intensifying your heart will bleed!

His family thought the Arabs would defeat Israel and thereby his family could return, but the Arabs failed. He became a \\"born again Christian\\" and joined a Christian evangelical movement in Jordan, before moving to the U.S. This book is about Mr. Shorrosh's life in his struggle in becoming a Christian minister, his marriage, his missionary activities in India and Palestine, and his development of a ministry. He eventually overcame his hatred of Israel, and worked to build reconciliation between Muslims and Jews.

A lot of these stories I had heard before, but others I hadn't. Entertaining and amusing, for those who like this kind of book I would recommend this highly. The author makes a few good points. The hostility towards long hair in the 1960's was real, and he points out that long hair didn't become &quot;mainstream&quot; until the early 70's with the general population. There is also a chapter on the Woodstock festival, and Fein points out that the proximity to NY and the fact that the event got filmed made it seem as if that was the only festival that summer. In fact there were many others that have been forgotten along the way. Little tidbits such as that give this book credibility beyond the gossipy nature of this kind of book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Rock & Roll Stories: The Most Outrageous, Magical and Scandalous Events in the History of Rock & Roll","review":"I have read a great many books on music in my time, and as a result I'd probably already heard about a third of the stories in this volume in one form or another. However, this book is one of the only places you'll get all the good stuff between a single pair of covers, and that alone makes it worth the money for anybody interested in rock folklore.As for the book itself - well, Fein is reasonably amusing, and many of the stories would be hilarious even if they were related by Sly Stallone during a stand-up comedy routine. Minus points, however, for the insistence on changing fonts halfway through each story, which is particularly jarring on both the eyes and the flow of the narrative (if you think I'm just nitpicking, check it out before you speak).One line summary - it's not a classic, but you'll get a few laughs, and learn about the things any self-professed music fan should know into the bargain.

This book, \\"The Colonizer's Model of the World\\", is the pinnacle of that oeuvre, together with its companion workEight Eurocentric Historians.The first and largest part of the book is devoted to refuting the mythology and mistakes of Eurocentric diffusionism, a body of theories and statements which purport to show that Europe or Europeans were in some way, whether mentally or physically or economically or environmentally or culturally, superior to Asians, Africans and other non-Europeans before the 'discovery' of America. Blaut does this by analyzing systematically the works of many recent and past popularizers of these theories, from the 'hydraulic societies' of Karl Wittfogel to the contemporary racist historiography of Eric L. Jones, and subjecting them to an unsparing criticism for their erroneous assumptions and ignorance of the non-European world. As Blaut shows, China, India, Southeast Asia and even Africa were not lagging behind Europe in any respect before 1492, including but not limited to technology, individual freedom (or lack thereof), and demographics. He also makes many essential geographic points, such as refuting the theories that tropical conditions are inherently unsuited for working or thinking, or that tropical soil is necessarily less fertile, or that Europe relied on rainfall agriculture unlike Asia. The book \\"Eight Eurocentric Historians\\" builds upon this part and goes into more detail about it.The second part of the book is a discussion of the state of feudalism in Europe and elsewhere (about the same level of development except for the Americas, as Blaut shows) before 1492, and the immensely rapid growth, change, and development Western and Southern Europe underwent in the period roughly from 1492 to 1700. Blaut persuasively argues that only the colonization of the Americas, with the enormous influx of wealth and capitalistic production relations resulting from gold and silver mining and plantation work (particularly sugar), can adequately explain this phenomenon. He also explains why it was Europe that conquered America rather than the opposite, the answer being disease, and why it was Europe as opposed to Asia or Africa that did this, the answer being geographical location and advantageous wind patterns for sailing.Blaut is unsparing and polemic in his writing, occasionally getting preachy, but his case is strong and aims home. He even criticizes otherwise radical authors for their failing in this regard, often legitimately, such as Marx and to a lesser extent Engels, Robert Brenner, Perry Anderson, and others. I do not endorse or support all his critiques on this field, as Blaut occasionally goes overboard, and his endorsement of Martin Bernal's \\"Black Athena\\" theory, now discredited, does not aid his case. (It must be noted that this book was written in 1993, and the refutation of this theory in \\"Black Athena Revisited\\" (Black Athena Revisited) was published in 1996.) Blaut nonetheless gives good cause also for the radical historians to revise and change the substance of some of the classic Marxist historical view - his book is yet more confirmation that the concept of the \\"Asiatic mode of production\\" is untenable and must be discarded, and it also gives more argument for introducting \\"protocapitalism\\" as a separate mode of production in between feudalism and Industrial Revolution capitalism, although Blaut himself is not yet willing to do so.What is most important about this book however is not its historiographical import, but the essential corrective it is to much of the still popular view of world history and the development of Europe and its superior position. From Tarzan to Tintin and from Kipling to the popular view of American Indians, the entire picture of the interactions between Europe and the rest of the world are for many people still unwittingly based on completely incorrect Victorian prejudices and assumptions. This goes not just for the average guy, but even for intellectuals, in fact even for professional historians. And if Blaut's book could make a dent in this vision, it will have made a major contribution to international understanding and historical sense."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"It is difficult to critique Blaut's book without falling into the trap of expounding the \`Eurocentric diffusion' theory oneself. If he was making the point that many historical thinkers at many points in time were guilty of over-estimating the uniqueness and impact of any \`European miracle', then I would have some sympathy with his argument. However, his aims are much grander. He wishes to prove that the success of \`Western' civilisation was a geographical happenstance, and that the whole canon of European historiography is built on the basis of \`Eurocentric diffusion', and he, of course, is the only person to have spotted this.Of course, Edward Said's Orientalism of 1979 had preceded Blaut's work by some 14 years, but despite the similarity of tone and approach, Blaut disregards Said's work in one sentence with a quick nod of approval - colonial activity in the Orient obviously being unimportant to his central thesis of the importance of the Americas in European growth. This is typical of Blaut's lack of interest in Asian, African or Middle-Eastern colonialism - for example, colonial India does not figure in his exposition at all. Blaut may not have been aware of the historical academic community's attacks on Said's thesis - these seem to me even more apparent in Blaut's thesis than in Said's. John MacKenzie's incisive critique of Said's Orientalism resonates with flaws I perceive in Blaut's book.Firstly Blaut does not provide any evidence of linkage between \`representation' of the \`outside' world, as he calls it, in the \`Colonizer's Model of the World' and the application of that \`representation' in the colonialisation \`project'. So what philosophical and historical texts existed in the critical 16th and 17th centuries that exhibited this Euro-chauvinism, and how were they harnessed by the colonisers in their supposed domination of the world? He only provides a brief survey of books from 1850 onwards in an extended footnote. Secondly, he creates a form of Euro-centrism himself in his argument painting a caricature of \\"the imperial mugger and unresisting victim\\" Thirdly, he essentialises \`european intellectual history' as if it is one body of consistent opinion. An example of his writing shows this: \\"All scholarship is diffusionist insofar as it axiomatically accepts the Inside-Outside world\\". Also, he is highly selective about the examples he cites, and those that he cites as examples of \`current thinking' are often archaic. An example can be seen in his argument against the \`Malthusian Theory' of overcrowding \\"being propagated today\\", where he attacks books by Lawrence Stone and Robert Brenner, both published in 1977. He only admits in a footnote that an extensive exegesis criticising these works was penned in the 1980s. His selectivity also extends to his bold statement that all world regions were using the sea as effectively as each other prior to 1492. However, he cannot ignore the evidence of the prowess of the Portuguese in sailing techniques, but he hides this in another footnote. What of Bartolomeu Dias's rounding of the Cape of Good Hope which predated Columbus's voyage by four years? Surely the epic voyage of Da Gama's to Kenya and India in 1497/8 shows that Columbus's route was not a one-off freak happenstance?John Thornton's book published the previous year gives a much more convincing historical and geographic explanation of European maritime Atlantic successes over the riverine African sailors, arguing that Europe (and the Middle-East) did have world-beating technical advantages in sailing technology and know-how by the mid 15th century.The final \`Saidian' streak in the book is its ahistoricism. Like Said, Blaut is not a historian. He is a geography professor. But how is this book ahistorical? Firstly, it ignores specific causality. What exactly was the flow of precious metals when they arrived back in Europe? Many historians believe that much of the bullion was respent on purchasing china, silk and tea. Surely this would have enriched Asia not Europe, and especially encouraged Asian industrialisation? Also, the countries which reaped the bullion rewards of South America (Spain and Portugal) patently did not defeudalise at the same rate as Britain and the Low Countries. And some areas, such as Italy and Germany did not gain directly from such colonies - and yet they lie within Blaut's uniform definition of \`Europe'.To conclude, Blaut fails to harness his idea of a \`Coloniser's Model' to any practical instances of colonialist hegemony, or instances of underdevelopment in the colonies. William Coffey describes Blaut's approach as \\"spending a great deal of effort constructing a \`straw man' which he heroically topples...but his approach may be more properly likened to an attack of (German) panzer divisions.\\" He fails to convince that there is one unitary Europe with one Colonial Model of exploitation for capitalist development. Some analysis of the divisions within Europe is surely required to understand how capitalism developed, and where it found nourishment. The book argues against Weber's ideas of the \`oriental despot', the cyclical rather than modernising nature of Asian societies and Weber's racist undertones. But it fails to address Weber's ideas on the famous \`Protestant Work Ethic' and the Marx's and Weber's \`spirit of the true man'. One year after the publication of Blaut's book. Francis Fukuyama published the highly successful and controversial End of History and the Last Man which investigated these issues - coming to very different conclusions from Blaut.It is worth noting that Blaut's final book, entitled Eight Eurocentric historians was published in 2000, in the year of his death. It may be that this new edition may address some of the criticisms I level at his 1993 work."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"In this book, the late James Blaut attempted to demonstrate the existence of a theory of Eurocentric diffusionism among mainstream scholars and the general public, as well as reasons for its falsity and the veracity of a competing theory.Eurocentric diffusionism is defined as the concept that the internal qualities of Europe led to the modernization of non-European countries after colonialism, rather than utilization of the resources of those continents themselves, which is the idea that Blaut supports. The concept of an \\"Inside\\" versus an \\"Outside\\" is repeatedly mentioned, with Europe or \\"Greater Europe\\" said to be conceptualized as a focal point that gradually spreads its inventions and discoveries outward to the non-producers of the world in other continents.Colonialism is legitimized by depicting non-European regions of the world as empty both physically and culturally. The exploitation of non-Europeans through dispossession, slavery, and theft of their mineral wealth is therefore justified because Europe contributed cultural wealth to those regions. While the importation of material products from non-Europe to Europe is regarded as acceptable, the importation of cultural or intellectual products is not, since non-Europeans are regarded as primitive and backwards.While the author accurately describes a historic academic model that is likely still accepted in part by segments of the public, he provides rather limited evidence that this framework was still widely adopted by scholars in 1993, the year of this book's publication.His own selected definitions of Europe and non-Europe are problematic. Blaut states that, \\"In this book, the word 'Europe' refers to the continent of Europe and to regions dominated by European culture elsewhere, regions like the United States and \\"Canada.\\" He does not mention Latin America, dominated primarily by European culture from Iberia, likely because Americans have been conditioned to regard Latin Americans as non-white or non-European, despite the fact that several countries (such as Argentina) are predominantly ethnically European and all are predominantly culturally European, though those with higher traditionalist Indian populations (i.e. Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia) have important Native influences.More significantly, the most persistent and critical error is likely the author's tendency to essentially promise more than he actually delivers in terms of demonstrating that the alleged disparities between Europe and non-Europe were nonexistent before the Age of Exploration, or to establish that there were parities between selected parts of non-Europe and Europe, but not the universal equality (or even the lesser standard of equity), that his wording implies existed.In the beginning of chapter 2, Blaut states, \\"My task in this chapter and in Chapter 3 ('Before 1492') is to show that Europeans had no superiority over non-Europeans at any time prior to 1492: they were not more advanced, not more modern, not more progressive.\\" However, in the beginning of chapter 3, he modifies his purpose somewhat, stating, \\"Prior to 1492, the progress toward modernization and capitalism which was taking place in parts of Europe was also taking place in parts of Asia and Africa.\\" This fails to address the disparities between Europe and America, Australia, and various islands that were colonized by Europeans. He thus states an intent to only partially support his claim of parity between Europe and non-Europe.Yet he then goes on to only partially support this partial support. The general pattern that he follows is to first make a rather strong claim, such as, \\"The protocapitalist port cities of Europe were not more highly developed than those of Africa and Asia in the fifteenth century.\\"He then proceeds to provide evidence for only part of this claim: \\"This holds true regardless of the kinds of criteria chosen as measures. European cities, first, were not larger in absolute or relative population. In fact, urbanization in Europe was probably less advanced than urbanization in China, India, the Arab region, and no doubt many other non-European areas. The urban population in early Ming China was perhaps 10% of the total population. In the Vijayanagar Empire of southern India it must have been at least as high: the inland capital alone held about 3% of the population - comparable centers in Europe, such as Paris, may have had half that percentage - and the coastal port cities were both numerous and large.\\"The examples of Ming China and Vijayanagar Empire may serve to prove that there was Asian urbanization comparable or superior to European urbanization, but the author does not cite any specific examples of African urbanization, such as Timbuktu. While the \\"Arab region\\" includes substantial portions of North Africa, the most persistent Eurocentric criticism is typically directed at sub-Saharan Africa, by genetic determinists because of their beliefs about the inferiority of the population and by those he terms environmental determinists because of their beliefs about the Saharan desert blocking diffusion to the south. To reference the most recent advocacy of environmental determinism in a popular science book, Jared Diamond (who is addressed in Blaut's bookEight Eurocentric Historians), writes inGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societiesthat, \\"my use of the term 'Eurasia' includes in several cases North Africa, which biogeographically and in many aspect of human culture is more closely related to Eurasia than to sub-Saharan Africa.\\"Worse than the partial argument is the bald assertion, such as that expressed in his discussion of military disparities between Europeans and Amerindians: \\"Moreover, the superiority of the Spaniards' primitive guns was not really very great when compared with the Americans' bows and arrows.\\"In comparison, inSeven Myths of the Spanish Conquest, Matthew Restall explains that guns were of limited use to the earliest Europeans in America artillery pieces such as cannons and firearms such as harquebuses were in short supply and difficult to transport, tropical and sub-tropical humidity dampened powder, rendering guns inoperable, and that more effective weapons such as the musket and more effective battle techniques such as volley-firing had yet to be developed. In1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, Charles Mann explains that the pistols owned by Jamestown colonists were inferior to arrows in range and penetration. InThe Mystic Warriors of the Plains, Thomas E. Mails explains that quickly drawn and discharged arrows can be fired more rapidly than a historic revolver, and at short range can penetrate further than the ball of a historic Colt's navy pistol and that the bow and arrow was not abandoned to a very great extent by Plains warriors until they acquired repeaters such as the Winchester 66 and the Sharps .50 caliber carbines.Blaut, by contrast, provides an (unsourced) assertion in a single sentence. There is evidence of this statement being true, in the form of the arguments provided by the aforementioned authors, but Blaut does not summarize these arguments himself or even reference these sources in an endnote.Returning to the issue of disparities between continents, of particular significance was the complete absence of any discussion of Australia from the book, and (according to the index), only one brief mention of the smallest continent, in an endnotes section. The likely reason is that Australian history strongly evidences the fact that there were technological disparities between continents based on the presence or absence of domesticable flora and fauna, and Blaut insistently rejects this as an explanation. In pre-colonial Australia, both domesticated plants and animals were fundamentally absent, and the consequence was that the indigenous population were nomadic hunter-gatherers.To this day, the principal rural productive activity in Australia is not crop cultivation but livestock ranching (mainly of sheep and cattle), with wheat, sugar cane, and cotton. Cultivation is primarily practiced in relatively small pockets in the southern and eastern regions of the continent (with the highest human populations concentrated in Melbourne and Sydney) that enjoy the combined benefits of moderate to high soil fertility, annual precipitation, and temperate climate. Even twenty-first century technology cannot produce an irrigation system that converts the massive interior deserts into fertile regions, demonstrating the extent of environmental influence that the author repeatedly denies.If we can accept the fact that there is a correlation between domesticated flora and fauna and technological sophistication, and it is sufficiently evident that a continent without the former also lacked the latter that the author omits it from his book, can we not also accept that high levels of such flora and fauna are present in certain regions of the world, low or nonexistent levels are present elsewhere, and intermediate levels in still others, with technology approximately commensurate to these levels? The author apparently cannot.Yet remarkably, after much criticism of environmental determinism (which he describes as \\"the theory that the natural environment strongly influences human affairs and human history\\"), Blaut emerges as a reluctant partial advocate of it in his explanation as to why America was colonized by Europeans rather than Africans or Asians, arguing that it was due to lesser distance and better sailing conditions.As a response to expected charges of environmental determinism, he writes, \\"Is this environmental determinism? There is no more environmentalism here than there is in, say, some statement about the effect of oilfields on societies of the Middle East. I am asserting only the environmental conditions that support and hinder long-distance oceanic travel. In any case, if the choice were between an environmentalistic explanation and one that claimed superiority of one group over all others, as Eurocentric diffusionism does, we would certainly settle for environmentalism.\\"The effects of distance and sailing conditions and the effects of oilfields both illustrate the same axiom, expressed by Diamond: \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments.\\" Blaut adheres to this axiom mainly when differences between peoples are more clearly involuntary Moreover, his wording in the concluding sentence implies that selection between competing theories is merely a matter of personal preference rather than following the evidence to a logical conclusion.Blaut states that the role of disease was, \\"of paramount importance and probably constitutes a sufficient cause in and of itself.\\" Diamond concurs, writing that, \\"Throughout the Americas, diseases introduced with Europeans spread from tribe to tribe far in advance of the Europeans themselves, killing an estimated 95 percent of the pre-Columbian Native American population.\\"The two authors also agree on the origin of major infectious diseases. Blaut writes that, \\"Many diseases originated or became epidemiologically significant during or after the Agricultural Revolution, and have ecological connections to agriculture, to urbanization, to zoological and botanical changes in he ecosystems strongly modified by human land use, and so on.\\" Diamond echoes him, writing, \\"That [disease] buildup began with the rise of agriculture starting about 10,000 years ago and then accelerated with the rise of cities starting several thousand years ago.\\"Far from being a consistent opponent of so-called environmental determinism (which, again, he describes as \\"the theory that the natural environment strongly influences human affairs and human history\\"), Blaut finds himself in agreement with its most prominent recent advocate on determining the most significant cause of success for permanent European colonialism in America. Since he argues that the divergence between Europe and non-Europe occurred, \\"because of Europe's location near America and because of the immense wealth obtained by Europeans in America and later in Asia and Africa,\\" it would certainly stand to reason that the natural environment strongly influenced human affairs and human history if this theory is correct.His partial environmental determinism ironically produces a self-condemnation, through his statement that, \\"One finds each Eurocentric historian adding one or a number of environmentalist arguments or factors to the mix, which, as a whole, explains the superiority of Europe.\\"Ultimately, though the crux of Blaut's argument seems logical and persuasive, these cited instances are unfortunately characteristic of his general approach, which can be broadly described as prone to assertions without sufficient evidence, substantial inconsistency in the specific case of environmental determinism, and repetitive pontification of some points and overly brief mention of others, regardless of their respective significance.While this book may serve as a supplement to Guns, Germs, and Steel (which provides little explanation for the Great Divergence), much of the same information is provided in the far more succinct bookIn the Wake of Columbus: The Impact of the New World on Europe, 1492-1650 (European History Series), orThe Columbian Exchange, Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492, both of which also expand beyond discussion of the effects of precious metals on Europe's economy to focus on the advantages provided by the exchange of cultivated crops from both continents and domesticated animals from Europe. Better yet, a synthesis of the main ideas of both Guns, Germs, and Steel and A Colonizer's Model of the World is provided inA Concise Economic History of the World: From Paleolithic Times to the Present."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"The author contends that prior to 1492 most of the sea-faring cultures of the &quot;Old World&quot; (Europe, Africa &amp; Asia) were, for the most part, equal in technological, political and economic status. It was only geographic proximity (and luck) that allowed the Europeans to &quot;discover&quot; America, which had advanced cultures, too. This &quot;discovery&quot; allowed the Europeans to be the first to exploit the natural and human resources of America and therefore position itself as the world powerhouse, that still exists today. Colonization and capitalism followed from the silver trade, then eventually the fur, rum and slave trades. The rest is history. Along the way, Mr. Blaut easily dismisses the notion that it was European culture or character (either good or evil) that led to their &quot;advancements.&quot; But it is that main point that really opened my eyes: that other cultures, in all hemispheres, were equally advanced as Europe in 1492, and that Europe's colonization of America was just luck and their &quot;advancement&quot; truly sprung from just that. It is a good complement to &quot;Indian Givers,&quot; by Jack Weatherford."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"Anyone familiar with academic professor-style writing will understand the structural weakness of this book. There are four very long chapters related to Blaut's theoretical argument, and they almost certainly originated as separate research projects written at different times for different audiences. Blaut has tied things together with occasional transitional paragraphs, surrounded by a shell of a general argument. Some knowledgeable reviewers here have found problems with Blaut's general history, and that's legitimate, but the fundamental problem with this book's construction makes such matters of detail a moot point.Blaut's major contention is very strong, if not exactly groundbreaking. He wishes to debunk the body of historical theory called diffusionism &#8211; the dubious Eurocentric view that all the advancements of civilization, from agriculture to cities to capitalism, originated amongst genius Europeans and then were disseminated to ignorant peoples around the world. At the start of the book, Blaut promises to explore the intellectual processes that make mainstream and elite historians continue to believe such theories even after they have long since been disproved. That would have made this book a winner, but the promise never comes to fruition, leaving us instead with a tedious exercise in theorization.After an exasperating opening chapter in which Blaut keeps telling us what he's going to cover later, this book collapses in the disastrous second chapter. Here he ceaselessly nitpicks the arguments of selected history books. This includes dozens of pages obsessing over the works of some historian named Eric L. Jones, which reeks of professional sour grapes. Unfortunately for Blaut, simply finding errors in other theories does not prove your own theory by default. Chapters 3 and 4 incomprehensibly descend into reductionist historical research on the development of feudalism outside of Europe and the influence of colonial riches on England's Glorious Revolution of 1688. Now what do these have to do with the attempted high-level theoretical insights of the rest of the book? Extremely little &#8211; although Blaut throws in occasional reminders that he's still leading up to great findings about his initial thesis. Well, he never does give us any real insights into why historians still believe in Eurocentric diffusionism. We only learn that Blaut really disagrees with it. Most would say he's correct given the realities of history, if only he could say it in a way that makes sense.

Blaut systematically dismantles idea after idea, many of which have been taken for granted by historians and laymen alike for years. For example, the idea that Europe's climate and soils are inherently better suited for agriculture than elsewhere. In the end, however, Blaut still has to explain Europe's rise, so his answer is that since Europe was geographically closer to the Americas and had the benefit of favorable winds and currents, these factors made the &quot;discovery&quot; of America possible. The resulting flood of bullion from America into Europe allowed the Europeans to eventually pull ahead of the rest of the world. Blaut is surely on to something, but his explanation is a little thin. Why didn't Africans discover Brazil? Nonetheless, this is an excellent book that will challenge your thinking and shake your Eurocentrism (if you suffer from it) to the foundations.

While Blaut makes some excellent arguments about Europe's lack of credit to other cultures, especially during it's early expansion, in the end the facts don't stand up to his argument.He overlooks that overwhelming riches did little to stop Spain's rapid decline as a power (it may have even accelerated it to some extent). Blaut seems to have discounted the fall of Constantinople and the subsequent fleeing of teachers and artists to the West as a factor.What subsequent events does Blaut either overlook or underevaluate? For starters there are the beginnings of the scientific method in the West. Then there are things that muck up his argument like the advancement of western medicine (so much that even the Chinese would ask for western doctors in the 16th century, military improvements and numerous advancements in technology.And so on and so on. I'm all for the remembering of contributions and influences from non-european societies, civilizations and cultures, but this \\"mea culpa\\" Western guilt has reached a bit of a height in Blaut's work. It also seems to reflect an emotional analysis rather than any unbiased academic approach.In addition to technical, scientific, medical, and management advancement, he leaves out the social/philisophical advancement of the West.The basic concept of the freedom and dignity of the individual, while not perfectly practised were almost unique in being applied to Western society. In fact the West is the first to look at itself and realize to this day it's failings vis a vis slavery, sexism, etc., in a sustained and critical way that other societies have yet to approach...Read this, but keep your wits about you as you do."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"... and I believe I am a seeker of engrossing, intellectual reading!With strong, stimulating, engrossing, logical and brilliantly vivid arguments, this book deserves to be a recommended study at all schools wishing to nurture a socially analytical intellect.

African Universities in particular, will find this book very interesting reading"},{"Title":"WITS : A University in the Apartheid Era","review":"A remarkable, authoritative and very personal insight into some aspects of the apartheid era. As one reads one feels increasingly 'involved' - and filled with admiration for those who (like the author) had to cope with the situation."},{"Title":"WITS : A University in the Apartheid Era","review":"All young people should read this book to better understand the climate of opinion which all political change must challenge. Whether the civil rights struggle in the U.S., the anti-Vietnam war movement, or the apartheid battles at WITS, the important development from the initial gentle questioning of the issue to the later struggle against the most bigoted opposition has been delineated in exciting and encompassing terms.

Insightful, full of good information. I recommend this book to all new and experienced users that don't already have it. Not only does it give specific advice for everyday Mac uses, it also shows users what else is out there to create, use and experience. An absolute must for all Mac users."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"A great reference and entertaining read for any Mac user, from beginner to advanced. I'm a voracious reader of books about Mac hardware and software, and I still picked up some great tips and insights. Best of all, the book is written in a lively, friendly style. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"The Macintosh Bible series has been excellent, but this edition is wonderful. So much so that I had to buy a 2nd copy; it's heavy to take to work every day and then home every night. But the detail is what even experienced Mac users need to deal with almost every relevant topic, day after day.Virtually all facets of Macintosh operation are covered sufficiently to overcome some of the (alas) now-expected roadblocks even in my favorite computers; for example, Ms. Aker and I agree that when it comes to providing a trustworthy, loyal, helpful, accurate, obedient, friendly, and kind installer for a new operating system, the folks at Apple Computer have, as is the nicest way to put it, have made progress, but there's lots of room for growth. She ably steers you around the icebergs.The book is quite thorough for people using up to Mac OS 8.0 or 8.1; also, there's more on OS 8.5 than I'd have expected, given the publication date. Many thanks to Apple for assisting this, providing enough material on the newer OS to let her deal effectively with it.This book is not only elegant in terms of describing the use of an excellent computer; it is also written beautifully. If the author had shown it to our former College English Composition Board, she'd have scored at an enviable level. Making technically complex procedures easy is very difficult, but she succeeds admirably.The jokes, brief historical anecdotes, and other details make it a pleasure to read and use. It sets a standard, in my opinion, not only for the present present but for the future."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"The strengths of this book are the tips to getting yourself out of trouble. The interesting part of this book are the interviews with the major players in the history of the MAC. Gives a chance to those people to voice their opinion of the state of the MAC."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"This book is a must have for all Mac users. The title of this book descibes its content. Sharon Aker is an excellent author. The book is easy to follow, covers 'every' topics , and ...its just great!. Its a great reference book: a must have !. Apple should commission Sharon Aker to write more books on its hardware and software ( how about an upto date and thorough Applescript book for starters)."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"I have to admit, from the outset, that I am not a Mac person. I am a PC tech trying to service one of the only Mac's I will probably work on this year. I have a copy of the Mac Bible. It is huge! That's not bad if it is useful. The problem I am having is finding what I need while I have to wade through the barrels of verbage that are useless to me. I finally had to resort to scouring the Web to find my answers. I guess I'm used to the more direct, almost cookbook approach to troubleshooting and setup. To be fair, and thats why I gave the book two stars instead of one, I realize that the different chapters are written by different authors, so the content and style will vary. Unfortunately for me the sections I needed were written by authors I would rather not consult in the future."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"its a good book, if you are reading this review, skip the first chapter.

The is a newer Mac bible, take a look on that one."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"1,00"},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"This book should probably ship with every new MacIntosh. It brings out the Mac's potential in a way that gave me new appreciation for its elegance and simplicity. In an enjoyable--albeit hokey--style, the author not only presents the information about hardware and software that it is expected she give, but often does the MacIntosh user's work for him. In the section on the software application QuicKeys, for instance, the are several pages of useful suggestions as to what keys the reader should assign to various tasks when using that program. That is amazing, that is not even the book's main task and it is more nuts-and-bolts, time-saving information than the very manufacturer of Quickeys supplies with their own software. The same is true in the section on how to set up an Apple menu. I just followed every suggestion the author made; it saved me time, works like a charm, and I'd never have come up with that stuff on my own. It's even a fun book (for Macheads) to just jump around in in one's free time; such browsing will almost always yield new knowledge or a useful trick or shortcut. I doubt that Windows users have this much fun learning about their OS, and I doubt that Windows could yield a book that makes such integrated sense as this one.I only have one annoyances with this book. First, the author fudges and glosses over real explanations of some of the more difficult concepts such as Apple Script and memory. It's as if she's so determined to make the book all-inclusive that she settles for doing a less than satisfactory job with advanced material that she'd have been within her rights to simply leave out of the book. In these instances, she seems to lift a lot of information out of the Mac OS's documentation, and fails to supplement those often spotty explanations. No one is going to understand how to use Applescript by reading her account of it. Also, the book supposedly comes with an interactive, &quot;readers only&quot; website, with the password to that website hidden somewhere in the pages of the book. It's so well hidden that I've had the book for 9 months and still not found it.All in all, indispensable, and I'll be buying the OS 9 version when it comes out."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"I have been using macs for about ten years and had read earlier editions of the mac bible and loved them. But after becoming an old mac hand (ignorance is bliss!) I had stopped feeling the need for newer editions of the mac bible. But last week my mother bought her first ever computer, a really sweet G3 Powerbook, and in preparation for flying across the country to tutor her I went shopping for some reference books to give us a hand. I bought the Mac Bible, the Mac OS 8.5 Black Book, and the Microsoft Office 98 Visual Basic Book. The Mac Bible is far and away the most helpful of the bunch. Easiest to read, most in depth and with valuable opinions, real life applications and a sense of humor. In fact I decided to return the Black Book and buy a Mac Bible for myself to take home."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"I got my first Mac ever about a year and a half ago, being a PC person before that. Being a book fanatic, I used this Mac purchase as an excuse to go out and buy lots of Mac books! The Mac Bible was one of the first I bought. It still remains the book I consult most often.I found it had an absolutely fabulous &quot;history of Mac&quot; section, so I was able to catch up on all the Macs through history. I was keenly interested in that, and still am. I love to read about the old LCs, and such. (Yes, I'm a pathetic geek.)But there's more to that to this book. Just lots of explanations on OS features, different kinds of problems you'll encounter, and some of the best software to use on a Mac. It has a great index, so you can find the information you need quickly. I have it by my Mac at all times. What would I do without it?I can't explain it - this book has EVERYTHING. I read it eagerly (I even had it before I got my Mac! I ordered the Mac, and read this book while waiting for it to arrive.) This book helped me adjust to the world of Mac-dom very quickly. And now, a year and a half after my first Mac, I am a full-fledged Machead, thanks in part to this book."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"Excellent book! Well written and superbly done.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"There are four major parts to this book:. Looking at the Mac, which talks about the Mac in general from an overview of the operating system to storage systems and printing.. Getting Productive which walks about common business and personal applications like word processing, databases and spreadsheets.. Getting Creative, all about graphics, web design and HTML, after all, the Mac is reknown for its capabilities in the graphical area.. Extending your Reach, reaching out for the internet, for networks and even working with Windows machines. This part also has a chapter 'Switching to the Mac from Windows.'In a bit over a thousand pages the authors have room to cover nearly every aspect of working with a Mac. This book covers the standard everyday tasks that you're likely to do on a Mac. From here, of course you can go on to more specialized programs if that's where your job lies. For instance in the graphics area, iPhoto, which is supplied with all new Macs is covered. But if you're a graphics professional you probably want some more professional. And the book talks about the professional level packages such as Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop, ACD Systems Canvas, Macromedia FreeHand, Corel Painter, and others. It doesn't cover these in detail, but at least talks enough about them to get you started on deciding which is best for your needs.This book is, as the title says, the Bible of the Mac. It doesn't contain everything there is to know about the Mac (if it did you couldn't lift it) but it certainly contains enough to get you well started."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"I recently had an excellent opportunity to try out this book as I made the switch from the PC to a new 15&quot; PowerBook G4. This is the type of book that very few people probably read from cover to cover. Rather they would read it as a resource book when they are having troubles or questions. As I made the change from one OS to another I found myself going to the book eleven times. Two of those times the book didn't answer my questions. But for the most part I learned what I needed to know each time.If you are about to make a switch or are having issues with your Mac I would recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Macintosh Bible","review":"Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you're sure to find dozens of useful tips and insights.

In her preface to the volume Hakim declares &quot;Are We Equal? Are We Kidding?&quot; Her point is to underscore the Declaration of Independence's famous proposition that all men are created equal and to point out that ending slavery does not really free people if they are denied education and jobs. However, while the issue of racial division begins and ends this book, Hakim covers the entire domestic history of the United States in between the Civil War and the rise of the nation as a world power.This volume does not have a formal structure but you can still find four rather distinction units. The first (Chapters 1-10) talks specifically about Southern Reconstruction and the fight between President Andrew Johnson and Thaddeus Stevens, leader of the Radical Republicans in Congress. The second (Chapters 11-18) tells about the opening of the West and Indians ordered to reservations. The third (Chapters 19-25) contrasts the world of Boss Tweed and Thomas Nast, P.T. Barnum and Mark Twain, with the immigrants who came to both coasts of the country. The fourth (Chapters 26-37) starts with the beginning of the movement towards rights for women and ends with Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois taking on the Jim Crow laws, with the birth of the Industrial Revolution and its patron saint Thomas Alva Edison in between.As you can see, this is an inelegant division of these 37 chapters at best. But in the second half of the 19th-century of American history lacks the direction of the first, where the nation was hurdling towards Civil War. The idea that America was indeed reconstructing, or remaking itself, makes sense. However, there is no finality to the story at this point because equality between the sexes and the races are still a half and full century away respectively. One sign of the changing focus of history is that George Armstrong Custer and the Battle of the Little Big Horn is literally a marginal topic while the story of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce gets an entire chapter.These volumes are wonderfully illustrated, with historic photographs, paintings, and in this particular volume political cartoons that help bring the period alive. Throughout the book you will find detailed features on subjects such as the first conservationist, John Wesley Powell, and the Route of the Nez Perce in 1877. As always the margins are crammed with notes, definitions, mini-biographies, and choice quotations. For children raised on computers and the Internet it is clear that Hakim is speaking their language, and for parents home schooling their children they will find Hakim to be an active teacher who anticipates questions and concerns from students even when she is writing and book and they are reading it. This is an excellent series of American history textbooks."},{"Title":"Reconstructing America: A History of US, Book 7","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought that it would be like the awful textbooks they force you to read in schools across the country (i.e. \\"and then Washington retired, and Adams became president,etc.,etc.\\"), but it wasn't boring at all.

It was made into the kind of stupid Hollywood film ALL HANDS ON DECK (1961) but the book has a wonderful charm and it's filled with rueful stories about the Navy that will ring true with anyone who's ever been in the service--or been in love, because it is a pretty good love story too.Donald Morris went on to more sober literary chronicles, he became the author of the amazing THE WASHING OF THE SPEARS which attempted to tell the story of the Zulu's war against ther British from the Zulu point of view. It is said that Hemingway gave Morris the idea for his groundbreaking book.You can see in WARM BODIES his sympathy for other races, as the most memorable character in the book is an enlisted man called S.E. (Shrieking Eagle) Garfield, a genius with hardware who refuses to speak anything but his native Chickasaw. (In the film this character was played by Buddy Hackett, who did a pretty good job but of course he wasn't Indian.)The book details the plight of naval officers who aren't married, \\"confirmed bachelors,\\" and how they try to make themselves comfortable homes on board their ships. In one funny episode a girlfriend tries to teach Morris how to make \\"something called beer balls.\\" In another storyline he tries to goose the sailors into doing more chipping of rust off the hull of the ship. \\"Chipping irons never wear out, and they never break. Sailors may surreptitiously drop them overboard, but the boatswain invariably has new ones ready. No one was ever been able to make a boatswain admit that he has run out of chipping irons. Rudolph Rush claimed that eighteen and one half per cent of the United States defense budget was spent on chipping irons.\\"Since Morris wrote the book, the term \\"Warm Bodies\\" has passed from naval slang into the general population, but it's worth going back and seeing how he phrased it. \\"A Warm Body is a man with at least one arm and two fingers who can pick something up when he is told to. Warm Bodies can carry boxes, count small objects, turn on lights, chip paint, and sweep.\\" Sounds like zombies, don't they?Pat Boone played Donald Morris in the long-ago film, and Barbara Eden played Sally Hobson, the Southern girl from Little Hominy (near Lye, Virginia) with whom he falls in love.

I was pleasantly surprised that the songs were so catchy and fun to sing along to. One of our faves: Bingo (aka \\"Sancho\\"): \\"Un perro grande tengo yo y el se llama Sancho! S - A - N - CH- O...\\" I got this for me, to keep my Spanish up to a basic level, and to reinforce Spanish for my daughter, whose dad is a native Spanish speaker, but doesn't use Spanish much around the house.Although kids are the ones singing on most of the tunes, they don't sound overly cutesy or artifical, they just sound like normal kids (unlike a lot of kiddie music cds, including others in this series). About half the songs are culturally Latino and half US. For the US songs of course it's easy to guess the meaning of the Spanish lyrics, but for the Spanish songs, you either have to just enjoy them for their musical appeal, or read along in the booklet as you listen. Since I always played this in the car, I never really got the Spanish lyrics down pat.I gave this product 5 stars despite this small limitation, because not only do the songs provide good immersion using fairly basic, easy to understand vocab, but also the CD includes a correspondance between a US and Mexican child, who read their penpal letters aloud to each other. If you had some high school Spanish, you will find it coming back to you as you listen to the letters.I would not however recommend that they add more English to this cd in future. I loved that it's almost full immersion (some songs are introduced in English and then switch to Spanish). This CD is not a good intro to Spanish, especially if as a parent you know no Spanish. On the other hand, if you are willing to take the time to read the booklet and maybe crack open a dictionary, you could make this work for you. It is certainly a lot more entertaining and fun than the total beginner CDs and DVDs on the market (at this point I feel like I've seen/heard them all, and they nearly all would make great insomnia cures; that's about it!)This CD would make a GREAT DVD, with subtitles for parents in English -- ideally with an option to choose Spanish subtitles, English, or none. Until then, just enjoy it for what it is: a fun collection of traditional English and Spanish-language songs that is guaranteed to get you and your child singing and smiling!PS- If you want another immersion CD, try Kids Picks Hit Mix, Vol. 5: En Espanol: tons of fun top 40 hits sung entirely in Spanish! It's a blast!Kids Picks Hit Mix, Vol. 5: En Espanol"},{"Title":"Pricksongs & Descants; Fictions","review":"Somehow, over the years, Robert Coover has been denied the status he deserves as one of America's most original and celebrated satirists of all things red white & blue. Although almost 40 years old now, this collection of short stories still displays Coover's protean talents at their most kaleidoscopic, despite the fact these works came early in his long career.In each of his stories, Coover takes iconic items of 20th Century American culture and holds them up to fun-house mirrors. Sometimes the Coover-modified images reveal a dark underbelly to myth, sometimes they are manically funny and sometimes they're simply warped -- but at all times, they move at breakneck speed and the wordcraft is nonpareil.While one by no means has to be a student of American iconography to appreciate these stories, the greater one's understanding of suburban mythology he or she brings to the party, the more he or she will take away.Coover's complex, yet extremely approachable writing gives readers the choice at what level they wish to read his work. They can be read as biting commentary on America's social mores or -- even better -- as a dazzling, runaway roller coaster ride taken for no other reason than the unadulterated joy of it. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee..........."},{"Title":"Pricksongs & Descants; Fictions","review":"Coover's name is typically mentioned alongside postmodern / metafiction masters like Barth, Barthelme, Borges and Calvino (one heck of a law firm, there), and Pricksongs & Descants is usually cited as his breakthrough book. While I agree that he's certainly exploring similar terrain, and that P&D; definitely has some innovative, standout moments, I don't think Coover's work here is of quite the same caliber.For one thing, it's often not a lot of fun to read. Most of the stories in this volume have at least some basis is fairytale, fable, myth or fantasy, which Coover then twists and extrudes through a sort of probability engine, revealing myriad possible outcomes. The sections of his nonlinear stories seem a bit like slices from a 'choose your own adventure' book, and combined with his penchant for dark, psychosexual drama, the result is occasionally intriguing but ultimately unsatisfying.With Coover, there's a feeling that cleverness is paramount. As William H. Gass observed in a largely enthusiastic 1969 review, \\"this is a book of virtuoso exercises: alert, self-conscious, instructional and show-off. Look at me, look at me, look at me now...\\" With its tricks and twists, the book practically fawns for admiration, though while controlled and technically accomplished, Coover's writing seems to lack a lot of genuine heart or generosity of spirit. This was a well that often drained me as a reader, rather than filling me up.That being said, Coover's 'shuffled deck' technique reaches its apotheosis in \\"The Babysitter,\\" a remarkable story that explodes the latent psychosexual tensions of suburban life with stunning ingenuity, what Gass called \\"a remarkable fugue -- the stock fears and wishes, desires and dangers of our time done into Bach.\\" Though much of P&D; failed to mean much for me, this story was a revelation. Whether you decide to go in for the whole book or not, read \\"The Babysitter.\\" Twice."},{"Title":"Pricksongs & Descants; Fictions","review":"Published in 1969, this collection of short stories could only have appeared in America at the end of a decade as turbulent as the sixties. The influence of that decade and all the stress it forced upon a comfortable America emerging from a comfortable 1950's- the assassination of JFK, the war in Vietnam, the rise and influence of psychedelic drugs, an emerging sexual freedom, riots in our cities- while not explicitly present in this collection of witty and masterful pieces, presides over every word and story. The anxiety and sense of danger that the sixties imposed upon the United States oozes from page one all the way through to the unsettling finish.The book starts off with the familiar- fairy tales- only they read nothing like the ones we were raised on. Then we're off to a deserted island where two lone females encounter strange men and magic fireplace pokers. Or do they? Nothing happens to them and yet everything happens to them. In another story, a babysitter gets raped, molested, accidentally drowns the baby, and falls asleep watching television- all at the same time.In every story, at every chance he gets, author Robert Coover challenges what we, the reader, think we know about what is going on and then presents a completely different scenario. It is clever, the word play is rapid and at times dizzying, and while it may feel at times that Coover is simply a magician pulling the wool over our eyes (an accusation he addresses in the final story, about a magician who attempts to pull the wool over the audience's eyes), his writing is so confident that he essentially gets away with whatever literary trick he attempts to pull.Biblical stories are reinterpreted. The Jesus story from the viewpoint of Joseph, the Noah story from the viewpoint of some unlucky neighbors. Lepers, sadistic stationmasters, men who fear elevators, the topics are unique and varied. One that stands out, that seems to speak to Coover's view of America and what it is becoming, concerns a man hit by a truck while crossing the street on a green light. While lying underneath the truck dying, the theater of the absurd takes place around him while people blame the pedestrian, laugh at a woman claiming to be the dying man's lover, yell at a helpless police officer, and encourage the futile antics of an incompetent doctor. Absurd yet underneath it all, deeply unsettling.Violent, sexual, crude- these are not nice stories. But if you want to read an author at his fearless best, grab this book now and savor some of the best writing modern America has produced."},{"Title":"F. D. R. My Exploited Father in Law","review":"Curtis B. Dall, the author, was a White House Insider while F.D.R. was President. This is a book that every American should read and is the only source I have ever found on many important events of that time period. Those events have repercussions down to the present day. Mr. Dall was an excellent observer and reporter plus he was a man of experience with the world &quot;as it is&quot;. He is a good writer, is clear and understandable and the events themselves are fascinating. I lent or lost my original copy and am now looking for another one for my permanent reference library. I think it was one of the best and most important books I've ever read."},{"Title":"F. D. R. My Exploited Father in Law","review":"The book started off with a slow start, but finished with \\" all cannons blazing\\". Curtis Dall was married to F.D.R.'s daughter and was a stockbroker on the floor during the 1929 crash. It was after the crash that the author started to \\" see the truth\\". After conversations with various individuals he begins to learn the 1929 crash was a manipulated event. The author states,\\" I had not yet learned that the largest and quickest profits which can accrue to powerful bankers and credit manipulators is selling just before they create a disaster to shake confidence throughout the world-- specifically, war\\". This is exactly what happened prior to the 9/11 attacks. Similarly, when the economy sank in late 2008 prior to the election, banks receieved a bailout, and \\"bankers\\" bought commodities at dirt cheap prices. Not much has changed.The author also describes the money power that is behind politics and war, and also the ultimate goal of this money power of achieving a world government on the basis of promoting peace. Curtis Dall describes how these people continually use the the innocuous term \\"peace\\" to achieve their goal. That interested me because in the book of Daniel we read...and by peace shall destroy many.(Daniel 8:25)The downside of the book is the events described involve alot of hearsay. For example, the author writes about Harry Hopkins giving money plates to the Soviet Union to print our currency. I haven't seen this documented anywhere, so we have to take the author on his word alone. This is a good book nevertheless; and one can gain more insight into the truth from Curtis Dall's personal experience."},{"Title":"Beowulf the Warrior","review":"This handy edition of Beowulf has the virtue of being easily approachable by an average reader, whereas some of the other translations I've seen have almost been like reading the original Anglo-Saxon itself. The translation reads easily yet retains the flavor and rhythms of the ancient epic.Though it's still a little advanced for my kids (under age 6), it will definitely be bedtime fare in the not-too-distant future. For those unfamiliar with the story, it tells the tale of Beowulf and his battles against awful Grendel, the hideous mother of Grendel, and the terrible fire-breathing dragon. This edition includes a number of illustrations which will certainly help draw younger readers into the story.If you enjoyed Beowulf and want to know more about the Anglo-Saxon language, you might tryA Book For The Beginner In Anglo-saxon: Comprising A Short Grammar and Some Selections from the Gospels. If you just like epic poems, there's alsoThe Laviniad: An Epic Poemwhich is an epic in the Trojan War cycle written by a modern author and the classicThe Ballad of the White Horseby G. K. Chesterton."},{"Title":"Beowulf the Warrior","review":"My children (6 and 7 years old) thoroughly enjoyed listening to how the mighty and brave Beowulf defeated the evil Grendel and his Mother. The book is written very well and lends itself to a great deal of imagery. I was very glad this classic could be written in a manner that small children could understand and enjoy this great story."},{"Title":"Beowulf the Warrior","review":"from the hardback edition published 1961, Henry Z. Walck, Incorporated, New York\\" Here is a spirited version of the oldest English verse epic. With tremendous power and memorable simplicity, Ian Serraillier has retold the heroic saga of the warrior who in his youth delivered Hrothgar the Dane from the menace of Grendel, the night-prowling monster; and who in his old age fought his last victorious but fatal battle against the dreadful dragon who ravaged the land of the Geats. The verse follow the pattern of the original poem closely, rekindling the fire and vigor of the unknown author who first wrote down this magnificent story, more than a thousand years ago.\\"\\"To venture on the story of Beowulf in verse, whether for children or adults, is a deed with its own kind of heroism. ...There must be a hundred ways of failing; Mr. Serraillier has hit on one of the ways to succeed. In about 800 lines of well-wrought verse, suitable for reading aloud, and free from the stale smells of lamp and candle, he establishes a manly narrative...\\"\\"-Times (London) Literary Supplement\\"Absolutely terrific retelling that condenses the Beowulf story to about 800 lines from the original 3812, while keeping the tone and intent intact. In my opinion it is a literary work of genius, and of great understanding of the original tome. Read aloud for grades 2/3 thru high school. (for sensitive children do not tackle till grades 4/6 due to blood and battle scenes) Independent read for grades 5/6 thru adult, but really best for late jr. high and all thru high school, even as prep for college literature classes.This retelling is well-complemented by Beowulf by Michael Morpurgo for grades 5-12. For the Beowulf story for younger readers, grades 2/3 to 5/6, I recommend The Dragon Slayer by Rosemary Sutcliff.PS- Beowulf is much more likely to appeal to the male gender."},{"Title":"Beowulf the Warrior","review":"I was lucky enough to find a hardcover, library-bound, 1961 version of this book at a booksale, so my review is for the story itself, rather than the book being sold. This retelling of the story is easily read aloud and brings with it the beauty of the original language of the poem. Other children's versions tell the story, but in a way that loses much of the magic, in my opinion. The illustrations are gorgeous! Some may be scary to young listeners, though. Do take advantage of the \\"Look Inside\\" feature to preview some of them. I am happy to see this classic reprinted and available to purchase."},{"Title":"Beowulf the Warrior","review":"Beowulf (Signet Classics)My youngest son has been wildly enamoured of Beowulf for the past 40 years.

Strains, sprains, spasms and disc problems are the cited sources of back pain. Treatmentmodalities are bed rest, exercise, spinal manipulation, braces, pharmaceuticals, counter stimulation chemonucleolysis andacupuncture. The details of spinal surgery are described ingreat detail. For instance,&quot; In a simple fusion procedure, the surgeon makes an incision-usually in the back, but sometimes in the abdomen-aboutthree inches long and, as in a discectomy, pushes asidemuscles and ligaments to reach the vertebrae. He attaches bone grafts, about the size and shape of matchsticks, onto the facet joints. Larger pieces of bone are used between vertebrae.Over time-generally four to nine months-the bones and bonegrafts grow together, and the two vertebrae are fused into a single, solid unit.&quot;The author provides numerous prevention strategies whichanticipate back pain.

While not a technical text, per se, it is much more than a &quot;dummies&quot; handbook. It is a concise, well-written guide to both the history and current state of rebreather diving systems. It is also well-illustrated, with excellent diagrams and tables. After reading this book the reader will have a good grounding in rebreather technology, and its important safety issues, and be able to not only evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the increasing number of recreational rebreathers being offered for sale, but whether this kind of technical diving is really suited for them. Rebreathers do not suffer fools, and this kind of diving is not a substitute for the relative simplicity of open circuit SCUBA using compressed air.

However, it is clearly a casebook to be used in a class; trying to read it without professorial guidance can be difficult. This is true of any casebook; though material and ideas are clearly presented here, the material itself is dense and complex. If you're a 1-L and have KCP as your casebook, you'll have an excellent grasp of contract law at the end of the course if you read everything your professor assigns out of the book. But do read it all."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"I found the plot of &quot;Black Star&quot; pretty unrealistic, but it was audacious enough that I'm giving the book four stars.The story starts a bit slow, but the last half of the book makes up for it, with many exciting descriptions of military conflicts. Character development is not all that great, but above average for a techno-thriller.The best parts of the book are the fantastic descriptions of aerial dogfights and naval battles. Surprisingly, I thought that some of the battle scenes between various Taiwanese and Chinese naval vessels were more exciting than the aerial shoot-outs. Robert Gandt is good at making both kinds of combat scenes come alive.My criticism about the lack of realism in the plot concerns the mission launched by the U.S. and Taiwanese military to steal an advanced Chinese stealth fighter. This sounds pretty crazy to me - I'm sure that in a real wartime situation that the allied forces would decide to simply destroy this aircraft. After all, the Chinese built this airplane using plans (stolen from the USA) for a corresponding American airplane. Why risk major loses trying to steal military &quot;secrets&quot; that you already have?Still, it's an audacious undertaking and the story of how the mission works out is very exciting.Another plus point is that there is some humor in the story. For example, there's an Air Force Major who fills the role of providing comic relief.On the other hand, an additional minus point is that a totally unnecessary extra conflict takes place in the last chapter.If you like military techno-thrillers about naval warfare in general and especially about naval aviation then I'd like to recommend this book.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Reviewer: Bill Vitale, fellow Marchetti pilot and avid Brick Maxwell fanIn his latest novel, Gandt's alter ego, Brick Maxwell, once again enthralls the reader with his hair-raising exploits as an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot aboard the USS Ronald Reagan in the South China Sea. An implacable malcontent has stolen the highly-classified plans for a Super Stealth fighter from the skunk works in Groom Lake, Nevada and has delivered them into the evil hands of The People's Republic Of China. In a desperate attempt to prevent an all-out war with Taiwan, Maxwell's mission is to defuse an imminent holocaust by slipping behind the enemy lines with a beautiful Chinese defector to search, seize and destroy. A bit far-fetched, perhaps, but nonetheless a well-told story by a master of intrigue. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to Gandt's next episode."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Open this book and it does not take long to figure out that Robert Gandt really knows his stuff. He has a \\"been there, done that\\" style you just can't fake. Mr. Gandt manages to be both thrilling yet technically accurate in his depictions of carrier operations, hairball dogfights and yes...trying to figure out the opposite sex. His latest in the \\"Brick\\" Maxwell series is also the deepest in terms of scenario and intrigue that introduces an interesting twist to a real potential threat. Gandt puts you front and center in the action. He had me sitting on the edge of my ejection seat. I highly recommend Black Star and look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Gandt has stuck gold again in this &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell novel about a conflict between Taiwan and China. It is an action-packed treasure of an adventure, with a great plot and lifelike characters.The measure of a technothriller author is his ability to write a work of fiction that reeks with realism. Gandt has done this for the third time. His experience in the Navy as a fighter pilot allows him to describe aspects of combat and life aboard ship that a bestselling accountant (you know who I'm talking about) can never seem to get right. For example, the first scene actually feels like you are there, landing a jet on the back of an aircraft carrier, and keeping your eye on the &quot;meatball.&quot; And speaking of combat, there is plenty of it in this novel, some personal, some naval, most in the air, but thrilling and realistic. Gandt does not let up until the last page.If you are a fan of Coonts, Huston, Brown, or any other air combat author, this is a novel for you... and by the way, even though this is the third &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell novel in the series, Gandt tactfully avoids giving away plots of previous novels, so they can be read out of order.Sadly, Gandt did not mention in the bio at the end of the novel if he is working on another novel...like he did in previous ones...so I'm hoping he'll keep writing..."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"This is the first Gandt book that I have read. I was a bit skeptical because most of the time the authors of these type of books get overly technical. However, I took the advice of a fellow Amazon reviewer and I am glad I did. The book is about a stolen defense contractor's plans for a ultra-stealthy plane that is invisible. The Chinese have developed the plane and use it to attack the Tiawanese president's plane, thus igniting a war. The U.S. Aircraft Carrier in the area gets involved to try and frustrate the Chinese' efforts. I found this an interesting, fast moving book and Brick Maxwell is a believable, yet swash-buckling hero."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Mr. Gandt knows how to write a book. He keeps the technical jargon to a minimum and when he uses it he lets the readers know what he means by it. Great combat scenes carry the book along with the reader being able to get inside the character's minds. The only drawback of this book is that the crew of USS Ronald Reagan is not in it as much as the previous two books. Other than that, an exceptional book that you will for sure want to read (but do not miss the first two books of the &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell series). Mr. Gandt I am anxiously awaiting the next book and many more in this series."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Acts of Vengence and Hostile Intent were great, but I really loved Black Star. The realism and characters were super. I can't wait for the next book (assuming there is a next one). I have nothing to read now."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Bob Gandt has done it again! He takes us flying by the seat of our pants into another hair-raising thriller. This time he introduces us into stealth technology and what it feels like to fly a supersonic stealth fighter--to be visible one moment and invisible the next. It changes our whole concept of the aerial dog-fight. And again he develops a plot that is entirely possible in a world whose values are turning upside down between terrorism and the race for global power. Just as it happens in \\"Black Star,\\" when Taiwan pre-empts another world war with its retaliation against the threat of a Chinese invasion, a small power could trigger a colossal 'nuclear showdown.' It's a fair question to ask: Has China ever stopped being the West's enemy or is it just more insidious in hiding its expansionist ambitions toward Taiwan and the Pacific Rim while it gains economical strength and global status? Our economies woo China just as North American industrials wooed Nazi Germany prior to World War II. Are we playing into China's hands and will Gandt's book become a preview of what our next generation of top guns will be fighting?It's the reality of the plot that makes Gandt's book so chilling at the same time as it showcases Brad Maxwell and his fighter team of F/A-18 Super Hornets. Again Gandt takes us inside Maxwell's cockpit to feel the maximum pull of gravity as 'we' maneuver in fight-to-the-death aerial combat. The thrill of the story and the plausibility of the plot are not Gandt's greatest strengths, however. It is his ability to carry readers inside the heads and experiences of what our fighting forces are currently experiencing in battles against the war on terrorism all over the world. He helps us understand why our military people put their lives on the line every day, and he brings home a sense of patriotism that, for North Americans, decades of complacency, political cynicism and living on the fast track lost. And he does this with page-turning urgency.Bob Gandt has established himself as the Robert Ludlum of the military thriller, and I look forward to a prolific succession of Gandt books in the years to come."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Robert Gandt's &quot;Black Star&quot; is an average, at best, highly implausible tale surrounding a military conflict between Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China. A jet transporting the President of Taiwan and escorted by 4 U.S. Navy Super Hornet fighter jets is shot down by an undetected enemy source. The escort lead by U.S. Navy wing commander, former astronaut and Gandt hero Sam &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell is baffled by the inexplicable disaster. Unfortunately the action leads to a shooting war between the PRC and Taiwan. The U.S. military has officially been ordered to remain neutral but secretly is supporting Taiwan.It is soon revealed that the Chinese have stolen sensitive stealth technology courtesy of the traitorous Raymond Lutz, disgruntled former Navy man and Maxwell rival. Through Lutz's treason, the Chinese have developed the Black Star, an invisible fighter jet responsible for the death of the Taiwanese president. The Black Star is now inflicting massive damage to both the Taiwanese Navy and Air Force and tipping the scales of battle toward the PRC.Maxwell, a test pilot who has flown the U.S. version of the Black Star, is recruited by Taiwan's special forces to penetrate the defenses of PRC to either steal or destroy the Chinese plane.Gandt, a former Navy aviator obviously possesses vast technical knowledge but presents a scripted, cookie cutter novel. The book contains the standard handsome, straight toothed hero, the obligatory love story and comes off as the result of a &quot;how to write a novel&quot; assignment. The book was a bit of a struggle to get through."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Great read hard to put down excellent from start to finish will read all the books from this author end"},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"..a very well written techno/fiction/war/thriller, good characters and well told story...very recommandable !The follow up book is as good too..."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Maxwell get it done again in fine style.

Even though almost a decade old from publication date, the theme very easily could be today's near future-time reality."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"This review is for all 5 books in the series, since I found I had to get them as quickly as I could and read most of them in a day. Definitely page-turners.If you have been, or know, people in the U.S. Navy, especially aviators, and you have a fondness for the service, as I do, I think you will find this series immensely rewarding. As a Navy brat with an uncle who was a Navy pilot, it had great immediacy for me. If you watched, and liked, the character of Harmon Rabb in the TV series \\"JAG,\\" you will relate to this series as well, since some of the best episodes involved his carrier flying when he wasn't a lawyer, and the lingo (e.g., \\"call the ball\\") is much the same. If you find the Middle East a quagmire and its intricacies interesting, again, you will like the series.They are intense, and I would advise reading the books in order as they build on what came before, though you needn't do that. The main characters are very well-developed as the books evolve, and they all center on combat pilot Sam \\"Brick\\" Maxwell, his missions, his love life, his concepts of the chain of command, morale, so much else. The combat scenes are great, and I loved the dialogue as well. And for Kindle books, very well-edited. Just a few of the usual transpositions of words and the like.The best recommendation I can give is that I was sad when each book ended. I don't really see how there could be another one, but with Mr. Gandt, you never know. I wouldn't mind one bit (hint!)"},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Agree with some of the derogatory comments.... stereotypical character development and implausible scenarios (am not too keen on this new stealth \\"functionality\\"). In addition I found many plot points predictable. But, for a quick popcorn read it moves along quickly and is a fun ride. I rated a 4-star, but in reality a 3.5.And.... the editors note plus various reviews mention a war with Taiwan.... my 2012 Kindle version is a potential war with VietNam. My version mentions a previous war with Taiwan, but does not go into detail about that war's outcome."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"It's nice to see Bob Gandt continue his tradition of fast moving realistic action in Black Star. In my opinion, and it's just my opinion, this book starts out slightly slower than his first two, but whoa baby, when it takes off, it does so like a Hornet from a catapult! Once again as with his first two books, don't start unless you have nothing else to do for the next couple of days because you can not put it down no matter how hard you try. Seems every time you get to the end of an action scene and decide to mark the page, something else starts right up and there you go again. In fact, I can't even see using a bookmark on Bob Gandt's books because you can't stop reading it anyway! Was the plot believable? Hey, in this world anything is possible! Another great adventure. Thanks Bob."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"I admit that I like these kinds of books. Gandt can write a good story, but leave the sappy romance [...]to sappy romance writers.In some ways this seemed like modern version of Firefox. (instead of thought controlled fighters, we are dealing with next generation stealth aircraft).Gandt makes it pretty clear that the Black Star trades agility for stealth, so the criticisms regarding the air battle seem unwarranted. I thought the naval engagements and the commando raid scenes were very well depicted. Although, for a thirty minute raid, it went on for 80 or 90 pages. This tended to lose the tension.The book did capture essense of the PRC/ROC conflict, what it failed to grasp was the economic and strategic importance of the Taiwan Strait. Over 90% of computer motherboards pass through the strait, and I do not think the United States or Japan could tolerate the economic disruption caused by a conflict. Therefore, I think the United States would intervene militarily against the aggressors.The last chapters with his girl friend, the DC cop and the bad guy traitor really tarnish the preceding 320 pages. Next time quash the desire to make everything tie out in the end - life isn't like that."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"The plot has been outlined in several reviews, so I will tell you how I felt after reading the book. I read action books all of the time, including the rest of the \\"Brick Maxwell\\" series. You can expect stereotyped characters, implausible scenarios, infighting amongst the \\"good guys,\\" and lots of things getting blown up. That's why I read them - to go on an adventure and not get caught up in technobabble and find out what a character's dynamic range is. With that said, I was not disappointed with this book. The scenarios depicted in this book were very unlikely and (of course)Brick flew to the rescue. I must say that unlike in his other books, the aerial combat was not the most entertaining part of the story. The sea combat between Taiwanese and Chinese naval forces and the commando raid into mainland China were the best battles in the book. They did not disappoint. That was unexpected and refreshing. There were some corny moments at the end of the book involving romance and jealousy. I would have ended the book when the shooting war ended. All in all, this book was a very enjoyable, action-packed read. If you want some fun, shoot 'em ups, where the good guys ultimately win, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Black Star","review":"Having nevr read a Robert Gandt novel until this one, I was more than pleasantly surprised.

Forester's shorter stories about World War II. It was published shortly after his death. Forester is, of course, best known as the creator of Horatio Hornblower, but he also wrote a number of other books, including some excellent stories of war at sea in the 20th century.Eight of the nine pieces in this collection are classic World War II short fiction: the last story in the collection is a well argued counterfactual history called \\"If Hitler had invaded England.\\"The first five stories, including the title story \\"Gold from Crete\\" itself, follow the adventures of Captain George Crowe RN and the flotilla of destroyers under his command. Crowe and his destroyers deal with missions from extracting refugees and treasure under enemy fire to diplomacy, and are opposed by every imaginable enemy from Stukas and U-boats to a very naughty monkey.The next three stories could almost have been put into the book as a tribute to three other groups of people who fought the Nazis at the risk of their lives. \\"An egg for the Major\\" is about soldiers at war in the desert; \\"Eagle Squadron\\" is about an RAF fighter squadron; and \\"The Dumb Dutchman\\" is about an unlikely hero who opposed the nazis in perhaps the most terrifying way of all - as a spy.The final part of the book \\"If Hitler had invaded England\\" is a counterfactual history. Forester set out to explore what might have happened if, instead of waiting the Luftwaffe to secure air superiority over the RAF (which of course they never did), Hitler had ordered an invasion immediately after the Dunkirk evacuation on June 4th 1940.Forester wrote this piece because a lot of people had said that if Hitler had invaded England in June 1940 he could have won the war, and Forester set out to analyse whether this was possible. He wrote in the preamble that Hitler \\"must be given every possible chance, but none of the impossible ones.\\"Counterfactuals are ten a penny these days, but this was an unusual thing to write at the time: it compares very well with the many WWII counterfactuals which have been written over the following forty years.Channel 4 has just (January 2009) screened a documentary, \\"The Real Dad's Army\\" which mentions an Anglo-German wargame run some years after the war involving some of the real commanders who would have been involved on both sides and featuring Hitler's real invasion plans, to see what might have happened if Operation Sealion had gone ahead. While the details were not necessarily the same, in overall outline the results of an invasion according to this very detailed wargame based on real information would have been very similar indeed to the analysis which Forester on his own projected in \\"If Hitler had invaded England.\\" Unless he had heard of the wargame, which I don't think he had (I suspect it took place after his death), that is a tribute to the clarity of C.S. Forester's thinking.I strongly recommend this book. If you like it, there are three other C.S. Forester works of fiction set at sea during world war II which may appeal to you. They are \\"The Good Shepherd\\" which is about a convoy escort mission during the battle of the Atlantic; \\"The man in the yellow raft,\\" a short story collection set on a US destroyer during the Pacific war; and best of all \\"The Ship\\" which is an absolutely brilliant account of a light cruiser in action while defending a Malta convoy against greatly superior forces."},{"Title":"Gold From Crete","review":"These ten stories are among the best CS Forester ever wrote, and they are some of the best war stories ever written. Forester published most of these during the war in the Saturday Evening Post, and they have an immediacy about them and an uncertainty regarding the future that makes them more compelling. My favorite, however, is the last story, a splendidly done alternative history Forester wrote in 1960, 'If Hitler Had Invaded England.' Forester persuasively writes of an outcome determined by all the factors on the British and German sides right after Dunkirk, and--I won't spoil the ending, but I guarantee it's a real page-turner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Navajo Folk Art: The People Speak","review":"The authors, collectors of American folk art, traveled the Navajo Nation.

The previous owner had noted that this was a book that was easy to pick up and just as easy to put down. It was the kind of book to be kept in the kitchen to be read while waiting for a pot to boil! These comments capture my feelings towards the book rather well. The authors take the reader on a tour of the seventeen London boroughs that are outside the \\"City\\". The tours, one borough per chapter, are related partially as a first person narrative of their travels and partly as very brief bits of history. Brief in that the longest items might be a couple of paragraphs while most are one or two sentences. As a result the reader comes across a constant stream of facts and after a small amount of time feels as if he is drowning in minutia. Cautiously recommended as a curiosity, but not recommended for any serious study or long term reading pleasure."},{"Title":"The lone star ranger;: A romance of the border,","review":"This review refers to the kindle edition of The Lone Star Ranger by Zane GreyA wonderful tale of the west; of rustlers, of outlaws, of Texas and The Rangers and of redemption.Buck Duane had his father's blood in him. That blood that boiled up, that had a killer instinct. The blood of a gunman. But he also had his mother's blood; the blood that calmed, blood of honor. When taunted into a shootout by another gunman, Cal Bain, with an evil reputation, his blood rose and his honor sent him searching out the other. Bain drew, but Duane was fast. It was his first kill.The saga of Buck Duane leads him to the life of a loner, and outlaw. His adventures lead him through a life and loneliness and doing what he must to stay alive and hidden. His instinct and honor leading him into some dangerous situations. Saving lives, taking lives. his reputation growing by leaps and bounds as a tough, fast gunman, even as often happens getting murders pinned on him that he had nothing to do with. As the years pass, the guilt never lets him rest.When offered the chance to become an undercover Ranger and redeem himself, most especially in his own eyes, he doesn't need to think twice. As the title of the book suggests, he does just that. The assignment is a tough one in more ways than one. His risks his life to accomplish the mission and also falls in love along the way.Zane Grey is such a wonderful story teller. He puts you right into the hearts and minds of the very colorful characters he creates for us, right down to the Texas drawls.Heroes to cheer, villains to jeer. He paints a very vivid picture, transporting the reader back to the old west.One of the things I love about a Grey novel is the beautifully written descriptions of the land. There were a few times, in this book, that there may have been just a bit too much. I think one entire chapter had Duane on the escape, and Grey describing just about every rock and tree on his route with no dialogue at all, other than Duane's occasional thoughts. I wanted to get back to the action. There was also one story-line I felt was not tied up. If not for those couple of minor things, I would have gone 5 stars on this story.The Kindle edition - 5008 Locations. All in all a pretty smooth read, no major formatting problems, nothing to take away from the enjoyment of the book. A few typos. There is a Table of Contents, however it is cut short, which is no big deal as it only lists the chapter numbers(no chapter titles.) It is divided into Book I - The Outlaw (this one has all the chapter numbers listed) and Book II - The Ranger - then it cuts off, not listing the chapter numbers and the book starts on the very next page.Saddle Up with Zane Grey and enjoy.....Laurie"},{"Title":"The lone star ranger;: A romance of the border,","review":"What has traditionally been one of the best selling of Zane Grey's novels, and considered by some to be one of his best, I find far inferior to the two novels from which this book was created by the editors at Harper Brothers. The two novels, Last of the Duanes and Rangers of the Lone Star stand far above this book. There are too many missing events and characters in this version. The female love interest is completely missing in Part Two of the book and there are many other unanswered questions created by the melding of these two works. But, if one is to have a complete set of Zane Grey, then this book is collectable and readable; but NOT one of his best. It is however far superior to anything being published today.

I discovered this book purely by accident while I was browsing the picture book section, but I'm glad I did-it's a beautiful little treasure for any childhood library.In the urban setting of Milk Street one night, the moon comes down. And all the children come to help dressed as firemen and policemen, all eager to fix things. The text is very simple, perfect to be read to a very young child or read by a child just learning to read. In some ways the restful and gentle nature of the lyrical words reminds me of GOODNIGHT MOON, but the similarities end there. The warmly colored gouache and mixed media pictures are simply drawn, depending on a soft cartoon style rather than detailed-realistic. They work perfectly with the words and subject, creating an almost dream-like feel to this story. All the characters are children in their pajamas and animals, all running to help. This is a proactive tale, a positive story of an emergency that is solved by cooperation. And, by the time the children wish each other goodnight and go off to bed, readers know they well deserve their peaceful sleep.This book tackles some important issues. Anyone familiar with what happened on 9/11 in 2001 will be quick to see similarities here. The pictures of children clothed in police and firefighter gear gathered in the street and all pitching in to help is an echo of similar images people saw after the events of 9/11. The moon dust on their pajamas even echoes the soot. But the reflection isn't brutal or dark; the similarities are gentle reminders-not scary. And the message is positive, and essential for children to hear. When an emergency happens, people will band together to help \\"set things right again.\\" It teaches children a powerful lesson within a fairly gently told tale that will inspire hope, not fear.This isn't a book about 9/11, of course. It can be read to cover many different traumatic events and emergencies. On the first page of the book, the author makes mention of Fred Rogers \\"when he was a child, if he ever came across a car accident or some other terrifying scene his mother would tell him, \`Look for the helpers.'\\" And that's what this book is about. Helpers. It is a tribute to them, and an inspiration to a new generation of them.I'd recommend this book for children anywhere from age 1-4, and especially for children who might be coping with fears or worries that this addresses. This is a remarkable little book and deserves some recognition for the beautiful art, musical prose and important message.Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad"},{"Title":"The Moon Came Down on Milk Street","review":"Late one night on Milk Street the moon falls from the sky!

I found Huxley's account of his trip round Guatemala, Mexico and the Caribbean boring. For him, Indians are uncivilized. \\"The village Indian can read, but his mind is so conditioned that he cannot understand what he reads,\\" he says. Still, it seems Huxley doesn't think much of the masses in general; \\"The intrinsic and congenital stupidity of the majority is as great as it ever was. Universal education has created an immmense class of what I may call the New Stupid.\\"After reading this, I would classify Huxley among his ranks of the New Stupid. He states on page 152 that \\"to civilize primitives may be impossible\\". He seems to have been influenced (brainwashed?) by D.H. Lawrence's book The Plumed Serpent. According to Huxley, \\"No-one has ever written more forcibly than Lawrence in The Plumed Serpent of the hopeless squalor and stuffiness of human beings who have not yet reached the spiritual and mental stage of consciousness.\\" In an Indian colonel he sees \\"a profound, hopeless melancholy\\". Huxley's explanation: \\"He had, I suppose, enough of our education to make him aware of his own Indianness.\\"After reading this, I suspect that people like Huxley and Lawrence had reached the stage of hopeless stuffiness, although it's not clear if Huxley shared Lawrence's view, as expressed in vol 3 of the Letters of D.H. Lawrence, that \\"To learn plainly to hate mankind, to detest the spawning human being, that is the only cleanliness now,\\" but it seems he was at least on the way to such a perspective."},{"Title":"The London Scene: Six Essays on London Life","review":"I enjoy reading about London and this book just fit the bill."},{"Title":"Expository Writing (Grades 4-8)","review":"This book captures the emotions of expository writing.

She also learnt the meaning of 'sad'. Old bear is a story of lasting friendship, teamwork among stuffed toys, and a daring airborne rescue bid. Contrary to one review, the pictures are not 'sugary-sweet', Our very discerning daughter loves them, and actually, so do I.

Eighteen-year-old Emma volunteers to go because of concerns regarding her younger sister's health. After hearing Dain's speech to the king, Gavin knows that Dain would prefer revenge to a bride, but yields only because of oath of fealty to the king. Besides, Emma knows she won't find a husband closer to home. Too many men knew of her education and magical abilities, preferring to wed more docile and mundane women.In Cornwall, Dain's immediate attraction to Emma leaves him stunned. He had prepared to wed a child of seven, expecting to put her away before she was old enough to wed. Instead, he found himself married to a striking beauty determined to make herself useful to him and his people. Even as he treats her with suspicion, Dain comes to realize that Emma's passion for him is genuine. Too bad he accepted responsibility for a feud he cannot put aside. Indeed, it irks him that he can find no fault in her. As each piece of the past comes to light, revealing the truth surrounding the feud between the families, the tension and betrayals increase.Flora Speer weaves a surprisingly complex tale against a medieval tapestry. Threads of magic interspersed with strong emotion result in a romance filled with bewitching passion and sweeping intensity. The use of magic is selective, never overpowering the narrative, yet helping it to move along smoothly. Indeed, A PASSIONATE MAGIC is a moving and beautiful tale of love determined to grow under tremendous odds. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Passionate Magic (Heartspell)","review":"There has been a feud between the houses of Wroxley and Penruan for generations. King Henry decides on an ending to the feud: marry Dain of Penruan to one of Wroxley's daughters. It was decided that Alys would go, but her older half-sister Emma asks to take her place because Alys is sickly and is only a child. Emma faces severs hostility at Penruan. Dain cannot trust her because his mother has poisoned his mind against anyone bearing the name. While his mother is away, Emma works in the still room with herbs and herbal remedies. She has magical ability, but hides it because Dain is biased against magic. Emma's life becomes infinitely more difficult when Dain's mother comes home. She is a bitter, poisonous woman full of unreasonable rage and false piety. She does everything she can to undermine Emma and remind Dain of the feud. He resists his mother's hateful words, but will he still support Emma when he learns of her magical abilities... and her true parentage? I would have liked to see Emma do magic earlier in the book, but I enjoyed the characters of Emma, Agatha, Vivienne, and Hermit. And the addition of the legend of Merlin and Nimue was a nice touch. An enjoyable work."},{"Title":"A Passionate Magic (Heartspell)","review":"Well I've read several other books by Flora Speer and I've always enjoyed them. This one was ok, not great. The back cover sounded better than the story turned out to be. There really wasn't much interaction between the hero and the heroine. Even the love scenes were so mild I wasn't sure that they had done anything. The Hero Dain has agreed to marry the daughter of his enemy to settle a feud that has been going on for generations. Emma, the heroine is sent instead of her 7 year old sickly sister. She is a magician but fears that if she tells Dain the truth he will hurt her in some way. She falls for him and he is hopelessly drawn to her even though he fights it. I didn't like the fact that he had very short cropped hair which looks like on the cover like it's been bleached. He looks too modern.

Yet in 1129, King Henry listened to Lord Dain's complaint and ruled that his rival Baron Gavin of Wroxley will hand over one of his daughters in marriage to end the dispute. Gavin hates handing over any of his children to Dain because he fears for them at the hands of the angry noble. He chooses his ailing seven-year-old daughter Alys, but eighteen-year-old Emma offers to go instead. The honorable Gavin raised Emma as his own, but though only three people know the truth she is not of his blood. Alys is the oldest of his seed. Still Emma persuades him and goes to live with Dain.In Cornwall, Dain is stunned that he is attracted to his &quot;guest.&quot;.Emma believes that she has found love at first sight, but must persuade Dain they belong together. However, though he begins to fall in love too, he seeks the reason why she came instead of the intended Alys because he mistrusts her family. However, he cannot deny that Emma with her healing abilities has captured his heart and that of his people except for his mother who hates her.A PASSIONATE MAGIC is an enchanting medieval romance that uses a magical element and tons of distrust to foster a power tale. The story line is loaded, as the key charcaters, including several secondary players whose appearances are limited, seem genuine. The cast makes the plot hum and brings alive an era of machinations at every level of society yet still allows fabulous Flora Speer to write that the real magic is in love.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Passionate Magic (Heartspell)","review":"I am not much for these type books, but truly enjoyed this book.Atop a seaside cliff at the edge of the windswept moors of Cornwall stood the forbidding castle that Lady Emma would now call home.

But when she first lifted her gaze to the turquoise eyes of her lord, she sensed that he was the man she had seen in her most intimate visions.Dain of Penruan was her destiny.

It has been edited by David Boaz, executive vp of Cato and author and editor of several other books regarding libertarianism. Cato is a public policy institute headquartered in DC that promotes limited government, free markets, peaceful coexistence and a return to the rule of law as envisioned by our founders, especially Madison and Jefferson. While this political philsophy is generally known as libertarianism, it is more correctly labeled the dominance of civil rather than political society. As a disclaimer, this reviewer has been a member of the Board of Directors of Cato for fifteen years and regards David Boaz as a friend; however, those who know me will vouch that I have been an vocal critic of Cato on those occasions where I have disagreed with its policy positions. Therefore, despite my position, I believe that my review provides a useful summary of this book.The editor provides an introduction which attempts to summarize the changes in the political landscape over the past quarter century and concludes that classical liberalism is on the ascendancy after a century of many failed experiments in statism.The book is then divided into nine topics with several selections for each topic - these are Ideas and Consequences (3 articles), Economic Growth (3 articles), The Welfare State (5), The Regulatory State (4), A World In Transition (11), Foreign Affairs (4), Trade And international Finance (4), Law And Liberty (8), and Democracy And Culture (8). Read in order, which few readers will probably do due to both time constaints and lack of interest in some of the topics, the book provides both a wonderful retrospective on the changes in the political debate over the past twenty five years and also serves as a comprehensive overview of the relevance of these ideas today. The authors include such well known figures as Milton Friedman, Alan Greenspan, an interview with F.A. Hayek, Dick Armey, Lord Peter Bauer, Jose Pinera and Antonin Scalia, but regardless of the fame of the author all pieces are both enlightening and intellectually stimulating. P.J O'Rourke's brief comments at the dedication of Cato's current headquarters, titled \\"THe Right To Do As You Please And Take The Consequences\\" even adds some trenchant and well directed wit to the collection. The longest piece is only fourteen pages and several are only three pages in lenghth, so while some of the topics are difficult if the ideas are new to the reader any can be digested in a single session.It is impossible to chose a few favorites, although I thought the strongest topic was the collection regarding law and liberty; perhaps that is only due to my intense interest in the area and my belief that a return to the Constitutional protections of life, liberty and property are essential to our continued freedom. And I do strongly recommend that everyone read the article by Scalia (as a judge on the Court of Appeals) and the brilliant critique and reply by Ricahard Epstein. For some added flavor, some of the other articles include \\"The Case For US Stategic Independence\\" (Ted Carpenter), \\"Myths Of Individualism\\" (Tom Palmer), \\"Are Libertarians Anti-Government\\" (David Boaz), and \\"Enviro-Capitalism Vs. Enviro-Statism\\" (Terry Anderson and Donald Leal).In conclusion, this book is for anyone who cares about the advancement of liberty and wants to sharpen their understanding of the topics which it covers. If you want to understand these ideas, whether to argue for or against them, there is no comparable collection that covers them so succinctly and states them so well by their most ardent proponents. N.B., the book is 460 pages long, not the 250 indicated in the description, and all the material is worthwhile but it is a long read that has to be accomplished gradually."},{"Title":"Toward Liberty: The Idea That Is Changing the World","review":"Boaz has assembled a very fine collection of essays regarding liberty and the failings of modern societies to create a world in which we can live as free men. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in libertarian (or for that matter free market or conservative) political thought.Just to tone down my entheusiasm a bit, though, I would add that many of the essays may seem a little elementary to someone who has been reading libertarian publications for a long time.

Designers with the experience and cleverness to engineer good applications are in demand.This book provides an excellent guide for both the novice and experienced application designer. Balentine and Morgan are both well known and well respected in the User Interface and Speech Processing technical communities.The book covers a wide variety of topics useful in creating speech recognition applications: speech output, speech recognition, natural language understanding, vocabulary suggestions, testing, etc. All of the topics are covered from an intensely practical approach. The authors provide lots of guidelines for application dialog definition, and distinguish required from recommended practices. They make an effort to point out good design practices. A careful reader of this book can not help but become a better dialog designer and application developer.But this book is not just a cookbook, or a list of guidelines. Balentine and Morgan make sure the reader understands why a recommendation is made. In difficult or controversial areas, they discuss important issues that affect the application dialog.

Everyone I know loves it! Can anyone tell me what Portraits sequel name is?"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Western Action Stories","review":"Sometimes, you really can tell a book by its cover. My hardcover edition is colored in red and desert gold blends and has got a picture on it of a tough-looking hombre, with a star pinned to his vest, firing a pistol with his left-hand and leaning against his horse's saddle and writing a note with his right hand (\\"rustlers cornered Red Gulch HELP sheriff\\").There isn't any story in this volume that corresponds with this picture, but who cares? It captures the flavor of the text well enough.Jon Tuska's collection of traditional Western action stories is immensely readable and made especially interesting by his running commentary. For the most part, these stories were written early in the 20th century as dime novels or as articles contributed to Western periodicals during the Golden Era of this type of story.While all of the tales have the satisfying \\"feel\\" that a good Western action story should bring, it's remarkable to observe that the \\"West\\" is more a state of mind than a geographic point of reference or a specific lifestyle. The stories are set as far east as Arkansas (which I would have thought of as a \\"Southern\\" state, as opposed to a \\"Western\\" one) and as far north as Montana.The characters from whose vantage point the stories are told include the usual assortment of cowpunchers, sheriffs, ranch detectives, pioneers, and gunfighters, but they also include a construction engineer and a banker. And although the era of the \\"Old West\\" is believed to have ranged from sometime in the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th, there is actually one story in this volume in which our hero rides, not a Shetland pony, but one of Henry Ford's battered mountain cars (the villain of the piece, by contrast, is a rich kid in a blue roadster).The one common thread that seems to weave relentlessly through all of these stories is the omniscient presence of the \\"Code\\" of the West. The \\"Code\\" is more easily transmitted to the reader through these stories than summarized by any third person, but roughly speaking, it's a series of directives which mandate that promises be kept, that alliances be honored, that grudges be avenged, that individuals communicate plainly (because the difference between friend and foe might depend on the manner in which the other's words or gestures are taken), that obligations be paid, that rights be boldly asserted or forever lost to those who are bolder, that justice be done, that law be taken into one's own hands when necessary to do justice, that crises of the environment or of the spirit be faced head-on, and that (unless otherwise asked) one not pry into the business of another.On occasion, there is confusion over exactly what course of action the \\"Code\\" requires, such as in the first story of the volume where the protagonist must choose between warning a benefactor about a threat to his life and honoring the mandate that one mind his own business. But most of the time, the \\"right thing to do\\" is fairly clear to the reader.The trouble is that the stories themselves, as entertaining as they are as oat operas, don't quite live up to the billing that the editor gives them as literary devices.\\"There is no other kind of American literary endeavor that has so repeatedly posed the eternal questions - how do I wish to live?, in what do I believe?, what do I want from life?, what have I to give to life? - as has the Western story,\\" Tuska declares.But the fact is that the writers of these stories don't really pose these as \\"questions\\". There's no doubt that the pioneer families in these stories are going to fulfill their manifest destiny by pressing westward and disregarding all excuses to return home. There's no doubt that Jim Laramie is going to overcome his fears and repay the hospitality of the family that has befriended him by facing down the badmen who earlier chased him out of Dodge. There's no doubt that Sheriff Milo Singer's protestations of stupidity and lack of ambition on his own part are facades designed to obscure his relentless pursuit of justice in his territory. The characters in these stories really don't agonize over these issues long enough to be compared with characters in a Greek drama, as Tuska seeks to do.Almost uniformly morose, taciturn, and persistent and reminiscent of heroes from a similar genre, the hard-boiled detective story, the heroes of the stories in this volume always ultimately follow the Code of the West, not because intense soul-searching enables them to decide that \\"this\\" is how they want to live, but simply because \\"this\\" is a role that their respective authors have designated them to fulfill in order to bring the action to a head.These should be primarily regarded as action stories, not allegories, and the heroes within them, for all their courage and tenacity, are as flat as the Arizona desert and more aptly compared to Horatio than to Hamlet.But as action stories, they work very well, and Tuska is to be commended for his choice of stories; for the loving care that he took to choose them and assemble them for this collection; for the biographical information submitted for each author; and for the memorable introduction to this genre that he provides in his forward."},{"Title":"THE PHENOMEON OF TEILHARD","review":"I was surprised that there were no reviews of this book. It deserves at least one. I disagree with the author, but I'll try to be positive anyway. The author states that his \\"analysis of Teilhard's work is highly critical.\\" That it definitely is. The author dislikes the \\"New Age\\" movement, declares that Darwinism is not a scientific fact, and links Teilhard to both. But this book contains detailed research, footnotes (not end notes, hurray!), a pair of indexes, and was published by an academic press, presumably with peer review. The foreword was from the dean of the Southern Evangelical Seminary in North Carolina. So, if you share the author's opinions, then you should find this book quite valuable. And if you prefer Teilhard's theories, this book is at least worth taking a look at just to read some objections. I gave the book two stars for content (I accept evolution), but the writing, editing and research are first class."},{"Title":"Cowboy Culture: A Saga of Five Centuries","review":"Currently there is no review here for this fine book, and it deserves one. For starters, the title for this well-researched history of 400 years of cattle raising in North America is not exactly right. It should be called \\"Cattle Culture,\\" because cattle and not cowboys are at the center of the story the author tells. And his story traces their introduction to the New World by Columbus in 1494 through to the end of the open ranges in the American West in the late 1800s. Horses, also introduced by the Spanish, are no less a part of that story, along with the cattlemen who owned, bought, sold and sometimes stole cattle, and the horsemen (vaqueros, buckaroos, and cowboys) who worked the cattle.Readers learn a great deal about cattle as a business, how the price of livestock fluctuated with demand and depended always on getting cattle to market, often many hundreds of difficult miles away. In some periods, the value of cattle was not in the beef on the hoof but in the hides and tallow. The California vaqueros, we learn, were not just herders but also expert slaughterers of cattle.Not surprisingly, a great swath of Texas history is interwoven with the rising and falling fortunes of cattlemen, and the author puts together a detailed picture of the industry as it emerged there in the mid-19th century, foundered during the Civil War, and then flourished as the railheads worked west into Kansas. But the cattle drives from Texas to cow-towns like Abilene were only some of the many that the century witnessed, as herds were driven in various directions, sometimes by west-bound settlers on the Oregon Trail, or often to meet the sudden demand for beef wherever there were gold strikes. The author provides accounts of many of these, illustrated with maps.There are many black and white period photographs in the book, which challenge the back-lot Hollywood imagery that readers are likely to have of the West. There are also informative illustrations, like that of the early western bridle called a j&aacute;quima by the Spanish-speaking vaqueros, later anglicized to \\"hackamore\\" by their American counterparts. The reader learns of many words flowing from Spanish into English, including \\"ranch,\\" from the Spanish \\"rancho.\\" The meanings of Spanish words like \\"hacienda\\" (a place where work is done) are also clarified. There are also illustrations of how to throw ropes in different ways to catch cattle and horses, how to dally a rope around a saddle horn, and the design of various kinds of barbed wire.One chapter, \\"Bunkhouse Culture,\\" is devoted to describing the fraternity of young men, mostly from the South, who came to be the Texas \\"cow-boys\\" that eventually emerged as the mythic figures on horseback that excited popular imagination. The author describes the unspoken \\"code\\" that bound them together and notes their quick passing from history as long-range drovers when barbed wire brought an end to the open range starting in the 1870s. About the same time, ranching as a corporate enterprise transformed the old conditions of loyalty between cowman and cowboy that characterized the earlier years. And so 400 years of history drew to a close.At 300+ pages, plus another 50 of notes and an index, the book is not a quick page-turner. It reads instead like a very informative and often entertaining textbook on its subject, drawing heavily on contemporary accounts from diaries, journals, and newspapers. Doing so, it brings the past to life with people, personalities, and arresting incidents. I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the American West, the origins and development of the cattle industry, and the interplay between cattle, politics, economics, and social history."},{"Title":"Cowboy Culture: A Saga of Five Centuries","review":"I enjoyed it. The title sounds like a college textbook, but the style is very conversational and there are stories on every page. The author clearly relishes his subject.

Unless you consider yourself mature and old enough to not laugh at fart jokes. I'm considered mature by various people, and yet I still find myself laughing my head off while reading this book. And I also suggest reading The Day My Butt Went Psycho!, also by Andy Griffiths first.The book is about a kid named Zack Freeman who is trouble by a very, VERY, rude butt. Zack is a good-willed but clusmy sort of kid who strives to be a butt hunter like all of his heros. Already widely considered a great butt hunter because of his heroic efforts in the first book, he finds himself failing at a Butt Hunters Training Academy and ultimately quits because he is tired of failing. But unbeknonwst to him, his parents (who frequently are on \\"tours\\" with an \\"orchestra\\") are butt hunters on a mission to Uranus when thousands of dead butts are reanimated bye an enormous explosion on the planet. Then the zombie butts go and attack Earth and yadda yadda... I don't want to ruin the ending.Zombie Butts From Uranus is a book that one should read more than once. Just like if you watch a movie multiple times in a brief period, you begin to notice all of the little things that don't seem that important, but provide a few extra laughs. And one thing that you have to do is read the covers and warning on the inside cover page.

Feral butts are runaway butts that have totally forgotten about their former rules. Runaway butts are butts detached from their owners. Rogue butts are wild and untamed. Kamikaze butts are butts that can blow themselves up. Nuclear butts are two or more butts mashed together, which can be fired from a Nuclear Butt launcher. Buttguards are butts that protect important butts.Step Four: How to Know Your ObstaclesButt boulders are many butts mashed together that can crush anything that gets under it. Buttcanoes are extinct volcanoes that have been colonized by butts. No more for this section.Step Five: The Great White ButtThe great white butt is the leader of all the butts.

N. Williamson horror novels on the cheap several years ago, but it is only now that I decided to read one of them. The covers are awfully cheesy, and Williamson does not seem to get a lot of respect or acknowledgement in the horror community, so I did not have high expectations as I entered the \\"doors\\" of Horror House. Part of the plot did indeed seem intriguing, namely the inclusion of Thomas Edison in this story. This novel is, to some degree, based on fact, at least insofar as the past events related in the novel are concerned. Edison did work on a machine he hoped would enable him to contact the dead, and apparently there was a house in Pittsburgh whose dark legacy served as the starting point for the Horror House of Williamson's story. The early parts of the novel are not bad, detailing the first acts of grisly murder that took place in the house, then detailing Edison's secret visit there to test his new device and the results he obtained when the machine actually worked. Then we are transported to the present and introduced to our three main characters. Laura Hawks is a struggling writer who takes a job working for a small publishing house run by Ben Kellogg, and the two of them begin work on a book based on the hauntings at Horror House; they are joined by parapsychologist and former Antichrist-defeater Martin Ruben, who quickly discovers that his friends are in over their heads on this one. Oddly enough, none of the ensuing action takes place anywhere near the haunted house. Instead, the story involves the discovery and reactivation of Edison's machine and the dire consequences of this action. Shedding logic and believability all along the way as it meanders to a conclusion, the story boils down to an entrapment of all of the world's evil in a localized area and the decision that must be made by our triumvirate of heroes as to how to proceed in a fight against a seemingly unbeatable foe of Evil with a capital E.Logic aside, the plot moves along fairly well, and I would not consider Hell House a bad or unreadable book at all. That being said, however, the dialogue often sounds quite forced, and more than once I found myself saying \\"Oh, for Pete's sake,\\" as a particular debate ran on and on with characters repeating the same arguments ad infinitum. I can't say the characters weren't reasonably well developed, but some combination of their descriptions and the commonly stilting dialogue combined to forestall my efforts to suspend my disbelief and let myself really be drawn into Williamson's story. The relationship between Laura and Ben also holds no real spark, making Williamson's occasional use of love scenes seem somewhat annoying and out of place. This novel could be considered ghost-like itself because there really is little of substance here upon which the reader can take hold. Horror House can serve as a nice diversion, but in the long run it proves quite forgettable."},{"Title":"Fodor's Exploring Rome, 5th Edition (Exploring Guides)","review":"After reading several tour books this one turned out to be the best of the lot.

This deck promised me tales (tails?) of intrigue and Baroque fantasy, a dream world where true vision is reflected in the round green eyes of a cat.One bit of advice--buy the boxed set.

The fierceness of the Siberian on the Knight of Swords crackles with energy, and the sweet innocence of the 6 of Cups elicits an \\"awww!\\" for both its cuteness and the way it captures the essence of this card. The 9 of Cups is a hilarious card, with a British shorthair licking his lips in snarky Puss in Boots fashion. Ms. Mahony writes of this card:\\"A somewhat portly and obviously very satisfied cat sits on a barrel in the public room of an inn, licking his lips. Behind him, carved in wood, can be a seen a scene of grand merrymaking.\\"Because some readers prefer Strength and Justice as either Trump 8 or 11, the deck designers have chosen to keep the Majors unnumbered. In addition to the standard RWS attributions and format, Ms. Mahony and Mr. Ukolov have also added a \\"good luck\\" card to the Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot: Hermes--which shows a golden statue of the god in a sunny courtyard while a lovely cat clothed in a sage green gown with white ruffles looks on. At first glance, it appears the card backings are fully reversible, but upon closer inspection, you can see the names Ukolov and Mahony on opposing sides. Because the script is so small, however, the backings still work wonderfully for reversals.The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot is an excellent reading deck, and especially good as a deck for children or cat lovers. Because this deck follows RWS, it can be used in conjunction with many Tarot books, making it a great beginner's deck, as well. I've had quite a few insights with these cards, which I've jotted down in my Tarot journal. While an artistically exquisite Tarot that belongs in every art deck collection, it's an excellent deck for both reading and meditation. (Note: I highly recommend getting the entire Kit, because Ms. Mahony's prose is exquisite, offering additional insights into both this deck and the Tarot in general).(To see 10 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])"},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Deck","review":"These cards are totally cool, a must for cat lovers. Gorgeous, highly-detailed cards with a great variety of cats: tortoiseshells, Persians, Russsian Blues, tabbies, gingers, Maine Coons, Siamese, etc. You can just sit and gaze at them for hours. All this plus a nice little explanatory booklet."},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Deck","review":"I totally love the pictures on this deck. They are fun and beautifully executed. I haven't had much time to work with this deck, and the size is a little hard to work with, but all in all I really love it."},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Deck","review":"The artwork is worth the price of admission. The cards have a cheap feel to them, the paper is very thin, but they can be shuffled with some effort. When looking down at your layout the colors and the expressions on the faces of the cats give an extra dimension to the read. While this will not often be my deck of choice for reading, I am glad to have it in my collection and certainly believe the money was well spent."},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Deck","review":"I really was excited to get this deck, and I wanted to like it, but when I received the item, I was disappointed.If you are a collector of tarot decks, and you collect decks for artwork purposes, this deck was disappointing to me. The cats looked photoshopped into the cards. Some cards it was executed nicely because you didnt notice that things were photoshopped and it worked smoothly, it made for a very enchanting card. However, on many of the cards, it was very noticable, even distracting. So objects looked dropped in with no consideration to shadow or placement of light. I wish the quaility of the artwork flowed through out the whole deck instead being inconsistent on each card.For a reading deck, I couldnt recomended this deck for a beginner. The problem is, there is not enough symbolism that matches or cues the reader into the meanings of the cards. Some of the cards in the minor arcana are hard to distinguish which number and which suit it is in.I hope perhaps the artist will revisit some of those pieces and modify them to be more consistent. This deck deserves to be given the very best it can be. It's just not there yet."},{"Title":"Diy Pr: The Small Business Guide to 'Free' Publicity","review":"At last! A practical guide to put anyone on the road to 'free' publicity.The grass-roots approach cuts through the mysterious air (ie: 'the crap') often hanging round PR and publicity issues and beloved by practitioners desperate to play their cards close to their chest.Penny's advice is simple, easy to follow and should guarantee results. It won't turn everybody into PR professionals as there's a bit more too it than securing media coverage, but then, that's not the aim of the book.As well as the sound 'can't go wrong' advice, there's templates and examples that lead readers through the process of putting together news releases etc.Altogether a brilliant guide that brings the seemingly impossible task of generating publicity well within reach of any small business or enthusiastic individual. Brilliant. And not before time."},{"Title":"The New Nation: A History of US, Book 4","review":"The reason Joy Hakim's &quot;A History of US&quot; series is so perfect for home schooling is that she actively engages her young readers in each volume. Usually in a history textbook like this the author is primarily concerned with presenting a lot of information in a captivating manner. There is some attention paid to the importance of people and events, but it is often left to the teacher in the classroom to make the connections and bring history alive for their students. However, Hakim takes a much more actively role in her textbooks. She is constantly asking her young readers to put themselves in the position of the people she is writing about and does an excellent job of anticipating questions that students would ask while reading about this particular events.Volume 4 in this series deals with &quot;The New Nation 1789-1850,&quot; which is the longest period of time covered in a single volume after the first two, which covered epochs from the first arrival of humans in North America to the entrenchment of the British in America. Hakim begins with the nation getting started with the inauguration of George Washington as the first President and ends with the Compromise of 1850, the watershed event that forestalled the coming of Civil War for another decade. However, the next volume in the series, &quot;Liberty For All? 1820-1860&quot; clearly overlaps with this one big time. This volume deals with the War of 1812 and the Seminole Wars while &quot;Liberty For All?&quot; covers the Mexican American War. The best way to describe the basic distinction between the two volumes is that this one looks at the country as a political experiment while the other deals with the expansion of the nation.&quot;The New Nation&quot; is basically divided into four sections. The first (Chapters 1-9) deals with the Federalist administrations of George Washington and John Adams, including a look at the key principle of judicial review. The second (Chapters 10-20) deals with the nation from the presidency of Thomas Jefferson to that of Andrew Jackson, which involves both the Indian question and the War of 1812 (a.k.a. the Revolutionary War Part II). The third section (Chapters 21-26) contrasts American ingenuity with the treatment of the Indians. The final section (Chapters 27-36) addresses the slavery issue and the rise of the Abolitionists, ending with the great debate in which Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster gave their final great speeches (I have a background in rhetoric so this is one of my favorite parts of American history).Hakim's focus is on how the principles of the revolution embodied in Constitution had to be enacted in practice. She underscores that at this point in American history the idea of &quot;people,&quot; (as in &quot;we the People&quot;) does not mean what it means today. If you are not an adult, white, free, male, property owners, then you are not really a citizen (and it is not until the Gettysburg Address that Lincoln makes the idea that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; part of the national consciousness). Anyhow, I agree with the impulse to have some overlap between the two volumes bridging the Revolution and the Civil War and to provide a clearer focus on the political and social elements by dealing with them this way."},{"Title":"The New Nation: A History of US, Book 4","review":"I was just replacing my daughter's textbook from school (it met with an unfortunate end!) but I got hooked reading this book. Fascinating, I don't doubt the entire series is just as good."},{"Title":"The New Nation: A History of US, Book 4","review":"This book looks great and I love the series.

(Maybe I'm just getting too old to have the language facility I once had?) The title is accurate it calling it an &quot;outline;&quot; the information is densely packed. It requires careful and repeated reading to understand. It illustrates each point by only a few short examples. It introduces and uses the devanagari script from the beginning, with transliterations. I think that one could learn everything else without learning the script. I am already familiar with the script, and want to improve my reading ability, so I am happy with the constant use of devanagari. Those who need to learn the script together with the vocabulary and grammar may find it more challenging. The text describes pronunciations in terms of the Queen's English, and it is confusing to those who don't speak that dialect. My teacher doesn't seem to pronounce everything the way it is described in the book. A tape is available, but I have not made much use of it yet, as it relates to specific exercises in the book. Studying with this book seems to be a slow start. It would be excellent for someone who wants to review and improve a language already partially acquired. I'm looking for something that makes the language feel more accessible."},{"Title":"Outline of Hindi grammar: With exercises","review":"McGregor presents a really coherent summary of Hindi grammar, though it is a more formal grammar than most people actually speak. The approach is very academic, which means it wouldn't necessarily be the book for many people to start with. On the whole, however, I like it better than any of the other books I have used, including Landour."},{"Title":"Outline of Hindi grammar: With exercises","review":"This book is great for a reference grammar of Hindi. It covers most major grammar points covered in most 1st and 2nd year Hindi Courses. One thing I noticed about this book, is you should have another book thoroughly explaining all grammatical concetps and use this one merely for more examples and as a refernce. This book is somewhat dense and tries to briefly cover SEVERAL topics of Hindi grammar. Another great thing about this book is it is the ONLY book I know of that transliterates from Pg 1 and never stops. The entire book shows script and then the transliteration right beside it. This is especially good for someone who wants to pick up some grammar and/or vocabulary etc, but is having trouble with the script. Lastly if you are already well versed in Hindi grammar, as I am, then this book is a great addition to your Hindi Language materials collection :)"},{"Title":"Outline of Hindi grammar: With exercises","review":"This book is very good for someone who is familiar with hindi, like who could read and understand a few simple words. I enjoyed reading this book since I consider my self belong to that category. I'm not sure howmuch someone, who is not exposed to hindi atall, will benefit from this book.Exercises and vocabulary sections are very good, as the title of the book says, the book focuses on the grammar part of the spoken and written hindi not for beginners who just want to learn to speak."},{"Title":"Outline of Hindi grammar: With exercises","review":"I have successfully used this book to teach myself written and spoken Hindi, along with practical exercises such as conversational help from people who already speak the language, and a watching Hindi-language films.This book is not for the faint of heart. It does not limit itself to introducing the reader to casual chatter in conversational Hindi -- my favourite example phrase translates as \\"I have burnt the house of my enemy,\\" an utterance not likely to be very helpful while, for example, reserving a Second AC ticket on the Rajdhani Express.Nevertheless the book's stated purpose is \\"to include most of what the student needs to know in the early stages of his study of Hindi and of what he needs to have accessible for easy reference while consolidating his grasp of the language.\\" In this, McGregor's grammar has proven to me absolutely invaluable. Thanks in large part to this book, I have now successfully fended for myself in Hindi from Delhi to Kolkata, and what's more feel equipped to tackle Hindi literature.To anyone who has studied, as I have, inflected languages such as Greek, Latin or German -- or anyone who has studied languages from an academic point of view -- McGregor's explanation will be concise, cogent and clear. I found myself able to begin assimilating the mechanics immediately, even before I had quite learnt the script, and bypassed all the usual nervous hand-wringing and hand-holding that usually accompany slower-paced elementary text books.It does sacrifice somewhat to brevity with a paucity of examples (e.g. things can get a bit murky where one exemplum serves double-duty illustrating two points of grammar), but this is not a major obstacle when taken in combination with outside reading, speaking and listening. The only real addition I would hope for would be a more extensive index along with more thorough cross-referencing.McGregor is a fantastic scholar. Along with this, hisThe Oxford Hindi-English Dictionaryare monuments of scholarship."},{"Title":"Home on the Hill: A Bombay Girlhood","review":"This is an excellent book written from memory by Miss Whabiz Merchant of her own childhood spent in Bombay India, in a house (a bungalow built by an Englishman actually) on Pali Hill in the 60s (now a posh neigborhood of Bollywood = Bevely Hills, Hollywood, CA). The author's intial years of growing up were pleasant with all the trappings of an upper middle class life, including servants. In her later years she talks about the bitter divorce proceedings between her parents, whom she loves equally, but who have manage to build up a wall betwen themselves filled with so much hatred for each other. The divorce court case of her parents takes up almost all of the latter half of the book, and the author's eventual break with it all by emigrating to America. The tragic end of the divorce case was totally unexpected. I would say this is a must read for all of us who were teenagers in the 1960s in India and a good read for all adolesecence psychologists, especially those who practice divorce law. I could not put down the book once I started reading it, her early life mirroring mine in the same part of the same city. The book has shades of &quot;Anne Frank's Diary&quot; in some parts, and &quot;Ann of Green Gables&quot; in others, but all enjoyable reading all the same. I recommend this book without reservations. At the price it is unbeatable"},{"Title":"Home on the Hill: A Bombay Girlhood","review":"From the tiny Parsi community of the City of Bombay, which has also produced the orchestra conductor Zubin Mehta, comes the eldest daughter of a prominent industrialist, W.D. Merchant. I had an amazingly good time reading about her childhood. She tells family anecdotes that truly reel in in the reader.Merchant's community included not just Parsis but Hindus and Muslims, and she talks here and there about how people lived together. The only hint of discord is between her parents. These two were CHARACTERS, and the book is worth reading just to learn their story. Apparently Merchant's father first saw her mother at a wedding and told someone next to him, \\"That's the girl I'm going to marry.\\"\\"But that's the bride!\\" his companion objected.This father was very handsome and so gifted vocally that an Indian film producer who heard him sing tried to offer him a contract via the servant working in their garden. The good servant retorted, \\"My master sings wonderfully but can swear even better. Besides, he is rich enough to buy several producers like you.\\"What the same father does when Merchant's mother tosses an emerald ring into the sea will keep you reading. As will every other anecdote!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Colin Thubron's _Among the Russians_ (1983) offers a compelling picture of the Soviet Union in 1980, at the moment of its serious, irrevocable decline. Thubron examines day-to-day life in Western Russia, Estonia, Belarus (\\"White Russia\\"), Ukraine, and Georgia, near the end of Leonid Brezhnev's premiership. He finds despair and cynicism, as well as an unshakeable sense of humor about life under communist rule.Thubron's work is a travel narrative, an account of a car trip that he took alone in 1980 that was planned and approved by the Intotourist, the Soviet tourism board. Traveling as a \\"building company director,\\" Thubron meets many people along the way. He talks with Russian and eastern bloc tourists at the campsites where he spends the night, locals in cities and towns, and dissidents whose addresses he has received from associates in Great Britain. Thubron also describes run-ins with police officials who are shocked to see a foreigner traveling alone by car in a British car. The first question he is asked while registering for his first overnight campsite stay is \\"Are you a group?,\\" which Thubron describes as a \\"quintessential Russian question.\\"Intermingled with his descriptions of the landscape and important historical sites, Thubron recounts various escapades, stories of people offering to buy his clothes (especially his jeans), of the advances lonely women who see him as a way to escape to the West (or to have an escape for a day), of many vodka guzzling evenings, of officious Intourist tourist guides, and of the talk of dissidents who seem unconcerned that their homes are bugged. Thubron offers his own insights about lesser known sites, like the Josef Stalin museum in Gori, Georgia, Stalin's hometown. In an exciting passage near the end of the work, Thubron describes how security personel in two white Volgas tail him all the way to the Romanian border.Throughout, Thubron expresses a Western sensibility and skepticism about the Soviet Union. His narrative mixes a blend of awe for the accomplishments of the Russian people and horror for what the Russians have endured and suffered. In fact, the book begins with an admission of his long-held fears about Russia, dating back to grade school when he first viewed in awe maps of the Soviet Union stretching across the globe.Thubron's prose style is both poetic and urbane (with an impressive vocabulary); he recounts many unforgettable episodes. The book ends where it begins with Thubron marveling at the vastness of Russia, an impression that the reader will remember, too."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Ride around with Thubron in the last years of the crumbling Soviet Union. He takes you into the apartment buildings to find some of the most interesting -- and heartening -- testaments to human color ever encountered in travel writing.There are some truly jaw-dropping observations made by our driver as he stumbles upon people who are dealing with oppression in ways that &quot;westerners&quot; have never had to imagine.Through the vodka, through the endlessly repeating housing blocs, Thubron takes us to a deeper, more personal understanding of life under the Soviets. On the way, he introduces us to individuals (yes, strong individuals) that are not easy to forget."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"As an interested reader of the Soviet Union and Russian culture, I picked this book up two years after I read In Siberia. I was amazed at the amount of detail the author poured into his journeys across the Soviet Union. He was able to visit the Russian citizens, homesteads of famous icons of years back (Tolstoy among them) and see cathedrals we can only see in pictures. His writing style and demeanor may strike readers as distant and unattached but he went over there to observe and he did not observe this place through rose-colored lenses-he showed us what Russia was really like in 1980. If you strictly want to read about Russia, you may be disappointed when you read the material towards the end which is about Georgia and Armenia, but my ignorance of those former republics were replaced with notions that they might be more beautiful and more interesting than all of Western Russia. The whole way through you will be captivated, appalled and intrigued with his journey. This is a must-read for anyone interested in Russian culture."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Written by someone who somehow managed to drive a clunker with UK plates through the Iron Curtain between West and East Germany and all the way to Moscow. Thubron then motors all the way to present day Azerbaijan and St.Petersburg. It is a snapshot not of present day Russia but of 1980 Soviet Union.The faint glimmers of hope that these people held on to and their continual amazement at the fact the author would explain the West was afraid of them are an excellent historical reference. Told that we are the threat to the Soviet Union a lot of the people were both in awe and afraid of the author.The amazing fact that he camped his way around a closed country is a great read of how they perceived us as much as a straight travelogue.Well recommended"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"If this gives any indication of enjoying a book :I read it in two gulps / just could not put it down !This writer is just captivating .I ESPECIALLY was charmed by the poignant descriptions of peoples' faces ..A MUST READ especially , if you are curious to understand the puzzling dichotomy of repressionand, too authentic warmth and hunger for beauty that comprises this fascinating country, Russia..Spaceba!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"This is a good account of traveling through Russia in recent times. For a similar travel narrative try Tent Life in Siberia: An Incredible Account of Siberian Adventure, Travel, and Survival - minus 120 years and a vehicle, but with the engaging addition of battling against the brutality of the Siberian climate."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"This is an excellent travelogue. Thubron is a vivid writer who paints memorable portrait of the people and places that he explores. The only knock on this book is that it is becoming dated. Originally published in 1983 it tells more about who the Russians used to be, rather than who they are. Still worth a read though."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"I wondered, when ordering \\"Among the Russians\\", whether the fact that it had been written a quarter of a century ago, about a world that had apparently disappeared, would detract from the impact of the journey. I need not have worried as it has the immediacy of a trip completed yesterday.The book perhaps - and understandably so - does not quite have the fine polish of the recent \\"Shadow of the Silk Road\\", my first experience of Thubron, but is none the less beautifully written and absolutely fascinating. The combination of the unorthodox travel arrangements for the time (a car), the poetic and precise (I checked Google Images while reading \\"Shadow of the Silk Road\\"!) descriptions of places, the intimate and thoughtful portraits of people and, particularly impressive, the provision of a detailed historical context, make for a compelling read. Extra thrills, including a dramatic conclusion to the book, were thoughtfully provided by the KGB.With all this it might seem unnecessarily querulous to ask for more. But in both these books we are left with a feeling that the author has, perhaps unconsciously, fenced off a part of his personality and his activities. In this age of \\"letting it all hang out\\" we are sometimes left with unanswered questions, sometimes on simple practical matters.On the one hand, a voyage, especially a solitary one, involves constant and often stressful interaction between the traveler and his surroundings. We do see a lot of this but are often left trying to imagine details. On the other, it is often marked by long periods of silence when the traveler, a long way from home, will reflect on his life, loves, beliefs and hopes. Aside from a few memorable incidents, we do not see very much of this.A writer is fully entitled to reveal, or to hide, as much as himself as he chooses. But a bit more of Colin Thubron, the man, would give his travel books an additional vital dimension. Perhaps - after reading \\"In Siberia\\" - I should try his novels!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"As a cultural anthropologist who was been living and working in St. Petersburg, Russia for several years I can recommend this book for only what it is now. This is a travel narrative written over a period of weeks by one person, who did not speak Russian, in a tightly regulated tourist industry. Firstly, most people would agree that not speaking a language of a culture seriously inhibits your ability to assess what is actually happening and why. Secondly, at the time this was originally written, the Soviet Union, nor anyone else thought that it was in decline (1980 was also the year that the Olympics were held in Russia and an year after the invasion of Afghanistan)and seeing it as such is only because of hindsight.Thuborn's travel is from the in-tourist perspective, several other Western travelers who visited for conferences and business trips might explain something completely different. I know one such American photographer, Demarest Peterson, who traveled to Russia in the 1950's who was virtually uninhibited by the tourist guides from the in-tourist department, and was even able to take pictures of worshipers in a Russian Orthodox church during this time!Consider the alternative, imagine a Russian who was able to visit the US, under false pretenses, at about the same time, alone, poor in English and by car (if this would ever have been allowed). Would they be allowed to travel independently? Probably not. Would they be monitored by governmental officials? Probably yes. Would they be requested to join an official tour group to \\"give them a better traveling experience\\" (to keep an eye on them)? Yes, most certainly. Would their documents have been examined? Yes. Seeing it from the other side may help to explain the experiences that Thuborn had. Very few traveled to Russia from the West during this time which may help to explain the enigma of Russia more than one persons two week journal.I can recommend this book from only this perspective, as a historical narrative, and not as something to be considered for 2010. Russia has changed greatly in the last 10 years alone and it resembles nothing of the Soviet Union in 1980. If taken as a guide this book, now, will only heighten one's sense of cultural shock. And when you return, write of your own experiences, they are sorely needed."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"I should preface my review by making it clear that I am not generally a fan of hyper-descriptive, verbose writers in the vein of Hemingway. That said/understood, I found Among the Russians to be so long-winded and detail oriented (in terms of describing places, buildings, forests, etc) that it was difficult to get a sense of the people. He interjects tales of his human interactions sparingly and a bit chaotically, so it isn't the type of book that I enjoy. A balance of description, history, and on-the-ground human interaction is key in making a book like this readable and entertaining. His style misses this by quite a bit. That said, it is an interesting account of 1980's Soviet Russia. It is what it is, but it's definitely not my favorite."},{"Title":"Berlioz and his century;: An introduction to the age of romanticism (Meridian books, M30)","review":"Jacques Barzun is an unapologetic advocate of great men (and women) and, in one of his most subtle philosophical veins, he has here comprehensively treated Berlioz as such an entity- rather than a style, technique, or eccentric- within the contemporary and personal world that the composer occupied and was occupied by.The designation of Berlioz, along with Keats, as The Romantic Genius, has cemented his place in the general surveys of musical and 19th century history. Sustained equally by the overly-emphasized program of \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\" and the easily recountable breaking of his engagement to Camille Moke- Berlioz as a Personality could be as easily subsumed in a general, genteely eccentric, demi-Napoleonic, bohemian Romantic \\"character\\".Barzun does not reject the singleness of the Romantic era, as he might have done, in questioning the existence of such an all-encompassing character for it; but explains the depth, the real pragmatism and sense of great morality, on all sides, by which the new generations of necessarily market-dependant artists were precluded by the more aristocratic-minded institutions that fostered them. Berlioz stood in the earliest of these generations, and emerges from his environment sympathetically human. If the embodiment of a period in a single person is a cause for endless fascination (and, barring that, assignation), it is also a cause for beaurocratic tedium, financial pandering, and occasional compositions.Barzun, having managed in one of his more recent works to extradite John Calvin from the morass of that leader's legacy, deserves admiration for the still more formidable task, in this work, of sorting out the arguments of the last two centuries concerning artistic prerogative, if not for happening yet on their solution.\\"Berlioz and His Century\\" consequently retains (like all of Barzun's narratives) both historical importance and present relevance in the full extent of its range, while remembering the real and finite experiences of the individual figures who made their times important and relevant."},{"Title":"Flower Fairies Baby Book R/I","review":"My whole nursury is in Flower fairies, so this book matches my theme perfectly.

The newest films analyzed are Tootsie (1982) and Yentl (1983), already a decade old when this book was published.Marjorie Garber uses a very rich vocabulary, some of which I was even able to stump internet dictionaries with. On the other hand, she uses unintended racist vocabulary. She may have known better in 1992.Many parts of the 390-paged book (+ 35 pages of footnotes and 38 picture pages, some of which are in color) are very interesting to read. Usually, when playing topsyturvy with our Western concepts of gender. For example that the pink-blue baby colors were reversed before WWI. When and in what circumstances Muslim societies appear to harbor more gender freedoms than the West. (Though the author doesn't mention everything possible.) Many history lessons are to be learned, e.g. that Joan of Arc wasn't tried under the inquisition for heresy, but transvestism.Lengthy chapters are reserved for classic films, sumptuary laws, Peter Pan, Salome, detective stories, M. Butterfly, the posthumous Harold Washington scandal, Josephine Baker and the image connection among Valentino, Liberace and Elvis. With most of these chapters I had the feeling that they were somewhat arbitrary or that separate long articles, worthy as they may be individually, were compiled for a book, which often loses sight of its overall coherence. Even though I liked reading about all of that, it felt too much like a patchwork text instead of clear messages.If you are interested in gender studies, don't miss out on this one. Just make sure, this will not remain the only one.

(Discussion paper)","review":"I urge you to read this important book, and then share it with your local and national leaders.Brian Jenkins, a senior advisor at the RAND Corporation, has been studying the issue of nuclear terrorism since the early 1970s. In fact, he may be the world's leading expert on this terrifying topic. \\"Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?\\" has been endorsed by top intelligence experts on both sides of the political spectrum, as well as a Nobel Prize laureate and retired military leaders.Warning: This is not a work of sensationalism. Unlike so many \\"shock authors,\\" Jenkins is even-handed and very careful with his words. He even criticizes his own earlier work, which is a rare thing in this age of reckless self-promotion.Here's the gist of Jenkins's argument: Nuclear \\"terror\\" and nuclear \\"terrorism\\" are two VERY different problems. One is emotional. The other is factual. If we base our policies on emotion, our nation will suffer through unnecessary fear and make poor decisions about security. As Jenkins states: \\"Al Qaeda is the first terrorist group to incite nuclear terror without actually possessing a nuclear weapon.\\"Make no mistake: The distinction between \\"terror\\" and \\"terrorism\\" is absolutely critical to our national response, says Jenkins. Nuclear terror is fear based on what MIGHT happen. In contrast, nuclear terrorism is the actual historical record of specific terrorist ACTS involving nuclear materials -- plus an objective estimate of current terrorist capabilities.Jenkins leaves no stone unturned. He walks us through the history of nuclear terror going back to H.G. Wells' 1913 novel on the subject and continuing to the current day. It's a fascinating -- almost unbelievable -- trip. For example, I didn't know that Robert Oppenheimer (father of the U.S. atomic bomb) actually worked on this issue in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The result was his famous but still classified \\"Screwdriver Report.\\"On a parallel track, Jenkins examines the history of actual terrorist acts involving nuclear materials -- everything from a love-triangle murder in Idaho Falls in 1961 to the Chechen radiological bomb planted in a Moscow park just a few years ago. He also reviews the rich history of black marketeering in nuclear materials, particularly in the former Soviet Union.Along the way, we learn a great deal about the difference between nuclear terror and nuclear terrorism. Topics include:-- Suitcase nukes-- The mysterious substance called \\"red mercury\\"-- Security procedures at Russian nuclear facilities-- Al Qaeda's attempts to secure nuclear and radiological weapons-- Pakistan's involvement in nuclear smuggling-- The great technical challenge of building a viable nuclear weapon from scratchAt times, Jenkins' narrative repeats itself, but for the most part he's right on the money. Each major topic is placed within the cultural and historical framework of our times. For example, Jenkins examines the religious \\"end times\\" fever of our age in the context of nuclear terror. He shows how specific threats are turned into \\"facts,\\" through the psychological process of reification. He even explains the use of threatening language in Arab culture, based on linguistic and psychiatric studies.So what is his conclusion? Are we destined for an act of nuclear terrorism on U.S. soil?Jenkins seems to think it's possible, but rather unlikely, particularly in terms of an actual nuclear fission explosion (nuclear bomb). Launching such an attack would involve three very difficult steps:1. Acquiring enriched uranium or plutonium in sufficient quantity.2. Assembling and maintaining such a weapon.3. Delivering it to a U.S. target without being detected.The first two steps seem to be the most difficult. Who knew, for example, that small nuclear weapons become inoperable in about 6 months because of cracks in the core material? They're harder to maintain than an old piano.It's far more likely, says Jenkins, that terrorists will use a radiological \\"dirty bomb\\" on U.S. soil. Such a device uses traditional explosives to disperse radioactive materials across a large area. The ensuing loss of life is much smaller, but the terror it could cause is potentially enormous.So what can we do to prevent nuclear terrorism? Plenty, says Jenkins. He outlines a long list of specific actions that civilized nations can take to reduce the likelihood of an actual nuclear attack. Most importantly, Jenkins ads, we must base our plans and decisions on actual facts -- not sensationalistic rhetoric.If you have any interest at all in this topic, I urge you to read this important book and then pass it along to others -- especially your Congressional representatives and elected officials."},{"Title":"Will terrorists go nuclear? (Discussion paper)","review":"Government officials trying to cope with terrorism's nagging complexity often resort to hiring consultants to soothe their concerns and help them find policies to thwart terrorism while not overreacting. Given the current state of America, terrorism experts like Brian Jenkins have a vital role in helping protect America. But experts can only help to a certain extent -- they're like a crutch, not a cure, because they can't prevent terrorism like citizens can.This book is an advertisement for Brian Jenkins, terrorism expert. Like any cautious consultant, he wants it both ways: he wants to reassure a fearful public that nuclear terrorism is less likely than they think; but if nuclear terrorism happens, he doesn't want to be blamed for making a poor prediction. The result is a confused advertisement for his professional services. Will terrorists go nuclear? Jenkins won't say. And his failure to take a stand undercuts his argument that Al Qaeda has scared us into believing that it's a nuclear power -- if terrorists nuke Manhattan, then our worries will have been correct. However, if we're over-reacting to a non-existent threat of smuggled nuclear bombs, then a title like \\"Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?\\" ratchets up fear without purpose.The real audience of this book is not the public but government officials who might hire Mr. Jenkins as well as media gate-keepers seeking a talking head after terrorism erupts. So Mr. Jenkins must appear knowledgeable to these two audiences. Perhaps this is why there are graphs typically found in introductory economics textbooks? There's a dubious reality TV skit tacked on near the end in which the reader is supposed to play president after a city has been nuked. A nuked Manhattan is \\"game over\\" (according to military strategists like Graham Allison) so why is this skit in there? An editor should have nuked the skit.Jenkins, like most people, assume terrorism is only a problem for police, government, military. But I think the problem of terrorism can only be handled by participation from citizens. We're the ones who suffer when it happens. And citizens working together can solve it. We have a power government lacks because we can change the framework in which law enforcement operates. And while experts like Jenkins have a constructive role, as citizens we must think for ourselves.Cynical readers opposed to substantive reform can read this book for more understanding of the dynamics of nuclear terrorism from an expert's perspective. And this book is helpful in this regard. Mr. Jenkins is one of the good guys helping thwart serious terrorism and deserves our sincere appreciation for his efforts. But I urge readers to own the problem of terrorism and to think through the problem for themselves.Thomas W.

(Discussion paper)","review":"For several presidential elections the candidates have all said the greatest danger facing America is nuclear terrorism. Even now. But somehow, it isn't part of the discussion, perhaps because they don't know how to talk about it. This book by Brian Jenkins is not only comprehendive, compelling, and a great read, it provides a realistic analysis of the history of nuclear terror and nuclear terrosim, pointing out that the latter -- the threat of a nuclear attack -- has all terrorists have ever been able to accomplish. That threat, however, has a higher probability of doing danger to our values, our commitment to civil liberty, and all the important things America stands for in the world than the risk of an attack.Jenkins, who is an acknowledged expert in the field, provides a chapter that is as compelling as an episode of \\"24,\\" running the scenario of what you would do if you were president and \\"A Brilliant Yellow Light\\" was seen over New York City.The book is a must for anyone seriously concerned about the danger of a nuclear attack, or the danger to our civil liberties of living in ignorance and fear. It should be part of the presidential debate, but won't be unless someone asks the candidates directly what they think."},{"Title":"Will terrorists go nuclear?

I usually like what he has to say, and this book was cited on the program.The book has very little new information in it. Jenkins just rehashes the obvious throughout. I suppose someone that lived under a rock for the past 20 years might find Will_Terrorists_Go_Nuclear? interesting.Jenkins doubts there is a immediate threat of a hidden nuclear device in the US. They are too hard to make, too hard to maintain, too hard to make small and maintain. The nuclear threat from terrorists is just rhetoric, causing a pervasive, underlining panic in every American's life. That's about it for the book.

Martin - writing a textbook on Homeland Security Law."},{"Title":"Will terrorists go nuclear? (Discussion paper)","review":"Will terrorists go nuclear? That is the essential questioned posed by counterterrorism expert Brian Jenkins in a book of the same title.Jenkins has written a sobering and critical analysis of this question that spans over his decades of research on the topic. In fact, the book shares the title of a research paper Jenkins wrote over 30 years ago and it is that essay he uses as the entrance point for his observations. The issue of nuclear terrorism is one that has haunted policy makers, enriched movie producers, and fevered American apprehension for 30 years and the strength of Jenkins book is his categorical and tempered analysis of how each of these complex areas play into the nuclear terrorism debate.Playing the role of mythbuster, Jenkins dives deep to determine the seeding point for a large number of nuclear terrorism memes that have propagated over the past decade. Upon examination, Jenkins finds that some of the memes are just that, organic ideas that developed a life of their own or had strategic sponsorship by individuals who were in a position to benefit from the propagation of the meme. Readers should draw some comfort from the thoughtful analysis and debunking of some of our most terrifying concerns.In his analysis of terrorist motives, operational concepts and evolution Jenkins dissects the core issues in a way that few terrorism analysts can. This book will speak not only to his peers, but is very accessible to the general audience and it is this audience that Jenkins seems obligated to inform with this book.That assumption brings us to the final and most essential element of the book, which is Jenkins' differentiation between \\"nuclear terrorism\\" and \\"nuclear terror\\". Nuclear terrorism is the threat that must be addressed by Western democracies through sound counterterrorism and non-proliferation policies. Nuclear terror is the state of perpetual societal fear that is exploited to erode civil liberties and generate apprehension within democracies. Of course, the fundamental question is how much apprehension can we cope with before the fundamental components of our society become unrecognizable.Jenkins book is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in this essential subject and should be required reading for consumers of popular culture (the TV show 24, for example) that propagate the nuclear terrorism meme, or anyone who finds the concept of nuclear terrorism \\"terrifying\\"."},{"Title":"Will terrorists go nuclear?

Before deciding to review this book, I looked at two or three others that were available at my local book stores on Macromedia 8.5. This was the only one that impressed me. In many ways, this book by Phil and Mike Gross pick up where Phil Gross's Director 8 and Lingo Authorized left off. This book is a training course which will guide the reader into the major areas of 3D programming. While this might sound daunting, it isn't because the lessons are step by step guides. The authors state in their introduction that the first four chapters are intended for 3D designers who want to bring their 3D creations to the web while the remainder of the chapters are for seasoned Director users who want to take advantage of the 3D features of Director 8.5. Even if I did not intend to use the properties of Director 8.5's 3D module extensively, these first lessons would get me started in an orderly and logical fashion because they highlight the basic information necessary to build upon should I desire to go further while giving me clear instruction on how to use basic 3D in a Director movie.Many small points are added that help tremendously in learning and manipulating the program. I like the way the authors have designated \\"additional\\" information as Tips and Notes. This book does not teach a basic course in Director. That is not its intent. For that, the earlier book by Phil Gross, referred to above, is an excellent source of knowledge.This book is very clearly written and logically moves the reader forward step by step. Whether the reader is advanced in the 3D world or a novice, this book describes using 3D tools in Director 8.5. The book shows how one can get heavily involved in the Lingo language and create complex 3D animations or just use basic techniques and create simpler ones.This is a must have if you are using Macromedia Director 8.5.

It's a book that tries to be an introduction to assembly language programming (ALP) as a whole, but comes up short when it goes a little too quick in the beginning before jumping right in with the instructions sets and example programs.The author himself states in the introduction that CPU fundamentals are to be understood prior to reading this book.. he means understanding a stack/registers/ALU/Memory/binary/hex.. then get into this book for specific use of the 8085's machine language... So I'm finding myself looking for another book to read to fill in the blanks before I continue with this one.The last section of the book does have some useful info on interfacing with peripherals.. which is my end purpose of understanding how to write code for the 80C85 in my old, but warm sounding digitally controlled analog synth.

I also have Varieties of Visual Expression (1992) that is essentially the same book. The chapter headings are the same & both books are organized alike. The only difference I see when comparing the first chapter is that a 1974 Frankenthaler and a 1983 Keifer (which weren't yet created in 1967)are added and the writing is improved here and there. In Varieties he adds sections on Photography and TV/Motion Pictures to the realm of art criticism. So I strongly reccomend that you order \\"Varieties of Visual Expression\\" instead simply because it is an updated version. I also highly reccomend Feldman's \\"Thinking About Art\\" written in 1985.

But if you can only have one - \\"Varieties of Visual Expression\\" is your best bet.Now, about the book(s) - Feldman is so highly regarded in Art Criticism that his concepts of the Personal, Social, and Physical Functions of Art - etc, are the general terms used in Art Appreciation and Art Criticism Courses.The Testing Excercises for the National Boards for Art Teachers are based upon Feldman's ideas so you need to read these books if you are a candidate!

Rose has skipped all that introductory material and has dived right into the controversy. I admit to not having read his other work, but I have checked out The New Oxford Review, the website of which he edits, from time to time, and have always come away thinking I needed to spend more time in those pages. Here, he's done an excellent job as a partisan for Pope Benedict XVI and the Church's traditional teachings on doctrinal matters. And \\"partisan\\" it clearly is. The Pope's many American critics are not going to find a warm, loving embrace within these pages. But readers sympathetic to him and what he is trying to achieve will certainly appreciate Rose's energetic defense of the man.The best way to summarize Benedict's approach to the many controversies he has to deal with might be to quote these lines from a 1999 \\"notification\\" reproduced on page 102: \\"[T]he promotion of errors and ambiguities is not consistent with a Christian attitude of true respect and compassion: Persons who are struggling with homosexuality, no less than any others, have the right to receive the authentic teaching of the Church from those who minister to them.\\" Rose does a very thorough job of showing how \\"the man who was Ratzinger\\" did as cardinal, and no doubt will as Pope, apply that standard on issues from homosexuality, to the remnants of \\"liberation theology,\\" to inter-faith dialogue, and much more. With the theological and religious Left still hanging on to power and influence in the American church, I think Catholics (and outsiders) of a more traditional bent will not only enjoy, but learn and even draw strength from, Rose's uncompromising approach and vigorous style. This book won't be to every readers' taste, but some readers, I think, will find it exactly the bracing, inspiring read they're looking for."},{"Title":"Benedict XVI: The Man Who Was Ratzinger","review":"One of the strangest public dramas of recent years was played out after the long-anticipated death of Pope John Paul II. Odd enough to watch as the MSM and the Left, which pretty much loathe everything he stood for and the institution he served, praised him unreservedly, but then we were treated to the bizarre spectacle of them assuring each other that the Church would now have to turn to a more \\"liberal\\" pope, who would free the Church of the moral baggage JPII had left behind. And, one thing for sure, no way could Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who's even more conservative, possibly be chosen to succeed him. Certainly the Church would have to seek to popularize its product by picking someone who would loosen doctrine enough to fit in with the postmodernist and relativist intellectual trends of secular Europe and Blue America, right? Well, we all know how that turned out. Perhaps folks who don't believe in Christianity in the first place ought not try to figure out how or why a man becomes Pope?Michael S. Rose, on the other hand, is a devout Catholic, author of the devastating book, Goodbye, Good Men, about the damage the Church did itself by recruiting gay priests, and web editor of the feisty New Oxford Review. In this brief but immensely useful polemic he outlines the challenges facing the new Pope and explains why Joseph Ratzinger may well have been the ideal man to confront them at this moment in the Church's history. Contrary to the expectations of the punditocracy and liberal Catholics, he suggests that:If any one point of reference can be taken as an augury of his papacy, it is Pope Benedict's clarion call to resist what he calls \\"the dictatorship of relativism.\\" [...] He defines this prevailing philosophy as one that \\"recognizes nothing as definitive and leaves as the ultimate standard one's own personality and desires.\\" In other words, according to the relativist philosophy, people who disagree on moral and social issues can be equally right.And if the defense of morality does prove unpopular in those segments of the West where gay marriage, abortion, multiculturalism, political correctness and the like are all the rage? Well, this Pope has said that the time may have come for a \\"mustard seed Church\\":The maximization of the number of faithful is not Pope Benedict's strategic objective. In 1995...Cardinal Ratzinger shocked the Catholic world by suggesting that it may need to disregard the notion of a \\"popular Church\\" that will be loved by everyone. He once wrote of the eighteenth-century Church, roiled by the Enlightenment, that it was \\"a Church reduced in size and diminished in social prestige, yet become fruitful from a new interior power, a power that released new formative forces for the individual and for society.\\" Similarly, his governing metaphor for the short-term destiny of Catholicism is the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32), suggesting a much smaller presence but with a faith whose dimensions could move mountains.Now, it seems at least possible that a Church that adheres to a strict moral vision will be more appealing than one that does not, but, regardless, it can hardly be the role of the Church fathers to trim their beliefs just to truckle to pop culture. That would be a betrayal of faith and of the Church.In the chapters that follow, Mr. Rose treats topics like the threat from radical Islam, potential damage from a too compromising ecumenism, the culture of death (or the \\"anti-culture of death\\" as the new Pope has aptly named it), the crisis of pedophile and gay priests, and reform of Church doctrine, bureaucracy and trappings. By the time he's done it's apparent that the Pope has a pretty full plate in front of him, but there also seems reason to hope that the man who was Ratzinger is up to all these challenges."},{"Title":"Benedict XVI: The Man Who Was Ratzinger","review":"Benedict XVI: The Man Who Was Ratzinger by Michael S. Rose is the inspirational story reveling the truth behind the myth of \\"Hitler's Pope\\" and what actualities grant Pope Pius XII the prestigious role he has taken on as the pope guiding millions of Catholics. As Benedict XVI introduces the realities of the new pope's history, it reveals an untold and heroic story of his struggle in earlier years for the relief of Jews in the midst of their own struggle with the Nazi reign.

For example, chapter three on imperialist nostalgia is a must-read for anybody who wants to understand the underpinnings of Western attitudes toward other cultures. Very eye-opening.There are other important ideas throughout the book. The tone of the book is scholarly and a bit labored. It took me more than a little discipline to finish the book.

In true postmodernist form, his study of the head hunting ritual of the Philippino Ilongots takes on personal interpretations that are shaped by the loss of his wife.Trying to reconcile his personal loss with the controversial study of a murder ritual make for an important ethnographic approach that should be an essential read for anyone who observes cultures and tries to understand them within their personal terms."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"The author is very talented teacher.

It would be nice if you could absorb new programming languages through osmosis, but it doesn't work that way. Some people will tell you to buy the K&R; book, but that's pretty old!

I've read my share of awful programming books and can tell the difference.C Primer Plus, 5th edition provides clear and detailed explanations of all concepts covered, as well as review questions and programming excercises at the end of each chapter. As any serious programmer knows, you can't learn just by reading. You have to DO the excercises. I regard the excercises a book has to offer as just as important as the material covered. The excercises in the Big Blue Book are varied and just challenging enough to really get you to remember what you read in each chapter.

Although I was not part of the decision to use it, I found it to be more than satisfactory. The explanations are detailed and the order of the coverage is appropriate, although like almost everyone else, I altered the order of presentation a bit. It covers what we commonly refer to as \\"plain vanilla C\\"; in other words programs run from a command line interface. The coverage is complete, everything that one would cover in any beginning course in C is present. The exercises and programming examples are generally well done, and the answers to the review questions are included.In looking through the fifth edition, I found very little that was different from the fourth edition. The order of the material and the explanations are almost identical. Therefore, my evaluation of the book is a bit different. I give it poor marks as a new edition, as I did not see anything that justified publishing a new edition. However, since the fourth edition worked so well, this one is also a good choice for learning C. Therefore, my rating of this book is simultaneously an A for content and an F in terms of being justified."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Excellent book that withstood the test of the time. Incidentally it has also sentimental value for me because many years ago, when I started my journey into progamming and had my first programming course in C itself, this book came to the rescue.The course textbook was a different one, which after the first couple of introductury chapters became vague. Especially on pointers it lost me.Then... I got this book. It started to read like an obsessive page turner. Once I reached the chapter on pointers I was amazed more-the topic in fact was extremly simple. I got very curious of the guys background. When I looked up that he was a physicist by upbringing, the great quality of the book made sence right away.In one word, this book is THE BOOK as a first book in C, especially for new programmers.After that ancient times, I red many C books of different complexity and scope, but this book still remains among few of my favorits for its lucid and extremly understandable coverage.As you can guess, the book has a sentimental value for me.In fact, if you have older version, especially last two, then there is no compelling reason to upgrade to this version.Have you finished the book?Now you are ready to enjoy the succinct C Programming Language, by Brian W. Kernighan, the author of C"},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This review is a rewrite of a previous review which I have deleted since on further reflection I have decided that it was too critical and did not represent the book fairly.Basically, I had given the book a low rating based on my belief that it is not suitable for beginners. While I still hold this view to some respect, I now feel that I placed too much emphasis on this criticism when I decided to give the book only two stars.Let's get that aspect out of the way first. My only real criticism of this book is that, as others have mentioned, the first 100 pages or so are a little long winded and potentially confusing for the beginner. The issue here is that Prata goes into, in my opinion, far too much detail when describing the printf() and scanf() functions along with their various conversion specifiers, modifiers and flags. As a total newcomer to C I felt like I was reading a reference manual at first. If you've never been exposed to C before - i.e. either you're a complete programming beginner or you've only ever programmed in simpler, higher level languages like BASIC or Python - then it can be quite overwhelming since the user is exposed to more layers of detail and complexity, with a much higher potential for bugs and errors. Unfortunately, Prata bombards the student with far more detail than is necessary at this stage.For example, is there any real need to cover so many conversion specifiers and modifiers, when surely it would be more prudent to explain two or three and then refer the student to an appendix for the rest? The same can be said with his treatment of data types - the book in my opinion dwells too much on types and their various possible sizes on various systems. As if that weren't enough, we're also exposed to another potential wave of confusion as Prata sees fit to bring different C standards into the equation. For example, consider the following passage on page 156 (still relatively early in the book):\\"When appearing in an expression, char and short, both signed and unsigned, are automatically converted to int or, if necessary, to unsigned int. (If short is the same size as int, unsigned short is larger than int; in that case, unsigned short is converted to unsigned int.) Under K&R; C, but not under current C, float is automatically converted to double. Because they are conversions to larger types, they are called promotions.\\"At a stage in which the beginner is not likely to feel very confident about the bigger picture, statements like this are liable to either confuse, bore or a mixture of both. I found that it disrupted the learning flow somewhat. At times during the first 150 pages of this book, I found my attention wandering as I worried which of the information I should be retaining and which was just extrenuous detail that I would pick up again later. It was a while before I felt like I was making any progress, put it that way.OK, so that's the negative out of the way. It's a little hairy for the beginner to begin with. But having now gotten all the way to the end of the book, I feel like heaping praise on what is a very well structured and thorough introduction to C.One of the main things I like about this book is that it doesn't treat the reader like a teenager. One of the most irritating things about some of today's modern programming texts is that they go out of their way to \\"liven up\\" the learning process, as if they're so worried that students are going to find the practice of programming boring that they feel like they have to inject goofy pictures, cheesy jokes and crossword puzzles into the proceedings (see the Head First series for a perfect example). Not so with Prata's \\"C Primer Plus.\\" Programming is a very logical, but complicated process and in truth that's what attracts a certain kind of mind to it. If a dry, logical approach to the subject doesn't attract you then to be honest programming isn't really for you. When you get down to the practical nuts and bolts of programming there are no cartoon gorillas or wordsearch puzzles or goofy analogies to liven things up. I can see the attraction to this style of learning for someone who isn't interested in programming at all but who is forced to learn it for a course, but if you're really enthusiastic about coding then a treatment like Prata's \\"C Primer Plus\\" is going to feel just right.He doesn't repeat himself to excess (like other programming authors I could name) and he builds on previously learned knowledge at a pace which is just right. Each chapter ends with a very well worded summary to stimulate recall, as well as some excellent review questions and programming exercises.The programming exercises are what really make this book in my opinion. They're graded just right and contain a mix of short exercises in which for example you're prompted to write a function that does some simple task to demonstrate some concept or other - and much larger exercises on which you can find yourself working most of the evening if your'e not careful. It's virtually impossible to breeze through the exercises in minutes, which means that if you stick to your guns and complete them, you really will feel confident and familiar with the concepts you've learned in that chapter. If you don't complete the exercises, you're not going to make it through this book, put it that way. I found them extremely useful and very satisfying to complete - for instance, in one exercise Prata has you writing a simple airplane booking program with two levels of menus, using structures which are then writen to disk in a binary file. It's upon completion of exercises like these that you really feel like you're a C programmer and it's impossible not to feel very pleased with yourself.The subject of pointers can be a make-or-break issue for the C student and on reflection Prata explains them very well indeed. Initially I was confused and a little frustrated, but I think that was because I'd found the book very easy up until that point that my brain took a little while to change to the required gear to understand them. But once I'd gotten over my initial confusion I found the subject very interesting and understandable. Again, the end of chapter exercises are a superb way to absorb and intergrate this topic.After a surprisingly understandable chapter on bit-fiddling and an admittedly dreary chapter on the preprocessor and the standard library, the book really takes it up a notch in the final chapter on advanced data representation and it was at this point I really started to feel things come together, albeit with some mental effort. The concepts of linked lists and binary trees can feel complicated to the beginner since it's a step up from the theoretical treatment of syntax and structure to a more applied subject. And while I found the subject of binary trees very heavy going at times, it was great to finally get through it and to feel like I understood it.After completing this book all the way to the end I really feel like I know enough about the basics of C to tackle some more involved programming texts and indeed I've just started \\"Practical Algorithms for Programmers\\" by Binstock and Rex, for which the last chapter of Prata's primer has really prepared me. It really feels as if I've worked out in a mental gymnasium.If you have done absolutely no programming before whatsoever then I'm not sure I'd recommend this book. In fact I'm not even sure I'd recommend C - maybe it would be better to play around with something like Python for a while in order to learn the basic concepts. This book is no \\"C for Dummies\\" and it does require a lot of time and effort to get through. But the results are worth it. This is probably the best (and most thorough) introduction to the C programming language on the market and it's worthy of a place on anyone's shelf."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This is a fantastic book, and I strongly recommend it. It walks you through the basic concepts and doesn't assume that you already know how to program. I picked up the 2nd Edition of this book over 10 years ago and taught myself how to program with it. At the time, I knew nothing about computer languages, but this book goes slow enough and explains the basic concepts so that I was able to learn. I have read a lot of programming books since that time, but I can say that this book was the most enjoyable and clearest that I have used. A lot of books try to teach you everything at once (GUI programming, object oriented programming, etc). I recommend learning C first with this book. Once you have the basics down, then go on to learning OOP and the GUI. Don't try to do it all at once."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Great book, and it assumes pretty much no programming knowledge; starts with the basics (variables, types, numering and so on) and moves, gradually and methodically, into the thornier aspects of the language. Takes its time, too -- perhaps to a fault; if you're a programmer with some experience (as I am), you might find it a little too slow, but then again, C's a rather unforgiving language, and Prata knows this well enough to spend ample amounts of time explaining the details and subtleties of the language's behavior that sometimes take years to learn on one's own. Lots and lots of problems and exercises, too, and highly readable at that. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I'm a freshman in college right now, and this book was required for my Intro to C class. Additionally, this is the first programming language (other than html, lol) I have ever studied.This book might scare you a little bit when you first pick it up; it's almost a thousand pages dedicated soley to learning a language that was first formally described in 1972. This language is old, and in some ways it shows. When you start studying an aspect of C such as pointers, you might wonder why something so low-level as memory addresses ever need to be understood. Thankfully, this book takes, in their own words, a \\"spiral\\" approach to learning the language. This book does not thoroughly go through each single aspect of C, one at a time. It does not thoroughly cover every method of input, then everything about arrays, then all about pointers, etc. Rather, the authors start by introducing you to a single, simple program and go on to describe what makes that program work. They might then cover a little bit about how to get input from the user, then move on for a chapter or two, and then return to input in more detail later.In general, the author will progress through the book by giving you a sample program, then explaining how and why it works. Wash, rinse, and repeat. This simple formula means that all of the practical methods introduced in the book are reinforced by useful and interesting theory.In this way, the authors have taken a massive and potentially overwhelming subject and turned it into something that you can play with. The authors start by giving you a basic toolset, and keep on giving you more tools at just the right time to keep you going. By the time you get to the tenth chapter (not to mention the twentieth), you'll have enough of an understanding of how C works to look at a complex program written by any professional programmer, and at least understand what the author of that program is trying to do. You may not understand all of the tools and methods that other programmer used, but at least you will not feel completely lost looking at someone else's code.All of the written examples in the book were tested on multiple machines with several (eleven?) different compilers, just to make sure that the programs given work as intended. I have found only two typographical errors in all my reading of the book, and both of those were noted on the publishers' website. This book is soundly fact-checked.What else to say? As a student who plans to make the most of their education (only one shot at it, haha), I couldn't be happier."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"C Primer Plus is an oddly written book. It treats its readers as absolute, or extremely novice programmers, yet if you try to read through the book from cover to cover, you could easily be overwhelmed over the amount of content. I wouldn't recommend the book ALONE as a sole source for a newcomer to C, there are better books that make the learning experience less overwhelming.With that said, I still highly recommend keeping this book on your shelf as a reference point and/or to use as a different view into a concept. It doesn't cover all of C and the standard libraries, but it covers the most important points and functions. The explanations tend to be more detailed and better than free resources such as sites like [...].My main gripe, as with most programming books, are with the code examples. The author sacrifices readability of the code (nesting function calls within an already lengthy scanf() statement, for example) for shorter code length. I'm sure this was done for logistic reasons, but I fear many newcomers will copycat the style of coding, a bad habit that'll be hard to break in the future. However, the code examples are very clear and concise."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Well-structured learning path and text organization. It feels like sidenotes and whatnot are included in all the right spots. The author tries to use humor fairly often, really doesn't pull it off, but I'm glad he does because it makes the book easier and more comfortable to read; so I guess if he's going for dorky then he succeeds well. The only problem I have is in the example/explanation code relatively frequently containing errors, i.e. bad syntax, mismatches between what is read in the text and what the code shows, using incorrect/misspelled variables/numbers/specifiers/etc. In a way, I suppose it adds to the educational effect and gears you towards debugging, but it still irritates me to read. This is the first programming book I've read, so I can't make a concrete comparison, but the purpose of the book is to teach, and it accompishes that very well."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Over the years, as I've flirted with the idea of really sitting down to learn C, I've looked at a variety of intro-to-C type books; I've even bought a couple - only to set them aside to collect dust.

Topics are presented logically, explained well, and include numerous sample programs in the text body to reinforce newly introduced ideas. If you take the time to walk through the sample programs, look at the review questions, and work on the end-chapter programming exercises, you'll be in good shape. This book is worth every bit of the purchase price; it will stay in my personal library for years to come and I will highly recommend it to friends and colleagues looking to learn core C programming skills.Note: I do have basic programming skills in other languages, but I think this book would be fine for any \\"true\\" novice as long as they gave themselves time and diligently worked through the exercises."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"If you want to learn C programming and new to it this is the book to start with.

If you just need to learn C, or you want to refresh your knowledge and see some new ways of doing your ordinary things, this is the best book you can find."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I absolutely love this book. Before this book, I found C _extremely_ intimidating. CPrimerPlus goes the opposite route of K&R; and provides thorough explanations as opposed to terse ones.The exercises are also great. Each chapter has a series of exercises ranging in difficulty. Do yourself a favor and DO THESE. You don't know for sure if you've learned the content in the chapters unless you can do the exercises!"},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I am finding this to be a great resource to learn programming both in general and specific to the C language. However, if you are familiar with a scripting language such as python, have some background knowledge about how computers and programming works, or are just quick on the uptake, then I encourage to use this text as a secondary source.In anticipation of my Intro to C class in University, I bought the K&R; C book and have found it immensely useful. However, K&R; assumes that you already know some of the the finer points of programming. It is terse and to the point, which is one of its great advantages, but it can also seem dense if some minor detail of bitwise calculation or conditional statements eludes you. Whenever I have difficulty with K&R; I turn to C Primer Plus. C Primer Plus can be counted on to have a lengthy and well written explanation. This faculty is invaluable whenever I am confused, but annoying when I get the picture and want to move on. Overall I find it to be a great complement to K&R; and would encourage this book over K&R; if a gun was pointed at your head (I understand this is a heresy). But the combination of both books is probably best for learning C quickly."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I have just started reading this book the day before yesterday and I'm only on pg.124 in ch.4 but I already know that this book is a must have for any beginner in C and with their index in the back of the book tells me that it is a great reference guide for veterans of C. I have read other programming books like Teach Yourself Visual Basic 2005 in 24 Hours (which is bad book-doesn't teach very well) and I have to say that this is one of the best programming books out there and it is a must own for any C programmer!"},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This is a great book for those who wants to learn C wihout any programming experience. The examples are well-explained and the exercises are pretty good.I wish I could give it more than five stars!!!"},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I bought this book in 2008 for self-study when I first decided to learn to program. I found its clear writing very accessible and the exercises extremely helpful. The chapters are detailed without ever being overwhelming, and there are frequent short code examples to drive the concepts home. I'm now starting my final year of a computer science degree, and I still use the book as a reference. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Yep the shelves are full of C and C++ books. It is not that one is better than the next. It is that sometimes it is good to have a book tell you what you already know in a different way. Then you can say \\"Oh, that's why it is done that way!\\" This is one of those books.This is a hands-on step-by-step book to get you started."},{"Title":"C Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Twice the size of most books on C, but the first two chapters alone have already cleared up a lot of my questions on how things work in computers, compilers, the language, etc. If you want to dive right in and just learn the basics you'd probably be better off with something else, but if you like to really understand the big picture, I think this book is the way too go. It's also less dry and academic than one would expect- the author has more conversational tone in the book which helps a lot."},{"Title":"Hot As Ice (Code Name: Danger) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"Unlike some of Merline Lovelace's longer books, this story lacks interest. The premise--pilot frozen in the 1950s is thawed out now--seems to promise readers an interesting look at the hero's adjustment to modern values, but in fact he makes the adjustment fairly easily. His sexism, etc., is all on the surface. The heroine isn't terribly interesting either--she could pass for the heroine of several other romances without trouble. If you're going to start with a sci-fi premise, you should DO something with it--not hang the same old romance plot on it and expect it to be enough."},{"Title":"Hot As Ice (Code Name: Danger) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"An Air Force pilot on a secret mission is frozen in the ice and is thawed out 45 years in the future. Great premise, different, interesting and enjoyable. Charlie was so heartbreaking with the shock he'd experienced and everything he knew and loved being gone. He tried so hard to adjust to the world as it is today.I \\"came of age\\" during the Women's Movement and I'm definitely liberated. Diana is upset because Charlie puts his hand on her back when they are walking and opens doors for her. I open doors for my sister or my mother or a man who's coming in as I'm going out. A man opening a door for a woman does not mean he's going to throw her over his shoulder, strip off her shoes and plop her in the kitchen with a strand of pearls around her neck and a frying pan in her hand. It's a sign of courtesy and respect. My husband opened the door for me on our first date and 21 years later he still does even if we're in the garage! On the other hand he has no problem going to the grocery store or my painting the outside of the house. What's the big deal?"},{"Title":"Hot As Ice (Code Name: Danger) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"I've read many of Merline Lovelace's books and this is a new favorite for me. She writes great heroines and this one is no exception. I love a woman who can take care of herself! Charlie is such a sexy hero. The chemistry between them. It's been so long since I've read something really different and fascinating from Silhouette like this. Hot as Ice was such a treat! The plot was original. The hero-adjusting-to-modern-life plot has been done to death in the time travel romances Silhouette and Harlequin published in the mid 90s. It was nice to see Lovelace concentrate on the action and adventure that makes this line special. This story requires some suspension of disbelief but the author made it ring true for me. I haven't been reading as many SIMs in the last few years. I got so sick of babies and cops and cowboys and amnesia. This one didn't have any of that, just an original romantic story. More like this and I'll have to start up again!"},{"Title":"Talking to Your Child About God: A Book for Families of All Faiths (Book Club Edition)","review":"I guess I should have known by the price but when I buy a new book, I expect a new book. The first non-amazon dealer sent me a filthy book, the second was at least clean and unworn but read in the packing slip notes it was from an estate sale. Shouldn't that be called like-new? New means from the book publisher, doesn't it? I can shop at half priced book stores and know what I am getting. I will be sticking with Amazon only sales going forward."},{"Title":"Recursive Partitioning and Applications (Statistics for Biology and Health)","review":"Brieman, Olshen, Friedman and Stone introduced CART in their 1984 book. It is an effective methodology and software tool for constructin classification and regression trees. The procedure is also referred to as recursive partitioning.There has been a great deal of research over the past 16 on this topic and the authors cover the basics and the new material well. New ideas include survival trees and adaptive splines (including MARS). It provides interesting applications to health science problems. Th authors compare tree based methods to logistic regression. This is a notable successor to the CART text.It is a little more difficult to read then CART. CART was motivated by biomedical problems but the book covered other applications in business and pattern recognition as well. This texts puts an emphasis on the important medical applications."},{"Title":"Recursive Partitioning and Applications (Statistics for Biology and Health)","review":"Zhang and Singer have done a splendid job of explaining recursive partitioning, a topic that should be of great interest to anyone who wants to make sense of data in which there are many potentially important variables contributing to some outcome or variable of interest. One should not be put off by the &quot;... in the Health Sciences&quot; part of the book's title; the potential audience of readers who can benefit from reading it is much greater than this implies (I'm an ecologist, for example). Why? First, because the topics covered have wide applicability in many fields; and second, because the writing is exceptionally clear and easy to follow. If you are able to use a typical introductory text on multiple regression, for example, you should have no difficulty getting a lot out of Zhang and Singer. If you are able to handle a mathematically rigorous approach to statistics but are new to the topics covered here, this book will provide an excellent starting place before you jump into the many references to the recent literature provided by the authors."},{"Title":"Recursive Partitioning and Applications (Statistics for Biology and Health)","review":"Recursive Partitioning in the Health Sciences is one of the few statistical texts specifically written with the epidemiologist as a target end user, similar in genre to Schlesselman's Case Control Studies. The subject matter is relatively new in the field of epidemiology and as such needs to be related contextually to more traditional statistical approaches. The authors accomplish this by incorporating introductory chapters on methods corresponding to those being addressed by the nonparametric methods of recursive partitioning and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Additionally, they compare results between these tried and true statistical methods and recursive partitioning and MARS with many illustrative examples. This last is a strength of this book. Examples of each topic under discussion are carefully considered in a stepwise manner. The book is nicely balanced in terms of theoretic background and practical applications, with the writing generally intelligible to the non-statistician. The book has provided our group with background material to allow utilization of recursive partitioning in our research.

It is a sensual love story set in Halifax, Nova Scotia woven into a historical event which is both amazing and overlooked in American history - probably because it happened in Canada! This book explores the beginnings of psychoanalysis as it follows the stories of several compelling characters after a devastating explosion in the harbor of Halafax which left much in its wake. It's epic. It's exciting. It's unique. It's informative. And it's sexy. I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"What a delight to read a story that captivates on so many different levels. The three main characters come to life and you can't help but care what happens to them and the people around them. The history of the Halifax explosion and its aftermath was fascinating. It really is amazing how little Americans know about Canada and Canadian history. Put it all together and you've got a story with sex, mystery, politics and religion that keeps you guessing how its going to turn out right up to the very end. A novel to truly get lost in for hours at a time."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"This book was informative and beautifully written. I loved Julia's story. Her dairy entries were so sensual and personal. MacNeil brought a beautiful woman to life for me. He wrote with such a feminine voice.

Overall, I loved it and have bought his \\"Voyage\\""},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"Historical fiction dealing with a little known historical event, the Halifax Explosion. Most people associate Halifax Nova Scotia with the Titanic Cemetery. The story of the Halifax Explosion is actually more horrendous because many more lives were lost than on the Titanic and injuries were far greater. Excellent writing and intriguing sub-plot. I read this book before visiting Halifax which made my visit even more meaningful."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"This was a very fast read for me. Indeed I was sorry to reach the end of it. MacNeil's reporting skills are evident in a strong, straightforward narration, filled with interesting (at least to me) detail on the tragic Halifax harbor explosion in 1917 and, more broadly, on Canada itself during WWI when it really seemed to establish its own national identity. Readers should also find the novel's characters both well-drawn and appealing, and its numerous sub-plots come together naturally in the satisfying conclusion. I strongly agree with one reviewer's comment that this is a refreshingly &quot;humane&quot; work. I recommend &quot;Burden of Desire&quot; highly."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"This book is truly captivating. I realized half-way through the book that there were only a couple of possible endings and found myself desperately wanting one over the other, probably because I had become so enmeshed in the lives of these characters.

My interest in \\"BURDEN OF DESIRE\\" was first kindled when I heard Mr. MacNeil talk about the 1917 Halifax tragedy on National Public Radio a few years ago. I was intrigued because I had never heard of this tragedy before. Then around Christmastime, I bought and read \\"BURDEN OF DESIRE\\". I became so wrapped up in the lives of the main characters (each of whom Mr. MacNeil creates with a full-bodied and multi-dimensional personality) that I felt as if I were a fly on the wall, watching events unfold.I give Mr. MacNeil special kudos for the way he created the main female character. From the way he wrote this novel, you'll feel that it is a real woman confiding her inmost thoughts in her diary.On so many levels, this is a well-written and beautiful story. Read \\"BURDEN OF DESIRE\\" and savor it. You'll be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"Brilliant description of the harbor explosion and its historical impact. Some great character background and a strong narrative. The priest is just too pathetic a character to draw much sympathy--others fare little better, but despite the chaos, the book is still interesting. Biggest letdown is the tendency to instill too much 1990s self-asorption, psycho-babble, me me me mentality into a different era in history, when the outlook and lives of people were quite different than they are in the North America of today. Still, a more appealling work overall than most of the fiction I've run across the last 10 years."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"I love this book. It is the best of the fiction books I have read this winter, yet has received the least acclaim. I have to wonder if the title has been an impediment."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. The historical aspect is very interesting and the plot is unique. The message - that convention can be paralyzing to all types of societies (religious, military, political, geographic) - is stong enough to stand on its own. Only a male author would feel the need to create the perfect woman to deliver that message. Julia is perfect in every aspect - she is young and physically beautiful (with long blonde hair); she is compassionate, benevolent, intelligent, mentally stable, strong, opinionated, and couragous. She enjoys and desires sex. She possesses a keen sense of humor and a perspective on life that is typically exhibited by much older characters. She is, in a word, unbelievable."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"I'm getting ready for a trip this summer to Nova Scotia and love to read books about places I'm visiting. This is a wonderful romance, but deeply embedded in the social history of Halifax during World War I. We see the toll the war takes, how patriotism is used and misued, and the class tensions between Catholics and Church of Englanders. Canadians are striving for their own kind of recognition from England, by sending huge numbers of men to the front, to carry out the most dangerous missions in a war that over time became meaningless. An engaging read."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I've known about the event for years but never known what happened exactly.

Because of this event, Halifax sends Boston a Christmas tree every year as thanks for what we did."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"Robert MacNeil writes a book that reads almost at thriller level, yet provides insight into the lives of several people affected by the explosion of a munitions ship in Halifax harbor during the First World War. The tragedy claimed some 2000 lives and flattened half the city. As did Hugh MacLennan in Barometer Rising, an earlier novel about the same disaster, MacNeil sticks close to the historical record of an event known to few Americans. He engages the reader's continued interest in each character in this upbeat book. In Halifax, I learned that Boston dispatched the first substantial aid, and is venerated by Nova Scotians even today as a result. All this MacNiel weaves into the background of his story. All in all, an impressive achievement."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"In 'Burden of Desire', Robert MacNeil focuses on the Halifax bombings, an event that remains obscure history for a lot of modern readers. He then shows the aftermath of these bombings and the setting in which they take place, as seen through the eyes of 3 protagonists. There's Peter Wentworth, the golden boy, who's struggling with questions of faith and repression: personal happiness versus public expectations and doctrine versus the spirit. Then there's Stewart MacPherson, a brilliant psychoanalyst and army doctor. Struggling to make a difference during an era that was still shaping concepts of mental health, trying to treat PTSD when the term hadn't even been coined yet, Stewart throws himself wholeheartedly into the all the new developments - feminism, medicine, psychiatry, sexual experimentation - while trying to make sense of a world that keeps changing every time he tries to catch up with it.And then there's Julia Robertson. Julia is bright, witty, rebellious, unconventional, free thinking, forward thinking, tortured, sensual, brilliant, compassionate, incredibly beautiful and and beloved by all. She is the widow of a fallen war hero and her diary - discovered during the bombing - form a common link between Stewart and Peter as they read the entries and both fall in love with the woman who wrote it.Julia is also whiny, irritating, angsty, a huge Mary Sue and the singular reason why this is a 3 star and not a 4 star review. Unfortunately, I suspect that McNeil may have been a little too enraptured by this character and therefore failed to flesh her out or give her any noticeable suffering or consequences. She advocates the natural enjoyment of sex - but remains celibate. She sneers at the repression of society - but all of society (including her snooty in-laws) adores her. She spends a great deal railing about the suffering caused by the bombings, but rarely gets her lovely blonde hair dirty doing anything like serving at the hospitals or cleaning evacuated areas. She's an outspoken atheist in the early 20th century, but somehow is not made a pariah for it. Instead, she reduces Peter - a trained wartime minister - to speechlessness with a one liner. Even romantic rivals become so enraptured by Julia that they wander around (literally!) quoting Julia's brilliant thoughts, which consist of gems such as: \\"After walking on the beach, we found sand at the bottom of the bed no matter how much we washed our feet.\\" And no, that's not a parable or metaphor for anything, it's just an example of Julia's inane nattering that everyone else seems to find so fascinating.If Julia were a secondary character, I'd say that the other 2 characters, the lyrical prose and vivid wartime setting would be enough to carry the novel, but since she forms the center of it, she drags everything down with her."},{"Title":"Burden of Desire","review":"This book is a complete surprise. Its title is at once misleading and accurate: one might easily expect \`Burden of Desire' to be third-rate lightweight romantic escapism for a female readership. The only reason I read it was that I was urged to do so by a friend whose judgement I trust.It is, in fact, an historical novel of depth, complexity and insight, which starts from a single event - the explosion of a munitions ship in Halifax harbour, Nova Scotia, in 1917 - and traces the aftershock of that disaster through the lives of three main protagonists, a woman and two men. In examining the psychology of the sexual repression and liberation of a post-Victorian era, it provides a detailed, almost clinical analysis of - yes, you've guessed it - the burden of desire.It is above all a study of conflict: the Freudian tension between sexual repression and liberation, certainly, but also the conflict between the entrenched hierarchical certainties of the past and the fluid uncertainties and passionate experimentalism of the present.The main arena for this conflict is in the characters of the three protagonists. Julia Robertson, unfulfilled wife of a soldier absent for two years, is stifled by the attitudes and expectations of family and society. Peter Wentworth, Anglican clergyman, is repressed on the one hand by theology and church hierarchy, and oppressed on the other by his own inadequate marriage and by the social and financial ambition of his in-laws. Stewart MacPherson, psychologist and student of Freud, does daily battle with medical, military and political authorities who refuse to acknowledge issues of mental health. These three are forced to confront a challenging agenda, ranging from personal loyalty and honesty to the meaning of courage, honour, duty and heroism.In the wake of the three main characters, and alongside the baggage-train of their families, friends and neighbours, the city of Halifax - or rather, the aspirational middle-class element of Halifax - is a player in the drama in its own right. The social ambition; the strident patriotism and jingoism of a colonial city at war at the behest of its ruling power; the uneasy relationship with the less refined Canadian hinterland and the uneasier relationship with Canada's brash, energetic young neighbour to the south - all these factors create an environment of mental turmoil, an emotional and societal powder-keg ripe for detonation by a far lesser spark than an exploding munitions ship.\`Burden of Desire' is a demanding read, as one would expect from a writer of MacNeil's intellectual calibre. One would not want to spend forever in this atmosphere of unbridled Freudian sexual self-awareness, but it is a thoroughly satisfying read with a credible conclusion.In fiction, my fifth star is normally reserved for the kind of prose that sinks deep into the mind for the sheer beauty and majesty of the language. MacNeil is a supremely competent writer, but the language of \`Burden of Desire' stops just short of this kind of inspired linguistic craftsmanship."},{"Title":"Penelope Puggle: Science Class Stomachache","review":"\\"Penelope Puggle: Science Class Stomachache\\" is a classic example of the inequalities that exist in our world- and as their roots form with our children.

Character development was not only thorough but had a sense of optimism, from Barbicane's vision to Ardan's intelligent arrogance. This book was no doubt enjoyable upon its first release, but the events take on new meaning when read in our age. The entire story seemed somewhat uplifting, especially when compared with something depressing like Paris in the 20th century, which unfortunately was also prophetic. A reader should note that while the concept is similar to The First Men in the Moon by Wells, the storyline immediately diverges from its counterpart. While Wells' work is pure, though enjoyable, fantasy, Verne's uncanny sense of future events keeps the reader grounded while reading what was at the time utter speculation."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"I have always been a fan of Verne. His scientific knowledge is presented in such a way that, if you don't know what he is talking about, he will explain it to you, and if you still don't get it, you will at least be convinced that what he is saying is truth. I loved this book and could not put it down. It almost remindes me of David Bowie singing &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. The sequal to the book is likewise similar to Peter Shillings answer song, &quot;Major Tom&quot;. This is a great book, and will be loved by any Verne fan, or a fan of the &quot;Steampunk&quot; genere."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"I would recommend this book for older people who could understand all those strange and odd calculations that Jules Verne made.

I would recommend for people to read the unabridged version last and the edited version first."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"Although there are many technical words concerning scientific field, I enjoyed reading the story. I can not believe it was written over 100 years ago. The unique idea of sending a projectile to the moon sounds strange, but whoever else but Jules Verne would have thought so? Just like Walt Disney Production made a motion picture of Verne's 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA in 1954, I strongly hope that they will make it into a major motion picture in the year 2005, commemorating the CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY of his death."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"My boyfriend bought From the Earth to the Moon, and since he is an Astrophysics student I expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time. He however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn't make much sense. Well, from a layman's perspective I found from the Earth to the Moon engaging. It goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic, Physics and Astronomy. Even from my scientifically deprived perspective, a lot of things in the book didn't make much sense, such as the actual method of getting to the moon, but this doesn't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal. The book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous. I was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work, and what these poor souls were going to come up with next. Compared to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and even Journey to the Centre of the Earth however, From the Earth to the Moon is noticeably less imaginative. Verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality, and much unlike his other works, doesn't stray far from the earthly. Some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion, but all in all From the Earth to the Moon is a good read. If you drop at the sight of f(x) = y, then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking, Centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate. If you really know your Physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today. If you, like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then From the Earth to the Moon is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"Verne writes a great story in From the Earth to the Moon, ending on a cliff hanger that leaves you wondering, exploring all the science of his day, and the possibilities therein. Sometimes it can get a bit long-winded, but overall, a fun read.The second portion is far less so, however. One gets the impression that, after his first novel was published, he suffered a large amount of scientific criticism, or else new scientific data came in, denying some of what he had written. Perhaps he simply gave in to critics who claimed the novel seemed unfinished. And so he wrote a second novel, and wrote too much. A Trip Around It suffers from extreme long-windedness, and tedious explanations of what we have observed of the moon, and what was hypothesized about the moon in Verne's day. I kept on reading, skimming finally, waiting for the action to begin, waiting for something to develop- and was disappointed. This is a novel about three men who are all rather big on themselves, traveling in cramped quarters, describing fictional and real geography. And it's simply not fun to read a novel whose characters are only proud people. This was perhaps a book that served a scientific purpose for understanding the lunar terrain, when it was written. Now it is more of a historical note on Verne's failure, and how not to write."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"I bought this book for a school project and really enjoyed reading it. It was intriguing and well written. The story line really pulled me in."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"If you're fond of the English, you're an Anglophile; if you like the French, you're a Francophile. It escapes me what the equivalent word would be for someone who loves the United States, but whatever that \\"-phile\\" is, Jules Verne fits right in. I noticed this with other books like The Mysterious Island, but it's front-and-center in From the Earth to the Moon.This story focuses on the Gun Club, a group of American designers of various projectile weapons. Depressed over the end of the Civil War (and with no prospect of a new war in the near future to make weapons for), the Gun Club decides to make a massive cannon to shoot a projectile to the moon.The bulk of the book is about the design and manufacture of this device, and this is why the book falters: it has no real characters, just talking heads who discuss the science and engineering of their inventions. We learn a lot about the moon, though for all the information he gives, sometimes Verne gets the science glaringly wrong (such as when he says the far side of the moon is always in absolute night).Though there is a bit of suspense about whether the launch will succeed or not, it hurts this book that it's hard to care about such one-dimensional characters. As a tribute to American industry and intelligence, this book does well, but as a story, not so much (though there is a fair amount of humor to entertain readers). One final note: this book ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, setting up the sequel Around the Moon."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is a great story, but this particular edition falls flat. The book's description is nonexistent, as the entry refers to 'classic works' that should not be forgotten, with no mention of the particular product in question. The author's source is clearly labeled in the back of the book, which itself is poorly edited and checked. There are spelling mistakes and the paragraphs are not indented (giving it copy/paste appeal with no formatting). Even the table of contents is incorrect. The table of contents.At 8 1/2\\" x 11\\", it feels inelegant, more like a textbook than a classic adventure novel. It's possible it was designed like this, but most likely the larger format makes for an easier packaging of other large classic works.It's Jules Verne, which is a great thing. But there may be better, more attractive editions to gravitate towards."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"I don't typically like to read a look of books, but this was one book was absolutely awesome to read and one I will probably read again in a few years. Definitely a great read."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"Honesty compels me to report that I didn't really read a lot of Jules Verne's novels when I was a lad: _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870), _The Mysterious Island_ (1874-5), and _Around the World in Eighty Days_ (1873). That was all. But I read those three novels over and over-- especially _The Mysterious Island_, which I thought was the Best Desert Island Story, Ever. I still have my boyhood copies of these novels, illustrated by pen and ink drawings and watercolors by Henry Pitz-- an artist who was born to illustrate Verne. In my copy of _Twenty Thousand Leagues..._ I recently discovered a bookmark that I once drew by hand, decorated with balloons, spaceships, islands, and submarines. On the side, it was labeled _Voyages Extraordinaires_.Verne is at the mercy of his translators. Many translations of Verne have been extraordinarily bad over the years. You may want to invest a few extra bucks in the World's Classics editions of Verne (published by Oxford University Press), which have generally excellent translations by experts such as William Butcher. The 1997 Bantam Classic edition of _From the Earth to the Moon_ (1865) uses a 1967 translation by Lowell Bair. Alas, I am not enough of an expert to judge the accuracy of Bair's translation, but he seems to have done an excellent job of catching Verne's sense of irony and wit. (Many translations make Verne's novels seem wooden and stilted.)The Civil War has ended, and the members of the Baltimore Gun Club are despondent. They can no longer design bigger guns or calculate elaborate trajectories to kill hundreds of people at a time. Worse still, no new wars from England or France seem to be in the works. Morale is low, attendance is down. One member, \\"his wooden legs... slowly charring in front of the fireplace in the smoking room\\" (4) mourns: \\"Where are the days when we were awakened by the joyful booming of cannons?\\" (5).*Shortly afterward, President Impey Barbicane (Yankee to the core) announces a bold plan to other members of the Gun Club. They will build a giant cannon that will shoot a spaceship to the Moon. The announcement is greeted with wild enthusiasm by the American public. The upper class drink sherry coblers in celebration, while boatmen drink knock-me-downs. There is cheering in the streets. The astronomers at Cambridge Observatory provide a plan for how to make the launch succeed... and off we go.It is not difficult for modern readers to point to scientific errors in the novel. A cannon could not really shoot a projectile with enough force to achieve escape velocity from Earth, a velocity of seven miles per second would have squashed any astronauts, and aluminum is too soft a metal for a spaceship.But the novel holds up surprisingly well. Why? because Verne shows us the process of developing the project-- from the planning stages, to the building stages, to the launching of the spacecraft. And Verne piles on such detail at every step that he makes us exclaim in spite of ourselves: \\"_Mais oui, mais oui_... It _could_ have happened like that!\\"And there are some things that Verne _did_ get right. The shape of the spacecraft, the number of astronauts, the launch site in Florida, the behavior of objects in zero-gee, the current day knowledge of the creation of the universe, and basic information about the Moon.Finally, Verne never takes his characters too seriously. We stay with the novel because there is a human element involved. We watch to see what they will do next and to laugh at their foibles. Verne's sense of humor helps to carry the day.I avoid revealing the endings of novels in my reviews. But I think that it is fair to warn the reader that this novel ends with a cliffhanger. It should be read in conjunction with its sequel, _Round the Moon_ (1870). This novel is highly recommended. It is brisk, lively, imaginative, and entertaining.* It is hard to read these pages without thinking of the modern Military Industrial Complex._Addendum_: At the time that I wrote the body of this review, I stated that I didn't know how good the Bair translation was. Since that time, I have consulted a bibliography of English translations of Verne's books by Arthur B. Evans (2005) on which many translations are rated. Evans rates the Bair translation as \\"poor,\\" though no further details are given."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"I think this was an excellent book filled with adventurous scenes. I enjoyed this book greatly and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure. This was action-filled and very exciting. It was action-filled in the scense that a cannon was being launched to the moon with a human in it. There were many arguments over this situation, and many different outcomes. The setting of this book stuck out to me the most, because it was in the U.S. That was interesting because the foreign author did her best to talk about all qualities of the U.S and what it would be like to actually shoot a cannon from here. This meant that she had to use very good back round information, and that's what made it so interesting. I found some things out about where I live from a foreign person that I didn't even know before. This book is best suited for people who enjoy learning about the moon and other scientific experiments that take place in outer space. This is becasue the cannon is being shot to the moon, but before that takes place many experiments have to be taken on the moon."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"From the Earth to the Moon and A Trip Around It is a clasic... but this copy of the book was a let down.

Verne was a satiric critic whose novel strongly hints at the future military industrial complex. This story depicts a club of artillery experts, the Baltimore Gun Club, bemoaning the end of the U. S. Civil War. The President of the Club, Impey Barbicane, comes up with a new project: a cannon shot to the moon. The idea for having passengers comes from a Frenchman. Most of the novel is concerned with the preparations for the launch which occurs at the end of the book. The story continues in Verne's sequel, &quot;Round the Moon&quot; (1870). It's amazing how many things Verne correctly predicted. Verne was perhaps the first author who attempts to make his novels agree with the science known at his time, although there are still mistakes. Verne is also making a number of political points as well in comparing the freedom observed in the U. S. and the real lack of such freedom in France of the 1860s. Readers should also note that Walter James Miller has provided an annotated edition of this novel in 1978 that is excellent."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"While I naturally have long admired Jules Verne for his outstanding scientific vision and prodigious talent as a writer, I really had no idea that he could also write in such an entertaining and humorous fashion as revealed in this short novel. My memories of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea consist to a large degree of stretches of pages devoted to pure scientific language that could be hard to get through, but this book is an easy read full of action and laugh-out-loud commentary. Don't get me wrong, though--the science is here, and Verne goes into a lot of details concerning the project from conception to reality, walking us through all of the steps involved in constructing the cannon and its projectile. Surely, though, Verne knew that the very idea of launching men to the moon via a superhuge cannon was not really an idea that could work; as such, he lets the story and especially his characterizations of the main players in the drama, take center stage over the science. What we end up with is a study of sorts of the American character, a tribute to the power of imagination and dreaming, the glorification of science, and a very funny story about some really amazing characters.I can not begin to relate the number of truly humorous anecdotes and observations filling the pages of this story. Barbicane, J. T. Maston, and Michel Ardan are quite memorable characters, and their acts and exploits will entertain you to no end. Verne introduces subtle but hilarious remarks and observations throughout the entire book that will make you laugh out loud. If the idea of hard scientific theorizing has scared you away from Verne, pick this book up and be wholly entertained. I would recommend, though, that you pick up a copy that also contains the sequel, Round the Moon. This first book essentially culminates in the firing of the men into space inside the projectile, and you will certainly want to read the story of what happens to the men afterward. I now have to find a copy of the second book, so I urge others to save yourselves time and buy both stories in one package."},{"Title":"From the Earth to the Moon","review":"I am a 12-year-old girl and I am really into astronomy and math and science and I'd have to say that this is a great and educational read if you are someone like me.

It features the Gun Club, a club established during the Civil War whose members tend to be a little...er...&quot;incomplete,&quot; as one of the characters himself puts it. These men are growing bored in the absence of opportunities to construct and test out new artillery weapons, so their president, the imperturbable, confident Barbicane, proposes they send a projectile to the Moon via a gigantic cannon! This idea is greeted with great approval from the world over, as Barbicane and his club work to organize all the details of the experiment and make sure everything will go perfectly. But despite lots of support from many nations, one man, Barbicane's main enemy, Captain Nicholl, bets several thousand dollars that the experiment will go amiss. To add to the confusion, right in the midst of things, a suave, passionate Frenchman named Michel Ardan decides to ride to the Moon in the projectile himself! I thought this book was, more than anything, very amusing. Verne's way of making his characters truly jump off the page with their vivid dialogue and lovable quirks provides for an abundance of understated humor. I also admired the book's thoroughness in its portrayal of the organization needed to help really get this project &quot;off the ground,&quot; from the discussions of the necessary precautions to take, through the math and scientific facts that guide the crafty inventors, up to the assembly of the cannon. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns and character revelations which fit nicely into the story.

When it did? The \\"information\\" inside fizzled out so quickly when I researched it, that I was totally buzzed killed by the end.The fact that it actually directed me to reported, confirmed, SCAM dropshipping sites, Wholesaler sites, and also blatant ridiculous sales pages for other scammers - tells me either that these \\"authors\\" (one of whom is the founder of [...], one of the worst ripoffs and worst sites for Ebay sellers I've ever seen and been burned by in the past) either did almost absolutely no quality testing whatsoever of the sources they recommend, or more likely they were paid to promote these scams in their \\"book\\" and were actively in on them, and profited from them. The impression I got at the end, and after researching their recommendations was that they were paid handsomely for promoting these scams, including the authors own mega scam, Doba.Beyond the scams they actively promote, they just barely did basically the pre-lim research you could do on the web yourself on google; and filled their book with it...All the while telling you in every chapter \\"You dont need a book to tell you this...\\" or \\"use your imagination...\\"This book leads down a path to nowhere, and quickly by the end drops you off a cliff of dead information, and common sense you shouldnt have to pay for.

In a couple of cases, there were only spam websites that were very similar in URL to the websites suggested in the book.This probably was a very informative book back in 2007, but it is fairly useless today.

I have been reading his books for many years, and I have come to dearly love Jilly Coppercorn. It was a treasure to read her story. It was also heartbreaking. It is not an easy story. Jilly is not always the wonderful, wonderous person full of grace that you may have come to know through prior stories. Now we know what shadows her smile, sometimes, or holds her back with some people. She becomes less &amp; more all at once, because she becomes more human.

Events that happened in previous books were referred to at least in passing, and usually in such a way that you didn't miss anything even if this was your first Newford novel. I didn't get that feeling reading Onion Girl. It referred to too much, leaving me feel not only like I was missing something, but that I was missing my motivation to be interested. There was such a strong sense that so much had come before, but very little to explain, so I had no real introduction to the characters. Too much was assumed. Sophie and Jeck? Who? Wendy? Angel &amp; Joe? Hunh? Did I miss something? I've read his short story collections and I can't remember a one of them.Of course, it doesn't help that of all the characters in Newford, I've never been especially interested in Jilly Coppercorn, the focus of this book. From the first, she's struck me as a cipher: a happy-go-lucky artist who believes in everything in a magical city and rarely ever has a bad day and de Lint's later attempts to flesh her out with an overwhelmingly dark history have always felt heavy handed. It has, in fact, been no small relief that his more recent works haven't involved this character. This obviously isn't the case this time around.In the end, I can't help but feel that this is a collection of his &quot;greatest bits&quot; put together with great force into a medley. Spirit world? Check. Animal people and fairies? Check. Lost sister? Check. Jilly? Check. Great danger? Oh yeah. Skeptic who reluctantly comes to believe in magic? Check. Heck, even the Crow Girls have a cameo. After a while it feels less like an original novel and more like a collage of moments woven together mostly to reward long-time fans and that's very disappointing.Check it out from a library if you're curious, I doubt I'll be in any great rush to reread it, let alone buy it for myself at any point in the future."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"if you have read forests of the heart you'll love this. i had walked by it for months and kept picking it up thinking about buying it so finally I did. and I loved it."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"First, you must understand that I am a serious Charles De Lint fan. I go out of my way to rummage through every dusty bookshop I can find for original copies, and have a special shelf just for my little treasures. Mr. De Lint's tales have supported me through some very difficult times, and brought me much joy.That said, I must say that if you are a recovering victim of abuse - Please - STAY AWAY. This book brought back all the horrible things I lived through, ripping away all the old scabs and exposing all the wounds. Nothing was gained other than those well remembered sleepless nights and wrenching panic attacks, wondering what was just around the corner, and when the horror would begin again. I am starting to pack it away again, but it will be a long, painful process, with no good to show from it.I don't know what twisted idea reached into his soul, but I don't think I will ever receive the same joy from one of the Newford tales ever again after reading this book.... and that is much sadder than you will ever know...."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I am about 250 pages in new &quot;Onion Girl&quot; novel. I must say that this novel is a major disappointment. Mr De Lint lost the sense of wonder that seemed to permeate his earlier books like &quot;Moonheart&quot;,&quot;Spiritwalk&quot;, &quot;Little Country&quot; and even too long but brilliant &quot;Memory and Dream&quot;. Enough with political correctness please. How many times can we read about poor runaways and beautific homeless people with crazy gleam in their mismatched eyes and one foot in the Otherworld?It seems to me that Mr De Lint developed a template for his novels and now seems to mix familiar formula, pick another character from his rich Newford managerie of characters and let the book roll off the presses. What a waste of an effort. Jilly Coppercorn was one of the most intruguing characters in his Newford collection &quot;Memory and Dream&quot;. I still fondly remember her appearance in &quot;Stone Drum&quot; story. &quot;Onion Girl&quot; is heavy, sentimental and totally lacking in any charm.I am deeply disappointed in this book, just like most of his recent Newford novels, like &quot;Trader&quot; and &quot;Someplace To Be Flying&quot;.Don't waste your money like I did. Wait for this book in paperback in a used bookstore. Maybe if writers who gave up on originality would feel the pinch of decreased sales, then they would feel motivated to give us something original instead.If you need your new De Lint fix, read &quot;Granny Weather&quot; short story in new Year's Best Fantasy and Horror edited by Terry Windling instead."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Before offending serious fans of the author, I must say that this is my first book by De Lint. Hopefully, the otehrs are better, but I do not think I will even attempt reading them.While the idea is not very original-co-existing of muttiple worlds is not new, even if one of them is the Spiritworld, it is interesting. I particularly liked the inhabitants of teh Dreamlands as they were not superior beings, but people with flaws, similar to ours.The plot however was full of cliches--abused children, people who have suffered but because of their generous souls have managed to overcome the hand delt to them, a whole city obviously inhabitted by nothing else but white trash, mafiots, druig dealers, corrupted cops, etc. And from these horrid surroundings, the herroine appears as a phoenix--untouched by the dirt and ashes. She is so perfect she is repulsive. Even the author's attempt to give her some humanity by briefly desctibing her dark past fails to stain her. And everyone loves her so much, that you begin to hate her. Urgh! The formula of a trash novel has been applied to The Onion Girl. But because of its clear ambition to be more than a trash novel, it comes through as cheaper and more superficial than that.I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"this is simply one of the worst books I've ever read. Although I have heard of De Lint, I've never read any of his books before now, and I definitely won't be reading any more. A mind-numbing mish-mash of formulaic bad guys (bad girls, in this case) and equally formulaic righteous good guys (mostly very nice, sweet young girls, in this case, with a few sensitive new-age guy hangers-on). Evil twins, sin and salvation, death and resurrection, the spirit creators of the Earth and the limitless forest at the edge of our dreams, all get dragged through the mud by a bunch of characters that were apparently inspired by the cast of Felicity (or maybe Dawson's Creek). If you are interested in this \\"urban fantasy\\" thing, please, do yourself a favor and read something by John Crowley, whose pencil shavings are probably more interesting than this sad, sad book."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"After I finished &quot;The Onion Girl&quot; last night, I sat there feeling vaguely dissatisfied and tried to figure out why. I think it all comes down to what some other reviewers have pointed out: we've seen this before - numerous times and handled better than this.DeLint's earlier books had a sense of wonder and delicacy both in his writing and in his portrayals of characters and Dreamlands/Otherlands. As you read, it felt as if the magical place he was talking about was not only real but that it could be fragile as well; it *was* real but only as long as you believed and DeLint was very good at making us believe. With this book, however, I didn't feel drawn in - more like bludgeoned. It reads along the lines of &quot;You will believe in Newford and in the Dreamlands because I say so.&quot;Characters in this book are not there so much to show as to tell which tends to rob the book of much of its possible emotion. We're told how wonderful Jilly is, we're told how much her friends are frightened for her or pulling for her to get better, but we're never shown it. We're surrounded by all these people who have supposedly pulled themselves up by their bootstraps or dealt with hard things in life but everyone reads the same regardless of their prior experiences. Wendy, positioned as a character with a normal (read: non-abusive) childhood, comes across no differently than Jilly or Sophie. We're told she has a hard time relating to the childhood Jilly experienced but it comes across like a line in a script read by an extremely poor actress. There is nothing to back up what we're being told to feel. Everyone is the same flat character with different names.Raylene's &quot;transformation&quot; rings hollow. Her motivation in this story has essentially been payback. She's face to face with the person, has the means and the method, and she suddenly decides not to? And in such a way that intimates some noble self-sacrifice when, all through the book, we're given example after example about how she's out for what she can get for herself? There is nothing that points to this completely unbelievable change of heart except perhaps DeLint wanted a happy (or happier) ending after &quot;Forests of the Heart&quot;.The Newford books seem to be becoming more about DeLint's personal likes/dislikes/agenda than him setting the characters down and letting them tell the story. We're treated to page after page of a character or characters wandering around in Native American or Celtic myths/stories/dreamlands and these scenes read as a too-long &quot;Let me show all the things I know about this culture&quot; rather than as vital to the story. In addition, although normally I like seeing the little snippets regarding music and musicians in his book, there is one paragraph regarding a band that comes in completely from left field and seems designed simply to advertise friends of DeLint's and nothing more.Overall, I felt the book fell flat on its face with its themes. What could have been an exploration of the meaning of family, how/if the events of the past color the future, child abuse, et cetera, were drowned out by DeLint and his Anvil Chorus. Between the coy phrasing of abuse victims as &quot;Children of the Secret&quot; and Jilly's apparent canonization, there is nothing real about this book or Jilly's and Raylene's experiences to hang onto. Instead, we're treated to a really long hurt/comfort fanfic.At one point, a character says something to the effect of &quot;children are our most precious resource&quot;. While true, it reads as the author needing to make sure we get that point and providing it via anvilicious methods. We. Get. It. Charles.Will I read another DeLint book? Possibly - I'll at least give him one more chance. However, I definitely won't be buying it in hardback. I'll content myself with my copies of &quot;Jack of Kinrowan&quot; and &quot;Trader&quot; until his next book comes out in paperback. If his next book is the same as &quot;The Onion Girl&quot;, I''ll sadly clear his books off my shelf and go in search of a new author who can make me feel the way DeLint used to."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"In the Onion Girl, De Lint fans will find his usual superb writing and his interesting take on mythologies and urban fantasies; however, as a De Lint fan, be prepared to have the veil removed regarding the always cheerful, favorite character, Jilly.New readers for De Lint are better off starting with books like Moonheart or The Little Country--they are a little more lighthearted and more descriptive of both De Lint's urban Newford and his spirit world. The Onion Girl is darker and relies more on past Newford characters and their experiences 'crossing over' into fantasy as well as their experiences with the spirits in our world.As a longtime De Lint fan, this book is as enjoyable as always."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I am a fan of Charles de Lint and can't imagine actively disliking anything he writes, but I have to admit that this is not my favorite de Lint novel. Jilly Coppercorn has long been one of my favorite de Lint characters, but in The Onion Girl, de Lint tells me more than I wanted to know about Jilly. The magical veil is somehow ripped away, and I am face-to-face with a character I maybe don't like as much as I thought I did.And, speaking of characters, there is an almost dizzying array of them and there were times when I had trouble keeping score. I didn't feel as though I got to know any of them in this novel -- there simply wasn't enough space for anyone in this pantheon to fully develop. I think that the lack of character development contributed to a sense of disbelief and some real confusion about the actions of some of the characters, especially Wendy and Raylene.In spite of all of this, I did enjoy the book and I remain an avid fan of Charles de Lint, all of his people - fairie and otherwise -- and all of his worlds!"},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Here is another fantastic novel by the master of the urban fantasy. This one is about Jilly Coppercorn, a painter who seems to peek her head in on most of de Lint's stories, whether they are short stories or novels. De Lint sets a majority of his tales in the North American city of Newford, and whether Jilly has a small or large part in the story, she is at Newford's heart; all the characters seem to have been affected by Jilly's kindness, charm and buoyant good nature. Jilly is the Onion Girl, however, and we see a much darker part of her than ever imagined before. This book is about the past, and how it can come snapping back to us, teeth blazing, when we least expect. This is one of those Chihuahua-smooshing burglar-stunning kinds of books, but it reads as fast as a 250 page-sized version. As usual, there is magic, and creatures far older than you or I, who were old when the world was created. But the thing I admire the most about de Lint's fiction, and this book is no different, are his characters. They are the ones who help out at soup kitchens and take in stray cats and bring people in off the street. These are people who have seen hard times themselves and go out of their way to help others. It is the simple fact that these people are good, in the purest sense of the word. And at the end of the novel, I truly wished Jilly was a real person that I could phone up and tell exactly how much I admire and love."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. To be completely fair, it is the first book I've read by this author and I realise there's other books that come before it in this series. From what I've read of other reviews, it's not necessarily the best book of his for a total newbie to start off with.I did like the world Charles de Lint created. The gritty fantasy aspects of it reminded me a bit of some of Neil Gaiman's work. I thought the character of Raylene was very well developed. I personally didn't have trouble sympathising with her, even though she wasn't a very \\"nice\\" person. The other characters were not as well-developed though, and Jilly in particular seemed very different from the vivacious personality everybody claimed her to be. She was actually rather depressed and self-pitying, which I suppose is understandable considering what she goes through in the book. Still, to have a character everyone says is one way, who behaves in a manner completely contrary to that is rather disconcerting. Also, the guy she eventually falls in love with at the end of the book is little more than a cardboard cut-out, which is too bad, considering how big a deal De Lint makes of her being unable to connect to men.I don't want to totally bash this book though. It was certainly interesting enough to keep me going and I did enjoy the world that De Lint created. I think a lot of the problems I ran into come from kind of jumping into the middle of a series with a book that seems to depend on a lot of prior knowledge of the characters. I'd be willing to give some of his earlier books a try though."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"For long-term fans of Charles de Lint's popular Newford novels, the central character of Jilly Coppercorn is engaging but enigmatic. So now she gets her own novel. It's a good story, well-written, compelling, and easy to read while giving you plenty to think about after you close the covers. So why is there some dissatisfaction nagging at me?Don't get me wrong. It's a great book, about a great character in great situations. I recommend it to fans and neophytes. But there's a little bit of a something...Jilly is struck down in a hit-and-run accident, leaving the vivacious painter bedridded and half-crippled. And that's on the first page. The story unfolds both forward and backward, letting us in on backstory we've never been privy to before, both on the character and the universe. Some characters are held in reserve: characters spotlighted in this book are given short shrift in the next novel, \\"Spirits in the Wires,\\" and vice versa. But this story focuses on the characters who color every de Lint book without often getting their own showcase.The theme running through this book is how awful incest and childhood sexual abuse are. I know this and agree wholeheartedly, but the book goes over the theme time and again, like a wound the author can't stop handling. In this book, a single abusive character is the motivation behind nearly everything that happens both to Jilly and her personal antagonist over the course of decades. Human beings are deeper and more complex than this. A writer of de Lint's skill owes his characters more than he's willing to give them.And I'm also bothered by one fact. If the dates de Lint gives are accurate, the principals in the book must all be pushing fifty, yet many are still looking for that one true love in their lives. Shouldn't there come a point when the characters graduate from that sort of rootlessness to a more mature identity? The characters act like they are in their early thirties, when this emotional meandering would be exactly appropriate, yet the dates add as much as two decades to their ages. It's time for the characters to settle down with one person and move on to the next identity crisis, which a writer of de Lint's ability should be able to execute adroitly.That said, the character conflicts are engaging, the plot moves foreward at a good pace that varies from cautious to lickety-split very effectively, and the payoff does feel earned. This book is good both as an introduction to Newford and an extension for established fans. So much is so deeply linked that any synopsis would give away key facts, so let's put it this way: the characters who are central to Newford go through meaningful personal changes in this book that will effect future novels.Highly recommended, despite the two problems mentioned above, this book expands on the ambiance that is Newford without destroying the magic and mystery. It isn't even necessary to have read the other Newford books to get what's going on. Subtle and enjoyable, this is a fantasy book for a grand audience and fantasy fans alike to savor and reread."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"In _The Onion Girl_, Newford artist Jilly Coppercorn suffers a devastating personal tragedy that forces her to re-evaluate her life and face things in her past that she'd rather not. As she is virtually the glue that holds Newford together, she is aided by a mind-boggling cast of characters, both this-worldly and otherworldly.I loved this book and couldn't put it down, but I ended up having mixed feelings about it when I was done. On the one hand, DeLint's writing was a beautiful as ever, his depictions of the joys and terrors of the Otherworld as richly realised, his characters as real and his forthright pictures of some very ugly human experiences as affecting.On the other hand, there are certain things I found a bit off. The cast of characters is SO enormous -- at times it seems that everyone who's ever appeared in a Newford story shows up at some time or another -- that it's a little hard to keep track of; I certainly wouldn't recommend reading this book unless you've at least read one or two of DeLint's short story anthologies. Towards the end, the message got just a little overbearing. At the same time, I didn't like the implication that only magic could really heal Jilly; I would have liked to see her take some real world steps to deal with her baggage. Maybe deciding to get therapy isn't magical, but I really think she could use it.I did like that everything between Jilly and her &quot;nemesis&quot; wasn't completely resolved and that there was still some tension between them at the end. I also liked the fact that this ending wasn't a happy-ever-after kind of thing--that people underwent irreversable changes.I didn't like that one character who could have been really interesting seemed to exist merely to deliver a heavy-handed message about standing up to bullies, which I think the book delivered effectively elsewhere. It seemed a waste of a character and brought up certain questions that were not answered to my satisfaction.Probably if you're a DeLint fan already you'll like this book. If you haven't read anything by this fine writer, don't start here or you'll be lost."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"CDL fans will particularly like this, it's like a convention of his Newford characters. This book concentrates mostly on Jilly, one of the main characters of De Lint's Newford stories, and her attempts to reconcile with her traumatic childhood and seedy past in the wake of an accident that leaves her in a hospital bed. De Lint does a particularly good job at merging the magical and the mundane in this book. The story shifts back and forth between the &quot;real world&quot; and the realm of dreams and magic as Jilly attempts to escape her broken body by going to another world in her dreams, only to discover that her past follows her there, too.A first time reader can enjoy the story on its own merits, but fans will get even more out of it by having read the background stories on the other Newfordites that appear. I enjoyed the opportunity, also, of getting to know one of my favorite characters better."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Ok, I'm a big fan, I admit it. Starting with Moonheart, many years ago, DeLint's books never lose their fascination for me. The stark reality of the life on the streets blends with spirit world in that compelling and fascinating way of his.Jilly Coppercorn has always been one of my favorite characters. She reminds me of a few of the wounded souls I know - lost children, indeed... it always amazes me that Charles DeLint, a man, can portray these women with such reality. It is not a spoiler to tell you that this book is about Jilly; we get to know her better than ever before, and to admire her strength.I am not sure if I have read everything he has written, but I have certainly come close. This is one I will certainly read over again. Many of the people we have come to know over the years have at least a cameo. The tension and uncertainty of what will happen will keep you glued to the book, although I made myself come up for air a few times...just to make it last longer."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I stumbled upon Charles DeLint's &quot;The Onion Girl&quot; while doing some research on fantasy books for a college project. Being new to the genre, and reluctant to read fantasy, I had no idea what to read. The book's title and the cover art by John Jude Palencar enticed me, and once I started the book, I could not put it down.The story's main character, Jilly Coppercorn, is struggling to heal from an accident. The circumstances that lead to her accident are shrouded in mystery, leaving her to find the clues and piece them together, a difficult task when one's bones are broken. Lying in her hospital bed, she learns to &quot;cross over&quot; into another world she has only heard of. Jilly experiences a catharsis as a result of her other wordly adventures, and she makes a surprising choice that heals her body and soul.DeLint's prose is inspiring, as his descriptions make the natural supernatural, and the extraordinary accessible to us mere mortals. His blend of urban streets, the wilderness, and dreamscape create a seamless trip through dimensions. The characters are quite likeable, and are varied in personality, from policeman to artist to shapeshifter.&quot;The Onion Girl&quot; quieted any preconceptions I had about fantasy writing, and I would recommend this book highly to those who are curious about the genre, but don't know where to start."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"The Onion Girl (Newford)A quote from this really thought provoking book written by Charles De Lint,\\"People who've never read fairy tales, the professor said, have a harder time coping in life that the people who have. They don't have access to all the lessons that can be learned from the journeys through the dark woods and the kindness of strangers treated decently, the knowledge that can be gained from that company and example of Donkeyskins and cats wearing boots and steadfast tin soldiers. I'm not talking about in-your-face lessons, but more subtle ones. The kind that seep up from your subconscious and give you moral and humane structures for your life. That teach you how to prevail, and trust. And maybe even love. The people who have missed out on them have to be re-storied in their adult lives.\\" pg 30HB editionThis tale is a whirlwind mixture of contemporary life in Canada and life in the Faerie Realm that many of these contemporary characters step in and out of during the course of this adventure.

This is true. However, it had been quite a while since my last book by de Lint, so I generally enjoyed The Onion Girl.It is not my favorite book by de Lint, despite the general enjoyment factor. Some of the book was just a little too much of the same old same old urban fae routine. I think that this is a general issue with the Newford books and it goes to the point of not reading too many de Lint books in a short period of time.In contrast, other elements of the book felt a little too far out of his comfort zone. Vacchs does the \\"children of the secret\\" much more believably than The Onion Girl ever manages. It may be that hard boiled detective novels are simply a better vehicle for this kind of subject matter. For me, the best de Lint characters are more worn down by life than really wounded like Jilly and Raylene. Not because the wounded aren't interesting, but because these particular characters do not ring quite as true as de Lint characters often can.Jilly in particular lacks spark. It is difficult to read either how she engages so well with some people or how she is unable to engage with others. Raylene is ultimately quite a bit more complex, and I generally found her story to be the most compelling.All in all, I am not sorry that I read The Onion Girl. For people who like de Lint already, it should be a good (if not great) entry in the Newford group. Enjoyable, even if nothing really special. If you do not have a strong stomach for urban fae, this will probably not be your cup of tea. Three-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Let me just start by saying that I LOVE this author; he is one of very few that I read simply because he wrote it.Saying that, although this is not my absolute favorite book of his I have ever read, it is one that I will recommend to every one who likes De Lint.This book is entirely about Jilly who has to be one of the most likable characters ever created. Almost from the first page you are thrust into a heart breaking story that even threw it's moments of predictability is extremely entertaining none the less.Even the best books aren't with out their problems;The story jumps through various times through history which can get very confusing if you aren't paying attention and you could easily find yourself going back to the beginning of the chapter to find out who you are talking to and what year it is.And I don't like the timing in the book, there are places where I don't want to wait two or three chapters to find out what happens and I had a really hard time not skipping ahead and missing some of the book.Please don't let me stop you from buying it, this book really was wonderful, he has a way of telling stories that really makes you want to be a part of them. I promise you, this book is worth your money."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Unlike many of DeLint's formulaic novels where his main character finds themselves up against an evil from some ancient past, this deals more with the heart, Jilly's Heart, to be exact. It was a delight to see him stray from what seemed to be a habitual path of the formulaic for this writer. I had become somewhat of a discouraged reader due to his constant plot repetition and poor resolutions of these plots. It was refreshing to see him finally break free of this and try something new.Jilly, is perhaps, one of the most endeared characters in DeLint's Newford sorties and I was delighted to see that he finally took the step into letting us know about the family and past history of this beloved character.This book can be ready without reading any of DeLint's Newford stories, but those who already have will find great joy in seeing many of the old favorites coming to visit Jilly while she is in the hospital.A story more about regret and following the paths one is given, this has less to do with DeLint's normal \\"urban fantasy\\" style and more to do with the complexities between siblings, child neglect and incest. There is more context to this story and more fleshing out of Jilly than one had before, which, is still overwhelming.A very sad and haunting story of two sisters caught in the same situation, it is an instersting trip into the human psyche as to how both characters deal with it.The ending was sad but redeeming as it comcludes that above all, family is everything."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"It was the John Jude Palencar cover that first attracted my attention to \\"The Onion Girl.\\" And after that happened, I wondered if the title of the book had anything to do with the tune of the same name on Holly Cole's fabulous \\"Dear Dark Heart\\" CD.It does.Having never read anything of Mr. De Lint's before, his imaginary city, Newford, with its remarkable array of characters, was totally new. No opinion is therefore offered here as to how this book compares with others in the series.At any rate, the tale told here, and told quite well indeed (the Native American mythology sprinkled throughout is likely to intrigue you as much as the story itself), is the touching tragedy of one of Newford's beloved artists, Jilly Coppercorn, who's been wounded in a hit and run accident and is trying to recover (she refers to herself as the \\"broken girl\\" although she's apparently in early middle age at the time of the story).As she lies in bed in the \\"real world\\" in her dream time she adventures in the fairytale-ish \\"Otherworld.\\" (The constantly shifting points of view, and changes from first-person to third-person narrative only serve to heighten the sense of dislocation.) Jilly is known best for her fairie paintings and someone breaks into her studio while she's recovering from the accident and vandalizes them. Her friends, one of whom's a police lieutenant, try to find out who that person is, and whether it's the same person who ran her down.The most memorable character, however, turns out to be Raylene Carter, who tells her story in the first person with a white trash dialect she uses to her advantage. A victim of child abuse (a subject that clearly concerns Mr. De Lint, as it should all of us), she has left her abusive family while still a teenager and seems to have spent most of the time after her departure to trying to get even. And then she finds her way into the Otherworld too. And then things really start getting interesting.You'll probably care a lot for Jilly and her supportive friends (we should all be as lucky as she is) and Raylene and her accomplice Pinky Miller; and the minor characters are well drawn too: Toby, Lucinda, the Tattersnake, and even those \\"crow girls\\" who turn up for a cameo at the end, and provide a bit of fun, at a time when it's needed, both for Jilly's sake and ours.Since the book's origins are North American, with its tradition of serious fiction being one thing and genre fiction quite another, it's assigned to the genre category and stamped \\"fantasy.\\" But: what would have happened if Mr. De Lint had pretended he was merely translating from the Portuguese the work of, say, \\"Joao Da Silva,\\" and had set the tale in an imaginary city in Brazil? Then, it probably would not have been stamped fantasy at all, but hailed as an exemplar of Latin American \\"Magic Realism.\\" It might then have been taken to be serious fiction and classified differently by those who love literary taxonomy more than reading a good novel.Which this is."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I like fantasy literature, and I definitely liked this book, which I received for Christmas. I'm going to look for Charles De Lint next time I'm at the library or the bookstore. I like the idea of there being hidden magic in the ordinary world, visible to those who know how to look.It's true this story dealt with unsettling material -- if it were a TV show it would probably be meant for &quot;mature audiences.&quot; And I can definitely see how it would be upsetting for survivors of abuse. But I personally had no problem with it.Interestingly, I read Neil Gaiman's _American Gods_ right before I read _The Onion Girl_, and the two have a minor character in common."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"De Lint has a wonderful imagination. He is a talented writer who carries you into another realm with his words. And makes you question your beliefs about dreams and fairies. But this book just does not hold my attention. He switches off characters in every chapter and it takes almost halfway through the book before they all come together and even then it isn't interesting enough to read in a week. I am an avid reader and when I have a good book I finish it fast. I got this months ago and I still haven't finished it and have moved on to other books. Not worth buying. Borrow it if you insist."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Just finished the book last night. This is the first De Lint book I have read so I was not disappointed like some reviewers, having no expectations. One aspect of the book I found very refreshing was the departure from the \\"good vs evil\\" theme that 1) infests most fantasy works, and 2) I have come to find boring because it gets so repetitiouos and predictable. This book kept my interest because I found myself caring about the characters and wondering what would happen next. The child abuse theme was difficult to take at times but I think was handled well. The ending wasn't clean and happy, but was alright - more like life than many fantasy fiction endings. I look forward to reading more of his work especially since several people think this isn't his best."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I usually love Charles De Lint's writing, and when I heard he was writing a book about Jilly Coppercorn's story, I was thrilled. What a letdown. His writing is still beautiful, although without the usual sense of magic and a bit more heavy-handed, hence the two stars, rather than one. In other novels, such as &quot;Memory and Dream&quot;, magic blends more seamlessly into the story, in this book, the Dreamlands sequence seemed very either-or. I also think there were too many characters. It was hard for any one of them to develop - it almost seemed cluttered.As one reviewer has already stated, I didn't buy Raylene's transformation, either - she's depicted as this ice-cold, half-insane killing machine, and all of sudden, she *stops*, and sacrifices herself for Jilly? It seems incredibly implausible. Also, for several books, De Lint has been teasing us with the possibility of a relationship between Jilly and Christie, and then demolishes that possibility with Daniel, who really appears more like a cardboard cutout. And where did Sophie's sudden reluctance to take Faerie seriously come from, let alone all of Wendy's doubts? Finally, the ending felt very incomplete and tacked on - he was working toward this major climax, and then undercut it. I hope I like Charles De Lint's next book better, because I found this one very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"The subject and characters were too raw for children and the writing too immature and preachy for adults. Graphic violence and rape of children by an abusive brother is the backstory for the lives of young adults who can move between the \\"world as it is\\" and a parallel universe of magic. The author's deft style and imagination lost out to the lengthy passages that highlighted the inner goodness of a character. These were trite and boring and slowed the progress of the story so much that I just skipped over them each time. This book was the first by this author for me and I am unlikely to read any others in the series. He needs a good editor."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Jilly Coppercorn has always been my favorite of de Lint's characters. She's a guidepost for others, weaving in and out of his Newford-based stories. While her history has been hinted at before, this book brings to light the true horror of her past as well as her attempts to reconcile past with present. I think it's important that the author reminds us of the children \\"left behind\\"--perhaps it bothered him that Jilly's sister's story had been left untold for so long.This book is definitely my new favorite full-length by de Lint (I've always favored his short stories). But at the same time, it's heartbreaking to see Jilly in this situation---I have mixed feelings about the book because it strips her of some of her mystery and dignity.While it does feel a bit heavy-handed or contrived at times (hence 4 stars instead of 5), it's truly a great story about \\"unpeeling\\" the layers of yourself to find strength within. I think that we will see Jilly begin to bounce back with some of her old magic---I read the recent Christmas story CDL posted online and was pleased to see her make an appearance! A definite must for the de Lint fans; for newcomers, read the short stories first and fall in love with Jilly before you plunge into this saga."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"What dreadful writing. What wooden characters. I found myself losing track of who was whom, and worse yet, not caring about any of the characters. It was painful to read the \\"Raylene\\" chapters written in the lugubrious \\"white trash\\" dialect. I started skipping over as much as I could so I did not have to focus on the falseness of the prose.Recently I re-read Terri Windling's Woodwife, and Mr. de Lint's work came up as an Amazon recommendation. There is absolutely no comparison. This book is a lot of badly written codswallop."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Another reviewer stated:\\"DeLint's earlier books had a sense of wonder and delicacy both in his writing and in his portrayals of characters and Dreamlands/Otherlands. As you read, it felt as if the magical place he was talking about was not only real but that it could be fragile as well; it *was* real but only as long as you believed and DeLint was very good at making us believe. With this book, however, I didn't feel drawn in - more like bludgeoned.\\"In many ways, that is true. In this book deLint gives you a lot of pages (some of his books are rather slender), he writes about one of his core characters, but he seems intent on proving that his world is solid, that the bad side of things is real and can be encountered./SighI've been an ad litem for Child Protective Services. I've served on the board of a rape crisis center. I know that there is ugliness in the world. Heck, I've worked around cess pools, I know that at times the world is not only ugly, it can stink.But that isn't why I read deLint. It isn't why I read at all.I consider this book as tainted by the trends of the 80s and 90s, though not broken by them. deLint has grown out of them (though consider The Little Country with its complete mainstream, down to the fan service bizarre sex scene -- like Gaimon, he couldn't avoid the trends).I own a copy, I didn't throw it away or sell it back. But I'd read other deLints first -- perhaps \\"Promises to keep\\" or a similar book."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Some people have written that they found this story sad. That could be said about a lot of Charles de Lint books, because they are always about struggle. No one writes personal struggle better. Although there is an underlying story of the characters trying to help keep magic or the Otherworld alive, the characters are always struggling to grow and keep parts of themselves alive. I delayed buying this book because of a reviewer who said they had been excited about learning Jilly's background but depressed and disappointed by the book. Yes, the story is hard. But life is hard. Maybe one of the reasons I relate to Charles de Lint so well is that he writes truthfully about the hard parts. I've read this book twice already and I'll read it many more times. And in response to the previous reviewer, I liked both Jilly and Raylene. Maybe later stories will tell us more about Raylene."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Plot Summary: This is the story of a couple of abused girls and what they have made in their lives after escaping. Jilly Coppercorn has made a new life for herself after some hard years on the streets thanks to some very good friends and a great spirit. She is now a painter of everything urban/faerie and has even changed her last name to escape from her past. Raylene has not done so well but has one good friend thoughout her life in Pinky Miller. The story starts off with Jilly getting hit by a car and being left partially paralyzed and unconscious in the hospital. This accident has knocked Jilly into the dreamworld where she is whole again and can walk. Meanwhile Pinky and Raylene have found themselves in this same dreamwold as wolves and are hunting the unicorns there for their life and youth giving blood. Eventually Raylene runs into the sister that left her to their malicious brother by running away. The sister she has hated and held a grudge against for years.Opinion: While my description above does not do the whole plot justice, I think it covers the main scope of two abused sisters finally reuniting in the World As It Is and the dreamworld and their paths to getting there. I really thought this was a great story and well told. Some of the female friends of Jilly seemed too similar for me to distinguish between them but it wasn't really necessary for story enjoyment. Perhaps other Newford books flesh them out a little, I am not sure. On the other hand, Jilly, Raylene, Joe, and a few of the others were incredibly well done. I was sympathetic with almost every character that played more than a minor role. While I cannot imagine the horror shared by some of the characters, I never felt that anyone's actions were forced as plot devices or as overly wrong in anyway. There were no moments when I thought \\"There is no way a person in that situation would do THAT!\\" and that is rare in a lot of fantasy stories. The fantasy world of Mabon and the Greatwoods played a major part in this story but were not the point of the story at all. It was touch and go at the end there whether or not the ending would be quick and easy and bad. I am happy to say the ending was in line with the rest of the novel. I thought the ending was quite realistic. Everyone should have friends like Jilly's friends. Despite the somber subject matter, the ending did provide a ray of hope for many of the characters.Recommendation: I have not read any previous de Lint works and was recommended this book by the good fellows at another website message board and I was not dissappointed. The only thing keeping me from actively reading more in this series or more by de Lint in general is that this story leaned a little too much towards the faerieland side of the genre and that is not my thing really. The story told and the way it was told were fantastic though and I would not feel bad reading anything by de Lint. So overall I rate this 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Artist Jilly Coppercorn is quite a talent whose paintings make the biggest cynic believe the painter has visited fairyland. Her landscape and creatures seem very real, as if she visited Fairy. However, a hit and run driver leaves the talented artist semi paralyzed. Worse than her broken body is Jilly's broken spirit as her zest for life is as paralyzed as her body.Jilly no longer wants to live in the human realm and turns to her dreams of fairyland as escapism just as she did as a girl to evade her drunken parents and her rapist elder brother Del. Jilly fell apart as a youngster, but when she finally got her act together and returned home, she found Raylene her younger sister hated her for abandoning her to rape by Del. Raylene still loathes Jilly and can enter fairyland where she feeds on unicorns targeting Jilly for death in that realm and subsequently the mundane world.THE ONION GIRL looks deeply inside he psyche of its' two lead female characters especially Jilly who has appeared in other Charles de Lint tales. Additionally, the novel persuades the audience to believe in fairyland, but surprisingly the tale goes at a slow pace for what sounds like an action fantasy. The fans see the reactions of Jilly and Raylene to setbacks on the human plane and how that impacts their behavior in fairyland. Though poignant and insightful, fans of epic fantasy will not enjoy this tale but those readers who relish a psychological character study using fantasy elements to enhance the profundity of the plot will love this special tale."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"I stumbled across this book in my local library, and it was the title that caught my attention more than anything. Charles de Lint is a new author to me, and with his writing has opened up a whole new world of magick and intrigue.Our tale begins in Newford with the main character, Jilly Coppercorn, becoming a victim of a hit-and-run. Lying in a hospital bed, confused and paralyzed, she escapes to the world of dreams. &quot;The Onion Girl&quot; takes you on one hell of a ride, as it's told from the eyes of Jilly, and her younger sister, Raylene. Having run away from a life of abuse and pain at a young age, and leaving Raylene to suffer as she once did, Jilly begins to regret not going back now that Raylene has resurfaced in her life.Two sisters - one dream world. One doesn't want to share it, and is determined to go to extremes to ensure that it belongs to her alone. The other just wants to know the baby sister she left behind.Charles de Lint has done an amazing job with &quot;The Onion Girl,&quot; and it is a favorite of mine due to the way he writes, and describes things. Things get slow here and there, but the intensity of Jilly's story makes it worth the slow spots. Definitely worth 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"Fans of Charles de Lint's voluminous stories of Newford all know and love Jilly Coppercorn. Here, at last, is a novel about Jilly. I was so excited, I scraped together some emergency money and bought it in hardback! A great fulfillment for all of us true blue fans, to learn more and spend time with this charming, magical artist and Friend to All.Its okay that some bad things happen to Jilly - she's a survivor, after all, and some great things happen to her, too. But the sudden apperance of a long-lost sister with a monster grudge is a little... convenient, isn't it? This wholly new side to Jilly's story leaves the reader feeling just a little jerked around.The novel's a bit schizophrenic, too, the way we vault back and forth between the disconnected sisters, and forward and backward and sideways in time. Then, when at last the story is twined together, it... kinda sucks.If you're a de Lint fan, and a fan of Newford, you really shouldn't miss this book. Everybody in Newford is affected by what affects Jilly, and so everyone's story is advanced and changed by this book. Just don't expect one of his best, or you're in for a sad disappointment.If you're new to the Charles de Lint oevre, please don't start with Onion Girl. Really, he's written much, much better stuff. Try Forests of the Heart for a fantastic novel also set in Newford, or dive in to his short story collection, starting with Dreams Underfoot."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, while I&#8217;m a fantasy fan, I am very much a selective fantasy fan. Mr. De Lint is one of those fantasy authors &#8211; in his case urban fantasy &#8211; whom I have read before and I will definitely read again. There is a solid dose of realism to his fantasy fiction, the type of gritty biting edge, in places, that I adore. His characters are far from perfect (as characters should be in order for me to be able to relate to them), they go through great struggles and pain and they don&#8217;t always come out on the other end smelling like a rose. There is solid substance to this fantasy, not just spectacle and pageantry.That being said, while I loved this book, it may not appeal to everyone. It is not a fast-paced read, nor is it a whimsical or flighty adventure filled with action. It certainly has its tense moments. It opens with a terrible accident and there are multiple incidents involving crime and violence, but much of the book is placid, emotional and introspective. It can also be a little difficult to follow at times because the narrative jumps around from real world to dream world and follows more than one character and chronology. I read it in drips and drabs between other things I was reading for review purposes and sometimes I found myself a little lost when I returned to it, having to back track a little to figure out where, when and with whom I was.As a whole I think this is a wonderful book and well deserving of the World Fantasy Award. I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have a signed copy which I bought when Mr. de Lint made a local appearance here. The story is as multi-layered as the onion mentioned in the title and in my opinion, a firm five-star read."},{"Title":"The Onion Girl (Newford)","review":"The Onion Girl by Charles de Lint is my new favorite Newford novel, even though it's an older one. de Lint does a remarkable job explaining the origins of the character, Jilly Coppercorn, the beloved fae artist of his fictional town. As usual, de Lint blends world mythology into a modern tale seamlessly. I personally related to Jilly as the proverbial onion girl, as I am sure all of us can. We have all overcome painful obstacles throughout our lives. And it is how we deal with those challenges that shape our hearts and souls. Jilly Coppercorn has a beautiful soul, as do all her friends that live in Newford. If you love art, the fae, and a tale from the heart, this one is for you.'"},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"Eras are rarely defined by something as arbitrary as calendar dates. Pertinent to this review of Horror Films of the 1970s is that what made '70s horror distinct is not necessarily confined to the years 1970-79. On the other hand, it does make a simple cutoff for starting and ending points.The book is broken down into several sections. First there is an introduction that discusses trends in the decade. Towards the end are some appendices providing additional insights. In the middle, and taking up the vast majority of the book are descriptions of individual movies. These include rather complete credit lists, a plot synopsis and usually a commentary about how the movie succeeds or doesn't succeed.This movie guide is listed by year and alphabetically within each year. Muir ( the author) covers a lot of movies including many obscure ones, but even he admits that it is an incomplete list. While it may be forgivable that he neglects relatively unknown films like The Velvet Vampire (1971) or Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1970), it is less so that he neglects films like Bay of Blood (1971, also known as Twitch of the Death Nerve) which served as a prototype for the slasher flick or Sugar Hill (1974) which not only included Robert Quarry, an actor Muir likes, but also is a blaxploitation horror movie, a genre he discusses with several other films (like Blacula).As is common in books of this type, there are occasional errors in plot descriptions, but overall, Muir does a good and insightful job (although he is occasionally repetitive). I enjoy these sorts of reads because they not only cover a topic I like but also does so in bite size pieces in case I don't have time to read a lot.Arguably, this is the best decade for the horror film, as this was a period when horror could cross boundaries it couldn't in previous decades, yet it was not so blatantly commercial as in future decades (of course, there are plenty of counterexamples). This book is not perfect, but it does a good job at allowing a glimpse into what made this decade stand out."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"I love horror films and this guide gave me so many titles I put on my &#34;must see&#34; list. It was also helpful since there are a lot of vampire films out there, some hits and some misses, so it's nice to have a general idea of ones that I might want to see or skip.I liked that he didn't just review mainstream films and talked about the plots instead of getting too deep into the acting. The writer sticks to the charm of horror movies, we watch them because we like to be scared, with a few giggles along the way.I want to read his other horror movie guides, I have a lot to catch up on!"},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"Back in the 1970s I used to stay up late on Saturday nights and watch \\"Sinister Cinema\\" on Channel 2. A comedy-relief host presented various cut-for-TV horror movies that tended to be more fun than frightening. My biggest childhood movie scares came from creepy advertisements for classic R-rated shockers such as \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Amityville Horror\\", and \\"Phantasm\\". All this titillation generated an abiding love of horror movies, and \\"Horror Films of the 1970s\\" brought it all back with a view through blood-colored glasses.John Kenneth Muir begins his compilation with an overview of horror cinema from that seminal decade. Then he launches his film list (over 225) with \\"And Soon the Darkness\\" from 1970, and proceeds through each year until finishing up in 1979 with \\"Zombie\\". Some less-compelling movies only receive a cursory entry, while others that made a bigger impression on Mr. Muir get a more substantial treatment including quotes from critics, a star rating, extended commentary, and even a short legacy section featuring sequels and copycat films. He even provides cast and credits to satisfy completists.The author's commentary (particularly on his favorites) is the most compelling reason to buy this book, as Mr. Muir's insights are equivalent to higher-end, thoughtful Amazon reviews. He reveals an unshakable passion for the subject matter given the comprehensive nature of \\"Horror Films of the 1970s\\" (further proof of his devotion is demonstrated by follow-up books dealing with horror movies of the 1980s and 1990s). However, be advised that his synopses tend to go a bit heavy on the spoilers, so keep that in mind if you haven't seen a particular movie in his list.Mr. Muir's enjoyable look back wraps with a glance at how the 70s horror trends were expanded upon during the following decades, along with some appendices containing era-specific esoterica such as his \\"Best Of\\" list and \\"Memorable Movie Ad Lines.\\" I recommend \\"Horror Films of the 1970s\\" for anyone who shares my fascination with the genre, especially if you were warped as a youth in that wild era of pre-political correctness."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"I really wanted to like this book. A kind of \\"Keep watching the skies\\" for Horror movies of the 1970s...hey must be great, right?Well...no. I could forgive the author for his sometimes peculiar opinions, I could also forgive that some important movies only get a short paragraph dedicated to them.What I can't forgive is the unbelievable amount of factual errors in this book.No, SHOCK WAVES is NOT a 1970 release, it's from 1977. (Didn't the author look at Peter Cushing's FACE when he was watching the movie?)No, NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE does NOT take place in Dresden. Dresden is a landlocked city! How could the vampire SAIL from Transsylaynia to Dresden? The movie takes place in Wismar at the Baltic Sea.Probably I could go on and on but so far I checked only a couple of reviews.I can't give much credibility to a reviewer's opinion if the guy so obviously doesn't know what he's talking about."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"I almost never write reviews, but nobody else should waste their money on this.Part I was fine: The History of the Decade.

For example, if your primary interest is Nature Strikes Back, you can't find any! Are you really expected to swipe your way through 16,140 pages of unlinked, unindexed text and hope to pick out the movies that you want to read about? Not a chance. If you don't at least know the year of the movie you want to read about, you haven't a chance of ever finding it. Want to search out the various works of a particular actor? Forget it.No pictures. No movie poster art. The film title doesn't appear in the header so if you randomly swipe forward a few thousand pages, you won't know where you landed or what you're reading about. None of the appendices are linked either except, oddly, \\"Notes\\". Worse than useless.Maybe the hardcover edition is fine, but as a Kindle edition, this book is a complete waste of money. Do not buy."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"I love this book. It tells about all the horror films that I remember and is a great reference book."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"John Kenneth Muir's &quot;Horror Films of the 1970s&quot; is a great reference guide for all horror movie fans. Covering 228 horror films from the 70s, the book is crammed with with detailed information within its 662 pages.The book begins with a &quot;History of the Decade&quot; and then breaks down the horror films by year, ending with a brief conclusion and several appendices, which include &quot;1970s Hall of Fame,&quot; &quot;Recommended Viewing,&quot; and &quot;Memorable Movie Ad Lines.&quot;Muir tackles most of the films in the book (I say most because not all of the films reviewed follow this format....some are just given a brief mention and are not even rated.) by breaking it down into sections. First, he provides excerpts from critical reviews of the film. He then provides a cast and crew list. He then provides a POV section (where those people associated with making the film offer their thoughts on the film.) Next comes a synopsis of the film's storyline before moving on to the author's own commentary and review of the film. Finally, there is a Legacy section which details any important (good or bad) contribution that the film may have made to the genre as a whole. The author also provides a rating system (one to four stars) ranking the over-all quality of the film.Muir's love of the genre is evident in the text, although his commentarys can sometimes be lengthy (he seems to have a gift for gab.) This reader found that Muir can sometimes &quot;over analyze&quot; a film, reading things into the script that I don't think were ever really there to begin with (not even by the makers of the film). The commentarys, however, have helped me to view a film differently, shedding light on aspects of the film that I may have otherwise overlooked. I am now much more aware of how camera techniques, lighting, editing and score (critical in all films but probably even more so to the horror genre) can contribute to the success or failure of a film. Muir even points out how some film's subtext points directly to the fears and concerns of the audience in the &quot;disco era.&quot; (Again, something I may have overlooked.......especially 30 years later.) All these small points add up and can make watching one of these movies a much more enjoyable experience. This makes the book a remarkable success in my opinion.On the whole, the book is a very enjoyable read and most horror lovers will probably find it quite satisfying. I am now in search of many of the films included in the book that I haven't yet seen. Some I have never even heard of until being introduced to them by Mr. Muir. Hopefully, a sequel (Horror Films of the 1980s)is somewhere on the horizon."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"John Muir's filmbooks are really in their own genre -- they're not quite film analysis, they're not quite fan appreciation -- they're somewhere in the middle, and that's what gives them their special appeal. Ever watch a DVD with director's commentary? That's what it's like reading one of Muir's film books -- you're discussing films with someone who loves them, and it's infectious. The end result is it's not dry film criticism (do we really need another Freudian analysis of anything?) -- it's sharing the joy and wonder of great films and not so great films and some downright guilty pleasures with someone who really brings experience, humor, knowledge, and enthusiasm to the subject matter. As a major fan of horror films from the 1970s, this book jumps right to the top of my list of &quot;must-haves&quot;. It's not a reference book -- it's a cover-to-cover read that's just formatted like a reference book. You'll find old favorites in here as well as get a little exposure to some films you haven't seen and probably should. It was the &quot;best of times&quot; for horror films (its only competing decade would be the 1930s, IMHO), and this book ranks with the &quot;best of books&quot; for a great decade for creepy movies. It does a great job of putting these films in their proper context (it was a fascinating decade, and its horror films really mirror that). This is a book that will make you smile, and throw you back a few decades into a time that was simpler and more confused...If you like horror films, you'll love this book. This should be a daily calendar! 365 Great Horror Films a Year!"},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"As a died-in-the-wool horror fan, I really appreciate the thought and care put into this reference book. Muir makes a compelling case for this decade's importance in the genre (I think the 70's would win hands-down in a contest of the greatest number of significant or classic horror films in a decade. Look at the evidence: Halloween, Alien, Carrie, The Exorcist, Suspiria, Jaws, The Stepford Wives, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc., etc.). Further, Muir gives good analysis, and that is very appreciated, even when he occasionally gets carried away (he has a tendency to state a thesis--check out his analysis of some of Tobe Hooper's formalist techniques in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre--and then repeat himself over and over just to make sure that we, the readers, get it); there are also a number of small errors in details from certain films that annoyed me just because they are so careless: it is the TANZ Academy that Jessica Harper travels to in Suspiria, not the TAMM Academy, and it is the ALLARDYCE family that rents the evil house to Karen Black and Oliver Reed in Burnt Offerings, not The ALLODICES (I happen to be a big fan of both films so these mistakes particularly stuck out like bleeding limbs to me). But those are minor quibbles really; mostly I'm just grateful that Muir is not only a fan, but an intelligent writer and critic as well. I agree with another reviewer: let's next have a book on Horror Films of the 1980's, Mr. Muir."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"Being a horror film buff, I've read many books dealing with the subject matter Mr. Muir covers, but I've never come across a book that so deftly manages to be both thoughtful/scholarly, while also extremely entertaining. Not many reference books manage to be page turners, but if you like horror films you'll find yourself unable to put it down. Muir's enthusiasm and extensive knowledge are evident, and in many ways reading the book is like having a discussion with a fellow horror fan.As a person who is quite familiar with a good deal of the films Muir discusses, I was also pleased to discover many I had never heard of. It's led me to viewing a few gems that I might have missed otherwise. If you're a fan of the genre (or even just curious), don't hesitate to pick this up - you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"Being a huge horror fan it was great to discover this book. I have had it for several months now and look through it constantly. Anyone who likes horror should denifinitely have this book. This book covers 228 movies from the 70's with detailed synopses for each movie as well as cast and crew information and a section with the author's commentary. I really enjoyed reading about the popular horror movies of the 70's and it was great to discover many movies which I was not familiar with. Having this book has led me to starting a collection of 70's horror movies which I think was the genre's best decade.In addition to this book I have three others by John Kenneth Muir: The films of John Carpenter, Wes Craven: the Art of Horror and Eaten Alive at a Chainsaw Massacre. All of these books are excellent and I Highly recommend them.If you are a hardcore horror fan this is a must have and even for the casual fan this book would be a wonderful addition to your library."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"I've read a fair bit of horror film criticism and analysis, and Muir is one of the very best writers I've come across in the field. What it comes down to is that he covers the films with precisely the correct amount of depth, as he goes well beyond the simple capsule reviews, but avoids ridiculous, pretentious analysis where the films quality as either art or entertainment is ignored entirely in favor of exploration of theme and social commentary. (Which, of course, generally results in a lotta ludicrous garbage, beyond the extreme tedium.) This isn't to say he isn't interested in social commentary, he's just good at actually analyzing the film for what it is, rather than what he'd like it to be. (Course, he misses and overreaches at a few points, but that's just the inevitable disagreement on my part, rather than a general trend.) He writes cleanly and clearly, and without a hint of pretention. He also includes a ton of information for the bulk of the films, including extensive credit listings and a detailed synopsis to go along with a lengthy commentary. There are also quite a few shorter, near capsule-type reviews, but those are still more detailed than you'd see in most basic guides. Muir perhaps is slightly to forgiving for my tastes, but it's better to be a bit too favorable when it comes to film analysis than to critical, as it's tougher to come up with something interesting to say about a film that you hated. Obviously, this book isn't even close to comprehensive, but that would be pretty much impossible, and he does cover a remarkable range of films. Overall he emphasizes American films most, but still works in quite a few more prominent european films from the decade. (i.e. Suspiria, Deep Red, Zombi, Tombs of the Blind Dead etc.) Finally, the book ends with a number of helpful and/or amusing appendices at the end.This book is damn expensive, so hopefully you can get it for free at a library, but if you can't it would probably still be worth picking up if you're really interested in horror films. Muir's books on Craven and Carpenter are also excellent, and follow the same basic format. (Though his book on Raimi was kinda disappointing, as it's more about filmmaking than the films themselves) Definitely worth checking out if you're interested in either of those guys, though those books are a bit out of date at this point. Anyway, I like it a lot. Hopefully we'll hear something more on Romero or euro-horror from Muir in the future."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"Reading this book is fun. Being a horror film buff, this book is a practical and thoughtful encyclopaedia and always brings me so much fun when exploring the anxieties and common fears in historical and social context of 1970s horror. In this period of 70s horror remakes (such as The Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Dawn of the Dead), this book can be a very essential guide to help us re-exmine the originalities and significance of these 70s classics. Highly Recommanded."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"Obviously I am a huge fan of this magnificent book. One cannot really overstate how brilliant the reviews for this book are. Its also very easy to read, the author has a real understanding for the subjects he covers. Each film has a razor sharp observation that isnt always found in other resource books. I havent yet read horror films from the 80s but I cant wait!"},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"What a terrifically fun book to read! It brought back so many fond memories of going to these scary movies back in the 70's. The author knows his stuff and his enthusiasm shines through loud and clear--no stuffy criticism here. I am completely hooked on this book."},{"Title":"Horror Films of the 1970s","review":"I found I prefered John Kenneth Muir's Horror Films of the 1980s but this volume is essential if you liked the previous book or are a fan of Muir's excellent reviews."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Like Ostrovsky's books, this is a very good one about the undercover Israeli operations through the world, but we can not make sure that all happened in that way. It's very interesting those Mossad's operations that went wrong. But I still think that Mr Thomas forgot the Colombian's FARC and drug dealers link with Mossad and the undercover operations in Brazil..."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Most computers are \\"state of the art computers\\". Most conversations are \\"picked up by computers\\", not by mikes. Most thoughts any Mossad Director had, twenty or thirty years ago, are known to the author (who also memorably states, on page 230 of the PB edition, that Andropov died from \\"hepatitis, a disease of the kidneys\\", thus opening new avenues to medicine). If it were limited to verifiable facts, and wasted less space on large font and line spacing, this book could easily be half the size.Even then I wouldn't recommend it, for the good reasons the one-star reviews to the second edition state or hint at (silly of me not to have read them before buying this shelfspace-consuming product).(As an irrelevant aside, I've noticed that the negative reviews are -at least for me, and unless written by a crank or \\"a reader\\"- the most useful; they are also the worst rated, except perhaps in string theory and the IDers-Darwinist debates: I think this might be because, as somebody noted, if you are going to picnic you don't like somebody telling you it's going to rain).But there are other factually inaccurate books that one reads with pleasure. It is the style that makes this one insufferable. Itis replete with inane sentences; thus, one reads in page 308 \\"A desert was like no other place on Earth for surprises. A sandstorm could appear in moments, changing the landscape, burying him alive. One kind of sky meant one thing, another something quite different. He would do his own weather forecasting; he would have to do everything by himself and learn to let his ears adjust to the silence, to remember that the silence of the desert was like no other. And always he must remember that his first mistake would be his last\\". This previously unknown secret wisdom occupies almost a quarter of a page. Fortunately Thomas doesn't stop here: one learns that \\"beneath his hupta he wore goggles; their lenses gave the dark landscape a crepuscular definition. The only weapon Shalom carried was the one the Sarami would expect to find on him: a hunting knife\\". Quite: goggles are widely used by desert Bedouins. But not only goggles: afterwards Shalom \\"began to photograph and time what he saw\\".Then, in another chapter (page 331), \\"Shortly before 6:30 AM, Yatom's Peugeot entered the parking lot in the basement of Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, and he took the elevator to a fourth-floor conference room. Waiting there were two men and to women ... each was in his late twenties, suntanned, and superbly-fit looking. For the past few days they had been up in the snow of northern Israel brushing up on their skiing\\". Gee, Mr. Thomas, thanks for the amazing and relevant info! How would one otherwise know Yatom took an elevator to the fourth-floor conference room on 16 February 1998?Then, in page 231 we are taken into the Pope study, where (in 1983) \\"the room's bookshelves offered clues to the pope's expanding interests. Along with leather-bound Polish editions of the classics and the works of theologians and philosophers, were copies of the 'International Defence Review' and books with such arresting titles as 'The Problems of Military Readiness' and 'Military Balance and Surprise Attack' ... \\". Anyone with the barest acquaintance of how any organizarion works is aware that their Heads, when they want to know about something, have a report prepared, and are briefed. They don't have time to read books to find out facts and background. But no, wait! The military books and reviews \\"reflected the Pontiff's unswerving conviction thet the main enemy the world still faced in 1983 was Soviet Communism\\". And the former Primate of Communist-dominated Poland took to reading the IDF to confirm that conviction? C'mon!And so it goes, on and on and on, like this review. In page 135 we learn that \\"on a damp spring morning in 1997, David Kimche instructed Arab landscapers how he wanted to have his garden rearranged in a Tel Aviv suburb. His manner was diffident, the mellifluous voice more suited to a college campus than dealing with manual workers, suggesting Komche was descended from generations of administrators who had once raised Britain's Union Jack over far-flung lands ... his every gesture while briefing the gardeners -the flicking away of hair from his forehead, the lengthy pauses, the thoughtful stare- suggested a lifetime spent cloistered on a college campus\\". Well, it's fortunate for us that the Arab landscapers recorded their impressions for posterity. Or was Thomas there, busily taking notes?Other space-filling gimmicks Thomas uses to inflate his book to mammoth size are unnecessary/meaningless sentences and verbiage (\\"On the video, Bazoft eyes showed signs he had been drugged. Mossad pharmacologists found it impossible to decide which drugs had been used\\", page 167; or \\"[In] 1988 Nir and Stanton travelled togethe to Madrid under false names ... why had they chosen aliases for the flight tickets when they both travelled on their real passports would never be explained [and is a very difficult feat. Try it yourself and see the result!]. Another mystery was why they took a flight first to Madrid when there were several scheduled direct ones to Mexico City. Was Nir trying to impress his lover with how easy it was to fool most people most of the time ... ? ... these questions were to remain unanswered\\", in page 321.The last trick is that anything goes, provided you always use the conditional/hypothetical \\"it's not impossible that X could have done Y\\",\\"one can't discard the hypothesis that Z\\"; make generic statements \\"not everybody agrees with this\\" and stop short of identifying the \\"they\\"; etc.In short, this book is a mixture of fact (the one-page list of Mossad's Directors and their tenures) and sentences about real or imaginary events, techniques and things the author understands poorly, couched in the language of a third-rate fiction thriller. If you don't have it, don't buy it and so hopefully prevent another edition and therefore save some trees, vastly nobler creatures. If you have it, and didn't like it, give it to a paper recycler. If you liked it, well, tastes difffer."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"If you are interested in covert intelligence organizations or just like plain spy books, this is it. Gordon Thomas does thorough research and writes in an objective style yet still manages to tell the story of the Mossad with the page-turning excitement of a novel. So I'll keep this short because time is valuable. Needless to say, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This book shows how dangerous the Israeli foreign policy is towards the United States and how they want to use the USA to destroy all the Islamic and Catholic countries because Israel fears they do not support the zionist movement. I'm not against the Jewish people most jewish people are also a victim of the zionist movements goals because they give the Jewish people a bad name with their global domination agendas. Sad what has been done in history for the zionist cause and all the damage it has done towards the Jewish people."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Gideon's Spies, while not as well written as By Way of Deception, still reveals Mossad's ruthlessness. Gordan Thomas seems to derive a sick pleasure in describing assassinations, deceit, espionage and taking advantage of the US that characterize Israel's secret intelligence agency. The author is in awe of this corrupt organization. If you can get past that, the events seem factual and are corroborated with other publications.By Way of Deception is a far better book. It has many more organizational details and each horrible incident unfolds like plot of a good mystery novel. The author, Victor Ostrovsky, is a Jew who had high expectations of a moral code of the Jewish state, who was bitterly disappointed upon entering the secret world of Israeli intelligence."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Rather than providing a comprehensive assessment of Israel's intelligence community, it is apparent that Thomas uses his forum to provide a very subtle &quot;anti-Mossad&quot; (and dare I say Jewish) agenda throughout his book. Using half-truths and innuendos, Thomas creates an extremely sophisticated and authoritative platform in order to illustrate and expound upon classic &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot; themes as undeniable fact. For instance, the notion of an extensive network of what Thomas refers to as &quot;sayanim&quot; or &quot;Jewish collaborator&quot; plays on the fear and belief that secretly all Jews conspire around the world to gain the upper hand on gentiles. Thomas presents the case in no uncertain terms that Jews of all nationality secretly feel that their commitment to Israel is stronger than that of their own country (and thus should not be trusted). The book was a sad and misleading account based primarily upon fiction and the fading stories of a few Ex-Mossad employees that somehow seem to have access to every mission the intelligence agency was conducting within its 50 years.For me, the opening chapters where enough to draw quite a bit of suspicion after recognizing that the majority of &quot;compliments&quot; Thomas made about the Mossad where generally &quot;back-handed&quot; and snide. From there the book degenerated into an all out assault on the &quot;ruthless&quot; Mossad as if viciously wages an unjust/immoral war on Palestinian &quot;revolutionaries.&quot; Bottom line, save your money!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"The best book about the Israeli Secret Service."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I have recently completed reading Gordon Thomas's Gideon's Spies - the Secret History of the Mossad.

I therefore contacted 3 very credible acquaintances of mine - who between them are extremely knowledgeable (I believe to be experts) about Israel and terrorists. Each of them responded to me, that they never heard of either the book or the author. I found that very strange and now have a very difficult time trusting any of the info in the book."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone in the intelligence community.

The author begins with a plunge into the circumstances revolving around the death of Princess Diane. He paints an intricate picture of facts, and faux paus that clearly complicated the situation then and now. It is an interesting beginning to a book of this nature. However, it does demand the reader's attention, therefore, I believe it serves the purpose well.After the dramatic introductory story, the author settles into a more traditional format based on the chronological events, and history of the Israeli spy agency, Mossad. Mossad has enjoyed a much more secretive past than its American counterparts. This alone, has me celebrating the encyclopedic work the author provides in this book. I literally could not put it down, and found myself reading it every time I had even a moment to spare.The sources, and intimate knowledge the author provides is phenomenal. He was afforded many hours of interviews with intricate members that commented directly and anonymously. The history of the agency and incidents in which they were involved are fascinating. The author details the successes as well as the failures in dynamic detail.This is a long book, but I highly recommend it for those interested in an absolutely fascinating look into this secretive agency and World History! Bravo!!!!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I enjoyed this book. I know it jumps all over in its timeline. However I enjoyed it because of that. It was exciting and kept me on my toes. I felt like I was constantly having to calculate where in history the author was. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I just can't bring myself to. I have too many issues with it.But first, let's talk about what's good. There are a lot of good stories in this book, presuming they're true. Some things seem a bit fanciful, like the idea that Mossad had a hand in the death of Princess Diana. Some other interesting stories include details of Mossad assassinations of various people (including a banker who threatened reveal its secrets), the probable theft of US nuclear materials, and others. I don't want to say that the author writes with a pro-Israel bias...rather, it's probably more accurate to say that he only tells Israel's side of the story. His admiration for Mossad seems to shine through, however.Speaking of Diana, the author keeps revisiting her throughout the book, but never makes a case of what precisely Mossad is supposed to have done, except that her driver may or may not have been an agent. He seems to revel in airing conspiracy theories about her and other potential Mossad exploits. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.My main gripes with this book are threefold. First, it's a series of vignettes that tend to include flashbacks and whose flashbacks include flashbacks. It gets confusing to remember where each storytelling thread left off, and the author doesn't do a good job of guiding the reader through each story. These vignettes don't seem to have any real organization within the book: there's no overall storytelling arc. The author does a clumsy job of organizing things into chapters, but then revisits stories from previous chapters or hints at future stories without indicating when they will be told.My second gripe is the constant typos. From misspelled words to missing words, the overall effect is amateurish and doesn't give me confidence that the author really knows what he's talking about. For example, Mossad apparently was able to steal US nuclear warhead blueprints that were stored \\"twenty feet beneath the Mexican mountains.\\" I'm pretty sure he meant the New Mexican mountains.Finally, the author obviously doesn't have a command of the computing world, in which he is trying to describe some of Mossad's exploits. He mentions a seemingly magical program called Promis umpteen times and describes how Mossad seems to have stolen it from the US, and how Mossad continuously gives it to other governments so it can spy on them. But it's apparent he doesn't really understand what Promis is. The author talks about a person using a \\"sophisticated Microsoft program\\" without mentioning anything more. According to this book, every super-secret and secure room is protected by \\"electronic swipe cards whose codes are changed daily.\\" I got really tired of reading that particular phrase.In the end, my Kindle says I'm 60% through with this book, and I'm not sure I will get past that. The book has become just too tedious to read, which is a pity. There's some interesting content, but it's so poorly presented that I don't feel like expending the effort."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Great book! Full of great stories about Mossad. It does jump around a little but it's not to the point where you cannot follow it. Definitely worth the 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I just finished Gideon's Spies, and while it was interesting I have to regard this book as more fiction that fact. The nature of the book is a case-by-case, relatively detailed account of Mossad tradecraft, foreign involvement, counterterrorism, and just general James Bond-ery. The book is not written chronologically. so following the names, dates and events takes a bit of effort. It's presented as a non-fiction work.I think the real selling point of the book is the level of detail, but the detail is the downfall. Thomas doesn't cite most of his sources, and the names, dates, activities and nuance of each account couldn't really have come from interviews. In fact, most of what he says could only have come from the operators who carried out the mission. Of course, Thomas would argue that he could not reveal his sources, but we can infer from what he writes that only one of two situations could have occurred to make his accounts accurate. First, he could have come into possession of a vast quantity of field reports and Mossad classified documents. Second, he has interviewed every operator within Israeli intelligence mentioned in the book. Neither is plausible. Adding further doubt are the inaccuracies in many of his details, added ironically to lend weight to what he writes. He places military installations in the wrong states, his dates are shaky, and he seems to oversimplify much of the material he covers. I think what he has done here is to mix known history, basic info from interviews, and existing conspiracy theories, then makes up the rest. And on top of that, I don't think he really expects us to believe everything in the book. So, accurate? No. Interesting? Well, I read the whole thing, didn't I?The only thing we can know for sure about foreign intelligence is that what we \\"know\\" isn't entirely true, so I'm an ardent skeptic of the information in Thomas' book. Without any real sources to back up his work, a large part of the book can be regarded as fantasy. I don't think the Mossad contributed to the death of Princess Di. I don't believe that Mossad has been a step ahead of every intelligence agency anywhere, ever, secretly running the show over entire continents. But like I said, it's a fun read!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Excellent Book If you want to know what has happened in the world since 1940's read this book."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Gives you a real good insight into the world of spies and intelligence communities around the world.

The problem with reading anything but an academic book on intelligence is that there is no way to verify any of the stories and separate fact from fiction, or more appropriately, myth. The stories in 'Gidion's Spies' could just as easily have been drawn out a script from James Bond as real life intelligence work. But the fact remains that we just don't know what goes on in the shadows of international relations. Having said that the detail and sources in the book gives these stories a frightening plausibility.It is a macabre history of the 'self-proclaimed' most feared intelligence agency in the world. For sheer entertainment value 'Gideon's Spies' is highly recommendable and it will have you annoying your friends and colleagues on a daily basis with last nights 20 pages before you nodded off. That's if you can put the book down in the first place."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"When you write a book about any intelligence agency ( Mossad, CIA, British MI6), you will need information from people near the top. This book makes some interesting accusations such as it was Iran who blew up Pan Am 103, not the two Lybians on trial. The author also claims that the Mossad killed Robert Maxwell. Here is the problem. Much of the source material was provided by an alleged Israeli Mossad agent named Ari Ben-Menashe. First of all the Mossad said he was never an agent. Second this Ben-Menashe is also the same man who said that George Bush and Ronald Reagan made the &quot;October Surprise &quot; deal with Iran. A congressional investigation into this matter said that Ari Ben-Menashe had no credibilty was was known to be a liar. Another source for the book is Victor Ostrovsky. He is famous as being the former Mossad agent who wrote the book &quot;By Way of Deception&quot;. He is angry at the Mossad and thus his credibilty must be questioned. Gordon Thomas did not leave any footnotes to check up on any of his accusations. Here is the thing though. Israel is surrounded by enemies. They need 24 hour intelligence gathering. The CIA has overthrown governments, financed mass murderering dictators and killed at freewill, yet people after reading this book would assume that the Mossad is the worse thing on the planet. This book is alright, but accusations need to be checked on and the author leaves us NO footnotes to do that."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the MossadThis book is a must read for anyone interested in current events and those fascinated by the covert activities of governments and their intelligence agencies. Isreal's Mossad is the book's focal point, but Gordon Thomas delves into the inner sanctums of American, British, French, Chinese, Russian and Arab intelligence services to show the connections, relationships and secret agendas of nations on a global basis. Although exposing the flaws and missteps of Mossad operations throughout the years, one cannot finish the book and not feel a sense of awe and admiration for the covert work of Israel's internationally-respected and feared intelligence agency."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"The book survives on its fascinating anecdotes. Unfortunately, it leaves the reader with the inescapable impression that the stories are incomplete and too simplistic, and that the events are presented for purposes of sensationalism more than accuracy. One has no idea to what extent the stories are true, but more importantly, the author doesn't make a serious attempt to inspire the reader's confidence."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"A real page turner. I found myself unable to put this down. Thomas really hits the mark with this book on the Mossad. I was sas when I got to the end, because I was hungry to read more about the Mossad."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I purchased Thomas' book with high hopes that it would be a reasoned, intelligent review of the history of Mossad, one of the world's most effective intelligence services, along the lines of Israel's Secret War's.Sadly, such was not the case. Thomas is a conspiracy theorist who relies on innuendo and rumor to justify mindless theories and meaningless concepts, all in lieu of research and facts to tell what is an incredible story on its own. From little things, like referring to the Echelon surveillance system operated by the National Security Agency as monitoring every conversation between every individual virtually anywhere in the world (Echelon monitors electronic conversations, not every possible conversation) to secondhand references to the late William Casey, the then-director of the CIA, as suggesting that Mossad supplied arms to Hezbollah in the early 1980's when Israel invaded Lebanon, Thomas studiously avoids anything approaching professionalism or reasoned analysis.Mossad is a rich topic for investigation, and there are excellent treatments on the subject. Thomas, unfortunately, is an unprofessional, sloppy and pathetic writer whose book demeans its subject."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Here in Brazil, I read this excellent book.And I must tell you that the author really wrote about this Israeli excellent secret service, called Mossad.The main Mossad's actions are all in this book.One more thing. The author also describes Mossad's failures and scandals.The author made dozens of interviews with Mossad's figures and also made interviews with many Mossad's enemies.It took about two weeks, until I read this great book.If you want to read just one book about the Mossad, this is my tip for you.What are katsas and kidons?I know, but read this book and you will know what katsas and kidons means."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"First of all, any reviewer or potential reader of this book who expects to find pure, untainted historical truth in a popularized account of classified intelligence work like &quot;Gideon's Spies&quot; is suffering from a laughable case of naivete. Obviously, no layman author is going to have much verifiable inside dirt on the &quot;katsas&quot; and their intelligence coups, especially an amateur such as Thomas who has no particular expertise in Israeli affairs and is better known as a journeyman author on a wide range of non-fiction subjects. So, if you're looking for some kind of exhaustively researched bible of Mossad history, then I'm afraid this is the wrong book for you. Thomas is more interested in luring the casual reader's interest with shocking allegations, like the Princess Diana/Mossad connection, than he is in providing some kind of chronological encyclopedia of the Mossad's deeds, as several of the other reviewers have made us aware in just a bit too much detail. Well, sorry guys, we're all very impressed with your stinging criticisms about the proper date of the Entebbe rescue and the book's lack of footnotes, but they ring a little hollow considering that &quot;Gideon's Spies&quot; is a blatant piece of entertainment non-fiction and nothing more. I'm sure that Thomas himself would be the first to admit this. I've read other books on the Mossad, such as &quot;Inside Stories&quot; by Eisenberg, and I have to say that Thomas' book is just as well-researched as any of the others, if a bit meandering at times, and is quite excellent if you're in the market for a casual and entertaining look at the world's most fearsome spy agency."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I found this book to be lacking something that most readers of this subject look for. I've read books about the mossad and Israel before and this one is good, but not the greatest. The author is spontaneous with his literature. At times it was interesting and grabbing and i couldn't put the book down. But often I found myself in a factual slum, struggling to get through. If you've never read anything about the Mossad, this is a good place to start, otherwise I would look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"One review on the back of the book states, in part, &quot;good enough to be a movie.&quot; This is certainly true. Combining fact, speculation, and a healthy mix of narrative, Gordon Thomas makes GIDEON'S SPIES an excellent read. He painstakingly peels back layer after layer of the spy organization few have heard of and even fewer know anything about. It has a ground zero, you are there feel, that &quot;tells it like it is.&quot; You'll be shocked by the shear audacity of some of Mossad's actions, and you'll read disbelievingly The Mossad's involvement in stories straight off the front page of the newspaper. While some of it does seem a little far out, Thomas keeps you interested. GIDEON'S SPIES will grab your attention from the first page and never let go."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Whenever I read a book, I ask tell me something I don't know. Well, I did not know that the Mossad was taping Bill Clinton's phone sex with Monica Lewinsky!Danny Yatom, the head of the Mossad, sent a spy team in March, 1997, to Washington D.C. based on reports \\"that President Clinton was repeatedly indulging in phone-sex calls with a former White House aide, Monica Lewinsky ... Knowing the White House was totally protected by electronic counter-measures, the yahalomin team focused on Lewinsky's apartment. They began to intercept explicit phone calls from the president to Lewinsky. The recordings were couriered by diplomatic bag to Tel Aviv.\\"Ken Starr in the Starr Report says that on March 29, 1997 \\"[Bill] told [Monica] that he suspected a foreign embassy ... was taping his telephones. If anyone ever asked about their phone sex, she should say that they knew that their calls were being monitored all day long, and the phone sex was a put on.\\" [Gideon's Spies, p.104]Just that little nugget above is reason enough to get this book.I wonder how many *other* compromised U.S. politicians the Mossad has the dirt on?In 1994 when Bobbie Ray Inman was up for consideration as the Secretary of Defense, there was a Mossad-inspired - or really American Zionist inspired - calling campaign to paint Inman as a homosexual. Inman is a married man and he may or may not be a man with a closet homosexual history. I do know this, after this campaign began Inman melted like a chocolate candy bar in the sun and withdrew his Secretary of Defense nomination.Calls (to journalists) were also made concerning Inman's alleged homosexuality even *after* he withdrew his nomination. Years later Bobbie Ray Inman is still stung by what happened to him. I do not know if the \\"smears\\" were true or not, but I suspect they were given the way Inman collapsed so quickly.The Mossad and American Zionists were outraged that Inman had restricted that satellite maps that the Israelis could look at to about 200 or 250 miles around Israel. Apparently, Israel feels it has the right to the entire panoply of U.S. intelligence."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"this book reads better than any fiction and it is verifiably true. i cannot reccomend this book highly enough, especially for those fans of the spy genre. get this, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I cannot use my name as this would comprimise my position but having read this book, I can say that I recognize much of it as factual.

They remain acitve as I do in US politics (democratic party)unfortunately promoting policies in the US that will eventually lead to the downfall of the american system.

Using half-truths and inuendos, Thomas create an extremely sophisticated and authoritative platform in order to illustrate and expound upon classic &quot;jewish conspiracy&quot; themes as undeniable fact. For instance, the notion of an extensive network of what Thomas refers to as &quot;sayanim&quot; or &quot;Jewish collaborator&quot; plays on the fear and belief that secretly all Jews conspire around the world to gain the upper hand on gentiles. Thomas presents the case in no uncertain terms that Jews of all nationality secretly feel that their committment to Israel is stronger than that of their own country (and thus should not be trusted). The book was a sad and misleading account based primarily upon fiction and the fading stories of a few Ex-Mossad employees that somehow seem to have access to every mission the intelligence agency was conducting within its 50 years.For me, the opening chapters where enough to draw quite a bit of suspicion after recognizing that the majority of &quot;compliments&quot; Thomas made about the Mossad where generally &quot;back-handed&quot; and snyde. From there the book degenerated into an all out assault on the &quot;ruthless&quot; Mossad as if viciously wages an unjust/immoral war on Palestinian &quot;revolutionaries.&quot; Bottom line, save your money!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I put this book 2 star because I never put less than 2 stars in a book, that is because I wrote two books (I gave them to my friends, I didn't publish them) and I know what is to write a book.Gordon Thomas is trying to tell us the most top secrets of the Mossad, I don't know if the Mossad, same as the CIA, MI5 or MI6 will let him do that (because all of them are involved), but if you like spies stories, read \\"Triple\\" (Ken Follet) or \\"The Fist of God\\" (Frederick Forsyth), in these books are telling all the Mossad secrets (same as in this book) with more enthusiasm and before anyone says that \\"is a secret, nobody will know it till you read this book.\\" So I really don't know how much of this book is secret and how much is public.The book at first is interesting and keep you reading, but when you get to \\"the secret\\" part that is in other books is really boring, maybe because I already know the story, but since the half of the book I just read it to finish it."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"this books in a way agrees to the assassination sanctioned by the regime of israel. when some counteracts, they are labeled a terrorists, to march in a sovereign state and execute someone in front of his children is heroism; for a child to through stones at a fully armed occupying force is considered terrorism. one thing though, the author is BIASED.

Gordon Thomas has a given us an excellent insight to the Mossad. He gave the reader all of the successful stories of the powerful and far reaching arm of Israeli intelligence. But, he also gave us the stories of the blunders and humiliation of the Mossad. Yes, even great spy and intelligence gathering agencies are not immune from botched assasinations and capture. Thomas also showed us that in order to be successful at the intelligence game, you must be determined, rutheless at some times, unwavering, and mentally strong.With that, Thomas has demonstrated the importance of intelligence, especially to a nation constantly under attack. I got a clear message of the importance of national security and why nations must strive to protect themselves. Sometimes this comes at a price, and many sacrifices must also be made.

Another GOOD JOB for Gordon Thomas."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This book will blow anyone away, who is interested in the Mossad. The stories that are listed within, could have come straight out of a James Bond novel. Which is also a little bit of a drawback. I would look at this book with a somewhat weary as for their historical accuracy. However, if you want a good bedtime book, this is not one of them. It will keep you up all night."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I opened this book knowing absolutely nothing about Mossad. I was stuck in a foreign country and since this was one of the only English books in the store, I decided to take a chance although I'm not usually a fan of these types of books in general as it's an area I know little about. For that reason, along with the ease of reading and the interspersed references to more current events, I actually walked away from reading this book with not only an intense interest in exploring this subject further but also with the wish that I had followed my childhood dream of being an undercover agent of some sort. Silly, but true. This book reads partly as a factual account and partly as a crime novel, and I must say that myself and the four others I have lent this to have all been extremely impressed. Whether or not this book is 100% correct on the details, I don't know yet, but even if I discover inaccuracies in future readings of more textbook like accounts, I'll still be grateful that I was able to be introduced to a new subject matter without feeling as though the author were talking over my head."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Although this is an interesting, some may even say thrilling, book, it is plagued by so many blatant inaccuracies and factual mistakes that it is difficult to take anything written by the author too seriously. Most of the Hebrew words are either ridiculously misspelled, or translated incorrectly, which immediately takes away from the credibility of the book. In addition to factual mistakes, there are also emberassing &quot;logical&quot; errors. The most blatant one perhaps is when the author tells of a meeting regarding the hostage-taking in Munich in 1972. He goes on to write that the participants couldn't help but think about the daring hostage rescue in Entebbe and wonder whether a repeat performence was possible. The problem, the Entebbe raid was in 1976...enough said."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"GS:TSHOTM is a truly interesting book on-without a shadow of a doubt-one of The Best spy agencies in the world today. My sister bought a hardbound copy for me after I saw it at Borders. I've come upon references to Mossad while reading other books (such as the MIG theft, usage of kidonim), but they didn't prepare me for what I would read.As was stated in the book, the Mossad works as if the very survival of Israel is at stake. It has been involved (directly or indirectly) in some of the more controversial incidents (the Lillehammer fiasco, the botched 1997 assassination of a Hamas official in Jordan) but pulled off some incredible moves that leave the bigger players in the intelligence community (CIA, KGB, etc.) in avid disbelief: the theft of the MIG, which was such a premier fighter in the 60s that the West scrambled to learn more about it; the Entebbe rescue mission; the worldwide network of sayanim (Jewish expatriates) that the Mossad katsas discreetly use as support resources; the detailed intel-gathering in Egypt, which led to Israel's resounding victory in the Six-Day War, and most of all, the capture of Adolf Eichmann, as told by Rafi Eitan himself.I liked the stories about the directors-general themselves, especially the one on Meir Amit, credited for laying the foundation that turned Mossad into the powerhouse that it is today. Their stories must also provide a lesson for the heads of other intelligence agencies.I was a bit confused with the organization of events, specifically on the chapter of David Kimche: Mr. Thomas states he entered Mossad in 1968, but his name had been brought up in earlier operations in 1965! Another error was during the Dec.1972 PLO hijacking of the Israeli embassy in Bangkok, GT wrote of an Entebbe-type operation being considered-even though Entebbe was four years in the future!The chapters on Robert Maxwell (I believe GT wrote a separate book on him too.) gave me the impression that the Mossad would mercilessly exploit someone's resources to help Israel, especially during the Vanunu episode-and more creepier, now that he's out of jail as I write these words...In all, Gideon's Spies is a great book, flaws aside. I lent this to a friend, and he's impressed as I am."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Engaging and accessable to just about everybody -- it reads more like a novel than a history.

In readable and engaging style, Gideon's Spies unwinds the mind-boggling complexities of Israeli politics and their intelligence services, which have been in and out of bed with their counterparts around the world, alternately abetting and undermining as suited Israel's needs of the moment in the perception of its leaders--and of HaMossad. There are occasional egregious technical lapses (a radio antenna is described as a quarter mile of tightly coiled fiber optic cable[sic], for example) that are not so damaging in themselves but nevertheless lead the reader to wonder about the accuracy of the research and reporting in areas not so easily checked.

First chapter was a massive intrigue, second one made to say \\"really?!\\", third one to rise eyebrows but fourth and remaining conveinced me, that the author is expert storyteller, but lacks credibility. Not that the sources are lying or author is thinking thing up. But one can't understand, where is which source and where are deductions of the author. Even a complete list of biblography is not included, not to mention archival documents (archives themselves are mentioned, though). Anothre problem is, that author seems not to believe, that one may read the whole book from the beginning to the end. That's probably the reason, that one can find examples like \\"Shin Beth, Israel's counterintelligence body, ...\\" hundreds of times repetaing througout the book. I think ten times is enough for even the worst idiot or he would have not managed up to that point in the book. The editor's haven't done their work, even not reading through the whole book after last additions from the author. That causes a lot of repeating facts, descriptions, even whole paragraphs. It's hard to understand, which chapters were in the original, which have been added in later editions. Worth of reading anyway, if You have a spare five days or so."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I bought this book thinking that i would get a few good stories, then some stuff i did'nt know, and then some stuff that would be boring too much information reading.....I was wrong!!!!

Thomas digs up and assembles an amazing amount of information about normally secret activities. Mossad has played a major role in world affairs for decades, including events it might not have seemed involved in. It acts as sort of a spy agency's spy agency; when MI5 or CIA have something they want to know, Mossad is often where they get it.Those who are pro-Israel will be impressed by the derring-do recounted here; the Israelis did not stop being audacious with the Eichmann kidnapping and the Entebbe rescue. Those who are anti-Israel will certainly find material to fuel their hatred. \\"What? You mean Mossad has whacked heroic terrorists without reading them their Miranda rights first?\\" Whatever.This book represents a significant updating of earlier editions; much has transpired since and Thomas has the goods on a lot of it. His sourcing is excellent. He was given major access to a number of major Mossad figures including past chiefs of the agency, and this lends an air of credibility. Thomas writes that he checked and cross-checked material, that his sources became more forthcoming with more recent events they remembered better, and that he never found them to have lied to him or otherwise led him astray.The book has a few flaws. It is occasionally sloppy with facts and dates, not enough to seriously mar it but enough for the astute reader to notice. Thomas overdoes the British angle a bit. He's British and his father worked in intelligence, giving Thomas major entr&eacute;e there, but it leaves him a little too tempted to press the British angle even when it's tangential to the subject matter. He makes much of a marginal Mossad tie to the death of Princess Diana, but while the event will fascinate for years - and this gives Thomas a place to explore some of the undisclosed angles - Mossad didn't have much to do with it. According to him, Mossad was attempting to recruit Henri Paul, the deputy Ritz hotel manager, security head and driver of the car in which Diana died, as a Mossad agent because of his access to records, hotel telephone lines and other sensitive data regarding the many powerful people who stayed at the Ritz, not specifically the princess. Mossad's pressure may have contributed to Paul's stress level and intoxication that night. But as the book also suggests Paul crashed after having a laser shone in his eyes, that a mysterious chase car disappeared and that its paparazzi owner was later found dead in Corsica, it strongly suggests Mossad was at best a spectator. This may burnish its reputation as being close to every affair of significance, or tarnish it as having been somehow instrumental in the popular princess's death, but the bottom line is that it allowed Thomas to devote dozens of pages to a grabby and sensational celebrity scandal that doesn't have much to do with Mossad.I question his decision to reveal as much personal data as he does on the young woman who was Mossad's honey trap to catch nuclear-secret spiller Mordecai Vanunu. She's now a housewife in Florida; Thomas does everything but tell you where her children go to school. It seems malicious to me. He also spends two pages describing Condoleezza Rice, but while he seems to want to depict her as some fearsome diplomatic Amazon, he fails to.This book gets into any number of international events, never failing to fascinate. I could hardly put it down. Thomas's storytelling style leaves you waiting to find out what happened, when you then remember that in many cases, the events still go on, with no ending yet to write about. His insights into the world stage, including China, Iran and North Korea, are countless and good.There's a lot of great stuff in here. How Mossad extends its reach - a lot of unpaid Jewish volunteers around the world are available to do it small favors. How Israel got the fissionable material for its nuclear program - by finagling it out of a US nuclear waste reprocessing firm. Why Jonathan Pollard hasn't been let out of prison - because Israel may have shared some of his intelligence take with China and Russia.A few major themes here:- US-Israeli relationship strains, which hit bottom in the 1980s. Some Israeli spy heads sought to shore the Jewish state's relations with America's enemies as a hedge against the US drifting out of Israel's corner.- China's emergence as a major player in the military and intelligence world, sometimes opposed to Israel but sometimes finding it an ally of convenience.- Iran is and has been for years a major concern of Mossad.Mossad suffered a number of publicized failures in recent years but seems to be recovering of late. As it does so, this book represents its own PR offensive to tell its side of various stories and to get them in the historical record."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Although Thomas has the information to make a great book, he is plagued with some false information that makes his book less convincing. Try Victor Ostrovsky's books, they are better written and more accurate. Or if you are looking for an excellent but longer book, try Israel's Secret Wars. Overall, an okay read, but it lacks the extra stuff to make it beleivable and good."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Love it or loath it, the Mossad has had it's ups and downs, and in the business of intelligence and national security they have frequently shown to be one of the best and one of the most misused resources at the disposal of the state of Israel.

The language is easy to enjoy and makes for a satisfying read.However this book isn't without its shortcomings. To talk through a few:-The author often does not follow thru on his thoughts. For example, the Rabin assassination (or conspiracy) was briefly talked about, then at one point just stopped. Without any further explanation. The author did not even hypothesise as to the how, why, etc. I don't want to call this being lazy, but it doesn't bode well for someone who should be a professional.- Factual errors. When the author talks about the Entebbe raid by the Israeli special forces, the military operation was incorrectly referred to as operation thunderball. Instead it should read: thunderbolt. Did the author perform an exhaustive proof read?-Many stories are horribly out of sequence, one chapter briefly talks about the Entebbe raid (1976) and then talks about Yom Kippur war (1973). This happens in many sections throughout the book in general.Often times, although I am intrigued by the subject matter, I find this book to be a flurry of headache-inducing back-and-forth narratives that span different decades, locations, political players, topics, etc. The various accounts of the Mossad's activities are described in an incohesive manner, at times disjointed and rarely does the author sum up a chapter well - if at all.In many places I find the ideas described in great detail and then quickly abandoned to go to the next one.-An example begins with the Iran contra affair, described over a number of pages in wonderful detail, then suddenly completely abandoned! The very next paragraph talked about David Kimche's view of Yasser Arafat and the PLO, then before you know it, that was the end of the chapter! No explanation. No summary. As a reader you're left wondering about the context, etc.-Another example is a narrative of the bombing of the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor by the Israeli Air Force. This event is described in various places in the book without any cohesion. This all sometimes feels like a bunch of cobbled together hand-written notes thrown in - to make a book.-Yet another example is the description over multiple pages about 6 dangerous rogue Pakistani nuclear scientists, then quickly abandoned to talk about Iran's hatred towards the Jewish state. Then without so much as another paragraph, moves on to talk about an assassination mission in the Indonesian city of Batu.On this same subject matter, having read Victor Ostrovsky's \\"By Way of Deception\\" and \\"The Other Side of Deception\\" and favour that style of writing, perhaps I tend to naturally view this book in a less than favourable light. Ostrovsky's books were narrated in a clear and crisp sequential flow. Not all books are so well produced.I love non-fiction spy stories and enjoyed this book by Gordon Thomas immensely. At USD$9 it is more than worth it! I will read this book again very soon. I had just hoped that the author had put in a little more effort to make sure he presents one cohesive historic narrative with regards to one of the most experienced and ruthless intelligence agencies in history."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Gideon's Spies by Gordon Thomas was originally published in 1995, but was updated in 2009. Even with the update, especially with respect to Osama Bin Lin. Gideon Spies is dated in places.Gideon's Spies is subtitled, \\"the secret history of the Mossad.\\" The subtitle lives up to its name. Much of the book centers on the success, failures, personalities, and management styles of the various directors of the Mossad. Thomas obtained, the reader hopes legally, an incredible amount of information about the inner-workings of Mossad. While some information is purely historical and irrelevant to modern spycraft, there is an incredible amount of detail. For instance, the reader is given tail numbers on aircraft used to transport terrorists as well as the selection criteria used by Hamas for suicide bombers.While Thomas amassed vast amounts of information, his presentation is sometimes muddied. Sometimes he provides so many \\"dots\\" that it is difficult for the reader to follow along. Also, some \\"dots\\" like Condoleezza Rice's skill at the piano and her tenure as Stanford's provost were just \\"dots\\" and were unconnected to the overall story. There is also some needless repetition, like telling the reader again and again, that access cards at a certain secure location were changed frequently. Most significantly, there is also one serious lapse in common sense, where Thomas repeated the recipe for a certain explosive Mossad found in a terrorist training manual.One final criticism, Gideon Spies starts with Mossad recruiting a man by the name of Henri Paul. Paul worked at the Ritz hotel where Princess Diana stayed immediately prior to her death. Mossad kept an eye on the hotel because it was frequented by Middle Easterners. It had no interest in Diana. The surveillance at Ritz Hotel is a footnote in the history of Mossad. Starting a book about Mossad with this footnote distorts the telling of its history. Gideon Spies would have been a better book if it began with birth of Mossad in pre-independence Israel.However Diana \\"sells.\\" Making the first chapter about Diana was almost certainly a marketing decision. To lure in buyers, many books these days start off with a dramatic, but out-of-logical sequence or irrelevant, first chapter. Thomas just did what many other authors have done, but still that doesn't make it right.Because of the \\"cheap trick\\" with the first chapter, the unnecessary repetition, a lapse in journalistic responsibility, some dated material, and some needless repetition, I give Gideon Spies just three stars."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This is the easiest book on the subject of Israel's intelligence apparatus to read.

Using half-truths and innuendos, Thomas creates an extremely sophisticated and authoritative platform in order to illustrate and expound upon classic &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot; themes as undeniable fact. For instance, the notion of an extensive network of what Thomas refers to as &quot;sayanim&quot; or &quot;Jewish collaborator&quot; plays on the fear and belief that secretly all Jews conspire around the world to gain the upper hand on gentiles. Thomas presents the case in no uncertain terms that Jews of all nationality secretly feel that their commitment to Israel is stronger than that of their own country (and thus should not be trusted). The book was a sad and misleading account based primarily upon fiction and the fading stories of a few Ex-Mossad employees that somehow seem to have access to every mission the intelligence agency was conducting within its 50 years.For me, the opening chapters where enough to draw quite a bit of suspicion after recognizing that the majority of &quot;compliments&quot; Thomas made about the Mossad where generally &quot;back-handed&quot; and snide. From there the book degenerated into an all out assault on the &quot;ruthless&quot; Mossad as if viciously wages an unjust/immoral war on Palestinian &quot;revolutionaries.&quot; Bottom line, save your money!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Come off it please! Do you really think that national spy agencies would be stupid enough to reveal the way they work? This could be adapted for a movie, but, seriously, with rare documentation, how much of it is true?"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"A very interesting book but I found that it was poorly structured. How much of it is true? Don't know. That's the problem with these kinds of books."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This book was painfully difficult to finish simply because it was clear to me that the material provided was highly sensationalized, over-reaching, inaccurate, and just flat out incorrect. The book kept my attention for the first part where Mossad had been involved with assassinations in the Middle East- I believe there is truth to what the author reports here. However, as the book enters the 1980's, it is full of \\"hype\\" and sensationalism that one can smell a mile away, i.e., the trap door on the PROMIS software was created by the NSA not Mossad and was sold to foreign governments so that the US could spy on them. Secondly, Mossad has a long history of established contacts with CSIS- long before 1992- to say that the Israelis established with them in 1992 is definitely deceiving. Thirdly, the Israelis have sold arms to most countries especially China even after ignoring protests from the US government- thanks to its lobby in Washington, AIPAC. So the author saying that the Israelis gave up arms sales to foreign countries because of US protest is absolute nonsense! Fourthly, Israel is just as guilty for the conflict with the Palestinians- something the author does not take into consideration. Instead, he labels the Palestinians as terrorists, suicide bombers, and threats to Israel. Meanwhile, a lot more Palestinians are killed every year than Israelis- yet, the Israelis are mere victims in the view of the author. What about the innocent Palestinians? Finally, I have a hard time believing that Osama Bin Laden has close relationships with the Chinese given that they are now a secular consumerist society- something which Bin Laden is against. Yet, according to the book, he visited Beijing in 2005?! That is just too bizarre.Though the Middle East is a complicated place, I do not think that everything is about the destruction of Israel. Other countries have hostile relationships with one another, i.e., Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Saudis view the increased power of the Iranians as a threat. Hence, the reason for their increased ambition for nuclear technology. It is definitely not about Israel. In fact, more occasions than not, the Saudis have invited friendly relations with the Israelis. The author creates an impression that every Middle East country is calling for the destruction of Israel- which is simply not true. As for the Iranian president saying \\"wiping Israel off the face of the world map\\" is debatable given that many sources on internet are saying that the interpretion was incorrect.But the harshest criticism I have for this book is the alleged Mossad support for critics against the Iraq War. It has been reported that the alleged evidence against Sadam Hussein was indeed planted by Mossad- the very thing that the author writes to the contrary. To suggest that Mossad had no involvement for the drumbeat to war is , in my opinion, absurd. I guess the money that AIPAC pumped into the current administration had nothing to do with the US going into Iraq either and Col. Lawrence Wilkerson's statement to that fact. One has to be really naive to believe that Israel or Mossad did not support the push for war.I have to say I am deeply disappointed in this book. I thought it would be more than it really is. In my opinion, this borders on the fictional spy thriller that cannot be taken seriously. If you are into mainstream press and propaganda, this is the book for you. But if you are one who believes in critical thought and factual information, look elsewhere because this book does not have it. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"For the most part this is an excellent book about Israeli intelligence in General and in particular the Mossad.It shows the agressive and highly secrative war Israel has fought against terrorist networks like Hezbollah, Black September, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the PLO. It also shows how effective Mossad has been in hunting down and assassinating specific terrorists like the Red Prince, and the Engineer. It also however shows some of the highly misguided and in some cases imoral actions by some of the more ignorant Mossad leaders. Most agregious are the actions of Mossad cheif Rafi Eitan, who illegally used the Mossas to track members of the IRA in Spain, at behest of the British MI6. Apparently Eitan had forgotten (or didn't care) that Britian had once oppressed Jews in Palestine the same way they have oppressed Catholics in Ireland.The Author correctly points out that Eitan was foolish to use Mossad to work against a group that is no different then the brave fighters of the Jewish Irgun. He also points out that the Mossad team was smart enough not to confront the IRA members, since it would have almost certainly led to the Mossad members deaths. Other then that incident, and a few other embarrasing incidents like the illegal gathering on intelligence about the relationship between Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinto (An act apparently approved by Benjamin Netanyahu) The book shows the mostly excellent professionalisim of Mossad. This is a well written and informative book on one of the world's most successful spy agencies."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Gideon's Spies is packed full of exhilarating and outlandish tales of the Mossad's exploits.

Mr Thomas has a terrible tendancy of starting stories showing operatives in the present (which is totally uninteresting) then flashing back to the past. Often the flashbacks never revert to the present, or have another flashback within a flashback.I am no expert on Israeli intelligence activities, but when an author falsly reports a simple fact \\"Israel has developed its own over-the-horizon accuracy for three German-build nuclear-powered submarines it had bought\\" (Germany doesn't have nuclear powered submarines, and Israel certainly doesn't have them) I begin to question his more controvertial theories and \\"facts.\\""},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"While reading this book I found that I was rolling my eyes every page. The author rambles on relating tidbits of information that don't seem to fit together at all and are, at best, poorly organized with no discernable order (chronological, by topic, context, etc). I have no way of verifying the authenticity of most of the information (it is after all a book on secret intelligence), but I know that some of the stories are so inconsistent as to make all the information in the book suspect."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I started to read this book with great interest. It is generally well written. Stories and facts come up that I had not seen in other similar books. However gradually I became concerned about the inclusion of information that seemed strange, inaccurate or worse without any explanation about the truthfulness of that information.Allegations on Edmond Safra, supposed assassination of Robert Maxwell by the Mossad, and many other similar allegations appear in the book without any explanation or justification.I stopped reading the book about two thirds into it, as I had just lost confidence in the author. I don't know what motivations that author had to turn a perfectly interesting topic with lots of potentially controversial events into a mixture of facts and opinionated fiction.

It contains everything from how it taped the conversations of Monica Lewinski and Bill Clinton to how they captured Adolf Eichmann and to how they took out missiles just seconds before they were to be detonated and shoot down the plane of Golda Meier when she flew to Rome. Nothing seems to be hidden from the Mossad. Do you want to know who hired Ali Agca to kill John Paul II? Read the book. It tells all."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"What I found most interesting in this book is the reach of the Mossad. Because Jews can be found in most of the countries of the world, the Mossad has friends in place who can assist Mossad's agents. No other intelligence service in the world has this sort of assistance. And it is because Jews are bound by something more than nationalism. Their bond trancends loyalty to country, and it is even more so since the Holocaust. In part it is survival in a hostile world."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"You may be able to put down Gideon's Spies and spread your reading over several days, but I couldn't.

Do you want to know what really happened and not what the biased and uninformed media put out? Your view of the world and especially the intelligence services will never be the same.

It's not dry, but rather makes you feel like you are part of the story. Sometimes you forget that this is not a work of fiction! The author was able to talk to many director-generals and Mossad agents that he writes about, and it shows through his writing. The book starts at the creation of what is now Mossad and talks about many events through the hunt for Osama Bin Laden (but stops before his capture). The book includes a dictionary of intelligence agency names, names for particular jobs/departments within Mossad, and a list of the director-generals of Mossad in case you need it while reading, but the author frequently adds a small definition of terms not used very frequently within the text itself so that you don't *have* to flip back and forth."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Very insightful, and lots of details about world events that I was completely unaware that Israel has been so completely involved. It is very much like a James Bond novel only it is not fiction."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"There is more intrigue, espionage, double crossing, plot construction and cold blooded killing in this factual account of the Israeli Intelligence service, Mossad than you will find in any work of fiction.The book races at a million miles an hour across the landscape of the vibrant and fascinating Middle East weaving pictures of the operations in which Mossad played everything from star to minor support act. The Author, Gordon Thomas gives us the facts of the missions, the historical and geographical context and, for added interest, paints his characters in as much detail as a novelist.I never knew that Condolezza Rice spent $500 a pop on her hair styling!Covering various war activities, the Munich Olympics massacre, the Vatican and its links with various spy organisations around the world:\\"By 1952, the Rome station of what was now the CIA was being run by another devout Catholic, William Colby ... Colby had established a powerful network of informers within the Secretariat of State and every Vatican congregation and tribunal. He used them to help the CIA fight Soviet espionage and subversion across the globe. Priests regularly reported to the Vatican what was happening. ... the pope saw the violence as necessary and shared the view that if the United States did not perform what he once called \\"sad, but necessary actions\\", the world would have to endure decades of further suffering.\\"Rupert Murdoch's political agenda and his untimely death, an analysis of Saddam Hussein, the current suspected Iranian nuclear capability, Israel's nuclear capability and much, much, MUCH more. Even Princess Diana's fatal car crash gets a mention.James Bond eat your heart out ... here are some of the toys that Mossad gets to play with ... for real ....\\"Known as an \\"infinity device\\", it could hack into any cell phone making it activate itself without triggering its display light. Another gadget known as \\"keystroke\\" was designed to be inserted into a target computer to download everything stored on its hard drive. This had been tested out on a dating agency in Madrid. Yet another device code-named \\"Tempest\\" was designed to scan all the computers in a building to discover the level of electronic protection each one had.Undoubtedly the greatest triumph had been creating a surveillance device known as \\"Smart Dust\\". These were ant-sized sensors that could be scattered in hostile territory - hidden in dust, grass or soil - and their microdot microphones would pick up data which would then be automatically transmitted to Mossad headquarters. The life of a sensor was a month before they would self-destruct.\\"I learned how on the one hand a country could be your friend, and on the other hand it would work against you. How the various intelligence organisations are in each other's pockets and can work together on common causes, and in the next breath against each other. How one country could supply another with nuclear resource and how that country could on-sell those goods to the enemies of the supplier.The book is a masterpiece of complex interrelationships and detail.Gordon Thomas is an investigative journalist who has reported stories involving the Mossad for more than a generation. In his own words:\\"I have had access at a sufficiently high level within the Israeli intelligence community to have made this an authoritative account ... I came to the subject of Mossad with no baggage. I have used information its members provided in the way any writer does when dealing with an intelligence service: checked it, checked it, checked it.\\"It is not a book for the faint hearted, I found that the sheer enormity of information packed into each sentence required a bite-sized chunk approach. It took a while to get used to Gordon's style of starting a storyline, then filling in the background stories before finishing the original story. There were a lot of acronyms, but they were well explained and referenced.Some more knowledgeable reviewers believe there are anomalies in the information presented, but given there are too many facts for the less well informed to take in, by taking the broad brush strokes of the content, Gideon's spies will enhance your understanding of the Middle Eastern political picture and recent history. It is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Books about the history and activities of espionage organizations (both gathering intelligence and covert operation) are by nature subject to be taken with a grain of salt, since the nature of the business is secrecy.Gordon Thomas does a good job unveiling that secrecy through his various sources, some named, some not, some within the Mossad organization itself, and many from without. He explicitly names these sources on an \\"acknowledgment page,\\" citing his sources within Israel and Elsewhere. One can only judge the credibility of the information by comparing it to other accounts of the same operations, and asking oneself if it is believable based upon consistency with factual events.Thomas pulls no punches in portraying the Mossad as arguably the most effective intelligence service in the world. He reveals their various tactics including psychological warfare, their legendary human intelligence capabilities, their worldwide presence (Thomas claims the Mossad has a mole in the White House, which the FBI has been searching for for years), and their covert assassination teams (known as kidons), and their ruthlessness in getting the job done in the defense of the StateThomas excels at this, especially with this new, updated 2007 edition that covers the role Mossad plays and continues to play in the Iraq War, and probably an upcoming pre-emptive war with Israel's arch foe, Iran. He reveals tidbits of information, such as the unconfirmed \\"fact\\" that Israel possesses three nuclear missile armed submarines, currently in the Persian Gulf, off the coast of Iran, completing its triad of nuclear umbrella cover. This, as an example, is something that Israel would probably never really officially confirm or deny. But it passes the \\"does it make sense?\\" test with flying colors. Israel's land based nuclear facilities at Dimona (in the Negev Desert) is probably the worst kept military \\"secret\\" in the world.\\" Nuclear payloads can be delivered by missile, aircraft, or seaborne vessels. Bombing Iran by air would not be practical due to the long ranges involved, so it does indeed make sense that it would need a third, seaborne leg of its nuclear capabilities.Other accounts conflict to varying degrees with other sources. Since covert agents routinely use aliases, this is not unexpected; however, Thomas identifies the famous \\"man who captured Eichman\\" as the long term Israeli spymaster Rafi Eitan. Others, including Peter (Zvi) Malkin wrote a book on the subject some years ago, in which he takes credit for making the first physical contact with Eichman on that audacious mission in 1960.There are several useful resources included in the book, including a comprehensive index, a list of the Directors-General of Mossad, along with their years of service from 1951 through the present, a general glossary, and an additional brief glossary of Arabic terms, and of course a bibliography and acknowledgment of sources and credits.My only criticism is that the time line of events recounted is not linear, sometimes making it difficult to follow. But the more you know about Israeli history, the easier it is to overcome this. Also, the sheer length of the book (587 pages, not including addenda), makes for a long, but fascinating read. The newly released 2007 version of this came out just in time - a lot has happened since the original version.This book should appeal to anyone interested in Israeli defense, politics, and especially espionage. Highly recommended for serious students of Israel.."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I thought this book was great in most ways. The Mossad is presented as an agency that will do anything to save Israel, to the point of assassination and framing their own agents. I have one major quibble though: his organization of the case histories/biographies/modern Israeli history was so annoying I wanted to tear my hair out by the end of the book. For example, a priest at Robert Maxwell's funeral leads to a shadowy meeting in the Vatican which goes to a flashback to Golda Meir meeting Paul VI to a flashback of James Jesus Angleton &amp; Pius XII. A flashback to a flashback to a flashback?!?! And he starts the book with the Princess Diana tragedy, hinting more than a little it wasn't just a car crash. Apparently a Mossad agent was attempting to enlish Henri Paul around the time of her death. But after she dies, the Mossad is barely mentioned for 30 pages except that they probably know something about it. I know he's an English journalist and the Diana death makes juicy copy, but why don't we start a book on the history of the Mossad with SOMETHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE MOSSAD?!?! So, I give Gideon's Spies 5 stars on content but a half a star on organization."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"If only half of what Thomas divulges in this book is true, it's a blockbuster. And I would speculate that perhaps half has the ring of truth- but which half? Probably just the well-documented parts used to give a veneer of truth to the fabricated bits. Amid all the stories of the deceptions and intelligence games played by the world's secret services, it's tempting to suspect that Thomas is being played as much as any of the other dupes he tells of. Did Khomeni order the assassination of John Paul? Did the Mossad kill Robert Maxwell? Who knows?The tales Thomas tells are often very critical of the Mossad, yet running through the book is the implication that the Mossad is the only competant intelligence organization on the planet, and that all other intelligence organizations are staffed with bumbling fools.The book seesm to give the impression is that Thomas' principle source of information is one or more retired or discharged Mossad officers who have both a pride in the organization as well as an axe or two to grind, but the reader begins to doubt that at least halfway through the book. Many of the stories just don't add up. Some, like the story of Gerald Bull, are absolutely at odds with versions told by well-established sources and thoroughly documented. The Bull story in particular reads like a sloppy farbication by someone who hasn't done a lot of research.Most of it is completely unverifiable, and a great deal of it strikes me as completely fabricated. And maybe, just maybe, the book is a piece of disinformation itself, designed to mislead and confuse. Who knows? File it on your bookshelves somewhere midway between Le Carre and Fleming."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I love reading spy novels. This book fits right into that genre--however it is not intended to be a novel. I have always found it difficult to swallow any title that states that it's the &quot;Secret History...&quot; of anything. If it was so secret how on earth did a hack British reporter (reknown worldwide for their sensationalistic style) get the inside scoop on it?This book reminds me a lot of &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; a &quot;secret history&quot; about NSA. Compared to the CIA or MI6, both NSA and MOSSAD have virtually nothing of substance in the way of reference books. Most of the facts are based upon specualtion, innuendo and heresay. The authors in both books is probably gathering TONS of information from every source. But, since he can't publish all of it, he must filter it to create a story. But how? He is not an agent. He has never worked in the intelligence field and does not really have the background to choose what is fact or fiction--in the intell world it si sometimes blurred. So the auther instead falls back on what he DOES know. Which is writing stories.This book IS an incredably good story. As good as any Tom Clancy novel, and it even jumps around (Clancy-style) a lot just as it is getting intriguing. But, since this book is intended as a resource of non-fiction, what does the author give the reader to gain credibility? Answer: A 5 page &quot;Note on Sources&quot; which only elaborates on a few people he interviewed, but never cross-referencing with the stories within the chapters. There is an index, but so what? In some places Mr. Thomas also insinuates that he attended several of the events as a reporter, but never says who he talked to, about what subject. No doubt he had is tape-recorder running, but one never knows whether something was on or off the record. I would also think that since he makes reference to some books and newspapers, that he would document those, but alas!As I was reading this book, I could almost hear Geraldo Rivera in my head narrating it. (note to publisher: get Geraldo to narrate the audio book. You'll sell millions.) Both the author and Geraldo share an emphasis of the sensational and exaggeration. They never worry about sources, because they are journalists by habit and not historians. They have no need to be accountable, just in making sure they get credit for the story. Unfortunately, since this book is so compelling (which is why I at least gave it 3 stars), but lacks so much in the way of documentation, it could have been THE subject matter on Israeli intelligence. Instead it will be a popular read for a short time and wind up in the bargain bin in a few months."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This book is great fun, bursting with supposed revelations about things we thought we'd already heard the definitive revelations about. Most of them come from former Mossad men who make all sorts of claims - that the Mossad killed Yitzhak Rabin, that Israel benefitted more than one might expect from Kennedy's assassination, that Princess Di's driver was about to become a Mossad informer. Some of Israel's most famous spy exploits, like Entebbe, the Eichmann kidnapping and the theft of a Mig from Iraq, are given a new slant suggesting that all previous accounts are incomplete and misleading. But I do wonder... considering the book talks a lot about the Mossad's misinformation department, which spends its time planting stories to mislead the public about Mossad activities, and considering that the author talked to a lot of Mossad people... aren't these new stories merely the Mossad's current version of reality, designed to obscure an even more bizarre series of truths? I hope so, it makes it all so much more fun. A great read for some insight about how the spy trade works, but take the precise details with a pillar of salt."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Of the all the books I have read on the Israeli intelligence services this one is by far the worst. Where to begin, lets start with the writing, its bad. The author has a tendency to start making a point and then meandering off for two pages before returning to his original point, its hard to believe this guy writes for a living. Lets turn to content, how do you write a CREDIBLE non-fiction book without footnotes? None of the events described in this book are sourced, except for the author's vague assurances that they were based on his extensive interviews. Give me a break! Any first year college student would get an F if he/she submitted a paper sourced like this book is. The book's cause is not helped by the fact that known fabricators such as Arie Ben-Menashe are quoted at length. The fables Ben-Menashe spins are presented as fact in this book, for sure that spells trouble. The most egregious error in this book, though, comes about when the author describes the 1972 take-over of the Israeli embassy in Bangkok. The reader is treated to an account where Israeli leaders agonize over their options thinking back to the Raid on Entebbe as one possible solution that is ultimately disregarded. Of course the raid on Entebbe took place in 1976 FOUR YEARS IN THE FUTURE. The Israelis are good, but time travel, please. What this means is the events the author described were made-up, FICTIONAlIZED, as is much of the rest of this book. In short this book is JUNK, there is no way for the serious reader to discern what is factual from what is fiction. Much better books on the topic have been written, Every Spy a Prince by Raaviv and Melmen and Israel's Secret Wars by Black to name two. If you must read Gideon's Spies go to the library, dont waste your money on this dog!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Initially captivating and hard to put down, it then deteriorates after the first one or two hundreds pages.Disappointing to realize that ALL the book has appeared in one form or another in the news.There are numerous errors and plenty of wild guesses as well. Repetitive bloviating especially in the last third.Most annoying is the obsession with Princess Diana's death. What has that tragic event anything to do with the famous \\"Institute\\" ? Why so many pages about it ? In order to appeal to the British readers ?If you are not familiar with Israel in general or with the mythical Mossad and its prolific activities specifically - then YES - absolutely, you must read it and you'll most probably like it. But if you do know about Israel and a bit of the history, politics, wars, and espionage that is an integral part of the Israelis' lives - then you can skip it."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This is a fascinating book. Not being especially well read in history my estimation of this book is based on an interest in intelligence operations. Names I've heard all my life, Rafi Eitan, Ben-Menashe, Yitzhak Rabin, Bibi Netanyahu, Shimon Peres, Menachem Begin, have more contextual association. The methods and rationale for Mossad operations, relationships to other intelligence organizations, the shocking betrayal of the US born Jonathan Pollard, this and more makes for a gripping read. Being a long-time Israel sympathizer I appreciate the opportunity to better place actions in a political and historical context. Survival has meant swift and unequivocating response. Reading about the agency's ever-compounding history of violence and brutality brings about self-reflection into my own impulses towards the revenge motif."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Mr. Gordon makes many shocking claims in this book. The Mossad supposedly knew that a truck bomb was going to be used against the marines in Lebanon, but didn't tell them. The Israeli Prime Minister (Shamir) supposedly gave Pollard's spy material to the Russians because he hated America. The Mossad supposedly didn't lift a finger to save William Buckley, who was tortured and killed in Lebanon. The famous Mr. Maxwell, who looted his employee's pension funds, supposedly gave those funds to the Mossad. I admit, I don't want to believe this stuff, but if the evidence was better, I would swallow hard and believe it. Its not enough to rely on an occassional disaffected spy like Ostrovsky. Lots of allegations in this book could be true, but on the other hand, they could be false."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I can only second the opinions of a couple of the other reviewers. This book is an utter waste of time. It merely serves to confuse a subject already shrouded in mystery.The book lacks footnotes. It is poorly organized. The disjointed storied are arranged neither chronologically nor thematically.If you are looking to learn more about Israel's intelligence community, a far better place to start would be &quot;Every Spy A Prince&quot;."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Lots of interesting facts about the Mossad. The author has done a good deal of research prior to writing the book."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"If you want espionage fiction, by all means buy this book. If you want a history of the Israeli secret services, then buy something else. Princess Diana? Oh please. Why on earth would Mossad want to bother with Princess Diana, unless her boyfriend Dodi was secretly in Al Quaeda? Yet this is how the book begins, as if the accident in a Paris tunnel involving the divorced and unhappy Princess, a drunken driver, and a rich Arab playboy was somehow connected to one of the world's great intelligence agencies that frankly has far more important things to worry about.There are several excellent books about Mossad, but all serious books about the institute must be thoroughly vetted before publication. So you're not likely to find out anything that is kept secret. Still, even newspaper articles about the institute are interesting, mainly because the Israelis are audacious and inventive in their operations. So of course anything about Mossad is tantalizing to espionage writers, and equally, Israel does nothing to squelch the mystique that has grown up around the organization.But it's important to remember that Israel is a small country without the resources of even France or the UK. And Israeli agents are as human as everyone else. Mistakes are made, along with errors in judgment. The amazing thing about Israel is that it manages to do so much with so much less than larger nations, and there's no question that when it comes to \\"humint,\\" Israel leads the pack.But back to the book-- it's a lot of sensationalism and there are better books out there on this subject that do not ludicrously include Princess Diana's death or somehow try to connect dots that never existed in the first place. And as other reviewers have noted, the book skips around all over the place. I can't recommend it to serious students of the world's intelligence agencies because some of it is clearly invented by the author, and he makes guesses and tries to form connections that end up being wildly inaccurate."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Combine equal parts of Frederick Forsyth, Alex Berenson, David Hagberg, Daniel Silva and Brad Thor...and you still haven't quite matched the creativity or cajones of the Mossad.

Only wish the author could have included pictures of the key players as well as a flow chart showing all individuals involved in a given incident."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Must Read! This will change your view of the world. This book makes you fully appreciate the scope of warfare being conducted in the Middle East and the length Isreal will go to insure its sovereignty. The book is fully engrossing and don't worry about the length, you'll wish it was longer by the time you're done. This account is also personalized with reflections by former Mossad members which include graphic accounts of their \\"wet works\\". The only downside is that the sheer scope of killings can get to you a bit. Every American, whatever your personal or political stance, should read this book."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Interesting read, especially PM Bibi Netanyhu and his wife Saragets a lot of grief.As always it's hard to check if the stories are the full truth,but I definitly buy most of them (Apo being caught with help ofMossad)..."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Thomas has produced an engaging literary work of incredible historical value regarding Israel's notorious intelligence agency--historical value that increased following the September 11, 2001 tragedy. In an effort to be more entertaining, Thomas attempts to novelize the historical legacy of the famous Mossad organization. But this literary style is a bit overdone and quite unnecessary: the historical facts by themselves are relentlessly fascinating, yet unsettling.Why unsettling? Because the amount of energy, intensity, and cunning--no matter how unethical--that the Mossad has put into preserving the life of Jewish Israel and keeping Muslim nations at bay is shocking. It seems that there has rarely been a dull moment within the Mossad organization.Thomas' diligence in his research efforts is first rate. His quest was not limited to just uncovering historical facts; he also captured the character essence of some of the former Mossad players covered in the book.Whether you are an espionage buff, a student of cultural studies, a political analyst, a religious studies academic, or just plain curious, this book will not fail to intrigue you."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I felt as if Mr. Gordon was trying to tell about the mossad using a style that consists of hiddem messages.

The secret world of international spies and their activities opens up an entirely new universe of world wide governmental relationships, intrigues and machinations that changed history in many countries in many ways. Assassinations, failed plots and real life characters holds the reader in page-turning suspense. The existence of these subcultures in their mysterious underworlds is a real eye opener.

Gordon Thomas painstakingly proves how the system works, and you need to know."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I thought this would be an informative book on various missions of the Israeli Mossad. I became suspicious when I saw listed on his acknowledgments page the contact name Barry Chamish. Barry is well known for his \\"creative\\" conspiracy theories. And for writing about UFO sightings in Israel.My suspicious became confirmed as I read the book and realized that most of his theories and speculations are in fact mainly based on talks with Ari Ben-Menashe. Time Magazine published a story about Ben-Menashe, calling him a \\"spinner of tangled yarns.\\" ABC News put him through a lie-detector test, which concluded that, on a scale of reliability from zero to minus eight \\"on every major question Menashe was recorded either minus eight or minus seven ...\\" (from Wikipedia)The book has the potential for being a great read - it's well written, with lots of facts. But it is so unreliable, so full of illogical speculations, that in the end I just chucked the book in the trash. I like fiction, but not when it is posing as non-fiction."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"The story line is fragmented...oh what am i saying,there is no story line. It appears that this book, is more of a collection of tabloid stories. The information sources do not appear credible. There is a tendency to blame this intelligence service for number of assassinations and military blunders, without justification. Poorly written,waste of paper"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"At first I was very intrigued by the book. Although the author does not cite sources, I still found it entertaining and at least plausible. Then it just started to get plain silly. The final straws were when the author writes of an Israeli helicopter that uses \\"silent mode\\" to enter enemy territory. As a helicopter pilot, I can assure you that is laughable, and I could no longer take the book seriously after that. A few pages later he references Pope Air Force Base in Georgia. A simple internet search would show you that Pope Air Force Base is not located in Georgia, but North Carolina. These are just a few of the numerous silly and down right wrong \\"facts\\" in this book. Move on to something better."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"THis interesting fast paced spy thriller tells the 'inside' story of Mossad, but with many glaring oversights. Fir instance the Lavon affir is not mentioned and neither is Elie Cohen, the Israeli spy who was Asads left hand man. Also their are several odd misfactuals. For instance we are told that one mossad agent grew 'curly' side locks to imitate an Orthodox Haredi in a few 'weeks'. This is pure nonsense, becuase Paellas, the sidelocks take years to grow. Nevertheless this is a wonderful book that reads like a 007 thriller, a must read for Mossad enthusiasts.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"At the end of the book, under &quot;Notes on Sources,&quot; the author tells us that his guiding principle in dealing with an intelligence matters has always been: &quot;check it, check it, check it.&quot; Well, I can testify that much, too much, of the even the PUBLIC information in this book was never checked, not even properly copyedited. There are too many errors in the Hebrew transcriptions of names (Yahalomim, not yahalomin), sites ( Glilot, not Gilot). Some of the dates, all are in the public domain, are erroneous (about Vanunu, for example).If there are that many erros, mistakes and other manifestations of sloppiness about matters of fact and language, all in the public domain, what can we say about the so many amazing claims in the book which cannnot be verified by evidence from the public domain (e.g., The Mossad was taping the phone sex between Lewinsky and clinton, the details of the relationship between Maxwell and the Mossad) None of these fantastic claims is substantiated by anything stronger than the author's word? But why should we accept his word? Then there are simply too many questionable citations some of them attributed to people who obviously never talked to the author (e.g., Abe Feinberg).And then there is the autohor's tendency to glorify the individuals who apparently did talk with him. The most obvious example is the character of Rafi Eitan, a bigger than life character in the book, whose mythical tales seem to leave the author virtually intoxicated.At the end, the book is no more than a collection of grandmother's tales (in yiddish, &quot;bobbemayses&quot;)."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"There is a great deal of very interesting material here but it is so poorly written it made me want to throw it away several times. Potentially great stories about fascinating people all get a hit-and-run treatment, like a Cliff Notes version of the REAL book that wasn't written. Also, having read a number of older books on the subject, there is a fair amount of 'direct borrowing' evident. For better reading, try finding an old copy of Eisenberg's \\"The Mossad: Inside Stories.\\""},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"I picked this book up in an airport during a layover and couldn't put it down. Thomas makes some fascinating claims, many of which may very well be true. If you are a closet conspiracy theorist, this is a good book for you. If you always wondered what it would be like if the CIA were tougher, dirtier, and sexier, then look no further. Thomas is both amazed by and critical of the Mossad, which is perhaps the best angle of approach in an undertaking such as this. In the end, it all seems too perfect, which leads me to believe that at least some of what is said actually happened. It is a very good read. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"First, I agree with others that the author begins a thread and then drifts off topic. He also repeats himself to the extent that he could have deducted a hundred pages from this rambling book.The author credits the North Koreans with having SSN-6 nuclear submarines. No, they have diesel submarines. They have SSN-6 missiles. Later he credits the Israeli navy of having nuclear submarines---again, wrong. They have diesel submarines built by Germany. How many other errors are contained here? I, for one, do not believe any real Mossad insider or ex employe would give this author the time of day. I will look elsewhere for information on Mossad"},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"This is a well written and entertaining view inside of what has always been seen as the supreme espionage agency in the world.

Lots of fascinating and entertaining stuff, no question, but Gordon Thomas is a myth-maker, so accuracy takes a back seat to speculation and romanticized conspiracy theorizing at every turn. If the guy can't get something simple like Sayaret Matkal right (Sayanet Maktal?!), as one of numerous examples, he's also just plain careless. The update doesn't really add a whole lot of new information. I'd recommend The Volunteer by Michael Ross -- a Mossad officer talks about the real-life functioning and actions of ha'misrad in the 1990's and the relationship with our CIA -- along with The Mossad, and Israel's Secret Wars."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"If you admire the secret forces of the world's governments, then you ought to read this book and you'll find a new admiration towards the Israelies.The book is a series of stories that act as well planned adventures and it tells you the way the Mossad operates.

Author doesn't miss a chance to malign the Mossad while painting known terrorists and \\"family men\\" and men of cause in addition to their terrorist work.

Surely there are better works on the subject."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Gordon Thomas's \\" Gideon's Spies : The Secret History of the Mossad \\" is a must read for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of Israel's intelligence service agency Mossad, and its working. I found the details and engrossing descriptions of the events to be extremely enlightening. Mossad, (formed in 1949 by the then prime minister of Israel - David Ben-Gurion) proved that it could go to any length in saving the interests of Israel. Events described in this book go from killing of Princess Dianna to attempted assassination of Pope. Because the events described in the book are from all over the globe, sometimes it makes you think that the book has nothing to do with Mossad. At the same time, those incidents are somewhere related (even remotely) with Mossad.That being said, this is a very readable book. It's not light reading, but once you start, make a pot of coffee because you won't want to put it down, not before finishing it.For me, this was a can't-put-it-down read."},{"Title":"Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad","review":"Most of the contents written in this book are probably true, but the people who the author claims are realy responsible for the attempt on the Popes life probably aren't.

This book should be reprinted with the Crichton name so it wil be easy to find for everybody."},{"Title":"Binary","review":"I like some of Michael Crichton's &quot;John Lange&quot; work better -- &quot;The Venom Business,&quot; for example -- but this was satisfying enough. I only wish I could find more of these now very out-of-print early novels."},{"Title":"Binary","review":"Less is not necessarily more. Binary is one of Michael Crichton's shorter novels, and its not at all bad, but it does feel a touch underdeveloped, rather like an adapted short story or a novelised television movie.It's a curious novel about a security agent, John Graves (aptly named for he has to save the day) and his protagonist the ingenious plotter John Wright. Graves is the man assigned to track Wright, who is regarded as suspicious and possibly subversive. It's played out against a 12-hour countdown to mass murder and with Wright's knowledge of Graves' psychological profile built in to his intentions.The word Binary is literally two chemical agents that produce a result together but it also represents the duel between the two men to \`out-puzzle' each other's actions and motives. Both are intelligent gamblers. Wright is rich and crazed; Graves is hamstrung by bureaucracy. It's a good read, but in the end, its brevity prevents any real depth to the characters when this is a psychological thriller. I wanted to know more about them. It's hard to think Crichton would write this without considerably more depth today. Frederick Forsythe would have made a lot more from the very good idea that forms the basis of the plot. The two writers have a lot in common.That said, it's hard to stop turning the pages. This is spare: no aimless diversions, existentialism or sub-plots. You just wish there had been more of it to bring the characters fully to life!It's worth adding this was written in 1972 and Crichton has always been one or two steps ahead of the game. The detail he routinely deploys to add credibility to his plotting is good, though not as detailed as many of his best efforts, and his vision of political terrorism remains ominous and unnerving."},{"Title":"Binary","review":"This is a great read. After exausting all of crichton's other books, finding one I haven't read was exhilarating.

Buy it just for the sake that your friends will think that you're cool.........Punk Rock!"},{"Title":"Binary","review":"Some of Crichton's early work is some of his best. This is a good example.

I wish these old, out-of-print novels would be re-released for the readers enjoyment. Binary is non-stop action, if you can't find the book, check out the movie, called PURSUIT, directed by none other than the auther himself, Michael Crichton.

The author who is most famous for the &quot;Green Knowe&quot; series lived during her lifetime in an ancient manor at Hemingford Grey, and devoted much of her life in restoring the house and grounds, which is now open for visitors. In this case, it is the house rather than the gardens that recieves the most attention, and though I have never been to Boston's home myself, the blurb tells me that several of the faces within the book are real items within the manor.Like almost all her books, Boston begins with the usual senario - a young boy (in this case Tom) is drawn to an old house lived in by an elderly woman. When he is sure she has left, he creeps in to explore (the moral implications of this aren't touched on, but the dream-like narrative compensates for this trespassing). Surrounded by disembodied voices and strange masks, Tom embarks on a series of strange adventures with several of the faces dotted around the house: a donkey's head made of straw, a Roman triton's bust, an Eastern goddess idol, and an Indian face. Each face magically transports him to another place and time, whether it be a jungle, an undersea city, or a temple in the desert, all of which are both magical and dangerous, till finally he is overly frightened, and leaves the house.Needless to say, it is a rather bizarre book, that comes across almost as a writing exercise or prose-poetry reading that was accidently published. Whatever the case, it is clearly a pet-project of Boston's, what with the features of her own house being brought to the page. Yet despite this there is something oddly fascinating about it. There is not much of a story, and Tom is hardly a well-developed character, but Boston's beautiful writing style makes this a hypnotic read - but perhaps not for children. Several of the adventures contain rather frightening imagery, including a tiger attacking a man, and a disembodied mackintosh chasing Tom - not to mention the fact that the story does not really have a beginning, middle or end: I predict children would be quite baffled at this.Instead, if you are an adult fan of Boston or a collector, then &quot;The Guardians of the House&quot; might interest you. I believe that it is the book that was closet to Boston's heart given the fact that artefacts from her own home feature in the story, and I don't find it hard to imagine that the entire book was a daydream of hers surrounding her house-hold faces and what they would do to protect her house if a Tom *did* actually intrude. Reading &quot;Guardians&quot; in that way, is a bit like wandering into someone else's dream: it's surreal, it's mysterious, it's oddly spiritual, and it's ultimately ingrossing. If you've ever fancied the idea of visiting Boston's home based on your readings of the &quot;Green Knowe&quot; books, then this is the book that will make up your mind.By the way, Peter Boston (Lucy's son) also illustrates &quot;Guardians&quot;, and I think they're the best I've seen (perhaps because he had the real faces to sketch?)"},{"Title":"Too Afraid to Live: Too Scared to Die","review":"They say that everything happens for a reason, and Paul Larsen is further proof of that. He has been to hell and back, and shares what he has learned from his experiences in this book. It's a fairly short read, yet powerful, as Mr. Larsen describes a life filled with addiction, substance abuse, compulsive behaviours, and depression. His ability to survive when all odds were against him is remarkable enough. And now he has taken that one step further by having the courage to talk about his life, and offer others in the same position the tools to begin their own recovery. The greatest teachers come from a place of much pain and suffering, and they've worked through the layers to reach a place where they can now help others to become free. Mr. Larsen believes everyone has gifts to offer the world, and he is clearly realizing his own."},{"Title":"The tiniest humans","review":"Both Doctor Liley and Lejeune have made discoveries among the greatest ever made in re The Tiniest Humans, Dr. Liley discovered that unborn humans could be treated like other patients, and did the pioneer work in developing the techniques of treating and observing unborn humans which are used today. For this, he was Knighted and given the title by other doctors of 'the Father of Fetology', which is the study of the fetus or unborn human. Dr. Lejeune discovered the cause of Mongolism and discovered that humans might have more than 46 chromosomes. Some regard him as the leading geneticist in the world. Both of these men have been given the highest honors by many nations.Liley and Lejeune came from opposites ends of the world to testify at the U.S. Senate hearings on abortion. They have also testified and been questioned by a New Zealand Royal Commision on Abortion. They have given numerous talks, and have written many articles for medical publications.

Each of its 27 chapters (nine units) contains both color and black and white illustrations, an outline, study exercises, suggested activities, and review exercises. The book contains 7 color maps. From the introduction: \\"The authors...have tried to provide a background which will help boys and girls understand their own country...through an appreciation of the ideals that have motivated individuals and nations.\\" It is a good supplement for a study of world history with younger children (early-mid elementary) though it is very slanted. For example, the authors compare the men of the Middle Ages and the men of the Renaissance by explaining that the latter forgot charity and justice, and became selfish and greedy. However, it is engaging, as it reads more like a story rather than dry text, and makes an easy review for adults too. It always helps to look behind us to see how we got here. Recommended for Catholic homeschooling families. My copy was published in 1955. It may be difficult to find a copy."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I laughed all the way through this book and could totally relate to her style of humor.

I'm 3/4 of the way through and it's smart and hysterically funny. We had a baby three years ago and no one has nailed the stress and insane social pressures put on new mothers (and fathers sometimes) like this book does.From surviving the crazy competitive Alpha Moms to the nut-job breast feeding evangelists (she calls them \\"The Tit Terrorists\\") the author identifies some of the lurking monsters that they never warn you about when you are about to have your first kid. I also love the edgy smart humor throughout that makes this read like a great HBO TV series. I wish someone had given this to my wife 3 years ago."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Yes it is possible to be a new parent and retain a sense of humor! This book is very funny and if, like me, you have spent months pre-and post-baby combing through dozens of parenting books, it really does feel like a breath of fresh air. Stephanie's approach is real and honest and her bottom line is, you do whatever works for you. You can't fit your baby into a prescribed role according to some parenting technique. Some things work some of the time, nothing works all of the time, you just do the best you can to make it through the day!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I thought a humorous parenting book with so many 5 star reviews must be pretty good!Wrong!I have two kids now and have read a LOT of this genre over the last 5 years and usually really enjoy it. To me, this books humor felt forced, slightly angry or aggressive, and clumsy. I think their might be merit to the idea that some of these reviews were seeded. I looked through several of the negative review's comments and they were mostly made by people who had never made any other comment or review before. That just seems suspicious to me.Bottom line, maybe people did enjoy this book- not everyone has the same tastes, but I for one did not find it funny. I saw it trying to be, but it never made me laugh once. I gave up half way through."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I want to give many kudos to Stefanie Wilder-Taylor for writing this book. Being a parent who spent the first 6 months of my son's life reading every book under the sun telling me what I'm doing right and wrong for my child, this book was a refreshing change. While I still continue to read Ferber and Weisbluth, this book will stay on my nightstand when I need a reality check that parenting can be fun (and funny!) when you let yourself relax a bit. An awesome read!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I read a lot of parenting books, and was hoping this book would be a light-hearted take on motherhood. I found it to be tasteless and not worth the time to read. For the most part it was full of over-used old cliches on parenthood. However, there were some things that were also offensive (joking about extreme postpartum depression)....save your money!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is so good I prayed for red lights so I could read more. I am not a mom so no kids were in the back. I still understood every story Stephanie experienced. Her comparisons are SO on the money and real zingers. She takes the pressure off the intense anxiety it must be to raise a shorty. My husband is reading it now because he heard me laughing so many times. Her genius translates into good solid advice \\"instinct.\\""},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book was funny and an easy read. The only thing that was really annoying is that any time the author used an italics there was no spacing between the words. Ane the author uses italics A LOT. I found it very annoying and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"this book was so funny and so true at the same time! I had a blast reading it.

It sounded interesting, so I got it. I read the whole thing in a few hours because I just couldn't put it down and am SO glad that I found it. I am now halfway through the second book and have officially made Stefanie Wilder-Taylor my new favorite author!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"this book really helped me to cope when I thought nothing else could help, it's insightful, yet totally hilarious!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is for any mom who needs a laugh about the trials of motherhood.The only thing I didn't like was some of the crude language, but all in all it kept me laughing and wondering how this lady got inside of my head!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"All I have to say is this book is worth the money. Well written and Hilarious! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I ordered a few books while I was on bed rest and this one proved to be my favorite. I appreciated the modern and fresh point of view, and found the book read like I was talking to a best friend. I can't wait to read more from her! It was so funny and made me laugh out loud, which can be hard when you've been laid up for 4 months. I just hope my brain can recall everything I read, especially the part about letting my baby sleep in his own bed."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I enjoyed the author's blog so much that I went out and got her book. Sad to say it was not as genuine, funny, touching, or engaging as her on-line writing. too bad!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I read Jenny McCarthy's books and excerpts from other \\"Mom Humor\\" books... but Stefanie Wilder-Taylor got it right. It may not be for everyone (don't give this book to a prude... Wilder-Taylor is crass and crude) but if you have a sense of humor like mine, you'll laugh out loud every few minutes. She even manages to slip in some decent advice... IE: take care of your nannies & babysitters since they are watching your BABY. Note that when I read Brooke Shields' \\"Down Came the Rain\\" (NOT a humor book), Shields complained about her 24-hour baby nurse requesting a piece of salmon to eat. I understand that Shields was depressed, but even when writing the book, she didn't catch how petty that sounded. Anyway, LOVED \\"Sippy Cups\\" and recommend it to new Moms who could use a laugh (don't we all?). You'll find that you relate a little too much (IE: going to the grocery store was a \\"big trip for the day\\" with my baby for the first few months!)"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I read 'em all. What to Expect, Babywise, Crazy Parenting Techniques for The Desperately Tired. And this was the only one that made sense to me! After reading all of the other books, I had this terrible feeling. I didn't know what I was doing!! But then I realized...so what?!?! Billions of moms before me managed to raise babies without so much as looking at a book. Some of them didn't even own ONE book, let alone a lame book with a title like, \\"My Kid Is Better Than Yours.\\" Please, if you've ever capped off a Monday of playing with your baby with a lemon drop martini (yes, my husband is home and no, my buzz hasn't worn off), buy this book. If you've ever laughed at yourself, this is the book for you. If you want to be told what to do, don't buy this book. Buy one written by your mother."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"All the things you think but wish you could say!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I loved this book and my copy arrived without any problems. This was such an enjoyable and easy to read book that gave me several much needed laugh out loud moments after having my first baby (now 5 mos old). It should not be taken seriously, however. I think many readers are offended by the slightly negative attitude towards breastfeeding in this book. I am successfully breastfeeding and still found it humorous and not offensive at all."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I got this book as a gift after I had my daughter and didn't even finish it, although it's a fast-read book because the tone was pretentious. I may have smirked once or twice, but it's definitely not the book you need as a new mom. If your a new mom trying to embrace your new role, and you don't happen to share the author's very specific philosophies, it comes across as just plain ANNOYING!!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Hilarious!! I should have read this book 3 years ago. The funny anecdotes would have been a welcomed during a very confusing time!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This was my favorite book of all pregnancy/mom books that I have, and I have many. It is so honest and makes yoo feel at ease for not being perfect all the time."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Her writing is so real & raw you feel as if you're sitting right next to her making fun of the \\"normal\\" mommies across the room. Although she is a little brazen on some of the sentimental moments some moms experience with having a baby, she does have a knack for making you laugh & enjoy the whole experience."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"At 7 months pregnant, (I'm now working on boy #2), everything that Stefanie writes about is very familiar. I've had to put the book down because I was laughing so hard that I was concerned I might have to change pants. My husband has laughed just as hard.This book isn't for everyone. If you're a hopeless romantic, this might not be the book you want. But, if you're a strong, modern woman with a sense of humor...don't pass this one up. (If you like Vicki Iovine's \\"Girlfriend's Guides\\" you'll love this one.)I'll be passing it on to my favorite girlfriends."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"The book was entertaining and gave great advice on how not to make yourself stick out like a sore thumb, being a new Mom!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I admit there were some parts that were funny, but overall, this book is pretty much worthless. First of all, it's alienating to moms who choose to make different choices than the author, such as making baby food yourself, or even buying organic! The funny thing is, she complains about women making their own baby food and then complains that baby food is \\"too expensive,\\" not even acknowledging that making your own is a fraction of the cost and is in fact the reason why most women opt to do just that.She can be witty at times, but most of the time she comes across as being harshly judgmental and defensive. A good friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, because she thought it \\"seemed funny\\" from the parts she read. I didn't tell her how much I hated it, but I really thought it was awful. And the references to celebrity gossip are totally annoying and shallow. On the upside, I guess it will make the book dated before too long."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Stefanie, thank you for this refreshingly candid and hilarious book! I don't have children yet, but I can definitely see myself returning to it again to help me navigate the maze of new parenthood. Reading this book is like listening to your funniest friend give you the real scoop on life after baby. So glad to have a heads-up on things I can expect when I become a mom. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"One of Hollywood's best comedy writers and performers shares her experience about being a new mom. If you're a new parent or know a new parent, this book is a MUST. When you read this book, you'll know you're not alone in babydom, that there is a very smart and extremely funny mom out there who wrote this just for you. Great to own and great for a gift."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"\\"Sippy Cups Are Not For Chardonnay\\" is a brilliantly funny survival guide that helps new mommies (and daddies) navigate the frustratingly arcane and often ridiculous \\"rules\\" of modern child-rearing. Readers will laugh out loud when they recognize the overly-indulgent parental arch-types, and cringe just a bit when it strikes too close to home. A must-have book for every couple that just sacrificed their vacation fund to decorate a nursery."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this book! I cried because I laughed so hard! I plan to give this book as gifts to my friends as we are all at that age now where we graduated college and are getting married and having babies! I have an 8 month old, and this book really brought some things into perspective. Stephanie is a great author and comedian and I hope she writes more books! I'm buying! I had this read in 2 days flat, even with a sick 8 month old on my hands! How's that for good reading!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I loved the book and I love how it focused on something other than the norm (pro breastfeeding). Breast if best but some people make people who can't breastfeed feel like they failed. And I'm sorry but that is not so! And I loved how she focused on that. She made the people who go with the flow feel like they are doing the right thing, instead of feeling like they failed."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Just in response to K. Plummer. It is easy for those of us who are able (albeit with much struggle and effort in my case) to accuse other women of being failures. Some people just can't do it. Due to necessary medication I took, I did have low milk supply and my daughter suffered because of my fear of judgmental people who would disapprove if I supplemented. I breastfed for over a year.Contrary to what some think, breastfeeding is not an insulator against all medical problems. I was breastfed. I have ADD. Kids who are breastfed still get colds and ear infections. Formula is obviously not as good as breastmilk, I don't think anyone would dispute that. However, as long as the brand chosen carefully (i.e. contains no corn syrup or franken-ingredients) MILLIONS of babies somehow grow up healthy and strong on it.Also, in over a year of breastfeeding my daughter did NOT ONCE fall asleep at the breast. You see, all babies, as all mothers, are individuals and one size does not always fit all. We should support each other in our parenting endeavors rather than find ways to consider ourselves superior."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Fast service, in great condition, this is the 2nd copy I have bought and across the board it has been a party pleaser and piece of conversation."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is fantastic! I am only 4 chapters in and I stopped to send it to my best friend so we can laugh together. Stefanie has the guts to put on paper the feelings we all have as mothers! And we all have them...I don't care who you are! We all need to take at least 10 minutes a night to read a chapter and realize that we're not alone and we're not crazy! I only hope there will be a sequel, I'm already looking forward to it!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I really this book would make me laugh, but it certainly did not.

It could have had better shock value for me to read this book before my daughter was two..."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"The title is catchy, and a lot of the anecdotes are funny, but overall I find this to be a rather dangerous book. I feel sorry for Stephanie Wilder-Taylor because of the mismanagement of breastfeeding, bonding, and new mama care following her baby's birth. Then, rather than get angry at the hospital for their lack of support, she writes a book to advocate for other parents to not breastfeed?I understand that some women need to supplement with formula or are unable to breastfeed at all. That doesn't make formula feeding \\"just as good\\" as breastfeeding."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I hate to see so many good reviews on a book as harmful as this one. It may seem like just a funny book to some, but new moms need all the support that they can get. This book encourages bad parenting, in my opinion. Sure, some things are tough at first (breastfeeding, for example), but being a mom isn't for sissies. You need to do what is best for your baby- not what is easiest. I think this book encourages the easy way out by making it seem ok."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Is it just me or is this woman an extreme alchoholic? There was rarely a page that went by that alchohol was not mentioned. That must be the REAL reason she didn't breastfeed. I found this book frightening because she wrote everything matter-of-fact and made anyone not like her sound stupid-people are going to read this book and believe it! I fell in love with my babies before they were born, I breastfed, I co-sleep, and yes, I'm going to homeschool. I normally like books like this but I'll takes Jenny McCarthy's book any day of the week- that's pee-in-your-pants humor. Sorry, no recommendations from me."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I must admit that I was drawn to this book by its low price - but after reading it I can say that it was well worth the money (I would have paid more). A great book for any first time mom. I must have looked like an idiot practically laughing out loud while reading it on the subway."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I love this book so much! I have been trying to balance one \\"technical\\" baby book with one \\"light-hearted\\" book. After \\"Belly Laughs\\" I didn't think I was going to be able to find any more \\"real\\" takes on pregnancy and child rearing. I am so glad that I saw Wilder-Taylor on the Today show talking about this book. I have girlfriends that aren't expecting and/or don't have children that are reading it merely because of the association that they have with everything in the book. I also have co-workers, male and female alike, ask for the latest on the book. In turn I usually end up reading the group and excerpt from what my husband and I read the night before and then rolls of laughter soon follow! Thank goodness for this great find!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Fortunately in Stephanie Wilder-Taylor's book it also makes you laugh out loud. This book is a must have for new parents who feel overwhelmed with the havoc wreaked by their new bundle of joy. Thank G-d there's a writer like Ms. Wilder-Taylor out there to make you feel a little less alone and laugh a little bit more during that disorienting first year of being a parent. A great gift for anyone, mostly yourself."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I have to say this book is an honest and hilarious look at being a new parent. The author writes in a style that makes you feel like you are having a conversation with a friend....a cool friend that isn't going to b.s. you about anything. It is not only a good read for someone who hasn't had a kid yet but it is also the most perfect gift to give to any expectant parents."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, parent or not, but those first time moms are in for a treat with this one! Stefanie is hands down the funniest writer I've come across, and this book is filled with the most accurate, honest and refreshing stories of motherhood ever told. Get this book and you will enjoy motherhood a thousand times more!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"From now on, I am going to insist that \\"Sippy Cups...\\" be mandatory reading for all of my new mother friends. Finally someone has vocalized what I've been feeling all along about the cult of mommy hood... that everyone has a degree in \\"I know what's best for your baby\\" but you. Stefanie Wilder-Taylor has done a hillarious job, breathing life to such baby milestones as his or her first trip to the doctor, sleep training, and your little one's first birthday. Seriously, this book is fantastic and I don't even need to have a baby in your life to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I had to put this one down before I finished it because I was so annoyed at the way the author continued to tell us she's all for anyone doing things differently than she, but then calling them bad names and insulting them for their choices. A hypocrit and a potty-mouth and I wouldn't keep her as a friend. It would be excusable if it made me laugh, but I didn't crack a smile the whole time."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I absolutely agree with the other \\"one star\\" reviews. Being a new mom, I thought I might find some comedic advice about being a new mother.I however, found nothing that I could relate to. I started the first chapter, and was appalled at the light-heartedness which she discussed having difficulty bonding with her baby. Don't get me wrong, there are some women who have this experience, and they should be nurtured. Bravo to her for admitting this and discussing it, however she absolutely was so judgemental about women who do bond and fall in love with their babies at first sight. She actually says of women who do immediately feel they fall in love with their baby \\"these women are either very lucky or lying or needy, and I don't trust them.\\" I didn't finish the chapter.The second chapter, again, very judgemental (and probably jealous) of women who breastfeed. The only helpful thing I saw in that chapter was her admitting that breastfeeding didn't work out for her because she didn't prepare by taking classes or researching breastfeeding. This is not the sort of literature we need out there for new moms. It is hard enough without us being tacky to/about each other. I am saddended that I supported the author by buying this book.Don't waste your precious time reading such negativity about motherhood!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I'm expecting my first child in June and found this book to be a great way to ease some tensions about my new mother worries."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"An unbelievably depressing and simplistic memoir of sorts by a woman who evidently finds her ineptitude as a mother hilarious, this book manages to make babies sound like a cross between cancer and the IRS. The constant references to drug use are sickening, and her aversion to natural processes disturbing. Note to the author: motherhood can be a blast, and not just because of the hormones."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"The author isn't nearly as funny as she thinks she is. There is nothing new or original in this book.

If you want to be a great mom--DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! Please check out the parenting books by Dr Sears or Our Babies, Ourselves by Meredith Small for good quality parenting advice and leave this book for your recycling!!!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"The truth is that I had higher expectations for this book considering the ratings that the book has gotten.Unfortunately,I was dissapointed. The writer is extremely informal.This was so distracting that I couldn't read any longer.I didn't think that she was funny I found her to be offensive and malinformed. Her writing style assumes that the reader is uneducated. Or a poor reader.There is a part on the book where she explains that not every woman bonds with her child immediately.And this is what happened to her.When she went to the doctor she was diagnosed with postpartum depression.But she never realized that the reason why she did not bond with the baby was because of the baby blues.New mommies when your baby is born there should be an immediate bond.It should only get stronger with time.I do not think that this is the best memoir out there for new moms."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is a HUGE step backward in the promotion of breastfeeding. Honestly, I don't even want to waste my time reviewing it, it was such swill. The author states that if you decide to breastfeed and have difficulty, do not call La Leche League. As a proud LLL member, I could not imagine life without them. LLL is for nursing mothers, whether they have problems or not. It is mother-to-mother support. What new mother wouldn't want to be supported?Instead of showing breastfeeding mother the other side of the spectrum, the author makes us stand proud and realize how clear it is that she, herself, was formula-fed and that's why she has no brain."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I truly enjoyed and relate to this book. Being a mother, although wonderful, is much more challenging than I ever imagined. Those who have left negative reviews need to respect that the author is sharing her experiences as a mother, from her perspective. Nowhere does she suggest that HER way of doing things is the \\"best\\" way, or the only way. In fact, I don't hear her advocating ANYTHING in this book other than being respectful and supportive of one another as mothers. She is making the all too important and often overlooked point that there are MANY different \\"good\\" ways of parenting, and we as mothers should respect one another's choices, discard competitive subtexts, and be supportive of one another. Refering to one another as \\"sissies\\" as a previous reviewer did and believing (or perceiving) that because you have had success with a particular parenting style or choice that you can make presumptions and judgments about another mother who is struggling or made a less \\"popular\\" choice in that area is both ignorant and overly simplistic, and is most likely indicative of one's own insecurities as a parent. I applaud Stefanie for her honesty and candor. I will be sharing this book with many friends."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"If you are a super-mom skip this book. If you are like the rest of us and struggling day-to-day this is a must read. I laughed out loud many times.

I too,will also include this as my new baby shower gift must haves!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I purchased this book as a baby shower gift for a new mom who was having her second child in 14 months.

I got a kick out of it when I read it the first time (at 3 months pregnant). Funny and up-beat, non-apologetic tone. Then I put it on the shelf with my other books on parenting/baby. My best friend just got pregnant and I thought that I would send her this book as well (she also has a great sense of humor and would 'get' this book. I was just going to send her my copy with a \\"keep or pass on\\" note. I thought I would re-read it before I sent it off. Well, I'm now getting my friend her own copy because this book is even more funny once your child has been through some of the milestones/experiences in the book. Now that my daughter is a bit older, I'm looking to get the toddler version as well. It's a quick read and good for a laugh. For those that slam it - it's not intended to be advice, just a light read to make you feel like someone else is in the trenches with you."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Not serious advice, people! But, y'know, apropo advice for the certain type of mom who maybe never felt she fit the standard American \\"mom\\" type.

I completely get Wilder-Taylor's love and devotion for her daughter (just like Lamott's for her Sam). They just know how to also be FUNNY!I wish I had both of these books when my boys were babies!I have been laughing out loud -- so much so that my husband hunts me down to make sure I'm okay. Bravo Stefanie Wilder-Taylor!You have offered A LOT of really practical, relevant, honest and thoughtful information here. AND YOU'RE FUNNY.I don't see that you're being judgmental at all. If anything, I'm getting over and over again that your bottom line is: there is no ONE way and we all find our own way in this new mom adventure. (and we're still learning)I'm ordering a copy right now for a new mom of a one-month old because you share the truth and you make us laugh. And she will feel relieved that she can pick up your book - randomly open to any page - and receive HELP along with LAUGHTER. Both count!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I just received this book. Its for my sister, a new mommy to be. I read through it a bit and enjoy the sense of humor. I want to keep it to read first, lol. I think she's really going to enjoy it. I had to scour the internet to find a book for her that wasn't one of those typical preachy \\"do or die\\" baby books, which I'm sure she'll receive plenty off. This should be a nice reprieve in the midst of her upcoming (happy)madness."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"great seller! great book- beyond funny and light hearted for new moms to be. I laughed so hard out loud several times!fast shipping too"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is not only a hilarious and truthful (although sarcastically exaggerated) look at motherhood, but it also provides useful information to new moms. I'm not saying this is a \\"parenting how-to\\" book, but it's nice to find a book that can entertain you as well as teach you a thing or two about how other moms cope. This book lifted my post-partum spirits many times, and had me laughing out loud when nothing else could make me crack a smile.As to the many complaints that the author is \\"against breast feeding\\", I have to say that is ridiculous. The author clearly states that she wanted to do it but decided to move on to bottle feeding after having a hard time breast feeding. She never \\"bashes\\" breast feeding mothers, or insinuates that there is anything wrong with breast feeding. I personally breast feed my baby and was not insulted one bit. Like most every topic she touches on in the book, she states that pretty much everything is okay as long as it works for your family... and as long as you don't go over-board with it! And if you DO go over-board, then she has the right to tell a hilarious antidote about you in her book.My only problem with the book is there are a lot of \\"cuss\\" words in it, which means I'm less likely to recommend it to some of my more sensitive friends, but I personally thought everything was hilarious and appropriately placed.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book was hilarious. Anyone who is a mom, or even a nanny can fully appreciate this book. If you are a new mom, or a mom to be, run right out and pick up a copy. You won't want to miss out on the advice this book has to offer.Stefanie Wilder-Taylor holds nothing back in her candid tales from the first year of her first child's life. Each short story is a bit of advice that you might not hear at the local mommy and me classes. She talks about everything from nipples nearly falling off trying to breastfeed, to mommy personality types on the playground (avoid alpha mom, you will never be good enough for this one).Her advice isn't researched per say, she has more of hands on experience. She learned that the most important lessons you can find outside of a book, just by using your own common sense.Stefanie also warns her readers of the many differing and strong opinions a new mother will face. From being bombarded at Babies R Us with questions about her views on breastfeeding (while only 6 months pregnant), to being scolded while at a stop light for not having the bar on her child safety seat fully lowered, Stefanie has seen and heard it all.This book is written by a friend of Chelsea Handler. Its clear to see that they get along famously in their snarky commentary. Check this book out if you liked \\"Are you there vodka? Its me Chelsea\\" by Chelsea Handler."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I bought this book wanting something funny and entertaining while I wait for the arrival of my baby. I laughed and laughed throughout the whole book. The author is funny and she takes you through situations that come up in every moms life. I also bought her other book \\"Nap time is the new happy hour\\". And fell in love with it too. I definitely recommend this to mom's who want a fun easy read with lots of laughs."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I got this book as a gift from a friend. I wish I had read it before all the struggles of the first few months of our little one's life. First of all it is hilarious. Secondly it is not so negative to be depressing (like Girlfriend's Guide). I think it is the best book on this subject."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor's book \\"Sippy Cups are Not for Chardonnay\\" is a refreshing find in the world of baby texts and parenting narrative. Straightforward, modern, and completely human, Wilder-Taylor's take on motherhood is a great find for first-time-moms and veterans alike. You won't agree with everything she has to say, but the beauty of the narrative is that you don't have to - one woman offers her experience as a new mother, and shows that not everything has to be \\"by the book.\\""},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I see responses from parents complaining about the use of language in Wilder-Taylor's book(s). The truth is, if you're a parent who doesn't swear in real life you may also want to shy away from a book about the realism of kids (and by proxy, things that might eventually make you swear). Hint: if you are into attachment parenting, holistic birthing, and keeping things au naturale, you will most likely read this book with a grain of salt. Does that mean you'll hate it? Maybe, maybe not. But even though I gave birth naturally I embraced this book with open arms and laughed my arse off."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book was purchased at the recommendation of another friend who was also pregnant at the time. It was hilarious! It was also a welcomed break from the other informational books I was reading at the time. I loved it so much that I've purchased 4 more copies for my pregnant girlfriends!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book made me laugh so hard I cried! I loved it. It helped this new mom get grounded again!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Cute book makes a great shower gift for first time moms. Seasoned moms will yawn a little. Been there done that."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is a fast read and I did chuckle here and there. But I don't understand why Wilder-Taylor is so disparaging towards mothers who had births they feel great about, enjoyed breastfeeding and co-sleeping, choose to homeschool, use cloth diapers or make their own babyfood.I was looking forward to reading this knowing she has a large following and I usually enjoy \\"Mama lit,\\" but the writing is flat and uninspiring. She certainly does not foster any sense of inclusion within mothers."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I totally get the sense of humour in this book. She talks about things that most women are thinking, but are too cowardly to say aloud. I commend her for writing this book and I appreciate being able to take a light-hearted look at motherhood because it can be so serious sometimes.
