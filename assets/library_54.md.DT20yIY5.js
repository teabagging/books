I certainly like the premise but I think a Novella would have been enough compared to this overly wordy behemoth.

If you are a Stephen King fan, you must read this story, just to finish &quot;The Castle Rock&quot; series of titles. But again, this is not top-notch King writing from the king of horror."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I ultimately dislike almost every SK story. However, this is not because of his writing ability, but rather it is because of the way he portrays humanity in general and faith in particular. As in of much English literature, the clergy are either bumbling dimwits or conniving predators victimizing the \\"sheep\\". SK often writes the \\"Good Guys\\" cynically and the innocent always lose, which is just as well since their motives were never virtuous anyway. Everybody in his books are well portrayed and you want to identify with them, but in the end SK wants us all to believe that virtue is a lie and black-hearted selfishness is the only \\"real\\" motivator.But in this tale, he screwed up and the good guy is both genuine and courageously virtuous. And he wins. I believe that it is this point that so many of the other reviewers find so objectionable; it is so NOT SK.The people in the story are believable and well filled out in the story, but the cautionary tale is the real point that shines through. One of the few times I will likely ever recommend one of his books. The movie with Sidrow and Harris is also excellent, and makes a more compelling case for virtue too boot."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"After reading over 800 pages, King never tells us if the Catholics have their bingo night or not.

All the old horror masters are gone now, so people must contend with mediocre, retarded and very secular novels. Well they haven't read mine, and never will."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"i am very impresed from the charecters of the green mile and also from the other stiven's books"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I wrote a draft of this composition 4 years ago, and in a way, despite my initial rejection, &quot;Needful Things&quot; has opened my mind. Many times, ideas that are unfamiliar to me, at first, create a very strong resistance and pain within me. In the end, I come at peace with myself when I realize they're true, and there's nothing I could or should do to change them. It's exactly getting out of my old beliefs and growing up. Yes, it is hard, but as it is was said - \\" the future always born in pain\\".This serious and somber novel takes a good look inside the human nature, explores it thoroughly, and comes up with severe consequences.After I'd read the book I realized it poisoned my soul .I didn't think that could happen because of a book, but it did. The horrifying things King had written about, the wickedness and horror influenced me consciously and unconsciously during the reading process.It is important to me to let you know how I felt back then, because it was bizarre, unusual, and after all, fascinating.Ignoring the supernatural in the novel, you're left with a lesson in decision-making when one is not utterly rational, the natural state of most of us. In here, as in \\"The Stand\\" everyone has to put himself in the place of the characters, decide what he would have done, which option he would have chosen and finally - take a stand.This book stressed the fact that everyone has good and bad inside of him. Yes, it's connected to the desires, interests and needs we all share, but there's more to it. Inside every woman and man there is a silent struggle, between the two mentioned, from time to time.It doesn't really ever end. There are intermissions, it could vanish for a long time, but its bases are there. This is the true nature of things as king see them.King extends, speak of sheer evil. He speaks of taking truly wicked actions in order to achieve this that you want, to let go of any limits and concentrate on the things you've justified and decided to do. The frightening conclusion of them all is that anyone can get down and dirty, and King adds, that once evil has regulated your soul once, there is no way back. You have crossed the lines. There is a thin red line that once you've passed it the road back is almost impossible.As usual in a King's book, he's referring to nothing short but a murder. After killing one man, willingly and intentionally, the barrier breaks. According to King, in that point, some would completely freak out and lose the good they did have before. They are now capable of doing anything you'd imagine.The really interesting part is that sometime there is still good inside A man after doing the unthinkable. This side of him burdens him immensely, trying to pull him back to being rational. This is the barrier of sanity; it can be said that after crossing the lines for the first time, the man loses the very thing that stops him from damaging him and his surroundings. He becomes indifferent to it, and thinks only of himself - his interests and needs.To be precise, in the book I read of so many people who were willing to do horrible deeds, only to satisfy their desires - the object of their affection.It was horrifying to read about the demonical activity of the devil incarnate in the novel, that let hell break loose, and was responsible for everything. The thought that one person can do all that...It is believable...And the way that people had changed in the face of the object they always craved for...Reading it, you have to witness all the filth and ugliness they had kept inside, then transformed it to brutal and gruesome acts. King calls it \\"Selling your soul\\". The idea that a person can lose control of his soul is unequaled in his books.The sides story that stunned me completely was Brad Denfort's.He is characterized as a peace and calm figure, of the ones that never vend anger on anyone, completely non violent, that suddenly, gets up one day, and in attack of sheer uncontrollable wrath bursts at the seams taking down a few others not to mention himself (and not without a reason).This is a terror imposing kind of story, because you instantly reckon - \\"This could happen to me too !\\". You understand what he'd gone through, and why he did what he did, and that's the scariest of them all. Yet, you should remember King aims to cause this reaction, and he is successful...In here ,we get to the bottom of it all. I found the \\"I want to scare the living daylight out of you\\" style very bad for me, though learned here a few formidable lessons. This is a real poisonous glass that harms...In \\"The Stand\\" it was different. There weren't terrible murders and human outbreaks like in here, certainly not like in this form (I mention it because I'd read it prior to NF).The satanic \\"Needful Things\\" is a monstrous, legendary horror, that some could relate to it as, \`at its best', but not me. I would avoid such writings in the future to come."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"About the best thing I can say about &quot;Needful Things&quot; is that I only paid 12.5 cents for it at a second hand bookstore because that's all it's worth(maybe). My problems with this novel are many, but I think some of the biggest shortcomings include no definition of what or who Gaunt is. I kept waiting for him to be fleshed out, but the book just kept droning on with endless vingettes of &quot;pranks&quot;. There were also way too many characters and for some reason King was unable to do what he does best: namely develop three dimensional, living, breathing people we can relate to, then put them in mortal jeopardy so the reader can feel like they are in their head, the fear being almost palpable. Also, I would like to know where this crap with the fake snake in the nut can somehow coming alive and the paper flowers turning into some kind of blazing torch came from. It screams of a very weak premise and an even weaker way to deal with it.

There's one good scene, but it doesn't justify reading the whole book. Read &quot;The Distributor&quot; and get the story better and faster.

It is so neat reading a book about a store in which posseses anything and everything your heart has ever desired, and we all know that their is that one thing standing in the limelight of our lives, that we would do almost anything for, and at Needful Things, the cost is not of the essence, but it is more, proving to an allegoriacal figure of the present figure--Satan, how much you want it and how much you will really do to get that one thing you have always desired. It is going great and Castle Rock has so many grins, but within the macabre price in which is to be paid, the citizens of Castle Rock realize when it is too late, they got soooooooo much more than they have barganed for.

One good book of his is &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;. So far this is the only book that came close to Needful Things. I have found that when you move from carachater to carachater like in Needful Things the story dosen't get boring. But if you stay on one subject for long amounts of time it gets boring. Right now I have around 10 paperback books and one hard cover. Personally I think hard covers are better and more fun to collect. Any way I give this book a 10 out of 10.

It has something for everyone, from young to old. The prices are really low and fair and shoppers just seem to always leave happy. The store's proprietor Leland Gaunt seems like such a nice man and all he asks for when he sells his goods is a fair price and a little favor. The buyer has to pull a prank on one of the town's other residents.Sheriff Alan Pangborn doesn't like Gaunt. The sheriff also has his hands full of problems trying to settle the town down with all of the violence and hatred that has erupted. Gaunt just seems to know what to ask for to stir up the most trouble and vicious behavior. He knows that people will pay almost anything to get their wishes, dreams and desires. Ultimately many towns' people sell their souls for Gaunt's goods and it is up to Pangborn to try to save their souls and the town itself.....This is an excellent book and Stephen King understands what it takes to get people at each other's throats with vengeance in their eyes. In this story he creates a demon in the guise of an old gentleman who collects souls. Only the sheriff with his bravery can save what is left of the town. I loved this story and it is much better as a book than the movie that was later released. The movie failed to follow the book and is different in the end and it detracted from the story line in my opinion.I recommend that you read the book and watch the DVD and judge for yourself. If you are a Stephen King fan, like I am you, will find yourself liking this book and enjoy both forms of entertainment to varying degrees. I recommend this book to you as a good story!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"this is the LAST Castle Rock book. Mr. King brings the Devil himself to Derry and things get strange (as if you thought his book would be otherwise) the residents get tempted by things they want and will do ANYTHING to get them."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"In my opinion, this novel is one of Stephen King's best. This is one of my favorite King novels from the 90s. Every aspect of the book is near perfect, the plot is awesome, its fast paced, exciting and thrilling, and best of all the end is great too.The novel in essence is about the opening of a new store in Castle Rock, the store causes a stir among the small town populus. The day of opening a boy goes in, he knows in his mind that he wont find anything because after all it is just a simple antique store. But somehow he is able to find a vintage Sandy Koufax base ball card, the excat year and exact series that he needed for his collection and the best part was that it was very cheap, their was only 1 stipulation he had to play a \\"harmless prank\\" on someone in town, usually some one that they already dislike; A harmless prank that turns into 2 or 3 pranks (your not done until Mr. Gaunt says your done). As the novel goes on this pattern continues with people going in and always finding what they have always desired in life and always getting it for a cheap price with the added bit of \\"community service at the end\\". As the residents start playing pranks on each other the pranks tend to get more and more violent and exploitive ultimately leading to violence within the town and which leads to an explosive awesome ending. It should also be mentioned that he inlists the help of two is the towns most unstable and dangerous people to assist him at his shop... definately bad luck for the town!! Additionally, I would say Mr. Gaunt (the name should say all it needs to) is one of the best King villians in any of his books, the way he is crafted and developed is phenominal, and the way he ends up in the finale is even more awesome.Definately pick this one up, it is a great read. You will not be disappointed in this one at all."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book is often overlooked by some more popular ones (The Stand, IT, Pet Semetary etc etc.), but that doesn't mean it isn't one of King's best.

I also enjoy a large cast of diverse characters which this has. You see first hand a small town slowly demising in fron of your eyes, and the ride along the way is nothing short of fantastic. King paints the small town perfect once again, fills it with horror and excitiment(as always), and anyone who hasn't read this book has really missed out in my opnion. I truly believe if this book was more popular, it would be mentioned at the top of King's list in many peoples eyes. Great great book.*Also, Leland Gaunt is a fantastic villian*"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is such a good book. Very moody and creepy.

Just an awesome story of a small town where everyone knows everyone and what happens when a new and interesting shop appears in your town. Like always SK's discription of the town itself and characters is fantastic, you really feel like you are there. Definately one of my top 5 King books!!!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Overall there is a good book here. It is a solid three or a soft four, which isn't bad at all. I think Gaunt, the shop keeper, was a wonderful bad guy. Granted, people often say nobody is completely good or completely bad, but King made Gaunt completely bad and within this Sci-fi/horror realm, it is fine and can work. He is severaly creepy and one of the best parts of the book. I will say I think King was lazy in that Gaunt literally never had to work. He could manipulate all but a couple of people in the town and if they were veering off course, could right them to his whims almost like snapping his fingers.The \\"good\\" characters aren't completely good, which is good. As other reviewers say, King can create very believable characters and I believe, for the most part, that's true in Needful Things. He can also create characters you care so deeply about and ones you just want to see fry. To me, that wasn't the case in this book. I didn't especially care about anybody. Their were some exceptions, but those characters aren't developed as deeply as Alan and Polly.My biggest complaint is the length. I have no issue with lenght, itself, but I found so much of this work was not needed. Closer to the end there is a paragraph about Buster driving back to his home and observing all of the satelite dishes that are on the houses. Who cares? There was just so much fat. I do agree that the ending was anticlimatic, but by the end, I had too many other issues.People also like to comment on King not writing as well after he sobered up. I think you can see a change, but one of my favorites by King is the Green Mile and it was written in the late 90s.But anyway, I this book needs major editing. I purposely read the abridged version of The Stand just so I wouldn't be subjected to the nonsense. I started Under the Dome, but at 300 pages realized I didn't like anybody period and that I wasn't going to waste anymore time. I'm hesitant to ever start It because I know I will feel compeled to finish it to see what the hype is about, similar to this book. Someday I suppose."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is one of my favorite King novels. Don't let the length scare you, once you get going you won't put it down. You become so invested that, like a lot of King stories, the climactic ending is unforgettable. Do not watch movie or you may not like the book! It almost ruined the book for me when i watched the movie after."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I read this book when it first came out. I had been eagerly anticipating it when the novel was released in October and I immediately feel under the spooky spell Stephen King cast from this book. I had previously read The Dark Half and Four Past Midnight and I remember King enticing me as a reader with the promise of a kind of trilogy about Castle Rock ending in what he called a longer work called Needful Things. I was on pins and needles because I could not get over that creepy title and what it could mean! Both The Dark Half and Four Past Midnight scared the living daylights out of me and I loved them both and I just couldn't wait for this magnum opus of my favorite horror town of Castle Rock! I have to say that the wait was well worth it; I devoured this monster of a novel in two weeks late in October (the perfect time to read this book) and I remember being pleasantly scared to death and somewhat wistful that Castle Rock may actually be no more. The whole atmosphere bleeds that dark fall of the year in Maine and I feel that a little part of me died along with MANY of the townsfolk in that novel. I have never read a Stephen King novel which I didn't enjoy but this one has to have a special place in my heart because of its finality of not only the spookiest town in literature but seemingly also an era with Stephen King. The next novel from him after this one was Gerald's Game and while I read and loved it too (still makes me thirsty just thinking of that book) I noticed that the subsequent novels following Needful Things seemed to head down a different dark road than those prior to it. I still loved all the others but I just feel that Needful Things marks and end of an era for me in terms of Stephen King."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is one of Stephen King's best ever. As the plot goes, Satan himself in the guise of a kindly old person of a gentleman named Leland Gaunt, opened an unusual shop in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine -- offering everything \\"that your secret heart desires\\", but it turns out that the price for the items being sold are more than what they've bargained for; and the ultimate payment for the people of Castle Rock are their very souls. The climax however, comes as a little bit almost nearly out-of-hand, that it seems quite cartoonish... anyway, NEEDFUL THINGS (w/c's one of those KING novels that are made into a motion picture, in this case starring Max VonSydow as the 'kindly' old Gaunt) is a must for SK-buffs and horror fiction lovers. And furthermore, the novel depicts a relevant message for our age's consumeristic lifestyle and attitudes."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I found this novel to be beautifully put together. It surprised me to see so many plots put together so well. However, what truly amazed me was that within these many plots, he was able to put in even more themes. And he put everyone of them in better than most authors can include even one.This book is exremely entertaining, stunningly suspensefully, but neither of these can compare to how beautifully it was brought to a conclusion in the end of the story.If you read a Stephen King novel, and do not feel that he has much to his stories beside the horror, do not judge his quality as a writer until having read this one."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is, IMO, one of King's best novels.

I guess I was wrong. Right from the beginning I liked this book. You meet a man named Leland Gaunt. Somehow, he can provide for you the things you've always wanted. However, there's always a small price to pay. Not everything is as it seems. It may not be a horror book, but it's still really good.The only downside to this book was that there are so many different characters that it's hard to keep them all straight."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This was the second ever Stephen King book I read next to \\"The girl who loved Tom Gordon\\" which in my opinion was pretty lame.

If you stuck for a book to read, read this- It doesnt take as long as it look"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"King here delivers one of his best novels to date, and that means that this novel is way better than most of the fiction on the shelves today. I am a fan of Stephen King but had taken a break from him; not because I was tired of him but because I needed to relax after his intense plots, remarkable characters, and superior writing. When I decided to get back in Stephen King's writing I started with this book, &quot;Needful Things.&quot; I was astonished by how complex the plot was, with literally about ten to fifteen characters, and how King kept it moving quickly making you turning pages and pages, and before you know it you'll be done with this humongous novel that is epic in scope.Welcome to Castle Rock, Maine, Stephen King's fictitious town which has held many previous King novels. The book opens up with a prologue type of chapter that describes the town and the people in it. King's vivid imagination is put to use here as he describes many of the characters that will be met later on in the book. Then there is a sign on a store that will be opening soon. The store is called Needful Things. The residents of Castle Rock are all wondering what the store will be like and for the first few pages we understand the characters thoughts about the store. Leland Gaunt is the owner of the store and he sells whatever the customer desires. Whether it is a baseball card, a picture, or an antique. Gaunt charges a small price for everything, but the customers must do a command that is assigned to them. Mr. Gaunt has a whole plan up his sleeve, one that can capture all of the souls of Castle Rock for himself...One of the best aspects about the novel are the characters. There really isn't one main character as King switches to the stories of many of Castle Rock's residents revolving around what is going on with Needful Things. Because of this the reader isn't stuck with only one viewpoint. We get to see enemies' thoughts through both eyes, which makes the reader have to choose between right and wrong. The reader isn't stuck with the author's take on the scene; that's up to you. Leland Gaunt is the perfect multi-dimensional villain. At times he may seem as the good guy who is trying to help everybody, but then he'll seem like the bad guy that is out to hurt everybody else. In addition to this villain every other character in this book is three dimensional, such as Sherrif Alan Pangborn, Polly, Nettie, Brian Rusk, Ace, and many others that are worth reading about.To put it simply, Stephen King is a genius when it comes to writing a well crafted novel. This book contains everything that makes a book great. He includes character development, plot development, description, and wonderful writing. This novel flows very quickly and despite its length you will have this superb novel completed in no time. I guarantee you that it will be nearly impossible to put this book down. &quot;Needful Things&quot; works as a thriller or as a novel involving the paranormal. King makes the novel very realistic. This is a work of genius. Read it.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book kept me interested for all 700 pages. I must say there were a lot characters which kept it a tiny bit hard to keep track. Yet, I've read about 12 other novels of King's and this is up there on the list. I thought some parts would be drawn out considering the length of the book but this did not happen. I must admit that I did not find this novel scary and up at night because of it, but it did have some suspenseful scenes. If you like King definetly read this and if you haven't read any of his works then start with this.

I will admit that the film with Ed Harris and Max von Sydow has influenced further my favoritism but this has everything. It draws on the inherent jealousy and envy within human nature, the desire for petty revenge that quickly spirals out of control and the religious animosity and human greed in the face of vanity. The devil raging through a small US town almost as an afterthought after newspaper clippings show far greater deeds, is excellently told. There is no ghoulishness or dripping blood at every turn, rather the fear and chills are generated through sheer human spite and maliciousness. Inevitably, this supernatural manipulation of human failings provides pathos, humor and lurching moments of genuine surprise. The characters are excellently drawn, from the small town sheriff with his arthritic girlfriend to the pitiably crazed 'Buster' and the fanatical religious leaders, the devil's subtle rampage through this small-town is excellently done by Stephen King. A must-read in the genre."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"While its not one of the classic King novels (IT, The Stand, The Shining, Misery, etc.), Needful Things is truly an original tale. What makes Stephen King such an important writer in modern literature is his ability to tap into that small town mentality and balance it with the supernatural. Like The Stand, Needful Things contains a cast of epic proportions, and at times the pranks and the pranksters are forgotten or confused with others. But this book still gets five stars for the realistic darkness of human nature. In the Needful Things shop, the small towners conveniently find items that play a significant role in their lives and find theyll do anything to get them; paying a small price and at first harmles tricks that turn deadly. an excellent book."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This one was just a little too weak for me, although the premise was interesting enough. Most of the characters were never developed to the extent that I was able to care about what happened to them. I also found it hard to believe that any town would be able to hold as many homicidal people as Castle Rock, and I found Ace Merrill's car to be more interesting than most of them. The ending was pure &quot;Deus ex machina&quot;,with King creating a supernatural band aid to close up all the plot threads. Not one of King's best."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I am a big Stephen King fan and i had read other reviews about Needful things so upon purchaseing the book I found it to be very differnt for example some of king's books take awhile to get into they start off slow but pick up midway through the book like Geralds Game or the Girl who loved tom gordon Needful things has to be one of the best books ever written from king I was so engrossed in this book from start to finish he makes the charcters seem so real he make you love them and hate them I mean you can feel sorry for Myrtle Keeton the way she is abused by Buster for the pain Polly and Alan go through I kinda liked Nettie myself now the book is about a man by the name of Leland Gaunt opening up a small shop called needful things he has anything you want after all he is Satan so he knows your desires like Brian Rusk and the love for baseball cards Nettie and Cranival glass the two ladies and there desire over Elvis Gaunt will sell you anything most of it for a very low price and a little prank of course he has away of hypnotizing the customers and he makes them do his evil bidding the best part about it is he plays the people aganist each other who have had problems with each other at some point in time or still do for the matter like the baptist and the catholics. the book really picks up when there is about two hundred pages left i couldn't hardly put it down and just think the chain of events start with a baseball card the book also has it tragedy as well but I reccomend this to any Stephen king fan you will not be disapointed"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"So, as usual, Stephen King weaves a tale of human nature. What would you do to get anything you wanted, and what price are you willing to pay to keep it. I absolutely loved this book. I must have read it five or six times. Stephen King creates a masterpiece that combines every element of writing in this book. The characters are believable and the story is also believable. I love the way he uses smaller chapters in his books to give it a sense of anticipation.I don't want to ruin the book for you but i'll tell you a little bit. A small town gets a new shopkeeper who is a little out of the ordinary. He sells items that everyone wants, the little boy is able to procure a baseball item that is more than just a card, it talks. Eveyone gets a special item, but is required to do something in return for it. mayhem ensues.I'm not going to tell you anymore, but i will say this, the movie of this story was excellent and I'm suprised it didn't do as well as it should have. All in all and excellent read."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I had to make my self read to the middle of the book and then I lost interest. I still pick it up every now and then because I hate leaving things incomplete, but this one is so poorly written that I can't stick with it. Even the movie was a disappointment."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book may be better than just 2 stars...but the problem is how do you give it more than that, when books like Salem's Lot, The Shinning, Pet Semetary can only get 5? I have been reading King's books for 15 years...and this one didnt do it for me. I liked the story line building around people's paranoia and insecurities...but in the end, the book fell short."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"The author states this is a black comedy about greed and obsession. It's not a genre for me. Instead of laughing at people, I was going ugh and oh - too much anger and stupidity.Gaunt a demon (or devil) comes to town. He meets with many people. He knows each person's weakness and greatest desire. He has a hypnotizing effect, fulfilling each person's desire and compelling them to do a task. This task is something mean to another person and keeping it secret.CAUTION SPOILER an example:Gaunt tells Brian to throw rocks to break windows, the tv, and other items in Wilma's home. The rocks have notes saying Nettie did it. Gaunt tells Hugh to kill Nettie's dog with a note saying Wilma did it. Instead of talking to each other, Wilma and Nettie are enraged. They grab knives and kill each other simultaneously.Actually the above kill scene was funny. I laughed, but I didn't laugh at other kill scenes.So, most of the story is getting to know people and watching them enjoy and obsess about whatever Gaunt gives them. They take extreme measures to protect it because they fear losing it. They do a task which is usually destroying A's property and leaving a note saying B did it. Then A and B attack each other in a rage. Throughout this, the framed people don't talk to each other or report damage to the police. No one acts in a rational manner.THE ENDING:A couple of characters eventually do some smart things at the end. It is sort of a happy ending. But so many people were foolish, vicious and dead, that it didn't feel good. And, the ending was weak. It was the hand of God (or other power) coming in to fix things. Where was this power earlier in the story? Why does it appear only at the end? I can accept it - just mentioning - it was weak.WHAT I LIKED:I loved getting to know so many characters living in a small town. The author is great with descriptions and dialogue.One unexpected reaction I had was feeling grateful that I didn't have some of the problems these people had. One woman had such severe arthritis in her hands, she couldn't zip a zipper, and she was in pain most of the time. What an awful way to live. Also a teen who stuttered who wished he didn't. Stephen does this exceedingly well. I've read about similar problems in other authors' books and didn't feel as much empathy as I felt here.NARRATOR:Stephen King narrated this book, and his acting was very good. His accent probably fits the characters in the story. But I'd prefer an actor with a \\"generic accent.\\" Stephen says Mondeeey, Tuesdeeey, and a few other things that I'm not used to. I kept thinking this is Stephen the author. I'd prefer not thinking about \\"who\\" is narrating and just be immersed in the story.DATA:Narrative mode: Most of the story is 3rd person. A few sections are an unrelated 1st person narrator. Unabridged audiobook reading time: 25 hrs and 11 mins. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual content: a few brief scenes, mostly referred to with no details, includes self pleasuring. Setting: 1991 mostly Maine. Book copyright: 1991. Genre: paranormal suspense. Ending: somewhat bad for the bad guy, barely good for a few good guys.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Stephen King books, see my 5 star review of Carrie posted 5-11-12."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"In this book the reader is introduced to two main characters. The first is Sherrif Alan Pangborn, a Serial Monogamist whose wife and son have recently died. With the two of them barely cold in the ground he \\"hooks up\\" with Polly who runs a store in the town of Castle Rock. Pangborn spends half of his time grieving and crying for the loss of his family and the rest of the time he spends having sex with Polly!!! Why any self respecting female would chose to get involved with a man who is still grieving for his loss is a mystery to me.However I have noticed that many of the women portrayed in King's books are \\"Profesional Victims\\" like Wendi, Jack Torrence's wife in The Shining. The other main character in the book is Leland Gaunt, who has just opened a new type of Antique store in town. When you purchase anything from Gaunt you buy now and pay dearly later. King wrote this book because he felt he was developing an unhealthy fascination with his fictional town of Castle Rock and in the words of the Kylie Minogue song \\"I can't get you out of my head\\". In writing this book one hopes that King finally managed to forget about Castle Rock and after reading this book you will too. I give this book 5 stars because it was made into a fairly decent movie."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I just got finished read a book, and I realized what is SK's horror. Someday I will read every book of SK. Because his story is grotesque and plot is fast and discription is cruel.The whole situation was weird...and getting weirder all the time. As time went by Needful Thing is a poison place, and Mr. Gaunt is a poison man. Only he's really not a man.-Who is HE? Maybe devil."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"A very interesting idea, but this is an example of how for sometime King seemed to have fallen in love with the sound of hearing himself type. Yet another example (much like insomnia) where king seems to ramble on much too long. The storytelling not nearly as tight as recent works. Not a bad story (though yet another horrible movie conversion) but hardly Kings best. If you have a very loooong flight to take and there is nothing else available you might give it a try."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"The beggining of the book was boring and had me asleep but you have to be patient. The ending was pretty good."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book is a little confusing at first but tends to get interesting with a lot of action near the end. Pick this book up because it is the final Stephen King book about Castle Rock!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"As one of King's so-called 'Constant Readers', this book of his has always stood out to me. Not in the last place because it's movie actually did the book credit (in my opinion third in-line after the prison tales The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile)The basic idea was the most gripping to me. What if there is a store, where you could get the one thing you need most? And it can be anything from a baseball-card, Elvis' glasses to a money-winning horserace game....And for the final trick, you just have to 'perform a little prank' in return. And before you know it you lit a fuse and an entire village is at war, including the local father and vicar.Brilliant. Read it and get swept away by King's version of selling your soul to the devil. Beautifully played by Max von Sydow in the movie. Ancient, likeable, gentlemanlike, seemingly concerned, but through and through evil.Excellent story telling."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is a really entertaining GREAT read. The characters are really true to life and I found the book HILARIOUS. This book proves everyone has their price....The setting was great, the plot was really rich and interesting, its a must read for King fans, and fans of horror. Watch out for the movie version though, its HORRID."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Among Stephen King's many talents is his ability to showcase the depths of his characters; i.e., how low they can be simply to justify their needs and desires. In this novel, Leland Gaunt, a small-town shop owner, barters with the townspeople of Castle Rock, but the price that they pay for their most desired items leads to terror. King is a master at writing this types of stories, and his fans love that he does it so well."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Since I started reading Stephen King six years ago, I have never read a book that topped Salem's Lot. Needful Things doesn't, but it's not for lack of trying. King has invited us in to his favorite roost one last time to let us get a real good look at its inhabitants. King took a dozen different stories, which could have been novels of their own, and brilliantly spliced them together. This is one to read again and again."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Five-star reviews are thrown around today like frisbees at the park. But Needful Things, Stephen King's absorbing tale of (what else?) evil in a small town, deserves this rating. With incredible ease, King spins the yarn of a malevolent shopkeeper straight from the depths of Hades. For over 200 pages, King takes his time setting the scene and the characters. But with King, the pages fly by enjoyably. Meanwhile, he is tightening the screws of suspense to an almost unbearable level. The second part of Needful Things introduces us to the carnage, fire and brimstone that will dominate Part Three. King explores the concept of &quot;soul selling&quot; that can be found in this his recent &quot;Storm of the Century.&quot; All the usual characters are there: The hero with a checkered past, the well-meaning youngster, the cocaine addict, the pedaphile principal, and of course, the diabolical embodiment of evil. The crescendo reaches deafening excitement in the final part of Needful Things. In a conclusion that tops any of King's works, the bubble of suspense finally bursts into one hundred pages of sheer excitement. The reader watches in awe as King paints the final magnificent strokes on his tapestry of pure horror delight."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Stephen King has done it again. &quot;Needful Things&quot; is another great book by this outstanding author. Each character is so unique, especially Leland Gaunt, the owner of the shop &quot;Needful Things&quot;. The way that Mr. Gaunt makes everyone in the small town of Castle Rock turn against one another is absolutely facinating. His little &quot;pranks&quot; eventually lead to murder, and he just sits back and enjoys the show! I highly recommend this book for all fans of Mr. King."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Wow! Some people are better at what they do than anybody else I know is at anything they do. Like Michael Jordan on a basketball court, Stephen King dazzles, amazes and makes it look easy.Here are all of the great parts of King and none of the bad. As often happens with King, I found myself &quot;almost&quot; routing for the bad guy right up until the gory end. But then, I could hardly wait for him to get what he deserved. I know it is a clich&eacute;, but I literally could not put this book down. This is &quot;The Master of Horror&quot; at his best! Buy it. Read it. Enough said."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is, by far, my favourite novel by Stephen King. As always he frightens us and makes us think. He also makes us think about ourselves and all of our greed. Also, he makes us wonder what we would do for our Needful Things"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Steven King is not only a master at chilling his readers to the bone, but he has been doingit for some twenty years. Three particular novels, one under his pen name of Richard Bachman, all have a common theme of one's deepest fears coming to life. Needful Things, The Regulators (as Bachman), and Cujo, all embody this common theme. Needful Things takes place in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. The unsuspecting inhabitants of the town are subject to an unknown means of evil. A store named Needful Things, and its proprietor, Leland Gaunt, have terrible things in mind for the people of the town. Any item is for sale, for a small price, and a small prank. Everybody believes that the store is too good to be true, and the town sheriff, Alan Pangborton, knows that this is the truth. The common theme is arises as more and more people are driven to violence due to the pranks. As Leleand Gaunt emerges as a man who is more evil than homely and handsome, the violences also grows. Alan battles for control of his town as it spins into chaos. the deep fear of your neighbors turning against you for no apparent reason is brought up in this terrifying novel when Gaunt and Pangborton finally confront each other in a battle of good and evil. The Regulators is also a novel of mystical things and brutal death. Audrey Wyler and her autistic nephew have been tormented by some unseen evil for many months. When the brightly colored vans come to Poplar Street, Audrey knows that the unseen evil has come to life. The vans are filled with shot gun bearing ghosts who inflict a rain of bullets over the people and houses of Poplar Street. They kill many, and cause incredible suffering to those who survive. The common theme is present when the vans start to shoot, and the people must hide form the ever present drive by shootings. This fear of death is in everybody, and it has also arisen in The Regulators. In Cujo, the force is not mystical, and is far from the evils present in the previous two novels. The evil in this novel, is a former sweet Sanit Bernard dog. When Cujo catches rabies, his family has left and he is left alone. Donna Trenton is suffering form a crumbling marriage, and feelings of despair. When she takes her son, Tad, to the home of the man who can fix her car, she does not know what she will find there. Donna is confronted with Cujo, who is restless and very disallusioned. She is trapped in her car, waiting for anybody to come and help her out of the blistering heat, and rabid dog. The common theme is represented here, by the ever present dog lurking in the shadows, close enough to jump if she tries to escape. The three novels, Needful Things, The Regulators, and Cujo, all embody the common theme of deep, hidden fear coming to life."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Although there are some supernatural elements in \\"Needful Things\\", the true terror isn't supernatural at all. What is REALLY frightening about this story is how the lower aspects of human nature - greed, fear, paranoia, and pride - can cause such pain, suffering and destruction.This was much more frightening to me than King's usual fare, because I could actually imagine some of these scenarios happening without the supernatural catalyst provided in the story. In fact, if you read the newspapers or watch the news, you can see this sort of pointless human-created devastation every day. The only thing keeping this tale of small-town apocalypse safely in the realm of fiction is the sheer magnitude of the emotional domino-effect of destruction.Format note: This is the second audio book by Stephen King read by Stephen King that I've listened to. A totally satisfying experience! I truly believe that the best way to \\"listen\\" to a book is to have the author read it."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"In many previous novels before \\"Needful Things\\", Stephen King expertly crafted the community of Castle Rock. In deciding to \\"retire\\" the locale with this novel, King sends the now infamous location out in style with a creepy story that will have you thrilled from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, \\"Needful Things\\" sees a new shopkeep (Leland Gaunt) open up a new establishment in Castle Rock entitled Needful Things. While looking like nothing more than a \\"junk shop\\" from the outside, Needful Things (and proprietor Gaunt) is not at all what it seems. When each town resident finds an item that is inexplicably near and dear to their heart, Mr. Gaunt charges them a pittance of a physical price...but takes something significantly more out of their soul & community.While \\"Needful Things\\" is, as usual, speckled with the paranormal aspects that King is known for, this novel is a character study at heart. It taps into the emotions of the common man/woman and, while reading, will make you wonder if you would react in the same way? After spending so much time creating this community in other books, King knows that we care about it and its residents, and thus writes to those emotions. Castle Rock is the epitome of \\"small town USA\\", an ideal that is easy to root foot and become invested in.Overall, \\"Needful Things\\" is another solid novel in the pantheon of King literature. It isn't overly weird, but instead leans more towards the \\"character\\" aspects of storytelling. In putting Castle Rock to bed, King perhaps told the best \\"town story\\" of his career."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful Things is a very well written suspensful novel with twists and turns. The suicide the things the shopkeeper does for his \\"repayment\\" seem not to be horrible, but just a vandilism or a rumor but they turn deadly turning people against each other ruining the town until the point where something has to be done. NO SPOILERS WILL I EVER WRITE!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful Things is my favorite Stephen King book. His plot and situations for these characters are intriguing. They intermingle quite nicely with a thoroughly nasty villian. The old saying \\"Be careful what you wish for you just might get it.\\"Applies here in spades. The people in town find out much too late that the price of happiness or their deepest desires is way too high.This is a wonderfully fiendish book I recommend to all true King fans.What are you willing to do for exchange for your soul? Leland Gaunt is waiting."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I just finished reading this book by Stephen King and I had to write a review on it immediately! This is an astounding piece of work that Stephen King has written, and of all the books that I have read of his, I would definitely consider \`Needful Things' as one of his best!The story revolves around a shop called \`Needful Things', which has just opened in the small town of Castle Rock. At first, everyone is very curious to get a glimpse of exactly what the shop holds. The shop is led by a mysterious man named Leland Gaunt, who seems to have, in stock, everything that each and every citizen in Castle Rock desires. However, in exchange for money, he asks his customers to perform small deeds for him, which seems playful, but ultimately leads to disastrous consequences.King has a magical way of bringing a whole town together in this book. We get to read about each and every citizen, their relationships with the others, and how drastically their lives change after a short period of time. You feel for many characters in this book, especially Nettie Cobb, Brian Rusk, Polly Chalmers and Myrtle Keeton. From the purchase that Brian Rusk makes at the shop, till the final battle between good and evil, we are taken in with the story. Leland Gaunt, the owner of Castle Rock is one of the best villains King has created. Gaunt will seem like an angel in one scene and will frighten you in the next. The only other villain I found to be as convincing as Gaunt was Flagg (from King's \`Eyes of the Dragon').\\"Needful Things\\" was the last Castle Rock story that Stephen King wrote and what an exciting book it was! If you have not read this book yet, make it a priority to pick it up when you take a trip to your bookstore."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"even if it costs them everything.&quot; Once again, Stephen King uses his well-developed, biting prose and sharp, twisted imagination to paint a moving portrait of small-town calm that becomes slowly infested with a gradually growing evil. This is NEEDFUL THINGS which, as mentioned at the very end, took Stephen King over two years to write, finishing it in 1991. It is one of his longer books, at 736 pages (in the paperback edition I own), but it held my interest throughout, actually increasing it the more I read!NEEDFUL THINGS is subtitled &quot;The Last Castle Rock Story,&quot; and what a grand finale it is! Castle Rock is, of course, the fictional Maine town in which Stephen King has set some of his most memorable works. It also lent its name to his production company, which has churned out many modern film classics. Being the single place name that is most famously associated with King, it is a surprise to me (and, I suspect, to many others) that a total of only five of his many novels are set in Castle Rock: THE DEAD ZONE (1979), CUJO (1982), THE TOMMYKNOCKERS (1987), THE DARK HALF (1989) and NEEDFUL THINGS (1991). However, as King ominously reminds us at the beginning of the latter, &quot;You've been here before.&quot; We sure have, and it is an absolute joy to revisit this most deceptively interesting of small towns that King has created for us.Sheriff Alan Pangborn, the lone holdover from the previous Castle Rock story THE DARK HALF, has lost his wife and only child to a tragically sudden car accident that occurred between that story and this one. It shocked him into a depressing reality, one that is helped somewhat by a kindred spirit in Polly Chalmers, who runs a sewing store and who has an enigmatic past of her own that she has never fully revealed. of course, she *will* let Alan in on the missing details...in time. However, they and others in the town take their minds temporarily off their own problems to investigate that new store Needful Things, which looks about ready to open. When it does, the fun really begins...The sinister storeowner, Leland Gaunt, is one of the best King villains; you know he is not the gentlemanly old fellow he seems to be at first when he entertains the impressionably young Brian Rusk, but you aren't quite sure (for most of the time) as to who (or what) he actually is. Of course, you begin to guess this early on, but King wisely chooses to reveal Gaunt's true identity very slowly, in scattershot throughout the book. Some reviewers on here have mentioned that for how long the story is, the ending presents a bit of a letdown. I'll admit that it wasn't quite what I expected, and it did disappoint me a little; however, I also realized that a story dealing with the supernatural and occult probably *shouldn't* be too-neatly-wrapped-up at the end.All in all, NEEDFUL THINGS develops at least a dozen characters very well, from those with whom I deeply sympathized (Sheriff Pangborn, Polly Chalmers, eleven-year-old---and first customer---Brian Rusk, his younger brother Sean, Nettie Cobb and Myrtle Keeton) and others I absolutely detested (Wilma Jerzyck, Danforth &quot;Buster&quot; Keeton and Reverend William &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; Rose; I just love SK's knack for picking great nicknames!). This is a story that is tremendously absorbing, effectively disturbing and worth every bit the time it takes to really get into it. NEEDFUL THINGS is one of the best Stephen King books I have read at this point; mind you, I have read only a handful of others so far. Now I really want to read the rest of his incredible collection of gloriously twisted, imaginative works!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; AGES 17 &amp; UP"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"After starting this book I began to realize that I was perhaps reading one of Mr. King's better books. The writing was crisp and punchy and the characters were believably drawn out, not to mention quite funny. Soon, I saw the story working on three levels: 1) that, yes, we all have &quot;needful things&quot; (one's man trash is quite simply another man's treasure) and that 2) we would do anything to hang on to our \\"needful things\\", be them religion, memories of childhood, relationships or even a ball card (&quot;you can have yours, just get away from mine&quot;) and that 3) perhaps it is &quot;needful&quot; in and of itself to want to wreck havoc, murder and chaos upon the world in which we live. You see, the characters in this book jump in to the fray, so to speak, quite willingly. Perhaps Mr. King is telling us, in his inimitable, cynical fashion, that we \\"need\\" to be bullies, conquerors, destroyers in this world and just might actually enjoy it.Pretty heavy stuff and I enjoyed \\"Needful Things\\" (in concept and book) thoroughly until the cop-out ending. Too much mysticism for my taste. This book was pretty brutal, unkind and devilish and the ending was quite rushed and convenient, which is surprising for King, who is as long-winded an author as I've ever read. Still, a fun and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Stephen King's \\"Needful Things\\" takes place in the town of Castle Rock, Maine. A new store has opened up that is run by a man named Leland Gaunt. He specializes in carrying everything and anything that you could ever want. The only problem, is that each person's \\"needful thing\\" comes at one HELL of a price, that could end costing the person their soul.Stephen King is not my favorite author, but I have read enough of his books to know that some are better than others. To this day, I still feel that Needful Things is one of his best books. The idea behind the story is what really makes this book fun to read. The idea that the Devil himself could come to a town and tempt the town members with their deepest desires is very appealing. The best thing, is that the characters do it all to themselves, because everything is based on free will. All the Devil does is show the characters the way, and convince them to pull a \\"harmless little prank\\" on members of the town. The story is extremely well written and moves at a very fast pace. I usually read a 400 -500 page book in 2 -3 days. That is how long it took me to read Needful Things. The 731 pages just seem to fly by, because King manages to create a story that involves you in the lives of each of the characters. As much as I would love to give this book 5 stars, I cannot because of the ending. You are left on the edge of your seat waiting for the end of the book to come, only to be left hanging by an ending that leaves things up in the air. This is the type of story that deserves a clear, cut ending.I will say this however. King's character development is at its all time best in this book. The reason being obviously because he created a whole town. Every character introduced is enjoyable. The main players are the Devil Leland Gaunt who is King's best villan ever, Sheriff Alan Pangborn who is the hero of the story, Alan's girlfriend Polly Chalmers who suffers from arthritis, Nettie Cobb and Wilma Jerzyck who spend thier time bickering and fighting, and Danforth \\"Buster\\" Keaton who is the other main villan.Needful Things is filled with comedy, romance, suspense, and overall terror. The story is well written and appealing, the characters are all great, and by the end of the story you feel like you have gotten to know a lot of them. With only one major flaw, the book is an overall treat to read."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"&quot;Needful Things&quot; is the story of Leland Gaunt, the mysterious proprietor who opens up shop in the town of Castle Rock. (King fans will remember the town from books like &quot;Cujo&quot; and &quot;The Dark Half,&quot; both of which are referred to on several occasions.) Gaunt sells anything to anyone, provided they are willing to pay the price.What I liked best about the book was that it really built up to its conclusion. I was surprised that so many found the ending lacking. It may have been over-the-top, but it got across the feeling of the mass chaos. From the beginning, I was waiting for the moment when neighbor would turn against neighbor, and I was not in the least bit dissapointed.The writing is clever and includes brilliant descriptions of each character. Point-of-view switches frequently, creating suspense and an insatiable urge to find out what happens next.&quot;Needful Things&quot; is a wonderful book that undoubtedly required much work to complete. It is not King's best work, but it is definitely near the top. What better way to say goodbye to the town we fans all know and love."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book Needful Things. The way Leland Gaunt twisted all of the other characters minds was awesome! My two favorite characters were Polly Chalmers and Alan Pangborn. the main reason I love Polly and Alan so much, is because they remind me of my own parents. I liked the plot of the story.The best part of this book was when the police and the townspeople were trying to figure out who killed Nettie Cobb. the worst part of this book was when Polly cracked open the locket that she got from the store, Needful Things, and a huge spider crawled out of it. The reason that I hated this part was because I am terrified of spiders.The plot and conflict were the most vivid. After reading the first chapter or so you could pretty much figure out what the rest of the story was going to be about. The conflict was a little more difficult to figure out, because each charcter's own problem was interlocked with another's."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I have read a number of books by Stephen King, and I think that this one has a very good idea. However, the realization is somewhat faulty. The book changes rhythm once too often, and some parts are getting a little bit boring, and you have the urge to skip some pages to get to the important part of the story. In conclusion, I think that any reader should take this book with moderate expectations and he will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"To put it bluntly, this is one of Stephen King's worst novels. As a big admirer of King, my major criticism has always been that he has a poor \\"end game\\". His ability to create and make you envision people and whole communities as if they were real, is second to none. However come the end of a story, he doesn't seem to know how to finish in a way that would do his stories justice... And for me, Needful Things is by far the worst example. Annie Wilkes would not be pleased!On a final note, this story is obviously influenced by an old Peter Cushing movie called Temptations Ltd, made in 1973, which is about an antique dealer with supernatural powers..."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Stephen King is one of those authors who are capable of making a great beginning, start an intriguing plot, and then let it all slip through their fingers and give the lamest of explanations for it. This book is not so.Aside of a good horror story, it brings a premise of human's tendency to look for easy sollutions and for achieving material without earning it. It also has a very good plot, and the best part of it is Mr. Leland Gaunt, an absolutley enchanting villain that is one of best King's character I've read about - he has some evil, dark sensuality and great intelligence you will see in Vampires, so different from King's usual devillish character we see in the &quot;Stand&quot; and other books.But there are also minuses. This book is too long, has too many undeveloped characters, and once again King relies on stereotypes more than solid characterisation which makes the book shallow at times. But, a great book - not as realistic as &quot;Cujo&quot;, not as powerful as &quot;Dolores Clairborne&quot;, not as thrilling as &quot;The Shining&quot;, but we've seen worse from King. And a little subjective note: I really do prefer Satan and occult to lame plots involving aliens."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"&quot;Something wicked this way comes...&quot; At least, that's the book that King is emulating with this unoriginal novel. A shopkeeper has come to town, willing to sell you anything... for a price. And, of course, the price is high. Wouldn't be interesting if the price was $4.50, now, would it? This book crashes to a decidedly odd end that seems to come from nowhere. It's otherworldly, with a lot of strange stuff going on. It almost seems as if King wasn't sure how to end it, so he just made a lot of supernatural stuff up to cover any and all bases. I expect that from Koontz, but not King. There is some interesting stuff going on in the middle of the book, and it is for that reason that I am giving the book an above average rating, but it is little more than above average. Perhaps this would be a good book if it was your first King experience, but as a constant reader who had read everything of his and immediately picked this up in hardcover upon its release, it bugged me so much so that I didn't read anything else by him again until The Green Mile hit the shelves."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"People give out 10's on this thing way too easily. I think we should all be a little more objective. Needful Things was a decent enough book -- a great premise that gets bogged down in the middle and kind of crashes into chaos at the end. Not one of Steven King's best. But listen, people are giving 10's and then citing flaws in the book. Could we all reserve 10's for our top 3 favorite books of all time. How about a nice, refreshing 9 every once and a while?"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"NEEDFUL THINGS has a great premise, and a good storyline. That's about it. There are far too many characters that sound exactly the same and the plot moves at a snail's pace. The characters that are good are well developed and human, but at close to 800 pages, it's too long, and its not until halfway through that the results of sinister Leland Gaunt's machinations start to show themselves. After that, when the people of Castle Rock are pitted against each other, the book gets good. But most readers will have lost interest by then. Persevere, though. Definitely one of Stephen King's weakest and darkest novels."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Unfortunately, by the time I reached the conclusion of Needful Things, I was pretty much tired of it. The concept of a store fulfilling everyone's desires with a price to pay is not exactly a new one, but I was excited to see what King would do with it. I am a big fan of his books about small towns, and read this right after The Tommyknockers, but was very disappointed.The first problem is that King doesn't make anybody in the town especially likeable. So when enemies confront one another to a usually bloody end (of note was the stomach churning scene involving two women, a butcher knife and a meat cleaver...) the reader just shrugs and keeps on reading. In nis zeal for blood, gore and more imaginative ways to kill characters, King seems to have forgotten his heart. And the elemen of surprise. How can any of us be truly stuinned by any events in a King novel when we know that almost everyone (if not all) will end up dead in the end? It's even harder to care when he makes his residents of this small Maine town about as appealing as Madame deFarge and company. Even the main characters are rather one note, and act out of odd motives. For example, what is exactly so scandalous about the way that Polly Chalmers son died? The only real scene of humanity occurs near the end of the book when Alan Pangborn visits a young 7 year old who is in a hospital bed. That scene alone has real heart to it. Not that King needs to be touchy feely, but his one dimensional characters this time all but wear saigns around their neck saying what they are, &quot;Greedy, embezzling politican,&quot; &quot;dimwitted deputy&quot;, &quot;Elvis worshipping mama&quot;..what gives? One almost feels that King himself bought the plot for this novel at the title store in exchange for his talent. He even throws in a battle royale between the towns Catholics and Baptists that not only make both groups look like half witted idiots for never verifying any pranks as truly being the responsibility of the other, but further, the cartoonis battle scene, and the animosity between the two groups (and yes, the Baptists sing, &quot;Onward Christian Soldier&quot; and the Catholics are a belligerent, (probably hard drinking) bunch) smacks of something that would have been written about earlier in the century, and not the 1990's.As for my last complaint, it would seem that in almost every book King writes, any type of same sex activty is about molestation, perversion or is caricatured so grotesquely that it would make any self respecting gay person hide. (See my review of It which I read at 15.)Needful Things is no different. In this book, our little small town homos are both, BOTH pedophiles. What are the odds of that happening? (And, as a more irresponsible tactic, King has them both in the educational system of the town. How very thoughtful of Mr. King.) It is characters like that which make me call King to task. I am not syaing he needs to write about gay characters in a positive light, but after the sundry men making passes at Jack in The Talisman, and the two guys in Chapter 2 of IT who are more disgusting than the monster itself, and the weak ineffectual king in the Eyes of the Dragon and now our dear friends, the perverts in Needful Things, maybe King just shouldn't write about gay characters at all, at the risk of alienating a large group of his fans. (And we are many.)If you want a great King read, go to Misery or The Tommyknockers. If you just want not awful, but not great, and are traveling by bus, plane or train... read Needful Things. Then leave it on the seat for the next person. No need to carry it around with you like a precious jewel, because it isn't one."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"The one star is to attract atttention. I actually thought this book was original in prose and content until...I read 'Need', a short story in a book called Beyond, author Theodore Sturgeon circa 1960. The plot and idea of this book, while excellent, as well as the outstanding prose of King combine to make this a Five-Star book. Nonetheless, the credit for this story goes to Sturgeon. For those of you who don't know, Sturgeon was an outstanding SF writer of the 50's and 60's who Stephen King obviously read. If you like King, you'll love Sturgeon who can do the same thing in thirty-five pages that King takes five-hundred for. And if you think King can write, well let me tell you, you'd better read Sturgeon!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Book came exactly as described.

If you have ever read anything by Stephen King, and liked it, or just like an involved story this is the book for you. The way King works every last character into the story is amazing. And there is still room for his expertise in describing things to real life. If I was writing a book like this it would probably be boring, but Stephen King has a way of putting life into his books. From the beginning when Brian is riding his bike to the end where Alan, Norris and Polly are watching the car leave there is a certain sent of emotion and life. In all of his books he puts emotion and thought but this is as if you are really there in the big fight at the end or in the pricipal office seeing his secret. No matter what you will love this book.

Alan Pangborn takes his place in my Pantheon Of Favorite Literary Heroes thanks to this. But my favorite character was Norris Ridgewick, the deputy. He was one of only three who could shake off Gaunt's power. There's more to him than you first see.I also liked Danforth Keeton (&quot;aka Buster, aka Zippy's Dad, aka Toad of Toad Hall&quot;).

If you are not a King fan than I must agree that this is not the book for you. This is perhaps the only truly ridiculous ending King has had. Of course he has had so-so endings and fantastic over the tops ones and the occasional ending that plays off of religion which isn't quite a bad thing really. However this ending had me feeling really cheated for days, I liked the first part of the book so much and took the time to read it and then there's this...this... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!Anyway if you are a fan I will say that the characters are all great and that if you like long engrossing stories with alot going on, this is 96 percent a fantastic book! If that wasn't very convincing, excuse me I am still quite bitter. So if this doesn't turn you against the book exactly then keep in mind that I did give it a 4 for the first 96 percent and I meant it. But also keep in mind that I told you -counting the end- this is his worst possible book that I know of. A way better book is The GreenMile and a way more rewarding long read is The Dark Tower series. Hope that helped, it really isn't worth describing the rest but here it is real quick.Smart grief-stricken cop from big city in a small town. Nice older Gentleman who may be Satan. Small time drug dealer. Corrupt counselman with pre-existing mental problems. Young woman with secrets and arthritis. Religious conflict. Town war. The selling of your soul for material posession. Ridiculous unrewarding ending. Constant Great narration [even through the ridiculous ending ]. Distinct segragation of a small town but upkeep of pop culture. Many ignorant people driven to violence, stupidity, and weakness, paranoia, jealousy and so on.

Do not be intimidated with this book's length. As soon as you get into the plot, a hundred pages wouldn't seem like much for a single sitting. The plot is intricate, complicated, and very exciting. Each action, each decision, brings up an intricate effect. The plot is based on a shop-owner who has anything anyone ever wanted, at a very reasonable price. But there's a catch to every order. A deed must be done. A simple, seemingly innocent deed done to another person. Soon, deeds build up and people become hateful.

It has something for everyone, from young to old. The prices are really low and fair and shoppers just seem to always leave happy. The store's proprietor Leland Gaunt seems like such a nice man and all he asks for when he sells his goods is a fair price and a little favor. The buyer has to pull a prank on one of the town's other residents.Sheriff Alan Pangborn doesn't like Gaunt. The sheriff also has his hands full of problems trying to settle the town down with all of the violence and hatred that has erupted. Gaunt just seems to know what to ask for to stir up the most trouble and vicious behavior. He knows that people will pay almost anything to get their wishes, dreams and desires. Ultimately many towns' people sell their souls for Gaunt's goods and it is up to Pangborn to try to save their souls and the town itself.....This is an excellent book and Stephen King understands what it takes to get people at each other's throats with vengeance in their eyes. In this story he creates a demon in the guise of an old gentleman who collects souls. Only the sheriff with his bravery can save what is left of the town. I loved this story and it is much better as a book than the movie that was later released. The movie failed to follow the book and is different in the end and it detracted from the story line in my opinion.I recommend that you read the book and watch the DVD and judge for yourself. If you are a Stephen King fan, like I am you, will find yourself liking this book and enjoy both forms of entertainment to varying degrees. I recommend this book to you as a good story!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Often times I've wondered how certain classics would have turned out were they to have been written by different authors.Let's take a classic Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded a 1740 novel by Samuel Richardson. It tells the story of a beautiful 15-year old maidservant named Pamela Andrews, whose nobleman master, Mr. B, makes unwanted advances towards her after the death of his mother, whose maid she was since age 12. He abducts her, locks her up in one of his estates, and attempts to seduce and rape her. She rejects him continually, but starts to realize that she is falling in love with him. He intercepts her letters to her parents; reading them, he becomes even more enamored by her innocence, intelligence, and continuous escape attempts. Her virtue is eventually rewarded when he sincerely proposes an equitable marriage to her. In the novel's second part, Pamela attempts to build a successful relationship with him and to acclimate to upperclass society. The story, a bestseller of its time, was very widely read but criticized for its perceived licentiousness.Now imagine this story told instead by Bram Stoker who actually wrote the novel Dracula.As another for instance, how about Frankenstein which was actually written by Mary Shelly. How would that story have been different if it had been written by Mark Twain instead.One of the great things about the volume of Stephen King's writing is that, sooner or later, you know you'll see his take on many stories that have already been out there. In this one King takes the additional step of letting readers know at this outset that Needful Things the supposedly last of his Castle Rock stories is actually an homage to the great Thornton Wilder play Our Town.Like Our Town, Needful Things endeavors to give readers a God's eye view of a community in crisis. In the case of Our Town the crisis varied depending on which individual you were dealing with but in the case of Needful Things of course all everyone's crisis had the same root cause: Leland Gaunt.At first it seems that Leland Gaunt is just another second hand trader, a close cousin to today's Pawn Stars or American Pickers except that the goods sold by Gaunt all seem to be just what the buyer wants...at any price. As it turns out Gaunt's Castle Rock customers ulitmately end up paying ultimate prices for the small trinkets they've gotten from Gaunt.The hows and whys of all this of course are best left to a reading of the story itself. But as with any King novel those who for a good time and an even better scare won't be disappointed.Unlike Gaunt's wares, Stephen King books only take a little of your time and money...not your soul."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I buy these for my mother, she is 98 years old and unable to read anymore.

Can we ever do anything without causing another person some issue? Is it possible that we all jump to conclusions about those we suspect before looking at the facts?

I saw the movie after reading it, and thought it was awful, compared to the book. I bet if I didn't read it I would like the movie, but the movie had none of my favorite characters. They kept it story-wise with the Alan and Polly. Thank god they kept Wilma and Nettie! Which is one of the BEST ever written deaths in a Stephen King novel. This was also a funny book.

Cyndi Rose Martin was next and she got exactly what she wanted too. In fact ALL of the residents of Castle Rock got exactly what they wanted most or had almost dreamed of and for a very reasonable price...the money price that was, but Leland Gaunt made them pay in other ways, too...This is the last book Stephen King has written that is based in Castle Rock - and if you are going to go out you might as well go out with a bang which is exactly what he has done with this book - and done incredibly well at that! I cant say too much without spoiling the storyline but this is an absolutely amazing book, by far one of Kings' best and the ending is one of the cleaverest, most well thought out endings I have ever read!

Alan Pangborn, sheriff of Castle Rock, is very keen to meet the newest business owner in town, one Leland Gaunt. Word is Needful Things has a little something for everyone in town, so why can't the sheriff seem to catch up with the new proprietor?Needful Things is right up there with a lot of old school king stories. A very large book of almost 800 pages and a story that doesn't let you down. From the start you have a gripping story and despite the book's length it doesn't have any flat spots throughout. A reasonably large cast keeps things moving along quite nicely but you never feel like you're getting lost.I wouldn't put this up there with the more \\"horror\\" style of King's other works, but Gaunt is a wonderfully realised antagonist that you can smell evil on him right down to the thread on his clothes.If you're looking for something to bury your teeth into for a week or so then Needful Things might be just what you are looking for. How surprising."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"No one quite does it like Stephen King. He has proved that for over three decades with countless horror novels. This one is no different. It's almost 700 pages (I have the hardcover) but it goes by fast. It's also the last in a series of books about a fictional town called Castle Rock, featured in earlier novels such as Cujo and The Dark Half.The plot, while seems a little silly at first, is also interesting. A new shop has arrived in Castle Rock called, you guessed it, Needfull Things. The owner, Leland Gaunt, has something for everyone here at low prices, and the deal to play a prank on someone. The novel switches points of view rapidly, so it has a fairly large, balanced cast of characters. The two main characters are Alan Pangborn and his lover Polly Chalmers. Alan, as you may remember him from previous Castle Rock novels, is the sherrif who is trying to get over the death of his wife and son. Anyway, back to Gaunt. He is no ordinary man, and he uses powers to make people play the pranks. Each prank causes a chain reaction that soon ends up with the whole town killing each other.In the tradition of King, it is entertaining to read, especially near the end, where it gets crazy, and you'll find yourself rapidly turning to pages to get near the end. If you like King, weird stories, or horror, I reccomend you to check this out. But read the other Castle Rock stories first, because they all are connected.By the way, King's coming out with a new novel this year, and, excluding the total pages of the Dark Tower series, it might be his longest. So far the manuscript is at 1500 pages. I guess age hasn't slowed him down a bit."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Another King masterpiece.

The same applies with &quot;Needful Things&quot; which did nothing but keep me glued to my seat in anticipation of the obvious climax.The language that King uses in this book amazed me, and if you really examine it, the descriptions and characters are extremely well built. He is an underrated author in terms of his literary merit. Many view King as a shock-value author who doesn't have any redeemable qualities in his writing. This is a completely bull-headed view and as many anecdotes have proven, King has a special ability to keep a reader interested and constantly thinking about the book when he isn't reading.It's too bad that King relies on the killing of animals as a way to induce &quot;horror&quot;. His writing abilities should be more than enough to resort to killing household pets as a way to elicit groans of horror.The only real downer that I felt was the ending. It seemed to me like a rehash of the ending to IT, and for those who have read both IT and &quot;Needful Things&quot;, I think the similarities are striking."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful Things by Stephen King was probably one of the books I've read so far. The book catches your attention right when it starts. It keeps you guessing throughout the entire book,&quot;what's going to happen next?&quot; It's a pshycotic thriller. One thinks &quot;How is this happening?&quot; But after a while, you no longer care, you're too enthralled by what's going on. Stephen King really brings these people to life. He releases the demented thoughts or fantasies from the dark recesses of one's mind, igeniously. The entire book as a whole is great. The ending might leave you hanging a bit, but the entire book makes up for it. Might there be a sequal to this fascinating horror story or a spruced up version of &quot;Mr. Guant?&quot; One can only hope.

I know there is much lost if you are listen to rather than read a book- albeit an unabridged, 18 hour version- but this book is read by Mr. King himself. The book is entertaining, enlightening, and a fine piece of writing. It is often so expedient and uplifting for reviewers to trash something that they feel does not meet their expectations, but this is an enjoyable story. And as other reviewers have noted before, there is a morality play at work. But, for me, it is not that either. It is the intricate detail that King creates. The way he describes certain aspects, be they the type of tin horses that Buster Keaton falls in love with or the foxtail that Hugh Priest cannot live without; these images and characters are left indelibly in your mind. Of course, it helps when King is actually reading them to you, but even if he is not, the book is simply riveting and eventually satisfying. There is something satisfying beyond the hyperbole of the disaster that befalls Castle Rock, and it is in that aftermath- the calm- that the reader actually sighs him/herself, disappointed that it is about to end but hoping that there is more down the road. Having learned that King writes 4 hours a day, we know that there will be more."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I don't know if I'd commit murder for a statuette or if I'd throw turkey dung on someone's washing and break all their windows for a baseball card but that's exactly what happens in this book.

I certanly reccomend it."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I loved this book, not only because King wrote it, but because the book was created off of human emotion. Mr. Leland Gaunt, owner of 'Needful Things' lived off of human desires and what they literally and ultimately would die for. See, Mr. Gaunt knows everything and knows exactly what it is that you like or want. He knows that before he even meets you. And he lets you have the item desired for the money in your wallet and a small &quot;trick&quot; of some kind to be played on someone. He knew Brian Rusk would do anything for a baseball card and knew Polly Chalmers would just about 'sell her soul' to rid her of her severe and agonizing arthritis. His charm is only skin deep because Gaunt is an evil being who tries to destroy a town by 'hot-wiring' them to their enemies. He leads a trail to a certain person to make it look like it was them who 'played the trick' but in essence it was somebody else. The book should keep your interest the whole way through, simply by wondering what will happen next.

Stephen King manages to leave a place he has written about and loved for so many years with the respect and dignity he so rightfully deserves. Needful Things is a compelling novel that takes you through the depths of the human soul in which like everything else is always for sale. Just how much are you willing to sacrifice for material things? Like always King manages to leave that aura of mystery for his antagonists in this case, Leland Gaunt. It makes you wonder: Was Leland Gaunt the devil himself or his next of kin?

It is vintage King at his best; a great read"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I have been a fan of King for years, and it is simply a given that when one of his novels come out I am in the bookstore that very day, plunking down whatever the asking price for a hardcover copy. There are many horror novel fans (believe it or not) who will tell you that Stephen King is a pulp author whose talents are based solely on the ability to toss off a 900 page book with an interesting sounding plotline every fall or so, but we true fans know that King's writing is much more than that, that he is a master storyteller capable of entertaining, shocking, and frightening at the same time. Needful Things is a prime example of King at his twisted best. The story centers on King's now mythical town of Castle Rock (undoubtedly an unlucky place; it is the site of Cujo and The Body to name a few of King's other works). A small rural town such as Castle Rock cannot help but take interest when a mysterious stranger breezes in and sets up shop (particularly a shop with a name as enticing as 'Needful Things'). The proprietor, one Leland Gaunt, can offer the residents of Needful Things whatever they want... for a price. Literally, the hopes and dreams of every person in town is somewhere on Gaunt's shelves, and as it turns out, most of them are willing to do anything to buy them. Of course, Gaunt doesn't simply take money; he requires a favor of his clients, in the form of a small service (usually a seemingly harmless prank or act of vandalism inflicted on another citizen). The people of Castle Rock are only too happy to comply, and that is where King really begins to spin the yarn. You see, Gaunt is very intelligent and very wicked. He uses the weaknesses and prejudices of the residents of Castle Rock against them, and soon his seemingly random series of pranks begin to connect, and suddenly the good folks of Castle Rock are set against one another, paranoid, vindictive, vengeful people who will do anything to protect their 'needful things'. Eventually, the killing begins. King turns his characters into killers and monsters in a frighteningly believable way, and ties the characters together in ways that will make you sit back and marvel at his storytelling. Obliviously assisting Gaunt is Ace Merril (yes, the same character from The Body, played by Kiefer Sutherland in the film Stand by Me) A criminal all his life, Ace harbors a hatred for Castle Rock that Gaunt cultivates and nurtures. The only thing that stands between Castle Rock and damnation is our hero, sheriff Alan Pangborn, who distrusts Gaunt and attempts to unravel his evil scheme (those of you who read King's The Dark Half will recognize Pangborn; he is one of its central characters as well). I must say after all this that I was less than impressed with the dramatic, climactic ending, which I found to be more than a tad cheesy and unfulfilling. However, the story leading up to the less than agreeable ending is well worth the mild disappointment. I would recommend Needful Things as a very enjoyable and exciting read, right up there with King's best works (the very best of which is the magnificent Eyes of the Dragon, which I will review some time in the future). If you are a King fan, Needful Things is a must, and if not, then I suggest it as an entertaing alternative to whatever your area of interest might be"},{"Title":"Contagious Holiness: Jesus' Meals With Sinners (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Not a book for cuddling into a comfy chair with tea and cookies, Contagious Holiness is a scholarly treatise which explores deeply into its subject. And if you think this subject is settled and unchanging, think again. Higher criticism- which isn't so high after all- has taken aim at Jesus and His eating habits. Blomburg sets out, most successfully, to show that Jesus quite deliberately ate with sinners-like you and me, and even better and worse folk-lovingly inundating them with His contagious holiness.Number 19 in IVP's New Studies in Biblical Theology series, Contagious Holiness first looks at meals in the Old Testament, then during the intertestamental period, and how these meals impacted the New Testament era. The meat of this book is next considered, a deep discussion of the why's and wherefore's of Jesus' eating with sinners, and what His pervasive purity accomplishes. The conclusion discusses how the church, in a world where eating is degenerating into lonely fast food pig outs, can apply all these lessons to reach people for Christ. All of the footnotes appear conveniently within the text. An exhaustive bibliography and a couple of relevant indices helpfully close this volume.Distinguished professor of New Testament and prolific author, Craig Blomburg capably keeps strictly to his subject and, while sometimes sending the lay reader to a dictionary, manages to keep his audience very interested. - Donna Eggett, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"Contagious Holiness: Jesus' Meals With Sinners (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Contagious Holiness by Craig Blomberg is the third book from the New Studies in Biblical Theology series that I've read. The series has proven very challenging, but equally as rewarding. This installment was no exception.The previous two books, Adopted into God's Family and Slave of Christ dealt with theological threads appearing all throughout the New Testament; namely the metaphors of adoption and slavery. After reading them, large portions of scripture gained a great deal of new meaning, simply because the metaphors used suddenly had more meaning. In Contagious Holiness the effect has not been as dramatic, or exciting.Blombergs intent in writing was to explore Jesus' meals with sinners; who was he dining with? What was the dining experience like? Most specifically, his intention was to investigate recent claims that Jesus' mealtimes with sinners would have reflected the Hellenistic tradition of symposium. A social party or club, often characterized by excessive eating, drinking, sleeping, philosophical conversation and sometimes sexual entertainment--even orgies. If this were the case then Jesus' meals with sinners were not only with the worst of the worst, but in the worst of the worst scenarios, and what's more that would not demand repentance or life change.Blomberg effectively searches the scriptures through the Old Testament, as well as non-canonical text, to investigate whether or not the Jewish culture of Jesus' day had become Hellenized to the point of participating in symposium. From there he moves to a thorough exegesis of all synoptic gospel accounts of Jesus sharing meals with others.Blomberg's writing is dry, and sometimes slow, but this has been characteristic of this series thus far, and is worth putting up with.While I didn't leave this book with a new perspective on scripture, I did leave with a more complete perspective on scripture--more specifically on Jesus' ministry. I wouldn't recommend this book to an average reader, but to someone wishing to delve more deeply into scripture, this book will be an encouragement, if you stick with it!"},{"Title":"Contagious Holiness: Jesus' Meals With Sinners (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Notwithstanding its title, this book is not really about holiness (though its central insight on that topic is invaluable). Rather it is a book about the social and theological significance of meals in the Bible. The author sets out the current debate over whether Jesus' meals with sinners involved genuinely wicked people or simply those who did not live up to the overly particular standards of ritual purit y laid down by the Scribes and Pharisees. To arrive at his findings he surveys meals in the Old Testament, Jewish and Graeco-Roman meals in the inter-testamental period, and finally the core texts in the Gospels that deal with Jesus' meals with \\"sinners.\\" The sixth and final chapter discusses some contemporary applications of Blomberg's finding that the practice of Jesus eating with sinners subverted the rules of ritual purity so that far from Jesus becoming contaminated by contact with sinners, it was they who became \\"contaminated\\" by contact with him! His holines rubbed off on them as they came into contact with his transformative presence.It should not surprise us that with the arrival of Jesus the meaning of holiness should undergo a revolutionary change. In the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth, while there is direct continuity with Old Testament concepts of holiness there is also radical reinvention. For one thing the \\"location\\" of holiness is moved. \\"Holiness looks different now\\"; it looks like Jesus (see Stephen C. Barton, \\"Dislocating and Relocating Holiness: A New Testament Study,\\" in Stephen C. Barton., ed. Holiness Past and Present (London and New York: T & T Clark, 2003), 197-98. ) In the holy character of Jesus there is a contagious power present to make holy all who come within its influence. Kenneth Walters sees this as the heavenly realm encroaching upon the earthly realm in the person of Jesus so that \\"where contact with God once meant destruction for any earthly being or object, contact with God in Christ now means sanctification and life.\\" (Kenneth L. Walters, Sr., \\"Holiness in New Testament Perspective,\\" in Kevin W. Mannoia and Don Thorsen, eds. The Holiness Manifesto (Grand Rapids, MI and Cambridge, UK: Eerdmans, 2008), 52.Historically the church has \\"fenced\\" the Lord's Table so that entrance to fellowship with Jesus has been carefully guarded. The early church practice was to limit access to the Eucharist to the baptised. The Puritans looked for evidence of a conversion experience and this remains the usual practice among Evangelicals. Methodists have often taken an \\"open table\\" approach based on John Wesley's conviction that the Lord's Supper was not only a confirming but also a converting ordinance. (His own mother was brought to full assurance at Communion). He welcomed \\"penitents\\" (what we today might call \\"seekers\\") to come to the Table and thus take a step closer to saving faith. The practice of an \\"open table\\" has become a contentious one among some Methodists and a difficult stance to take in an ecumenical context where baptism is normally seen as the rite of entry to the Table, in keeping with the practice of the ancient church. In the argument from Wesley's practice of inviting people who had not undergone a conversion experience to approach the Table, it is often forgotten that those Wesley addressed were for the most part baptised as infants and could therefore be admitted to the Table as a way of confirming the grace received at baptism in a conscious act of faith. Those who argue for an open table on the basis that Jesus \\"ate with sinners\\" and that this is after all, his Table, not ours, make a more persuasive point. Do we exclude for the sake of maintaining clear marks of discipleship? Or do we include for the sake of bearig witness to Jesus' \\"contagious holiness\\"? Blomberg's book will be must reading for those who are seeking to answer such questions from a textual basis."},{"Title":"Contagious Holiness: Jesus' Meals With Sinners (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Craig Blomberg's Contagious Holiness: Jesus' Meals With Sinners is the 19th contribution to the \\"New Studies in Biblical Theology\\" series (D. A. Carson, ed.). It traces a biblical theology of meals from Genesis to Revelation so as to provide the context for more deeply understanding the significance of Jesus' meals in the gospels, especially in the gospel of Luke.The first chapter surveys the practice of meals in the Old Testament, noting especially the role of meals in defining who is - and is not - a member of the community. The second chapter surveys inter-testamental developments, concluding that such developments are largely in line with the Old Testament pattern, and arguing that the Roman symposia do not play a significant role as background for Jesus' meals in the gospels. The third and fourth chapters then survey the gospel material - focusing first on general material in the gospels, and then on material unique to Luke's gospel.Over against the Jewish expectation that eating with the wrong people would result in one being defiled, Jesus practiced what Blomberg helpfully calls \\"contagious purity\\" or \\"contagious holiness.\\" Jesus clearly expected that, by eating with those who were excluded from the community, he might be able to bring them into the community by way of faith and repentance. This theme of repentance is one that Blomberg skillfully defends, in opposition to the claims of Sanders and others that Jesus ate with sinners without calling them to repentance. Jesus' meals were radically inclusive, to be sure, but not as a means of accepting the sin of others. Rather, it was a means of graciously calling others to a restored life as part of the new people of God by faith in him.Blomberg weaves other themes through the gospel meals as well: the Lord's Supper, and especially the Messianic banquet of Isaiah 25, a theme that he believes is central to many of the meals in the gospels. Referring to the meals in Luke 24, he writes:Instead, one thinks again of the coming eschatological banquet. ...if Jesus' table fellowship prior to the resurrection foreshadowed the Messianic banquet, and if his resurrection implies that the Messianic age has begun, then \`This scene is a foretaste or anticipation of the messianic banquet with Jesus as host' (159).Blomberg then concludes with a chapter discussing provocative ideas for how the church today might carry out the life of fellowship via meals that Jesus so clearly lived in his ministry. The book of Acts portrays the church carrying on that way of life, and doing so in a way that is intended to give shape to the life of the church today.This book is highly recommended as a study of an important biblical theological theme, as well as helpful contribution to studying the Gospel of Luke in particular."},{"Title":"Contagious Holiness: Jesus' Meals With Sinners (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Blomberg offers a thorough survey of the Biblical role of meals and food, and he also surveys the same dynamic during the inter-testamental period. His book works toward the climax of Jesus' meals with both \\"sinners\\" and the religious. He examines the meals described in the gospels, explains them and exegetes them in depth. The book concludes with I think a too brief application chapter that resembles a summary of several of the emerging church books I've read. Blomberg offers some subjective experiences of churches using meals as outreach and fellowship tools, as well as churches doing initiaties with community meals.The book is well written and the Biblical exposition is thorough and scholarly. The approach of the book is too academic I think to be considered moving or inspiring; although, it is still enlightening. It certainly demonstrates the usefulness of meals in ministry.Blomberg addresses the Lord's Supper in a cumbersome manner in the final chapter. I wish he would have taken more time and care to include a separate section on the relation of the Lord's Supper and its continuation in the church to his thesis. He seems to even mention it apologetically not wanting to turn off readers from a non-liturgical tradition.The book is actually 180 pages of text followed by sources and indexes."},{"Title":"And Still I Rise: Selected Poems","review":"This book captured me.

The poem from which the collection derives its name, \\"And Still I Rise,\\" is a stunning and beautifully written testament of the courageous strength of those who fought to break the bonds of slavery and ultimately bring civil rights to our nation. Much of the collection also provides readers with a unique insight into African-American culture through Angelou's use of diction, rhyme, and subject matter. This is illustrated most poignantly by the first lines of Angelou's poem, \\"Ain't That Bad?\\"Dancing the funky chickeneating ribs and tipsDiggin' all the latest soundsAnd drinking gin in sips.The most intriguing poems of this collection though are the uncommon love stories--the way Angelou at one moment returns us to the remembrance of our first true love and the next moment shows us the other side of love--one that might leave us angry and bitter. This dichotomy is seen when comparing the love poem \\"Refusal,\\" which is focused upon a love that transcends time, upon our notion of \`soulmates' perhaps, to the loss and pain of love found in these lines of the poem \\"Men:\\"One day they hold you in thePalms of their handsThen they tighten upA little moreThe hurt beginsUltimately Angelou has chosen to name the collection after the famous poem \\"And Still I Rise.\\" This is a fitting choice for the collection, which serves as a history of sorts: a history of slavery, of the fight for civil rights, of the fight of women, of the path of love."},{"Title":"And Still I Rise: Selected Poems","review":"Dr Angelou is one of America's most talented andinspiring writers"},{"Title":"And Still I Rise: Selected Poems","review":"IT GET'S YOU TO THINK ABOUT ALL THINKS IN LIFE WORK, SCHOOL, COMMUNITY, FRIENDS, ETC.

While this book is acceptable, in that it does list the trails, I find it very difficult to use. My biggest gripes are about the ride organization, the directions to the rides, and the lack of detail in the illustrations/maps. I would advise the author to pick up John Zilly's \\"Kissing the Trail\\" to see how a ride book should be done.The rides are not well organized. Most books group rides by locality or by difficulty (or both!), but this one does it alphabetically--not useful to those new to the area. Along those lines, the author makes the initial effort to number rides in the table of contents to correspond with the overview map of New Jersey but fails to carry it through in the rest of the book. The result? The poor reader cannot easily flip amongst the rides and figure out where they are on the NJ map. Instead, he has to cross-reference all the rides to locate them.Directions to the rides are rather poor. As has been pointed out in a review of the previous edition, the author assumes you know a lot about NJ. I have to use Google or Mapquest to really figure out how to get there.The maps and illustrations leave something to be desired. I feel the clarity that the author attempts to offer sacrifices the detail needed to help both locate the ride and to keep from getting lost. Also, while the perforated maps are a nifty idea in concept, the reality is they don't hold up well to the sweat and mud of mountain biking.

It is so much more than a simple romance novel. It takes an honest look at a time in history when life was not particulary kind, especially to women. Moira was taken away from everything that she'd known and forced to live among strangers that did not understand or accept her. She manages to survive and adjust to an extent, but suffers in various ways constantly. She is an outsider and always remains so, even her children seem strangers to her. Moira is loved, but in a destructive kind of way. Eirik and Harald bounce restlessly around the world, dragging Moira and her children with them. She seeks peace and happiness in a place she could call her own, but although simple, this is completely out of her reach. Years pass. This book is not a \\"happily ever after\\" kind of book. It's up to the reader to figure out if Moira finds what she is looking for at the end. I loved it. I would compare it to \\"Winter Serpent\\" by Maggie Davis-another excellent novel."},{"Title":"Northwind","review":"Moira is a handful. The spirited and fractious daughter of Donough lives with her older sister Rea and her aged father. The girls bicker and dream of their futures, until a Viking raid upon Lairge disrupts their peaceful lives forever. Moira is taken away by Eirik Ivarsson. After a tumultuous clash of cultures that estranges them, they finally achieve common ground to build a future upon. Unfortunately, Eirik is hot-tempered, and he is forced to flee Norway. He leaves Moira and their son Gyle with his sister Halva, promising to return for them. A year goes by. Then Eirik and his half-brother, Harald, return for Moira, kidnapping her from their sister's home, forcing her to leave Gyle behind. They take to the rivers with Jarl, Harald's older brother, to make their fortunes. Through a series of adventures and misadventures, they travel from Hedeby down the Dnieper to the fabled Constantinople, and eventually back home to Norway.But a dark destiny overshadows the Ivarsson House. Harald is hopelessly in love with Moira. Their ways are very different from hers, and the brothers have great difficulty understanding her. Moira understands much more than the brothers suspect, and chooses the only path that will lead to peace, thereby confusing them even more. She longs for home, but the definition of that word means something different for each of them. Together, they ride the Northwind, seeking their place in a very tumultuous and hostile world.NORTHWIND is a deceptively simple story. It is a love story, but it is more than a love story. It is a hard, unforgiving look at a time in history where human life was up for grabs and so very cheap. The winds of Destiny, guided by the mighty northwind, fling the Ivarsson House like so much chaff, but the power of love and duty, the two great forces guiding human behavior at this time, wage war upon its caprices and ultimately triumph. The author does not offer insights into the characters' thoughts, relying instead on their actions to reveal what they are thinking and who they are. Nor does the author offer apologies for those actions. Judgement, apologies, explanations are left to the reader. The characters are skillfully drawn, and the poignant, bittersweet story will float hauntingly through your mind long after you've read and re-read it."},{"Title":"In the Wake of 9-11: The Psychology of Terror","review":"In the Wake of 9/11: The Psychology of Terror (Washington: American Psychological Association, 2002), Tom Pyszcynski, Sheldon Solomon and Jeff Greenberg.Many have observed that America will never be the same in the wake of the terrorist attacks on US soil on the morning of September 11, 2001. The sudden impact of the explosions, captured in vivid detail and replayed over and over again on television, fundamentally altered the illusion of invulnerability that Americans had enjoyed since World War II. Beginning almost immediately a host of Middle Eastern analysts and academics of all stripes supplied an endless stream of hypotheses concerning \\"why they hate us\\" and the general nature of terrorism, all in a well-meaning effort to come to terms with a national tragedy.But to plumb the depths of terrorism one must look beyond the sound bites, beyond the narrow focus on Middle Eastern politics, beyond popular opinion concerning the supposed differences between Islamic and Judaeo-Christian cultures. This is one of the chief accomplishments of In the Wake of 9/11: The Psychology of Terror. Its authors have succeeded in recasting the psychology of terror against a general theory of human nature. Working in the tradition of cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, they trace the roots of terrorism to the troubling yet inescapable reality of human mortality. Becker long ago proposed that there exists at all times a latent fear of death that threatens to upend societal equilibrium. To shield ourselves from the ever-present threat of death anxiety, we seek to bolster our self-esteem through group loyalty. Hence competing worldviews threaten us at a very deep level.Becker's prolific publications were hailed by many as brilliant and garnered him a Pulitzer Prize (for his 1973 classic, The Denial of Death). But he was unable to gain widespread acceptance within the academy. His interdisciplinary methodology ran contrary to the emerging trend toward specialization. And there was the recurring criticism that his bold and far-reaching ideas, while intriguing, were ultimately untestable. Like many pioneering visionaries, Becker's death was followed by a period of neglect and dormancy.That changed with the appearance of three social psychologists (Pyszczynski, Solomon and Greenberg) who possessed the ingenuity to do what others said could not be done: put Becker's ideas to the test. Their results demonstrate conclusively that Becker's ideas are not only theoretically compelling, they are empirically verifiable. Years prior to the devastating events of 9/11, they were testing and developing what came to be called \\"terror management theory.\\" Fine tuning Becker's ideas, they discovered, among other things, a clear and testable relationship between the awareness of mortality and hostility toward those who appear to subscribe to a different worldview. More specifically, they found people who were asked to consider their mortality would be more favorably predisposed to people who shared their basic world view, and conversely, more negatively predisposed toward outsiders of one kind or another. These findings fit both the surge in patriotic hoopla and the hostility toward foreigners in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.While acknowledging that \\"terrorism results from the interaction of a wide range of social, political, ideological, and psychological forces,\\" the authors set out to \\"illuminate the psychological aspects of the problem\\" (p. 187). The result is a veritable calculus of depth psychology that identifies the factors inclining groups toward violence. Drawing from their cumulative research efforts (spanning over 150 empirical studies) the authors provide a concise overview of their research (Chapters 1-3), then proceed to apply their findings to the social and cultural milieu of post 9/11 America (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 is devoted to the application of terror management theory to Islamic extremists, while Chapters 8 & 9 point to the way out of the cycle of violence. Acknowledging the enormity of the issues and the gravity of the current socio-political state of affairs, the authors suggest that hope resides in new, more inclusive worldviews that are neither too rigid nor too diffuse.Much has been written concerning Becker's allegedly bleak view of human nature and his seemingly macabre fascinations with humanity's destructiveness. But those familiar with his writings can attest to his great compassion for the human condition and the reverence for the \\"life force\\" that sustained his long descent into the night. \\"In ways that are yet unknown to us, this spirit will continue giving birth to its own possibilities\\" (Becker, Angel in Armor, p. 118). In the Wake of 9/11 adds another important chapter to the story Becker so urgently wanted to tell."},{"Title":"In the Wake of 9-11: The Psychology of Terror","review":"This book explores our recent experience of terrorism through the lens of psychological research into the impact of \\"death anxiety\\" on human attitudes and behaviors. By the end, we readers have been carried far beyond The Obvious - that death anxiety is aroused by threats to our lives --- and smack into Surprise and Dismay: Surprise, to realize that \\"death anxiety\\" is a constant in human nature that is also aroused by perceived threats to anything with which we identify or through which we give meaning to our lives. And Dismay, to realize that death anxiety itself, is a root-cause of human violence. No, that doesn't mean that all of us are physically violent, nor does it mean that psychology alone explains human violence or terrorism. (The authors, true to their multidisciplinary commitments, push the analysis well beyond psychology.) It does mean, however, that we cannot understand or hope to diminish violence without insight into the human factors that contribute to it. The authors paint an accessible but realistically complex picture of the causes and the impact of the events of 9/11, and although they offer no easy answers... their research and analysis give rise to new insights into our human and historical predicament. This is powerful, provocative reading, and while it is often disturbing, it is also peculiarly satisfying because it has the ring of truth. Whether or not you agree with everything the authors say, you will finish this book with new and revealing ways to think about human nature, individual and collective violence, the struggle for meaning, and the demands of and obstacles to freedom and tolerance.Here's some more detail on how the book unfolds:The \\"psychological lens\\" here is Terror Management Theory (TMT), developed by these authors in the effort to test Ernest Becker's claim that the human fear of death is a source of \\"human evil.\\" (See especially his Pulitzer Prize winning Denial of Death.) Pyszczynski, Solomon and Greenberg explain how that research was conducted (over about a 15 year period) and present the findings. These chapters can be challenging for those unfamiliar with psychological research methods, but their frequent summaries and conclusions keep the reader on track as the evidence accumulates in support of Becker's claims and TMT. Next, the authors use TMT to analyze the American confrontation with terrorism on September 11, and our responses to it, both individually and collectively. Then they explore the causes of terrorism, adding to their psychological analysis, historical, religious, political and economic factors that must be considered. Here too, the application of TMT leads to some unexpected insights. In the end, their concluding suggestions point towards comfortably familiar \\"American values\\" but with uncomfortably honest reminders of the challenge they present us."},{"Title":"In the Wake of 9-11: The Psychology of Terror","review":"Written with a rare combination of wise hesitation and committed passion, this book has so much to commend it is difficult to know where to start. In short summary, this book presents a well-argued 'take' on current political terrorism, as well as public reaction to that terrorism, from the perspective of Terror Management Theory (TMT). TMT is an increasingly important area of social psychology that was originated explicitly as an attempt to subject Ernest Becker's main ideas to empirical testing. The robustness of the theory is now causing many heads to turn that 20 years ago quickly passed over Becker's ideas as 'speculative philosophizing,' unworthy of serious attention from social scientists. One of the great values of this book is that they have taken all of this two decades' worth of research and boiled it down to two concise chapters, in which they both lay out the research results itself in coherent format and discuss its significance in the context of Becker's wider theories and relating it to other current material in the social sciences. In subsequent chapters, as they lay out the psychology of terror, focusing both on the terrorist mentality itself, but even more so on the public reaction to the events of 9/11, the theory genuinely springs to life with cogent illustrations of each point from the very newspaper headlines we have all been recently reading ourselves. The feeling is that of reading 'lived history' in which the reader is also an intimate actor as well as an interpretive observer. This is easily the most riveting interpretive account of these events I have seen in the growing mass of 9/11 literature."},{"Title":"In the Wake of 9-11: The Psychology of Terror","review":"As a \\"self-styled\\" student of Ernest Becker myself, I take a special interest in this brave book. I am writing a book myself on racism in America, and Becker's paradigm on the Science of Man and the social and existential psychology that it rests on (mostly death denial, mortality salience and death defiance), as well as the \\"American worldview,\\" also will serve as the basis of my own theoretical platform. So, one cannot imagine how excited I was to see these brave men launch a first foray into the use of Becker's paradigm as part of a set of testable hypotheses.As a trained scientist (Mathematician and Operations Research Analyst) and quantitative behavioral scientist (advance degrees in International Relations Theory and Political Science), I read this book with great enthusiasm. In many ways, it looks very much like my own Phd thesis: It develops (or appropriates) a suitable theoretical framework (TMT), forms various hypotheses (about death defiance, mortality salience, the American worldview and how 911 disturbed the American reality and conscience), collects appropriate data (reactions of victims to the 911 experience), and then proceeds to try to test those hypotheses using the most suitable tools available (subjects of psychometric and social psychological experimental test designs, etc.). This is all to the good.If the reader allows the authors to get away with this smoothly developed tableau, there is very little to complain about here. However, since I too am going through the same exercise, I have a few questions to raise: of the same sort that have plagued my own research.For instance, how can the authors so causally speak of the \\"American worldview,\\" (which, in the background, does most of the heavy lifting), and is the most pivotal of all concepts in their research design), as if it is a \\"given\\" without first properly delineating its content and tracing out its outlines? It certainly is not enough to assert that: \\"national identity is a large component of most people's worldview.\\" This is the beginning, not the end of an analysis of worldview.In these authors design, the \\"American worldview,\\" remains essentially a black box, indeed an unopened (possibly cocked and loaded) black (pandora's) box! I believe that if they unlock this box, rather than presume to know and thus able to intuit its contents, they will discover the all kinds of things will come tumbling out:The \\"American Worldview\\" as a psychological construct is a house of horrors that cannot be intuited or taken casually for granted. Once opened, they will discover, as I did, that it is a fantastically complex, not just multidimensional, but more importantly, a multilayered psychological construct, that never quite stops unraveling. At the very bottom (not at the top) of this multilayer psychological chain is of course death denial. And as one ascends the chain of sublimated complexity, one discovers, not just death defiance and mortality salience, but also many other things that are equally as \\"weighty\\" as death defiance and mortality salience: things such as an almost existential dependence on and a preference for a \\"barely transparent racist ideology,\\" a very localized and parochial set of contradictory moral rules, a specter of sex and violence at every turn; dependence on strange and contradictory religious concepts and beliefs, and on an avowedly white male \\"hero system\\" all couched in a social hierarchy that often contradicts the much revered notions of freedom, independence, and democracy, just to name a few. These go well beyond just national identity.And while it is true that these all inevitably do connect in one way or another back to death defiance, mortality salience, and thus ultimately back to death denial, the connections are never straightforward or linear ones. They are invariably very circuitous and tenuous connections, and there exists, equally plausible alternative explanations for each of them. And most of all, there is very little that can be assumed about the construct of \\"an American worldview\\" itself, or about the connections to it as the variables upon which it depends, proceed up the psychological chain. Nor indeed is there very much that can be assumed about the way these disparate elements and their respective connections are to be properly \\"weighted\\" in the larger overarching concept called \\"the American worldview.\\"Because so much of the authors design depends on how the \\"American Worldview\\" is conceptualized, this is not a casual matter at all. It is not a matter that can be easily ignored or simply glossed over as simply, a matter of \\"national identity.\\" If the assumption is that it does not matter how the \\"American Worldview\\" is conceptualized, since all roads inevitably lead directly back to a deeply sublimated death denial anyway. Then that is no longer just an assumption, but amounts to a grand global meta-hypothesis that is larger than, and indeed engulfs the whole research design itself. Such a large meta-hypothesis cannot be allowed to enter the research through the backdoor, but must be wrestled with, up front. And at the very least somehow be acknowledged and defended, if not proven out right.I of course have not finished the book, but hope that this is the only major concern. For bravery alone the book merits five stars."},{"Title":"In the Wake of 9-11: The Psychology of Terror","review":"Pyszczynski et al have done a fine job of presenting a theory of the human emotion of terror. However, most people browsing in Amazon.com would be more interested in books explaining terrorism. Terrorism is an extreme form of violent, political activity; terror is a profoundly distressing human emotion. The two concepts are distinctly different, and readers interested in the former will be disappointed to purchase a book on the latter.Having said that, Pyszczynski et al have done a good job explicating what they deem their -- existential-evolutionary theory -- of how humans manage the fundamental, existential terror inherently associated with the contemplation of one's own mortality, and by extension, the meaninglessness and finitude of existence. Basically, unable to tolerate the thought that we are all transient, meaningless specks of dust in a vast, indifferent universe, we busy ourselves investing in goal-directed activities to win cultural approval, gain self-esteem, and derive existential solace in the thought that we are important parts of a larger, meaningful, enduring cultural enterprise that, collectively, achieves a kind of super-organismic immortality.After explaining the theory itself in an interesting manner in the first three chapters, the authors present two long, research-based chapters, in which they review dozens of controlled studies done, predictably, on undergraduate college students, in a reasonable attempt to demonstrate empirical support for aspects of their theory. Good enough for a solid, thoughtful, interesting psychology textbook. What follows, however, is somewhat of a change of topic, and, perhaps, an unreasonable attempt to capitalize on the sensationalism of the 9/11 attacks (the book was published only shortly following the terrorist attacks of 9/11/01).The authors shift from their very attractive theory of terror, and specifically -- terror management -- how humans handle our moments of existential terror - to a theory of terrorism - and that portends a rapid deterioration in quality and insight. The chapters that follow find the authors presenting an embarrassingly shallow theory of terrorist motivations and behavior, and a sophomoric, platitudinous, solution to the problem of world terrorism: yes, indeed, it is so bad that they actually have a chapter on how to solve the problem of world terrorism called, quote -- Give Peace a Chance -- unquote. Ouch! The second half of the book is actually a good example of how quickly good scholars can plummet into an abyss of ill-informed gibberish once they stray outside of their area of considerable expertise.The first part of the book is good enough to merit a stand-alone text, but the second half of the book, in which the authors behave as if nothing of significance has ever been written about the psychology of terrorism, is so fatuous that it is embarrassing and painful to read. Many people, I fear, will buy the book due to the current intense interest in understanding terrorism, when in fact, the better reason to buy the book is to better understand the complex set of human emotions related to how we struggle to deal with the fact of our inevitable mortality.Larry H. Pastor, M.D., Oakton, Virginia"},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Mike Carey, Lucifer: Devil in the Gateway (Vertigo, 2001)Lucifer was always one of the more interesting characters in the Sandman universe, though he didn't get much screen time. Enter Mike Carey (John Constantine: Hellblazer), who takes the threads Gaiman left in Sandman and runs with them. Lucifer, having abdicated his throne, is now the owner of a small bar/club in Los Angeles, playing the piano and mingling with the natives with his longtime companion Mazikeen. That, however, does not stop him from messing in mortal affairs every once in a while. But there's more to it than that-- it seems Heaven will, with distaste, use Lucifer as a hitman when it doesn't wish to get its own hands dirty. And thus we meet Amenadiel, an angel with a mission: to hire the Lightbringer. Wheels within wheels within wheels; the Gaiman legacy is in good hands.As much as I enjoyed the all-too-brief Death spinoff, the stories never held the complexity that was both Gaiman's atmosphere and his greatest strength. Carey, on the other hand, is a perfect channel for it. I admit I like this book a great deal more now, having read volumes 2 and 3, than I did when I first read it; so much of this is setup that it doesn't feel like a great deal actually happens. Rest assured, though, the series takes off quickly just after this. ***"},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Quick, if you haven't already done it, you need to read a synopsis of John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" on Wikipedia - just the good parts about how John Milton, a goodly Christian, seemed to make the Adversary the hero of Paradise Lost. Or at least, the most interesting character.Then, I highly recommend you not only read a little about William Blake's \\"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\\" on Wikipedia, but actually invest the time in reading it (it is short, and available free on line). It will make up for all the poetry you were supposed to read, but didn't, in high school and perhaps college as well.Or at least know that \\"Lucifer\\", the graphic novel, stands in a long tradition of literature that has literally turned the Bible on its head, and cast the traditional villain as the hero. Or at least, as the most interesting character.Yet \\"Lucifer\\" is not blasphemous. It may well be heretical - I love the cross-mythological excursions into other cultural and religious beliefs - but it is not disrespectful of God, of Christ, or of the Bible. It is simply a religious noir thriller, and also, in some ways, follows in the tradition of Hollywood noir. I mean - Lucifer owns and operates a piano bar in Los Angeles? How appropriate, a bar named \\"Lux,\\" or light, operated by the original (before his rebellion) angel of light, in a city called \\"the angels.\\"\\"Lucifer\\" doesn't merely cross over into other cultures and religions, it exhumes the Bible and Christian beliefs themselves - there are so many angels, and classes of angels, and did you know Adam had a wife before Eve, named Lilith? (This is apparently from 8th-10th century Jewish folklore, although a class of demons known as lilith existed in the Bible ... as did the mazikeen, which is the name of Lucifer's consort in the graphic novel, one of the daughters of Lilith.) I think Mike Carey must have spent a _lot_ of time in the library and raised a _lot_ of eyebrows by his choice of books. But you don't have to be a scholar of Jewish folklore, of comparative religions, or medieval theology (how many angels _can_ dance on the head of a pin?) to enjoy \\"Lucifer,\\" any more than you need to know Magick to enjoy \\"Hellblazer\\".Vol. 1 of \\"Lucifer\\" begins with a commission from the Most High to His most rebellious angel, which of course echoes the modern popular culture motif of fighting fire with fire, sending out the Dirty Dozen, or a gunfighter, or a rebel to restore the very order that the authority itself cannot restore - and in order to get Lucifer to \\"volunteer\\" an almost impossibly good deal is dangled in front of him, a deal which is so good that the angel delivering the message and the offer would rather have Lucifer reject.The first third of Vol. 1 follows Lucifer as he investigates the cause of the magickal phenomenon which is threatening to unravel the very order of things. To investigate, he must visit a group of Lillim (Lilith's children, who believe they have the right of return to the Garden of Eden since they are not Adam or Eve's progeny, but Lilith's, and hence not subject to the ban); then he must take a young, disaffected woman on a spirit quest through Navaho mythology to end the source of the problem.The story, told thusly, is simple; but the richness of character details, of humor, the level of WRITING is far beyond what we are used to seeing in graphic novels. You have to read (actually read, not skim) the text and look at the illustrations at least three or four times to begin to put it all together, it is so richly condensed. This is not bang bang, boom boom super hero action. It is a political story set in a richly magical, and religious, universe that we have not inhabited since before the age of technology. Nowadays we live on iPhones and computers and GPS tracks our whereabouts. There are no monsters left, only serial killers, and no aliens, only NASA on Mars. For a writer and some illustrators to create a literary \\"pocket universe\\" in which the technology and \\"normal life\\" exist, but overlaying that normal life and behind it are Biblical wars and intrigues of epic dimensions - that is an amazing accomplishment.For example, in the second third of Vol. 1, Carey introduces the Basanos - very reminiscent of the medieval Tarot, but also very different and independent. A lesser writer would have used the traditional Tarot; Carey re-invents and repurposes it. The locale moves from Los Angeles (with cabaret and warehouse district) and New Mexico to the seamy nightlife of Hamburg. The mortals whose stories are backgrounds to Lucifer's larger mission are a female cabaret singer, a young gay Middle Easterner, and a neo Nazi longing for acceptance into a hate group. The divines are an angel whose singular self appointed task has been to write down, and save, everything written by any human thinker of any importance, and whose obsession has been to craft a fortune telling pack of cards whose characters literally take on a life of their own.But wait - in between main story arcs, the angel left in charge of Hell sells off Lucifer's wings to an Easterner in exchange for a batch of human souls from the Easterner's hell. Not that the angel would do anything to hurt Lucifer, but the opportunity to bring more souls into his Hell is simply too appealing. Those wings will become quite important in Vol. 2 - and are a good example of _nothing_ being just a side story or \\"throw away\\" in Carey's meticulously plotted wheels within wheels \\"Lucifer\\" series. Unlike \\"Hellblazer\\" with has multiple story arcs, \\"Lucifer\\" is really designed as a limited run series - it has a beginning, middle, and end, and while there are side stories an supporting stories, it all fits together over the course of the series.For example, the THIRD story arc in Lucifer seems like one of those \\"throw away\\" stories unrelated to the plot line. Far from it. The little girl introduced in that story, Elaine, takes on quite important dimensions later in the series.I have to confess that I first bought 3 vols. of Lucifer in 2005 but didn't give them the attention they deserved. I was put off by the title - I still have some of that old fear of fire and brimstone in me. But this is literature, not a celebration of evil by any stretch of the imagination, and the greatest risk to your \\"soul\\" in reading these is Free Thinking. Your morals are in more danger from our current obsession with serial killers and from books like Silence of the Lambs, than from this series, which simply posits that most of the Bible is true, then overlays that assumption with \\"and what if other religions and folklore are also true\\" and then weaves an amazing story focused on what appears to be the chief villain in our own beloved Bible. No horns or tail - just a tuxedo, pale blond hair and a deceivingly effete look (how beautifully angelic as an angel! how disturbing as the first among fallen!) along the lines of David Bowie/ Peter O'Toole (Michael Fassbinder can play him if \\"Lucifer, the Mini Series\\" ever comes out), instilled with all the wit and deviousness displayed by the Serpent from the Garden of Eden - yet, in one chilling and revealing moment at the end of Vol 3, _not_ a pet Terminator, as he displays all the cruelty one could ever fear (\\"you came into MY house without knocking, and then you prayed to HIM!\\") with no leavening compassion or mercy. He honors his word; but offers nothing more.And by the way, did I mention that Mazikeen is surely one of the \\"hottest\\" femme fatales in literary fiction?"},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Though his story telling is nowhere near as compelling Neil Gaiman, Mike Carey does a decent enough job. The series would only get better as it progresses."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Lucifer resigned as ruler of Hell, got Morpheus to cut off his wings, and moved to Los Angeles to open an upscale piano bar called Lux in the pages of Neil Gaiman's Sandman in the early 1990's. Then Vertigo Comics decided to bring him back in 1999, with then up-and-coming writer Mike Carey at the helm.Lucifer being Lucifer, the piano bar business seems to have become a bit boring. So when an angel comes calling with a mission from God, Lucifer accepts. Primal, prehistorical gods threaten to undermine Creation, so off Lucifer goes, at a price, to save the world.After that, the Lightbringer heads off to Hamburg to get a divination. As the magical colony organism that is the world's first Tarot deck has escaped its prison, things get pretty hairy there, too.As Lucifer is a manipulative, scheming creature whose saving grace is that he never lies, a lot of the weight of interest in these stories falls on the supporting characters, human and otherwise, whom we meet along the way. Lucifer's loyal servant Mazikeen returns from Sandman, while a host of one-off and recurring characters also appear. Lucifer, tricky as ever, has an audacious plan that will ultimately unfold over the book's seven-year run.Carey already shows a deft hand for weirdness and drama amidst supernatural beings and humans, one that would only grow greater as his career progressed.

I really like how it shifts back some into the past of Lucifer when he was among the heavenly hosts. It gives a bit of insight into the past. I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Mike Carey brings back Lucifer from the Sandman series for his own storyline complete with uncooperative angels, a girl who sees her best friend's ghost, a teen unsure of a unusual roadtrip with Morning Star and a tarot deck gone postal. Can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"If you like your literature dark, lurid and intense, feel free to indulge in Lucifer. The mere concept is rewarding to think about but seeing the personification of the prince of darkness as he goes about his day is as gratifying as it can get. Cool and cruel best describes Lucifer but he's mainly just trying to enjoy life since he got fed up with his dayjob so to speak. If you've read and loved Sandman, Preacher, or Kid Eternity, you're going to love Lucifer. Get ready for one hell of a ride."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Okay, this isn't Neil Gaiman's genius level work. What is? But this is the first work I've seen in the Sandman universe that's worthy of Gaiman's imagination. It is compelling, horrifying, enthralling, and true."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"This is collection of comic books for mature readers that starts here in the year 2000 and the series recently ended a couple months ago so you know it's modern and current. Lucifer first appeared in the critically acclaimed Sandman series, and like its source, is very racey for a comic book featuring nudity and swearing, right up my alley for someone who prefers R rated horror films if only out of curiosity and familiarity with the R rated- 18 and over. This is very similar to Vertigo's source The Sandman for those reasons, only in here Lucifer appears as a sympathetic character, a hero who appears like an angel- a blonde man with wings. I was surprised this was not very scary at all, as Lucifer is the hero does no mad deeds. Now, these are not your typical virgin 12 year old kiddie comics, DC published the Vertigo imprint for mature readers to suit a variety of literary tastes. After buying 3 or four issues and then finding Lucifer comic number one for cheap at local stores, I found the series to be addicting. The swearing and nudity became predictable as did the dark, brooding atmosphere, made me want to come back for more only if for the same thing. I think that it takes balls for a mainstream comic publisher like DC to make comics that bo beyond your basic super hero in spandex saves the day."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"It took ages to arrive. The series is amazing but the service was not....It was bent to hell when it arrived. It's very unsatisfactory....."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"\\"I admit, I'm not well versed in Gaiman's work.\\" Boy, that's true, since Neil Gaiman didn't write this.! You seem to be unable to grasp the obvious. As for the comic, it's above average but not fantastic. The artwork is great but the story is only average. Still, it's a very promising idea and can't wait to see what is don with it in future installments."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"I admit, I'm not well versed in Gaiman's work. Apart from reading 2 TPB's of the Sandman several years ago which I had borrowed from a friend, I am mostly clueless about the world his stories revolve around.Therefore, I evidently did not grasp the level of wonderfulness which apparently abounds within this book, according to my fellow reviewers.For me, the road to purchasing this book began at the Vertigo site. There I viewed some preview pages, and I was enchanted by the fabulous artwork of Scott Hampton. The characterrs seemed flawed and appealing; real and human, something that I thought would allow me begin investing some emotion in the story, assuming they would be recurring characters. Add in Lucifer (at this point simply my assumed concept of Lucifer as a character) for a bit of the old supernatural kook, and we would have our book. Something which I would enjoy reading. Sadly, this magical vision of how the book would be, did not pan out.Most of the first story within the book held my interest firmly within its grip. Unfortunately, Carey for some reason decided half way through to begin rushing us through scenes treating the characters with seemingly no regard! Nor any regard for the reader who is not well-versed in Gaiman's world of literature. Should there be a warning label on this book for clueless comic store browers so that they fork out for however many Sandman books there are (15 or so?) to get a grip before continuing onto this series?After the disapointing detriment of the first story due to Carey's rushed conclusion and bizarre treatment of characters, we are suddenly plunged into \\"A Six Card Spread\\", a confusing mix of germans speaking english while demanding that other english-speaking germans speak german, and horrible art (compared to the artistry of Hapton's painted panels). From this point on, artistically and storywise it's a major downhill spiral. It eventually hits rock bottom. \\"Six Card Spread\\" felt like the 'difficult second album'.Luckily, Dean Ormston comes in to save the day with his simple dark style of art, and picks up the ending of the book for a relatively ok Carey story (at least in comparison to the previous one) leaving the whole book evening out for a slightly below average 2 stars out of 5.My suggestion : DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU ARE A DIEHARD GAIMAN FAN. Or unless you are one of those fat 40 year olds business men who can spend all their money at the comic shop because they have a cushy job and no children. Unemployed non-Gaiman literate humans beware.I am not even sure if diehard Carey fans will get a kick out of this. I've read some of Carey's work on Hellblazer, and I have found it far superior to his work here. Lucifer is perhaps the least likable protagonist I have come across in a book or comic. Nothing in the way he behaves, the way he speaks (not to mention his bizarre and offputting penislessness (?!) makes for a remotely likable character. His inhumanity, his lack of want and need, his dry and to-the-point dialogue which spills out when necessary (usually it seems to tell people he has \\"no time for them\\" or that he wants something) with occasional flares of horrid 'sassiness' don't make him endearing as I'm assuming Carey meant for him to be. Generally to make a 'bad' character likable they need an ounce of 'cool'. Lucifer is a void of cool.So far from what I have read, the characterisation is vapid and bordering on non-existant for the rest of the cast too. This may come down to not understanding Gaiman's world, and there's things going on deep within the characters that I'm not privvy to at this point in the story. It is nice when there is something on the surface of a character though. As far as likable characters, Rachel Bagai was as it close as it came to likable for my money. Everyone else just seems to be moving through their motions unrealisticly and with zero sense of humanity, depth or motivation. Mind-numbing. (And hell, even Arseface is easier to understand than whatever Mazikeen is going on about whenever she starts mumbing.)Also, the tone of the books just feels too watered down for my liking. Perhaps it's keeping in line with the feel of Gaiman's work, but for me, this book could have really shot to some great heights based on the core material of it. Which I think is what is most disapointing. Conceptually quite nice, but it gets beaten to death in the execution.So in conclusion. If this book (and 'Children And Monsters' which I am currently half-way through) are any indication, this series will be a very average, monotonous and not remotely challenging or fun read, with zero character development, zero likable characters, and zero challenge for our protagonist as he goes through the motions of setting up whatever he has planned while rarely giving us glimspes into whats going on, and framing everything with a seemingly random series of substandard artists doing visuals.And who really wants to waste money getting the start of a story they never want to finish. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this book. Simply not worth reading unless you're a Gaimanophile and desire anything at all which may mention Dream and Death! Ooooh. And they don't even INCLUDE THE COVERS IN THE BOOK. You jarringly just slam from one story to another without any seperation or cover art. Poor work by whoever put together the collection.Final words : Go read Preacher. You'll have a MUCH better time."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"It takes some arrogance, worthy of the Prince of Lies himself, to claim, as this book does, that the book is based on characters created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, and Mike Dringenberg. I would think that, at the very least, John Milton might have some prior claim on the creation of Lucifer, the fallen angel, but in the legal shenanigans of the comic world, what that claim is actually revealing is that this graphic novel is a spin-off from Gaiman's incredibly popular Sandman series. As such, it shares a lot in common with Gaiman's re-envisioning of mythology. In Sandman: Seasons of Mist, Lucifer resigned from his post in Hell, had his wings cut off by Dream, and \\"retired\\" to host a nightclub called Lux in a distorted reflection of Rick's from Casablanca, although in Lux, Lucifer plays his own piano. This book and series picks up where that left off, opening with a visit from an angel of the host to Lucifer to offer him a job for whatever price Lucifer will name. Thus begins the wheels-within-wheels that is the hallmark of this series.In his introduction, Gaiman states that whenever another comic writer would ask him what he thought should spin-off from Sandman, he always told them \\"Lucifer,\\" which is likely not what any of them wanted to hear, instead hoping for dream assignments (pun intentional) like Death, Desire or Destiny. But, as in most things relating to his comic, Gaiman was spot on. He had already covered the possibilities with the Endless, while Lucifer was the perfect protagonist: extremely flawed yet ultimately intriguing, charming and deadly, full of pride but also hubris. Lucifer is the character you don't want to like, but you can't help yourself from doing so because, unlike the throne of Heaven, Lucifer is much more like us. The Bible may say that man was created in God's image, but our personalities were grafted from Lucifer.This collection has three main story arcs: \\"The Morningstar Option,\\" where Lucifer fulfills a job for Heaven, and shows that he's a right bastard to any who doubted; \\"A Six Card Spread,\\" in which Lucifer attempts to discover if his payment from Heaven has any strings attached that he wasn't aware of; and \\"Born with the DEAD,\\" which seems ancilliary to the ongoing story, as it's about a young girl who tries to figure out how and why her best friend died with Lucifer showing up near the denounement to provide a favor which will put the girl in debt to him. There's a thread of story that weaves through these three, but, as in Gaiman's Sandman, it will take at least another three or four collections before you start to see the resulting weave that begins here.Each arc has a different team of artists. I appreciated Scott Hampton's work on \\"The Morningstar Option\\" the most, because his art is both exact and yet abstract, almost dreamlike in its openness. The art by Weston and Hodgkins for \\"A Six Card Spread\\" is too realistic for a horror/fantasy comic, which works in this case by making some of the uglier parts of the story even uglier. \\"Born with the DEAD's\\" Pleece and Ormston ply a middle ground between realistic representation and a Marc Hempel-style abstraction. Their's is the kind of art that I don't like for its own sake, but works extremely well with the story."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"I thought it was great, just great.Carey functions within Gaimen's world, yet he goes way beyond stale imitation. Weaving together eclectic mythological influences, he makes a series that is very much uniquely his own. This series contains many elements I don't think many authors could make work. How do you build up, ehem, sympathy for the Devil? With a main character of such incredible skill and power, how do you put him in suspenceful situations. Similarly, how do you get him out of those situations without it looking like a silly Deus Ex Machina?I've only read this first trade paperback of the series. Sure, there a lot of open questions, but that's the way it should be. This is, on the whole, a darker series than Sandman, it's mostly about despair and imprisonment, whereas Sandman conveyed a fair bit of hope and freedom. But you have to consider the main character.Overall, the only comic to make me want to stick with the Sandman Universe."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Well I am a huge Sandman and HellBlazer fan and the Morningstar was definitely one of my favourite supporting characters.I did not have much trouble jumping into this trade with all my background knowledge from Sandman and my reading of mythology.Readers new to the Vertigo line of comics may find this series at first confusing.So please bear in mind that things are really explained in the next two trades. After careful readings &quot;Lucifer: The Divine Comedy&quot;, &quot;Lucifer: Children and Monsters&quot; and &quot;Lucifer: Inferno&quot; you really appreciate the intricate weavings of the story.Going back to this first trade, I found myself going, &quot;oh that is what he was talking about&quot;. After all, Lucifer has an almost cosmic awareness and it is an interesting twist that he sees and hears more than even the reader."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"It's been over a decade since Sandman #23, in which Lucifer closed up Hell, had his wings cut off, and (as we later learned) opened a night spot in L.A. Now he stars in his own saga, under a new team of writer and illustrators. The result is the most successful to date of the various attempts to keep the Sandman franchise going since the climactic events of Sandman #69. As is usually the case with compilations from an on-going series, &quot;Lucifer: Devil in the Gateway&quot; leaves too many loose ends to entirely succeed as a stand-alone graphic novel. Nevertheless, the cast of characters and original stories are very much worthy of its progenitor. The stories in this collection aren't really dependent on familiarity with the Sandman series to understand what's going on. Still, Gaiman's Sandman is a classic and the keystone of DC's Vertigo line to which &quot;Lucifer&quot; belongs, so I would recommend reading at least the collections &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; and &quot;Season of Mists&quot; first. Those who have done so are very likely to enjoy following these new tales of Lucifer."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Mike Carey had the daring task of following Neil Gaiman's portrayal of Lucifer (from the Sandman series)and he has passed the test with flying colors! Carey's Lucifer,IMHO,actually surpasses Gaiman's and that is a very difficult thing to do. Even though he is devious and shrewd, you can't help but like the guy! This book contains the three issue &quot;The Morningstar Option&quot; from Sandman Presents and the first four issues of the regular series which has been nominated for five Eisners. Read this book and give the devil his due!"},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"Positive reviews makes me curious about any comic book and I picked this one up with high expectations, after I finished I was a bit dissapointed because it didn't filled up all my expectations.Lucifer series is a bit slow moving and vague for my taste but I heard that it gets better and I'm looking forward to read the next issues.Carey's writing is stylish and erudite and his main caracther is well developed.The art of Chris Weston is very good ;unfortunately he left off after issue 3 and was replaced by Peter Gross(Books of Magic).In some parts Lucifer lacks narrative drive and demands attention because Carey loves cryptic sentences.Overall a good comic book but a little overated too."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"I've been reading mostly manga over the past two years, so what surprised me most about this comic (aside from the most obvious differences, ie., color, dialogue-heavy, etc.) was that the illustrators in American comics appear to be disposable, exactly opposite from the Japanese system.The first story in this comic is illustrated by Scott Hampton who draws a beautiful, lucid version of a Mephistophelean-type, world-weary Satan bored by the absurdity & impermanence of this universe. His beauty is matched by his exquisite courtesy.The second story is drawn by Chris Weston (I guess...it is not always clear who is responsible for character design amid all the pencillers, inkers, and colorists listed) who draws Lucifer as a thug with the expression of someone who has bitten into something really sour or is, alternatively, in need of a really good laxative.I found Lucifer's expression jarring enough but then he has been graced with a hairstyle reminiscent of Barbie's Ken. I mean, I know Japanese illustrators are far more concerned with a character's hair than their American counterpart, but come on people, do you really think even the ex-King of Hell would settle for hair that looks like a plastic bottlecap?Apart from these quibbles about the graphic part of the graphic novel, the story is excellent. The plot is involved but precise and never insults the reader's intelligence. I've only read this first book, but there is obviously much more to come & I'm looking forward to Lucifer's struggle with the angels & whoever else comes up. I plant to read the whole series."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"In Neil Gaiman's \\"Sandman\\" series, Lucifer Morningstar - the devil - was a fairly minor character. During the \\"Sandman\\" series Lucifer lost his wings, resigned from hell and went on to pursue other unknown activities. In \\"Devil in the Gateway\\" we finally learn what happened to him - that he started running a nightclub in LA. \\"Devil in the Gateway\\" contains three stories.The first one tells us how Lucifer is being contracted - by none other than God almighty himself - to eliminate some ancient competition: terminate someprimordial gods. I think this was an interesting story, but it didn't have Neil Gaiman's \\"magic\\". It just didn't have \\"it\\".The second story tells about Lucifer's encounter with an angel - an encounter which gives strange superpowers to a mortal. Again, this was an OK story, but I didn't find it to be particularly good.The third - and the shortest - story tells about a young girl who has magical powers. Lucifer barelyappears in this story. Nevertheless this one was my favorite story - it was a definite improvement over the previous two.All of these stories tie in together - but this pretty much happens in the next graphic novel. Overall, the stories were good, but felt unfocused, vague - and sometimes just plain cryptic. Even though this is Neil Gaiman's world, Mike Carey did not capture its spirit successfully. I was hesitatingwhether to continue with the series, but (as I later found out) it is totally worth it. I recommend this graphic novel mainly because the sequel is much better!"},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"I was deliberating whether or not to review this since it's a few years old, but so on the offhand chance some of you Sandman fans haven't read Mike Carey's Lucifer, you really should.The connection with Neil, is that it uses his interpretation of Lucifer fromThe Sandman Vol. 4: Season of Mist (Sandman New Editions), and spins him off into his own series. There's a quote from that book which goes a long way towards informing the character as depicted in both series. It goes, \\"Why do they blame me for all their little failings? They use my name as if I spend my entire day sitting on their shoulders, forcing them to commit acts they would otherwise find repulsive. \\"The devil made me do it.\\" I have never made one of them do anything. Never. They live their own tiny lives. I do not live their lives for them. And then they die, and they come here (having transgressed against what they believed to be right), and expect us to fulfill their desire for pain and retribution. I don't make them come here. They talk of me going around and buying souls, like a fishwife come market day, never stopping to ask themselves why. I need no souls. And how can anyone own a soul? No. They belong to themselves...They just hate to have to face up to it.\\"This is right before or right after Lucifer announces that he's quitting Hell because he's grown bored, and when Dream asks him what he'll do, he replies perhaps he'll take a walk on the beach, or learn to play piano.In the first graphic novel of the Lucifer series we find him playing piano... in the most exclusive club (Luxe), in the city of angels, Los Angeles. But the quiet life of leisure is ill suited to the morningstar's temperament. It's a big, sprawling, epic story, with another war of angels, a cameo by Death (Peachy!), and even God (who learns a thing or two from his wayward son). But at it's core, it's a story about fathers and sons. And about Lucifer trying to free himself from the grip of predestination. That feeling that, rule hell, quit hell, no matter what he does, it's according to the old bastard's plan. In other words, a son leaving the family business in order to strike out on his own, and finding himself making the same old decisions, conducting his business the same old way as his dad once had. Even as he strains to be unique.But it's no namby pamby feel good story. This is Lucifer after all. He may not be intentionally evil, but he is so self absorbed, and so obsessed with his own goals, that the consequences and collateral damage of his actions don't even enter into his deliberations. He's the protagonist, but he's not the hero.She doesn't show up until much later in the series.He is however, a wonderfully complex, and fascinating character and if it were turned into a movie, all the Hollywood stars would be beating each other with sticks for the chance to play the role. Men and Woman.Like all great stories, it utilizes the simplest themes written in the largest scale and I can't recommend it highly enough. If you like dark fantasy, this is your cup of tea. I envy you reading it for the first time. I've thrice myself and I must say (heresy, I know) I enjoyed it even more than Sandman. Although, quite frankly, it could never exist without it. Still, give it a whirl. You might like it."},{"Title":"Lucifer Vol. 1: Devil in the Gateway","review":"This is more of a review of the series as a whole rather than this individual volume.There's nothing positive that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other five star reviewers (and a good deal of the four star reviewers). In the interest of full disclosure, I consider Gaiman's Sandman series to be the greatest sequential art/comic/graphic novel series of all time. In a bit of a catch-22, to me, Carey's Lucifer would hold that honor if Sandman didn't exist...and yet it wouldn't exist if Gaiman had never penned Sandman.If you've read Sandman and liked it, there's a good chance this is up your alley. If you've read Sandman and hated it, this probably isn't for you unless you have a particular attachment to angelic mythology.My only gripe is that DC hasn't issued an Absolute edition for this series."},{"Title":"North African Odyssey: Adventures in the Mediterranean Theater of War","review":"An American tank commander tells in his own words the long overdue story of his distinguished Sherman tank company in North Afica and Sicily.

The main problem with the book: there are no attributions to the quotes, and no info on Hepburn herself. There is a bibiliography, so if you're really meticulous (or a little odd), you can research everything and get the dates of the quotes; otherwise, you're left high and dry as to information about the material.There is also very little info on the actress herself, just a very short (2-3 pages in an undersized hardcover) snippet of a biography. There is also no speculation on the quotes themselves. While that gives the readers free range for interpretation, again, knowing the dates would have been nice.The reason I gave it four stars instead of three: one of the pictures in the beginning of the book. It may appear elsewhere, but I don't know. It has Hepburn sitting in a plane with a flight helmet on. If you don't have this picture, buy the book just for it alone--talk about those cheek bones!!!

If you are expecting more than a hundred, you'll be disappointed, but the 100 characters presented here are done so with clarity: 2 pages dedicated to each character. On the left, you have the character in simplified and traditional format (which is important, depending upon where in Taiwan or China you're reading Chinese), common ways and examples in which the character is used, an explanation of the component parts and significance of the character, and the etymology (evolution from the ancient pictograph into the modern), and on the facing page, there is a worksheet for practicing writing the character. Having studied Chinese for about two years in preparation for Chinese medical school, I feel the best way to remember these characters is to write write write! I was quite surprised to see that one reviewer complained that etymologies are offered here, since the symbolic significance and make-up of each character has really helped me to remember and differentiate between similar characters. (Sometimes you can really see the original meaning in the ancient script!) One thing this book could have had to further aid in memorization and usage is additional workbook type exercises and sample practice reading sections to help bridge the gap between this series and the rather dense Chinese Medical Chinese that follows. In terms of price, to be honest, having already studied a fair amount of Chinese, I think I would have paid 5 bucks just for a copy of the table of contents and done the research on my own. But for the beginning student, you're paying not only for the text, but for the assurance that it's been presented by a traditional Chinese medical language authority and veteran translator.If you liked this book, the second, Acu Point Vocab, follows the same format and the third, Materia Medica Vocab, can also be found online elsewhere."},{"Title":"Chinese Medical Characters Volume 1 Basic Vocabulary","review":"I gave this book 4stars because of its ease of usability.

This is Vol. one, and each of the next volumes will coaver more characters. I hope they publish them all in one book, before I graduate from TCM school.

The nine white women who contributed to this book the stories of their development and their involvement in the civil rights struggle were of that last category. They never really saw themselves as particularly strong or smart, although their writing shows them to be exceptionally articulate, and none of them were brought up by their families to become involved in that fight. They took it upon themselves to make their own stands and become part of that effort regardless of the personal risks. &quot;Deep In Our Hearts&quot; is aptly named - what springs out at us from their stories is their simple strength, the heart-deep commitment to social justice, that helped make this country face up to its promises to all of its citizens. That they came from genuinely different backgrounds reflects the diversity that sets our country apart and which puts the lie to common assumptions about them, such as that they were born of affluent families from the northeast and went south with Ivy League educations and high-flown notions of setting things right. What is also remarkable about their stories and their lives is that they have continued with that commitment to equality and fairness in varied ways; they never saw fit to rest upon their laurels once this nation recognized, in words at least, that racial segregation and discrimination were wrong and brought down the obvious barriers to equality. These little stories, none more than forty-eight pages long, also spell out how their subsequent involvement in combating the Vietnam War was a logical progression, the same struggle on a different front. Although some of them became front-line soldiers in the fight to free women from their own set of shackles, all of them contributed to modern feminism and women's rights more by their actions than by their words. To them, and to the many whose stories who are not in this book, we all owe a debt of gratitude. If not for them this country may not have been able to look itself in the eye in the bathroom mirror. The collective lesson of these stories is that one need not come from uncommon beginnings in order to develop the will to lead extraordinary, adventuresome, purposeful lives. Read their stories, be inspired without being preached to, and put some meat on the dry bones of history."},{"Title":"Deep in Our Hearts: Nine White Women in the Freedom Movement","review":"Imagine leaving your comfortable world as you knew it in the erly 1960's. Young white women; some from the north, some from the south. Rural and urban, college kids, middle class, working class and just plain poor. Heading to a dangerous world and joining the early days of the Civil Rights Movement. Leaving behind the scorn, disdain, and ridicule of family and friends. Walking into a climate of hate and bigotry, and joining in civil disobedience against segregation. Walking in the picket lines, sometimes fearing for your life; organizing, and joining in singing hymns of freedom. Going from tears of frustration to smiles of great joy, while hitching a ride on that freedom train and holding on for dear life.One recent eveing at Northern Lights Book Store and Cafe in St. Johnsbury, Vt., 70 people heard two local women who participated passionately in that movement. The authors read from their book, Deep In Our Hearts: Nine White Women in the Freedom Movement.The book is an eloquent and powerful one that takes us back to one of the most tumultuous periods in American history; the erly days of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Freedom Summer, voter registrations, lunch counter sit-ins and the rise of Black Power and the women's movement. Deep In Our Hearts is a collection of essays, that take us into the lives of a group of young women who were transformed by the Civil Rights Movement.The audience listened as Penny Patch looked back and read softly. \\"I understand well that what was between us will never be again, but still, that experience remains at the core of who I am. The fact that some of us had deep friendships that crossed all racial lines is simply a miracle. For short periods of time, in those early yers, we leaped over all the history and all of the minefields between us.\\"Perched on a stool and sipping warm tea to sooth a sore throat, Theresa Del Pozzo read from the book. \\"My involement with the movement began as a moral reaction to the blatant injustice of segregation and the denial of basic human rights of African-Americans. Along the way I got an education in the intricate patterns of racism and began to experience what I think as the small-c culture of the African_American community: the wisdom, dignity, strength, humor, gentleness and creativeness of its everyday life and people. The experience of living within the black world changed forever the person I was to become and the way I live my adult life.\\"Listening to the authors as they told their stories one could not help but admire their courage and admire this courageous book. They stand as powerful testaments to a time when the goal of universal justice was truly in sight and to the hope that a new generation of blacks and whites will take up the challenge to make the world a better place.Marvin Minkler of the North Star Monthly"},{"Title":"Deep in Our Hearts: Nine White Women in the Freedom Movement","review":"Just finished reading &quot; Deep In Our Hearts&quot;, a book I'd like to strongly recommend. It captures on a very personal level, the spirit of the Civil Rights era, from the perspective of nine different white women who were deeply involved in the struggle to bring about more racial justice. It is a moving tribute to all the heroes of that very difficult time. To all who were involved at the time or those who are the least bit curious of &quot;what went down&quot;, you cannot fail to admire the stories of these brave women. This is history (herstory) as it should be related-from the participants."},{"Title":"Deep in Our Hearts: Nine White Women in the Freedom Movement","review":"Often around Atlanta, where Connie Curry still lives, I'd see her as she progressed on editing this vivid and now canonical record of women in the civil rights movement, which have been followed by others - Jewish women, but not, yet,so far as I know, \\"black women,\\" perhaps because so many have written individual books - from Rosa Parks, to Bernice Johnson Reagon, to Shirley Chisholm, and many more. She talked about how difficult the project was, yet the collective story of these women, some from my region, like Sue Thrasher from Tennessee, or Dorothy Burlage from Texas, North Carolina and Tennessee, (places she 'served') others from up North, like Penny Patch from Vermont, all speak in differentand complimentary ways about the transcendent events in which so many of us jumped into, were 'swept into,' or simplyobserved with shocked attention, up close. An advantage of this book for teachers, is the possiblity of assigning a profile from the student's own state or region, for reading and report. An advantage for readers is the diversity of views represented. An advantage to all is the existence of a classic collection, which, I predict, will be used a long,long time in teaching about the movement. Howard M.

Reading this autobiography made me feel as though I was spending time with a dear friend, engrossed in his stories. At the end of each chapter, I rushed toward the next, wanting to know more about this boy who became a man, his experiences and those that shared the journey with him.

The Guidebook provides an excellent bibliography for further reading. Although, it covers the basics in a comprehensive fashion for such a slim volume (65 pages), from the time commitments normally expected of directors to the limits of indemnification, I would recommend new directors also purchase the ABA's Fundamentals of Corporate Governance: A Guide for Directors &amp; Corporate Counsel. That volume provides more in depth coverage of many of the same areas, discusses controversial issues and is complete with brief descriptions of relevant cases.

You are drawn into the dram from the very beginning, and it's hard to put it down until you're finished. Beyond the appeal of the fast-moving action and unfolding drama, what's unique about these novellas is that they are also think pieces.

This biography was very informative about his life, albeit, a little slow in the childhood and beginnings but it picked up nicely. It was interesting to know that he came from a very prominent and wealthy family in Texas. His personal life was chronicled in a thorough way and I felt the book was very much worth reading. I bought it and put in my library of Hollywood memorabilia and history."},{"Title":"Zachary Scott: Hollywood's Sophisticated Cad (Hollywood Legends Series)","review":"Ronald Davis wrote a previous book about Van Johnson, the still living star of the boy next door type whose sexuality was much whispered about in the 1940s. But, as Davis says of himself, as an author he's no scandalmonger, so much of what makes Van Johnson interesting was absent from Davis' biography, and I imagine Zachary Scott was more interesting than the dapper cipher presented here.Obviously something went wrong at every stage of Scott's life, though his parents never let him down and supported him financially through his last days. He failed to become a topflight Hollywood star, even though he went West at a time when, as Van Johnson discovered too, the war, the draft and simple patriotism had emptied the movie capital of nearly all male competition, and the studios were in dire need of leading men. (Davis theorizes that Zach's dad, a well connected Texas doctor, may have pulled some strings and had his son released from the ordinary citizen's responsibilities). Scott's first marriage collapsed when his life left him for John Steinbeck, and his second marriage was an extraordinary pileup of Gothic egos. Add two \\"daughters\\" to the pack (one who Davis interviewed and who winds up coming off as sincere and stable, the other who eluded him who gets the demon treatment), a drinking problem shared by nearly everyone else in the book, and a suspect earring borne steadily in his ear as a defiant badge of \\"pirate\\" sexuality, and you've got a recipe for disaster. Yet he did make A MASK FOR DIMITRIOS, MILDRED PIERCE, RUTHLESS, THE YOUNG ONE, THE SOUTHERNER, and (on stage) he played Gavin Stevens in Faulkner's REQUIEM FOR A NUN in London and New York, so who knows, there are grounds for a fullscale Zachary Scott revival. I don't know if Ronald Davis really likes him though.Physically, the book itself is printed on ultra creamy paper (though I kept hoping for a photo of Scott's sister and or children, in fact there weren't enough photos in general or what there were aren't well chosen.) If I had to die and come back as a book I hope it would be one as sturdy, elegant and pleasing as one of these \\"Hollywood Legends Series\\" from the University Press of Mississippi."},{"Title":"Zachary Scott: Hollywood's Sophisticated Cad (Hollywood Legends Series)","review":"Zachary Scott, what more can I say!

Rick Smith has captured the reality. Though it was written about Washington much of The Power Game is also true of state and sometimes even local government. A must read for anyone with an interest in government or politics."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"Talk about your weighty tomes. Hedrick Smith's \\"The Power Game\\" takes on the story of politics in Washington, D.C., circa the 1980s. Not only does he dig into every subject imaginable, like the importance of staffers, the intricacies of foreign policy work, and the behemoth of defense spending, but he takes more than 700 pages doing so.\\"The Power Game\\" works best as a series of anecdotes about political life, and the passions that ran riot across the national landscape at various times in the second half of the 20th century. Smith gets some tremendous candor from many of his subjects, like former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas, who tells Smith that his \\"substantive work\\" suffered most when he was most in the public spotlight. \\"I was probably a lesser senator when my numbers were going up,\\" Tsongas confesses.There's great anecdotes about presidential power, too. The book begins with preparations to convert a senator's rambler-style ranch house into a bunker as Ronald Reagan plans a sleepover there, and then dovetails into an account of the symbolic importance of the office. Smith's style is to present such an anecdote at the start of each chapter or section, then offer some insights and overview.The anecdotes are great, like the one that features Lesley Stahl anchoring a CBS attack piece on Reagan. After, she gets a call from a White House senior official. She expects a tirade, but instead the guy thanks her. Stahl's acid commentary was aired over image after image of Reagan in carefully staged feel-good set pieces, sort of by way of ironic contrast. But the senior official told Stahl no one cared what she said, it was the images that would resonate with the viewer, and those images supported Reagan. Alas, to her chagrin, he was right.The problem I have is with the analysis and overview. At times Smith is very dry, writing at length about congressional backroom games, staff work, and supplemental appropriations in a way that's probably too elementary for the poly sci student and too dull for everyone else. Elsewhere, he is just wrong, nowhere more so than when he talks about the presidency as a debilitated institution. He discourses on such things as the Democratic control of Congress and the dominance of PAC money as if they are things that will always be with us, when time has shown him wrong.The last chapter is the book's weakest, not because Smith attempts to offer prescriptions for the ills he ably depicts in the rest of the book, but for the \\"this could work, but then again...\\" tone he takes as he offers them up. Smith is a typical reporter; he wants to find fault but not commit himself to anything that smacks of a solution, since his inner cynic tells him such nostrums only bite you back in the end.There's a great book about Ronald Reagan and his impact on D.C. in \\"The Power Game\\" which I sort of wish Smith had hacked from the rest of this book and released in its stead. Smith is no fan of Reagan, but he's a keenly perceptive critic, not blindly partisan but very mainstream media in his generic liberal disdain. He makes some strong points about Reagan's less-than-positive legacy on the economic front, specifically by channeling the artful turncoat David Stockman, who ran the numbers for the early Reagan budgets, then turned around and told everyone Reagan was just in business to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Reagan also got run around by Congress more than popular history remembers, and Smith is there with the play-by-play.But did Reagan's first term in office see less growth in the national economy than the lone term of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter? Smith says so, but I sure don't remember it that way. He also lambastes Reagan for things that history proved him right on, like his handling of the Soviets, the Contras, and tax relief, and for Star Wars, where the jury is still out. By the end, Smith has worked up such a head of steam that he lumps Reagan and Kennedy alongside Carter, Ford, Nixon, and Johnson as failed presidents. [Here's a clue: When they name a major airport after a president, it probably means he did something right.]The problem is that the premise of \\"The Power Game,\\" that Congress is winning, is flawed. Since Smith keeps hitting on that point, it keeps sounding a false note.But Smith is a solid journalist, and at its best, which it frequently is, \\"The Power Game\\" is a fine inside-the-Beltway account of what went on in Washington during a time of great change. In some ways, the book is valuable historical reading as much for what it gets wrong as for what it gets right."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"Though he talks a little too much about the Redskins, this one is still worth studying in the classroom."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"Ever wondered why as soon as a candidate takes office, their campaign promises seem to become the first casualty of their incumbency?

Through his myriad of stories, Smith pieces together a definitive profile of Washington: what its like, who wins, who loses, and what the games are. It gives an informative outline as to the fundamental strategies and actions are in Washington, and what the role of certain circles of power are, such as the media, the military, and the lobbies.The examples Smith uses to illustrate his points on Washington come mainly from the Reagan administration. Smith's analysis of the Reagan era is very troubling, and he specifically says that the actions of the Reagan team are similar to all the teams of &quot;successful&quot; Presidents. Inadvertently (or perhaps purposefully), Smith raises serious questions about the ethics of Washington today, and the actions of the present day administration. He also points out the actions of Congress, and the faults with the present-day system. Smith also delves into the origins of our system, tracing the impact of various political events throughout history. Smith manages to make this not only readable, but highly interesting. He mixes humor and wit with biting sarcasm and investigative journalism, all making for a very intelligent and thorough analysis of Washington. Even Smith's solutions are concise and cogent.Smith is not a brilliant writer: he is adept, but he is not brilliant. His strength lies in research and presentation of his extensive material. Surprisingly, Smith is able to deliver the material in a very readable, friendly way. Despite being an insider for so many years, he is able to write as a tourist, stunned by the denigration of Washington over the years. He is also able to use his experience to give first-hand insight into corrupt Washington, all of which leads to a very smart, very good book. Smith is a little wordy, and he has many passages which are extraneous, but despite the flaws, he has packed this book with information every American must know. A must-read for all interested in our government at all. In fact, this is a book that every person who votes must read, because it gives tremendous insight into our system.

Before I read this book, I naively thought power in our federal government was a linear, north-south, hierarchic beast. Boy, was I wrong. It gets passed around like a beach ball. Hedrick Smith uses the Reagan Administration as his example, but the template he draws can easily be transferred to the Clinton White House. This is a long book, but it's worth the investment if you want to become a wiser citizen or just to be entertained by the power plays of our elected officials. I just finished reading former Labor Secretary Robert Reich's memoirs, &quot;Locked in the Cabinet&quot;.

As opposed to textbook description of our governmental process, Smith's book digs a little deeper to describe how American government - and politics - really works. It is big but fairly readable. There are some flaws: the book is a bit dated as it was written in the late 80s (e.g. Smith talks about the problems of PACs in campaign but today's problem is soft money); there are a surprisingly decent number of typos and editing oversights; finally, like I mentioned, it is a large book and at some points, few as they are, where the book drags. At the least, a good teacher could use the book and pull out certain chapters that are more pertinent. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"Hedrick Smith has answered the troublesome question, &quot;Why don't our current leaders measure up to those I read about in history books?&quot; The answer is simple: our previous leaders have successfully exercised power in a few instances, and in hindsight it looks easy. People who are trying to exercise power have to deal with the fact that grasping power is like squeezing a balloon -- the harder you squeeze, the more slips through your fingers. Institutional checks and balances are described, but the most compelling aspects of Smith's book come from his analysis of the role of lobbyists, staffers, and constituents and their role in giving and taking power from our leaders. Reagan, currently championed by conservatives as the epitome of the powerful president, is exposed as more susceptible to the political winds after blunders like Iran-Contra. Powerful congressional committee chairs have had their power split asunder by new voting rules, and the laws have become so complex that no single poltician can know all the detail behind them. The power therefore transfers to the staffers who take the time to understand the piles of data and who can communicate it effectively. And there is always the fickle wind of public opinion wafting across D.C., changing politicians' courses as quickly as it can be ascertained which direction it's blowing. Of course, as soon as the politicians figure out where it's blowing, it changes, and the whole scramble starts again. A true gem for the political junkie, every student of D.C. and the exercise of governmental power must read this book"},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"Hedrick Smith wrote and amazingly in-depth novel about American Politics and Government.

Smith takes you inside the heart of government. And not the metaphorical heart, he truly shows all aspects of American Politics and Government. I am sure if people were capable or reading so much about politics and government; Smith could have written another 711 pages and still would not have covered everything that HE wanted to. But if it were any longer Smith would not have made a profit selling it.Smith's analysis of Washington would have brought tears to my eyes, only because of his understanding of the best institution out there. However, Smith's love for Reagan did damper my mood of the novel. Smith seems to have a love affair with Reagan. Though Reagan did shake things up on Capitol Hill, Smith going more than fifteen pages with out mentioning something \\"great\\" about Reagan is nothing short of a small miracle.I would love to Read this book if Smith had written it in the passed five years. Sadly this look at \\"the Power Game\\" is almost twenty years old and has no analysis of resent dynamics and shenanigans in Washington. If you are thinking of reading this book, make sure you have time and a lot of love for America. I recommend \\"The Power Game\\" because it does give you a deep understanding of Politics and Government. How deep you want to go is up to you. If you can handle knowing everything and then some, please pick up a copy. If you do not really want to know the \\"then some\\" or Washington than I would recommend a different novel. There are many novels that will give you an understanding of Washington, with out confusing or boring you. All in all, Great Book."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"As a non-American, interested in US politics, Smith's book is a more than useful insight into how Washington politics works - the deals, counter deals, and a good examiniation of the machinery that makes it all works. Smith stays away from the personalities, and concentrates on the machinery and plotical strcutures and systems, and how they all interact (and some cases how they don't) and it all reveals a complex but continually fascinating political system."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"Perhaps a political science classic - Hedrick Smith provides an insightful glimpse not only into Washington's political scene but offers a phenomenal analysis of politics and power itself. he presents why so much of the system has become so cumbersome and complex as people fight for power and control of various aspects. He describes PACs and lobbying groups and their impact on the political system.He also describes how the various players in Wahsington have grown over time. Take this interesting tidbit from the book: Journalists: 1,522 were acredited to Congrssional press galleries in 1961 and 5,250 in 1987; the 1980 census showed 12,612 journalists citywide. When Truman ordered the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan in 1945, I was told, he broke the news to the entire White House press corps - twenty-five reporters. By mid-1987, some 1,708 people had regular White House press passes. So enormous had the wider political community grown - lobbyists, lawyers, journalists, policy think tanks, defense or health consultants, and the hotels, offices, accountants, resterautns, and the service industries that support them - that by 1979 this whole nongovernmental sector actually outnumbered federal government employees in Washington!Other fascinating facts like that are found throughout the book helping to maintin the interest of the reader. If you want to read a book about Washington, politics and the ultimate Power Game, this is the one for you. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"This is one of the best UNBIASED books on power politics as practiced on the national stage, I've ever run across. The book was written in the '80's and the examples are from that era, but the principles and practices are basically unchanged. I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to make sense of the Washington &#34;Clown Show&#34;."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"I bought this book as it was required for an American Politics class. I was inimidated by the length, but as I started reading Smith is a wonderful writer. It is interesting and informative. I also did some reading about the author and found a video from 1988 talking about this book. Once I heard him speak and saw how charismatic he is, I enjoyed the book even that much more."},{"Title":"The Power Game: How Washington Works","review":"&quot;You never get in trouble in politics for lying. You only get in trouble for tellinng the truth.&quot; These wise words, from Tip O'Neill, former Speaker of the House, sum up the bottom line of what it takes to stay polotically alive in Washington. Interestingly enough they are quoted almost at the end of &quot;the Power Game&quot; by Hedrick Smith. It is as if Smith wants you to read the entire book before giving you the Grand Finale about what Washington is really like. Hedrick Smith, the author of this bestseller, was a the Washington bureau chief for the Washington Post during the Reagan era and his book gives good inside information about how Washington really works. It goes into details about how the game of power gaining and keeping is really played, what it takes to get something on the Agenda, the influence of the Iron Triangle, the power of special intrests and their lobbies and, not to forget the Iran-Contra affair. He also shines a spotlight on how coalitions are made across party lines and the big influence of the National Security Council. Of course the most important issue is how the use of the Media has changed the way politics are &quot;done&quot; from the old fashioned &quot;breed&quot; of politician with long term ideas to the glitzy, image only, political contender, who talks in soundbites. Smith's style is that of a typical journalist. Not too heady and easy to read. Unfortunately, it seems that the book is written in episodes, beefed up with too many anecdotes. Many &quot;sources&quot; are quoted, making it look more like a gossip column than the work of an expert of Washington DC. An overall better organization of related topics could have served the reader better. The way the book is written the reader has to piece the parts together from different sections in the book. Through vignets about the quircks and character of the people discussed, the reader gets to know the personalies who play the power game. A real conclusion is not given but is left up to the reader to figure out. Also this book requires a very thourough background of knowledge of names of politicians and staff members in the Reagan era and the maze of the numerous committies within the political system. Smith starts in his book with a baffeling discription on what is involved in security measures for a presidential visit. He definitely captures the audience's attention with this. Then he goes on describing how, since Watergate and Nixon's abuse of power, the power structure has changed between the president and congress. &quot;Congress seized for itself the legal authority and the expertise to insure that its challenge to the chief executive would be permanent&quot; (p21) and the House of Representatives created an incredible number of subcommittees for each different sector of national policy. Smith blames the weakening of the parties within themselves and the rapid upcoming importance of the TV as the factors contributing to this change of how politics are played. He takes the year 1974 as the split between the &quot;old breed&quot; of politicians with the &quot;new breed.&quot; The rise of TV politics brought with it a wave of &quot;political shamans: the media advisors, political strtegists, pollsters [and] direct mail operatives&quot; (p137) who replaced the old political bosses. &quot;New breed&quot; politicians have learned how to manipulate the media by i.e. waiting for a slow news day for their press releases and counting on the competetiveness of reporters to cover the story. (140) Practices of political &quot;junkmail&quot; to rally up support and personalizing of letters made by assembly line like operations of staff are also exposed in the scope light of Smith. The mention that some politicians even use ink that smudges so it will look like they personally answered the letter is a good illustration of the make-believe world of mass media politics. On the bottom of page 152, Smith quotes David Himes of the National Republican Congressional Commettee saying that&quot;... people's image of a congressman is more important to their vote than his stand on the issues. It is questionable who is to blame for this, the Media, the congresssman, or the voter. In my opinion, it is the voter who does not take the time to investigate in enough. But also some blame could be with the other two who don't cover the issues enough. Within congress is a group of scrupulous protesters who make up the Dissident Triangle, according to Smith. These are the congressmen who fight for effectiveness and efficiency within the operations of the Pentagon. One mentioned is Denny Smith of Oregon. Interestingly enough it seems that his motiviation to object to defective weaponry for the military stems from his being a former Air Force officer. He knows from experience what is needed and how the military works on the inside. His realism caused me a few moments of trust in the system and a sigh of relief. Smith goes in his next session into the &quot;old breed&quot; of lobbying and the &quot;new breed&quot; of lobbying. The new breed seems to be more backed up by grass roots activism. However money still oils the machine which seems to need more and more in order to produce the same effect. Activism is also practiced among the staff on Capitol Hill. Staffers are by no means powerless. On page 283 Smith quotes a member of the House of representatives as saying:&quot;....I never thought I'd give up that much power voluntarily&quot; to staff members.&quot;"},{"Title":"We, the People: Formative Documents of America's Democracy","review":"What is our Constitution based on?

An excellent read and a job well done!"},{"Title":"We, the People: Formative Documents of America's Democracy","review":"\\"We the People Considers the Patriots' Act\\" might very well be the title of an important essay that should be written by an individual much more knowledgeable than I. Instead it is my way of introducing you to two books that have made significant impressions on me during the past month.We the People by Adolph Caso has been a troubling, perplexing text for me to assimilate. Although I am not an avid \\"student\\" of America's history, I was nevertheless appalled to learn for the first time in my life about Cesare Beccaria and his role in our history. Indeed, I had never heard of his essay, \\"Crimes and Punishments.\\"We are all aware that there are laws under which we, the people, are judged and punished daily. But have we any significant background and/or knowledge of those laws? Have we any significant understanding of the philosophies that guided America in its formative years. I, for one, admit I did not.Yet, the truths in Beccaria's book have been incorporated in the constitutions of practically all European countries, as well as America. Indeed, in America where there is a great need to co-exist amongst many immigrants, it required much more. \\"The extent to which Beccaria's observation served to cause the Founding Fathers to opt for \\"We, the People\\" over \\"We, the States\\" may never be completely known. But that the Constitution was supposed to be the supreme law of the land has certainly come to fruition. It is this kind of law, a law that aims at the single individual rather than at units, that Beccaria was principally concerned with, it being the means to regulate the activities of men and to assure them their happiness on earth.\\" (P.288).How can we ever attain a government of the people when we, as individuals are not taught our responsibilities? If we are not taught to take responsibility for our actions, if we are not provided an opportunity to learn what response will occur when we act irresponsibly, how are we to survive? \\"Among the richest to the poorest ...from the lowliest positions to the highest offices in the land--including in the courts and with judges, ministers, politicians, lawyers and every other profession--responsibility needs to be taught, emphasized and enforced, without which we end up with mayhem and ultimately destroying ourselves.\\" (Dick Innes, Founder/ Director of ACTS International and ACTS Communications, Daily Encounter, July 13, 2006.)While reading and studying, yes, studying, the text of We the People, I picked up a novel by one of my favorite storytellers, Stephen T. Cannell. Who of us has not seen a picture of him on TV, at the end of one of his major dramas, excitingly tearing out a sheet of paper from his typewriter and having it fly away until his next program of the A-Team (my favorite) The Rockford Files, The Commish, et. al. Thus, in my usual anticipation of a good suspense story, I opened Cold Hit.As with many of today's major authors, Cannell has taken an issue and created a drama that helps us learn about and see the possible and probable ramifications of what is happening in today's America. In Cold Hit, Cannell calls our attention to the Patriots' Act. Was it that I had already been studying We the People, or was it the drama and reality of Cold Hit? However absorbing the storyline of Cold Hit, it brought fiction into reality for me as I watched Cannell put the Patriots' Act into action.What if, under the USA Patriot Act, federal bureaucrats could take murder cases away from local cops--then bury those cases so they're never investigated again?What if government agents could bug your home, your car, and your place of business--your entire life--with nothing more than spoken permission from a secret panel of judges?What if the Department of Homeland Security could pull police officers off the street and hold them in cells indefinitely as material witnesses--because they're working on \\"sensitive\\" investigations?They Can. . .(From the book cover)I thank Cannell for writing Cold Hit to explain through fictional narrative the ramifications of the Patriots' Act! If you also were unaware of the extent of powers granted under the Patriots' Act, you will come to realize and question whether we are still a government of The People...Adoph Caso has brought together the major significant documents from America's past. His inclusion of \\"Essays on Crime and Punishments\\" was entirely new to me. Yes, I can recall learning about our government, how bills and laws are formulated. I had learned and memorized \\"We the People of the United States, in order to formulate a more...\\" as is normally required in our schools. But I had never learned one word about \\"Crimes and Punishments.\\" Even as I read, I was asking others, \\"do you recall ever learning about...?\\"Why have we been taught basic guidelines, what you might call, our Policies? But never really trained in our procedures--the basics about our laws, crimes and punishments? How can an Act, such as the Patriots' Act be implemented without \\"We the People\\" fully understanding what that could mean to each of us?Perhaps instead of two book reviews, I have actually written a short essay...but it is one that is based upon what I have learned by reading these two books. This is insufficient coverage of the books' content, perhaps, but is it not a goal of every writer to have a reader absorb and take something away from each book? That I have done! If you are concerned about our nation and what is happening today, take first a look at the past with We the People by Adolph Caso, to gain a better understanding of the philosophy behind our crimes and punishments. Then, read novels by individuals such as Stephen J. Cannell with Cold Hit, who research and tell you about events and actions that could very well affect the rest of your life!Both of these books, in my opinion, should be on your permanent/keep bookshelf as Must Reads!\\"The Worth of a book is to be measured by what you can carry away from it.\\" --James Bryce"},{"Title":"My Mother's Charms: Timeless Gifts of Family Wisdom","review":"This charming book draws us into the wonderful world of antique movable charms using poignant anecdotes about women in the author's life whose stories serve to uplift us all.

When a mixup in photos leaves her with some disturbing pictures of a badly beaten and tortured woman, a horrified Jordy goes to the police and tries to find the owner of the photos.Fantasy writer Cai L'Baan has been receiving emails from a deranged fan Margaron, who acts like she thinks his black pearl series is real. She says she will take hostages to prove her threats are real and that Cai must come to her with the black pearl. When it becomes apparant the fan is really dangerous he goes to the police and then he meets Jordy. Cai is terrified of the overwhelming feelings he has for Jordy, but when his grandfather Alfred meets her and commissions her to do a piece for him, he realizes they will end up in a relationship. Jordy has drawn several mystical looking figures and Cai decides to use a drawing she does of a dragon for his next book cover.Cai's grandfather Alfred is an eccentric old man from Wales who sometimes talks as though the stories he tells Cai about Merlin, Arthur, the black pearl etc.. are real as though he was really there. His housekeeper Dilys, also from Wales, also acts as though she believes the stories. Cai and Jordy believe he is suffering from dementia but a series of events make them start questioning everything they ever thought was real.When it becomes apparent that they are dealing with someone dark and evil, Alfred insists that Cai and Jordy will have to confront Margaron with the black pearl or the world will suffer. He informs them that the L'Baans have long been the keepers of the black pearl and they must go to Wales to put everything right.To me the most interesting character in this whole book was Alfred. Cai at times seems to be kind of boring and even though Jordy has potential at times she is too predictable. The biggest problem with this story to me was it just doesn't make sense. Although it is explained that Alfred was the keeper of the black pearl, it doesn't really explain why the black pearl exists or what exactly Margaron's agenda is other than to get the black pearl. It doesn't explain who Dilys is...too many questions. However, the story had potential I'm just wondering if there was a prequel I missed or something...."},{"Title":"Legend of the Sorcerer","review":"This was the first book I've picked up in about three years.

Ultimately, our ability to decipher what came before is limited by the records at hand, a factor which can constrain even the best historian.The limitation is particularly evident in John Morris' history of Roman London. A longtime historian of the Roman Empire and its aftermath in Britain, Morris draws upon the range of available archaeological and historical evidence to describe the first centuries of London's existence. With chapters on the development of the town, its governance, and the everyday habits of its inhabitants, he provides a good examination of life in Londinium and the role the city played in Rome's rule over Britain.Yet Morris' command of the material cannot mask its thinness. Most of the first part of the book is devoted to providing a history of pre-Roman and Roman Britain, which, while useful, often loses relevancy and can feel a little like padding. Moreover, the absence of detailed evidence often forces Morris to resort to supposition, or inference from other Roman cities. This does not make it a bad book, but the age of the text (originally written in the early 1970s and revised after Morris' death) does beg for updating as new archaeological and historical evidence emerges which allows us to improve and refine our understanding of London's earliest inhabitants. Until then, we have Morris' fine, if dated study."},{"Title":"Londinium London in the Roman Empire","review":"'Londinium: London in the Roman Empire' by John Morris is an absolutely wonderful book on the history of London's origins. A narrative history that is thorough and interesting, this text covers a wide range of historical issues.Morris organises the book in three sections: The Making of London, Roman London, and The Survival of London. Apart from these three primary sections is an Introduction, notes, bibliography, and an index.Morris correctly identifies that prior to Rome, there was no London, and after Rome, not much is known about/heard of from London for hundreds of years. Therefore, to understand London, one must have at the very least a basic understanding of Rome -- Roman architecture, Roman social structures and hierarchy, Roman military and economic institutions, and Roman concerns.There are two primary sources for history that Morris uses, and uses well: archaeological and documentary. Acclaimed as a master of both types, as well as an innovative thinker and careful interpreter, Morris uses archaeology and documentary evidence in connection with each other in a more-or-less equal weighting. The drawback here is that there is precious little documentary evidence of London during the Roman period, as London was almost as far from the centre of the Empire as one could get while still being part of the Empire (a somewhat ironic position for London to be in, considering its position as the centre of another worldwide empire many centuries later).In looking at The Making of London, goes back to the very beginnings, looking not only at Rome, but even before Rome. Morris does a brief survey of pre-historic Britain, not great in detail, but important in giving a grounding of the ground on which London was built. London was not a 'natural' settlement -- it was placed by deliberate decision on the part of the powerful of Rome; like other major Roman provincial capitals (Paris, Vienna, Belgrade, Cologne), it grew to major proportions later in history; unlike these, it dominated the country it served much more completely. Morris continues his survey by looking at Rome before Caesar and then Flavian Rome, Britain of the Belgae and the Roman conquest, and the consolidation of Roman power under the Flavians.In the second section, Roman London, Morris examines the development of a mature Roman city. This includes important structures such as Government House, City Hall, the Forum, the baths and other public works, so that the people could pursue typical Roman pursuits such as education, economy, sporting events, and typical work any provincial trading centre would host. Locations for theatres and racecourse/stadiums in London are not known (unlike other towns such as Canterbury). To a certain extent, therefore, Roman life in London is based on an extrapolation of typical Roman life in any like-sized city in the northern Roman empire.In the third major section, The Survival of London, Morris looks at the 'fall' of Roman through the lens of London, showing increasing insularity of the remaining Romans in Britain, but ironically showing an increase in trade for London rather than a decrease at certain times. However, as the stable borders of the Empire crumbled, so too did London's trade with certain areas (such as the Rhine area in Germany). As the Romans retreated to more central, and then more eastern, concentrations of power, little if anything was recorded as documentary evidence of London, as it became just too distant to be of any concern. Morris writes that London and Roman Britain didn't suffer from a systematic withdraw of Roman imperium as much as it fell victim to neglect and unfulfilled promises, like much of the Western Empire would eventually suffer.London continued in the post-Roman environment to be a link to the past, to Europe, and to the future of organisation and stability, and in this role it flourished, although not without periods of stagnation and occasional neglect.The maps, illustrations, and photographs complement the narrative history well, and the overall organisation is very logical. This is a fascinating look at the ancient European world through the lens of a single city, both looking within and without the walls. Professor Morris of University College, London, passed away before the completion of this text; the finishing touches were done by Sarah Macready of the Institute of Archaeology, London University.A truly excellent snapshot of the past, this book will please those interested in archaeology, Roman history, British history, the history of London, or even the casual reader interested in a good, true story."},{"Title":"The Bandit of Hell's Bend","review":"I have read virtually all of the books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The Bandit of Hells Bend is the western I have always liked the best. As an avid fan of Shakespeare, Coleridge, Donne and many other famous poets and playwrights, I would definitely disregard Larry E's opinion concerning this book. In fact, having read as much ERB as I did as a teen greatly contributed to my scoring the second highest in a word comprehension test taken in a British Literature class in college. Furthermore, actor and screen writer Sylvester Stallone reads from another of Burroughs' westerns, The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County, in Rocky II.

One of them is \\"The Bandit of Hell's Bend\\". I know from reading his Apache novels that ERB can write good westerns. But Bandit of Hell's Bend isn't one of them. Written in the mid-20s, it is too melodramatic for modern readers. The characters spout bad western (and in one case, Chinese) dialect. One character is a poetry spouting cowboy who recites the worst poetry known to man. It's just plain lousy, but since I have to have a complete collection... And hey, if you can find it for 20 cents, talk 'em down to 10."},{"Title":"They're a Weird Mob","review":"They're a Weird Mob is the first book by John O'Grady writing under the pseudonym Nino Culotta, and purports to tell the tale of Nino, an Italian journalist sent to Australia to write articles about the country and her people for Italians to read. Nino has learned English, so he shouldn't have a problem, his boss thinks. But English, Nino finds, is not Australian. As Nino experiences true Aussie culture in the form of Kings Bloody Cross, labouring for a brickie, drinking in the pub, picking a fight in the street, almost being arrested, travelling on the train, being invited to tea, a buck's night, a wedding reception, going shooting and swimming at Bondi, he relates his interactions with Australians and his puzzlement with their language. Some of the conversations he overhears, like the discussion of horse racing in a caf&eacute;, are confusing to me now, after having lived in Australia for 55 years. Nino learns about the attitude of many Australians to migrants, but finds his appearance and his willingness to \\"have a go\\" soon defuse this, and finds himself taking part in many Aussie-male rites of passage. He also learns that many words (ticket, drum, shout, before, only) have multiple meanings. This novel is a very long way from being Politically Correct: when Nino decides he wants to marry, the discussion on \\"sheilas\\" begins \\"blondes are easy on the eye, but they get dirty quick\\". One needs to remember, though, that it was written in 1957, and reflects attitudes of the day, and if one bears this in mind, there are many laugh-out-loud moments. While O'Grady's writing does an excellent job of portraying a nave Italian migrant, his eulogising about the Australian and how to become a good one is a bit transparent. Hilarious!"},{"Title":"80/20 Management","review":"I found this book helpful. It has clear and comprehensive structuring when explaining ideas and what is good it is written in a step-by-step description style of delivering practical techniques to the reader.*** Whom this book could be interesting for? ***It is definitely not a study on the subject but rather a pocket reference for those who are striving for making their life more accurate in terms of a workload being properly balanced.I believe this book could be also interesting to those who having jumped into Management Land still feel they need to learn how to develop the ability of working effectively and with high effectiveness.This publication gives necessary explanation of the difference between working effectively and being efficient. Not everyone understands that:* Being effective means producing powerful results* Being efficient means producing results with the least level of wasted effortsIn other words, being efficient does not necessarily mean being effective.The name of the book is reflecting \`The Pareto Principle' stating that only 20% of our efforts usually provide 80% of valuable results.

There is a tremendous amount of technical information in this book, much of which is over my weaving head at this point in my skill set. A substantial subset of the information will always be beyond my four-shaft loom's grasp. Some of this book was written for textile designers who were not responsible for setting up their own looms.Incidentally, the numbering of figures and diagrams can be difficult to follow; illustrations may be described several pages away from their location. With 1875 figures, this probably should not be a surprise.Oelsner is the kind of book I'm happy to have on my shelf. I take it down every now and then and find I understand more than I did the last time. OTOH, I also recognize it's discussing even more aspects of weaving than I had even realized existed.You won't learn to weave from A Handbook of Weaves, and if you're looking for handweaving pattern ideas, there are a number of more accessible books available. But if you have a bit of a book budget and you have room on your weaving bookshelf, Oelsner's well worth the inch it occupies. Wow. There's a lot to know in this field.

I would have to stop reading it to savor the richness and then quickly return to it. The fluency and reality of this novel blew me away. How could someone as young as Ms. Evans write so exquisitely? The story line I could relate to even though I'm not British nor have I been to Niger nor have I a twin. But I believed every character. Ms. Evans brought the characters to life. So often authors forget about the minor characters once they are introduced, but Kemy was well-rounded. Errol and Dean instantly came to life. I can't wait for the next novel. My hat goes off to Diana Evans!"},{"Title":"26a","review":"I found this book rather randomly, as I was browsing bookshelves in no particular order, and I reading it made me very grateful that I still find the time to visit brick & mortar bookstores!Even though this is the story of two biracial girls living in London, even though their Nigerian roots are strong, Evans never makes the novel about race. Rather, being biracial, having a Nigerian mother who believes in spirits, these are important, influential parts of who they are. Its not portray as an obstacle or a difficulty, which I appreciated. But even better than this story of a family of women with exceptional connections and insight into the human spirit and across continents and physical boundaries, the language is this novel is what makes it stand out. The language of this novel is what makes it move. I think I will be dreaming of the last few chapters, \\"the last bit,\\" as Evans might say, for days.The characters were real and interesting, the story was moving, and the writing just took my breath away. Evans has a real gift for poetic prose and imagery. The clash of cultures especially vivid, and the pain and confusion of depression -- I just can't even imagine how Evans was able to portray it so vividly. I can't wait for more."},{"Title":"26a","review":"As an identical twin, I completely identified with the two main characters in this story (Bessi and Georgia). I also recognised the difficulties of Kemmy, the younger sister who finds herself outside the golden circle, and think that the parents are both excellently described, three-dimensional characters, seen as they are through the eyes of the young people. For me, the stay in Nigeria is a strong part of the story, and I took it as laid out before me, without questioning its accuracy, which I don't think is too important in this story anyway it's not a travel guide to the parts of the world that can be seen, but rather to those that can only be sensed beneath it.The relationship between the twins is a truly authentic one for me, even down to the way one comes to accept the current life while the other, unnerved by what happened in Nigeria, is unable to. I also found the supernatural touches to be completely believable, hovering on the edge of the story the way so many of these things do in our apparently ordinary lives. Family myth and reality often blend like this, so that a new chronology is created by the vision of the person creating the story.The strange thing for me is that it is the dead twin, Georgia, who seems to be the stronger character of the two, while the one who remains in the known world becomes a little flatter and less clearly seen as a result. Shadows can often pick out hidden seams of richness that the light sweeps over and fails to touch. If it is true that this novel is autobiographical where it concerns the relationship between the twins, then the more worldly Bessi has a deep understanding of how easily interchangeable she and her sister are in their feelings and experiences."},{"Title":"26a","review":"Prior to their birth, identical twins Georgia and Bessie experience a terrifying moment, one that forebodes their futures. It also marks the beginning of an unbreakable bond between them. Suffused with elements of magical realism, 26A takes the reader on a mystical roller-coaster where neither time, nor distance, nor the ultimate of separations can sever the ties that bind the two sisters and best friends together...body, mind and soul. While some of the magical realism elements didn't quite work for me (in particular the lingering presence of Nne-Nne), 26A tugs at the heartstrings and attests to the true power of forever-ness."},{"Title":"26a","review":"Excellent!

I got through 3/4 of it, and just gave up. The characters seemed very one-dimensional to me, they grew without growing if that makes sense. I couldn't bear another drunken father story, or mother talking to herself (but really to her mother who's back in Nigeria) or the girls working through problem after problem with no real resolution. I felt like they were hamsters on a wheel, as was I for reading the same thing over and over. Finally I jumped off the wheel and moved on. Thank God. I was really disappointed because I feel the author had a story there, and I had read positive reviews. Oh well. Maybe someone else can enlighten me, or maybe her next novel will show me how wrong I am."},{"Title":"26a","review":"26A by Diana Evans introduces readers to the lives of identical twin sisters. Bessi and Georgie are intricately connected from even before the womb, as the author so uniquely illustrates. The story is set in England, in a suburb of London called Neasden, their address being 26 Waifer Avenue (the \\"A\\" signifying the attic where the twins reside). Bessi and Georgie are bi-racial and live with their mother, Ida, who fled from Lagos, Nigeria to avoid an arranged marriage; their father, Aubrey, who is English and a successful businessman who met their mother while in Nigeria on an extended business trip; their older sister, Isabel (Bel) and their younger sister, Kemy. All of the sisters are extremely close and very protective of each other. However, their older and younger sisters make special effort to protect the bond of the twins. Their space is respected and no one enters their world without permission. The sisters are an extreme comfort and support to each other as they deal with their parents impending \\"divorce\\" and cope with their father's frequent bouts of anger, as they often refer to him as Dr. Jekyll or Mr Hyde, depending on his behavior that day.What resonated most about 26A was the way in which the author described the relationship between Bessi and Georgie. Evans literally blew me away with how she described a relationship that I, as an identical twin, could never begin to put into words myself - and probably never would, because some of the things shared seemed as natural as breathing. For example, Bessi and Georgie \\"share\\" dreams. Georgie visits a character in her dreams named Gladstone that she talks to Bessi about all the time, as if he is a real part of their family. Another example is how they feel each other's discomfort or pain. Evans described a scene so vividly in which one of the twins was being harmed and the other felt her pain.Bessi and Georgie do not make any moves without consulting the other - their twin's consideration is always put first and it has to be because they were partners before their lives began! From being business partners in their flapjack-making endeavor, The Famous Flapjack Twins, to lifetime partners. Their dependency on one another is likened to the way your left foot is dependent on your right. One cannot go further until the other one goes first and if one breaks, well, the other one will carry all the weight until her partner recovers.This is a love story of sorts which describes the bond between two soul mates that would do anything to protect the private world in which they live. They protect this world by keeping it peaceful, safe, happy, and young. First and foremost, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a twin or a sibling of twins, for you will gain much more appreciation for your/their relationship, or anyone that is fascinated with the unique relationship of twins or of sisters coming of age. The cultural references were also enlightening and very interesting to read about as well. Overall, you will not be disappointed!Reviewed by: Lena WillisAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"26a","review":"In this magnificent debut, Diana Evans captures the magic and complexity of childhood with such honesty and candor it will take you right back to your own memories. To quote an excerpt:\\"On the outside of their front door Georgia and Bessi had written in chalk '26a', and on the inside 'G + B', at eye level, just above the handle. This was the extra dimension. The one after sight, sound, smell, touch and taste where the world multiplied and exploded because it was the sum of two people. Bright was twice as bright. All the colours were extra. Girls with umbrellas skipped across the wallpaper and Georgia and Bessi could hear them laughing.\\"Georgia and Bessi are identical twins growing up in Neasden, London. Their mother is a Nigerian immigrant who pines after her homeland and converses with 'spirits' while their father, an English accountant, drowns his sorrows in the bottle. Despite these difficulties, Georgia and Bessi grow up as confident and imaginative girls, escaping in their own world of fantasy and possibility.What makes this novel so successful is the ultra-delicious writing, sprinkled with unusual linguistic devices and elements of 'magical realism'. Add to that animated, well-crafted characters and a story line that is hard to put down!Part hilarious, part endearing, part sobering, 26a is a moving ode to childhood, the pains of growing up and the magic of 'twinhood'."},{"Title":"26a","review":"I listened to this on tape, read by the amazing Adjoa Andoh.

It is a short read but I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"26a","review":"26a is a story set in Neasden, London about a mixed race family. The father is an Englishman and the mother a Nigerian woman. They have four daughters Bel, Georgia & Bessi (identical twins) and Kenny, the youngest. The main storyline revolves around the twins.The story begins when the twins are about 9 years old, they live in the loft of their house at 26 Waifer Avenue. They name the loft 26a, hence the title. Georgia and Bessi are both regular pre-adolescent girls, with an amazing bond. They share everything and tell each other all their secrets. As the story progresses, the Hunter family moves to Nigeria for a couple of years. All the girls take their own adjustment periods. However, Georgia has a near rape experience which she chooses not to tell anyone, even Bessi, about. This incident is a turning point for the story. Georgia begins to keep all sad and depressing things from Bessi. As they turn 18, Bessi, moves from England to St. Lucia leaving Georgia alone. Georgia's depression and dark periods worsen. She starts a relationship with a young man and they have a wonderful companionship and friendship. They complement each other, but she worries her depression will destroy him too, so she breaks it off with him.In the end, depression takes over her and tragically, she commits suicide. Although the twins shared the close bond, in the end the elder sister Bel, seems to be more in tune with Georgia's feelings. She is the one who is constantly worried about her and she tries to get Georgia out of the house.The parents have always had a strained relationship but after the death of their daughter, their mutual tragedy brings them together. The father was always a bitter and hard man but in the end is shown as a broken, grieving father.in the last few pages, the book took a bit of a spin for me. I wasn't sure what the point was. The twins continue communication and discussing things, perhaps to show the common bond of twins. For me, it seemed a bit off and unnecessary.All in all, it was a nice coming of age book. There were some nice parts to it and I liked the authors writing. The storyline was not too spectacular."},{"Title":"26a","review":"In her first published novel, Diana Evans masterfully weaves together the twin realities of growing up in a fractured, multicultural, essentially modern family and the magical world shared only by two sisters whose bond serves as a model of familial togetherness and companionship so intense it makes one person of two.Born to an English banker and his Nigerian-born wife in the London suburb of Neasden, twin protagonists Georgia and Bessi Hunter claim as their shared birthright a multiplicity of locales -- the deceptively pedestrian environs of their middle-class English home, the unfamiliar Nigerian homeland of their mother, and the many realms they explore together in dreams and visions. None of these places is without considerable danger, and the twins face great horrors in each. Their growing-up throughout the course of the novel is a struggle against abuse, alienation, and uncertainty.Evans relates her balanced and forceful plot with a strong lyric voice informed by her experience with poetry. Though she occasionally gives way to melodrama, readers are unlikely to resent her for it, given her rich appreciation for her characters' inner lives and her peculiar sense of linguistic and narrative invention."},{"Title":"26a","review":"Diana Evans' debut novel, 26A, boasts more than just this author's proficient use of the English language. Evans' language and characterization of the two young protagonists, Georgia and Bessi, reaches out to the reader and finds his sentimentality, his complex understanding of himself and his relationships, and his nostalgia. Evans employs the real and mystical realms as she probes ontological understandings of the reason through the often separate parts of the twins: their Nigerian halves from their mother Ida and their English halves from their father Aubrey. The mystic realm enters through their Ida: her baths and secret conversations with Nne-Nne, her father's stories of Nigerians labeling twins as evil, and her aid in Bel's interpretations of prophetic dreams. The real realm enters through Aubrey: his nightly glass of scotch, his overbearing mother, and his need to control his household. The twins' relationship and spiritual bond also reflects on the mystic realm. The girls are affected physically when one thing happens to one of them the other feels it. They have a deeper understanding of one another's feelings."},{"Title":"26a","review":"Diana Evan's novel explores thoughts, and conceptions of what the reader conceives as reality and magical realism. Evans writes about these multicultural and multiracial twins that experience everything together in their lives. She starts off with the reader questioning the reality of the story because the girls were born from animals that were recently road kill. Through their experiences they learned that they can't always be together forever which will become evident at the ending. Evans also creates a story full of metaphors that examine different meanings in the novel. By combining the Nigerian and English cultures she brings forth different sets of values and beliefs."},{"Title":"26a","review":"This started interestingly enough...twins that seemed joined from a past life. But it quickly derailed into non-stop depressing, life-altering tragedies. It WAS well written, despite the authors intentional use of poor grammar (the character's London and Nigerian accents). But the ending was meaningless and a true disappointment for this reader who stuck it out, only to be disappointed. I was hoping for another Audrey Niffenegger\\"s \\"Her Fearful Symmetry\\", but I got a Thomas Hardy remake instead."},{"Title":"26a","review":"This book can fool you with its magical writing, because it handles some pretty heavy topics (like depression and abuse) so well. It is realistic and true without losing a mystical feeling of \\"oneness\\" that permeates the sisters and also their Nigeria, even while trying to fit in at school and in their young lives. The characters are beautiful and thoroughly written. Just a wonderful book. I look forward to reading more from this author!"},{"Title":"Bhowani Junction","review":"Victoria Jones is a 28-year old Anglo-Indian (mixed Indian and European blood) living in Bhowani in the turbulent months leading to Indian independence. This novel explores her search for where she will belong in the &quot;new&quot; India- she does her searching through her liaisons with a fellow Anglo-Indian, an Indian (Sikh) and a British officer. It is a very good book, especially reading it from a historical/feminist perspective. It falls well will other novels of the British Raj - where Anglo-Indian women are depicted as sexual objects. The movie version of the book starring Ava Gardner does it justice, but it is always better to read the book instead!"},{"Title":"Bhowani Junction","review":"I reviewed this book many years ago, and don't see it here anymore, so this is a re-write. I have to start, again, by repeating that this review is by someone who has a voracious appetite for books about the Raj... extending into the present day. I particularly favor \\"half-caste\\" books in which the protagonist is of mixed race, or mixed cultural allegiance, so Bhowani Jundtion pleased me. Bhowani Junction has the additional recommendation of being a Train book, another genre I favor. Set in 1946-47, the story has resonance for modern day readers by featuring a great terrorist villain, (although if the terrorists become successful, like Ben Gurion, history drops the t-word label and calls them 'father of the nation' I notice...) So the Indian saboteur, plotting to blow up trains, tracks and (mostly Muslim) passengers to foment violence for the WWII-weary British rulers to contend with, tries to recruit among the loyalty-challenged mixed race caste the British have put in charge of running the railways. There's a pretty interesting portrayal of the railroading Anglo-Indian community, which I have no ability evaluating as to accuracy. But these little sub-cultural pockets exist all over the sub-continent, so I bought it. There's another great thread in this story - the love triangle between the British officer in charge of hunting down the terrorist, the Anglo-Indian train engineer's daughter, struggling to find her cultural identity, and Patrick, the clutzy, incompetent Anglo-Indian engineer who wants to marry her honorably. Victoria's choice is surprising and true and not the Hollywood ending you expect."},{"Title":"Bhowani Junction","review":"John Masters is one of my favorite authors, and this, I think, is his fictional masterpiece (of his non-fiction works, I think the first volume of his autobiography, \\"Bugles and a Tiger\\", is the best). He manages to strike precisely the right note with each of his three principal characters, who are quite different: Patrick, the resentful \\"Anglo-Indian\\" railwayman; Rodney Savage, the extremely competent Gurkha officer who turns out to have a softer romantic side; and Victoria, the Anglo-Indian who is far from certain where her future lies. As they take turns narrating unfolding events, each from their own perspective, the reader is really drawn into a very accurate portrayal of post-WWII India, with the uncertainties faced by the Anglo-Indian (i.e., Eurasian) community, the attempts by some Congress extremists to foment both religious riots and anti-British sentiment, and the war-weariness of the British troops who had just emerged from the brutal Burma campaign but then had to face \\"aid to the civil power\\" duties in India. As time passes, independence struggles tend to be portrayed in simplified, heroic terms; this book is about some of the messy complexities that really occur, far from the headlines. (Incidentally, my own family connections with India go back about 150 years, beginning with railways in the South, then continuing with judges, soldiers, diplomats and, myself, engineering. As an army officer at the time of Malayan Independence I have even been responsible for \\"aid to the civil power\\".

However, I must make another confession: the old text sometimes has words that had me reaching for my Merriam Webster dictionary because I suddenly said, \\"huh?\\" while reading.The best aspect of the one-year KJV is that it provides a variety of readings on a daily basis--a little OT, a little NT, something from Psalms, something from Proverbs--so you don't have a long, hard slog through some books, like the oh-so-gruesome Book of Leviticus. This variety speeds the process along, and really at a couple pages a day, they do make it easy for you.My one gripe about the one-year format is that it is not good for referencing specific books, chapters, or passages. For instance, sometimes I may have a need to look up a specific book. Given the not-quite-sequential nature of the daily readings, I find myself wishing for a traditionally ordered KJV, so I have the feeling that I'll be buying that next.And so, on December 31, I managed to complete my reading of the King James Bible. I did not read every single day...Later in the year I ended up reading a week at a time when my schedule was free. That doesn't always allow for a deep reading or understanding. And, honestly, the highfalutin language got to be a little too much even for me. I might try the Revised Standard Version or (maybe) the NIV at some later point so I have a clearer idea of what I was reading. Or I'll pick up a study bible so I could get some things clarified.So what did I learn? If I had to summarize the Old Testament and New Testament separately, I would use the following verses:\\"I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\\" (Exodus 20:2-6)This seems to sum up the \\"story\\" of the Old Testament nicely. God made a pact with his chosen people, Israel, and obedience to Him was the primary thing he required on his side of the bargain. The Old Testament then goes on to show all the bad things that happen to the Israelites when they do not obey--God's favor is withdrawn, and their nation suffers. This lesson, the first of the Ten Commandments, has resonance today because, if human beings do not start with a belief in God to whom they are answerable, they are likely to violate all the other Commandments as well.The New Testament can be summed up by that verse you see on signs at football games, John 3:16:\\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\"If the Old Testament emphasizes God's law, the New Testament emphasizes His love, as exemplified by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The New Testament has three great heroes: Jesus is the subject of the story and also the great story teller; the apostle Peter is the leader who falls and then redeems himself after Jesus's crucifixion; St. Paul is the great evangelizer and systematizer of Christian doctrine and behavior.If I had to pick a favorite book or two out of the Bible, I would pick the Psalms for their sheer poetry and ability to bring comfort and joy. Following that, I might choose the Book of Ecclesiastes and the Gospel of Matthew, which seems to be the Gospel that speaks in the clearest language.I am glad that I finally read the Bible all the way through. It was something I needed to do. However, when I next feel like educating myself on its text, I will take the easier way out and try a version closer to the language I speak."},{"Title":"The One Year Bible KJV","review":"I've read the bible all the way through a couple of times in the past. Started at Genesis and worked my way through to Revelation. At the beginning the reading was action packed and very dynamic. But there were certain times when I had to admit that reading nothing but prophesies and the written law got kind of difficult. It's a lot better to have a plan that includes a mixture of all.This book makes it easier and a lot more interesting. I started with the New Living Version of the One year Bible in paperback around this time last year. It was the same size as this book. The font size was a bit small and hard to read. Then I found a large print NLV soft cover edition and purchased that one also.I purchased this version because of the familiar language of the King James but the font size is still a bit small for me. Nevertheless these One Year Bibles are a great way of reading through the bible in a year. I'm already into my second year of reading through the bible. The readings are arranged in four groups: first are a few chapters of the Old Testament, second a chapter from the New Testament, third one chapter from the book of psalms and finally a couple of verses from proverbs.The readings go through all of the Psalms twice which is a good feature. I spend about 20 minutes each morning and I hope to continue in this fashion. I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading through the bible."},{"Title":"The One Year Bible KJV","review":"I absolutely love this bible!! 2010 will be my 5th year in a row to read the bible through using the One Year Bible.

You can begin at any point during the year and read the entire bible through by that time the next year.

I have used other reading plans with my Bible but there is just a mind set of accomplishing more if you read front to back rather than flipping around in the Bible to read each day.

Running the dangerous roads of 1970 Cambodia in pursuit of both news and personal fame, the author allows his readers a special insight into his soul. Anson's accounts of the deaths of his friends and colleagues, as well as the details of his own capture and detention by revolutionary forces, are remarkably vivid and painful to read, but at the same time filled with a special sense of black humor. No emotion, no matter how unflattering, is hidden from the reader. The author would certainly not be surprised to learn that the attitudes of US Embassy bureaucrats toward the death and disappearance of these same journalists was no different twenty years later than it was during the course of the war."},{"Title":"War News: A Young Reporter in Indochina","review":"This is a very good account of what happened in Cambodia in 1970. The author worked for Time in Saigon, and was ousted to cover Laos and Cambodia because of his anti war views. A Vietnamese friend he worked with in Saigon was critical in his survival in Cambodia.In Cambodia, he sees the massacre of Cambodians by the Vietnamese, and the massacre of Vietnamese by Cambodians. Vietnamese in Cambodia ran most of the businesses and had the skilled labor knowledge. Cambodians resented this.Several reporters died covering the Cambodian fighting, including Sean Flynn, the son of Errol Flynn.The author saved a bunch of Vietnamese from slaughter by the Cambodians.Later, he was captured by the Cambodians and turned over to the North Vietnamese. The North Vietnamese checked his background to determine whether or not to shoot him.Because of his friendship of a Vietnamese who also worked for Time, his life was spared.In 1985 the author returned to Vietnam and visited his old Time friend. It turned out he was a Col in the North Vietnmaese army.The Col explained that he was not killed while a captive as they were friends.He also describes the battles with Time staff and his marriage."},{"Title":"War News: A Young Reporter in Indochina","review":"I came close not to buying this book in a second hand book store. I read Anson's views on Richard Nixon, and found them not very objective, so when I saw this book about the Vietnam War I was not sure. The book is very readable, and Anson makes sure to detail his own weaknesses in the book, especially his rocky marriage and use of drugs and alcohol. He details his coverage of the war. Also details his views on the Cambodian government and their Vietnamese massacres. He is sypathetic to the NVA, even though several of his friends were killed by them. His personal stories are the best in detailing the corruption of Cambodian and South Vietnamese governments."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"good and ill together. That line from Shakespeare's All's Well that Ends Well captures the essence of Neil Gaiman's latest creation, Anansi Boys.Charlie Nancy is one of life's more passive characters. He is perpetually embarrassed by those around him. He grew up in Florida embarrassed by his father who had an eye for the ladies, never seemed to have a job, and who bestowed upon Charlie the nickname \\"Fat Charlie\\". It is a name that stuck to Charlie like glue and has followed him everywhere he goes, even to England where he now lives and works. More than anything else, Fat Charlie is embarrassed by himself. His life is an endless stream of self-conscious needless apologies for his life. As one would expect from a character like Charlie he is timid in front of his boss and can't seem to convince his fianc&eacute; that there is nothing wrong with consummating their relationship prior to their marriage. The word perpetually frustrated comes to mind here.As the story opens, Fat Charlie is back in Florida for the funeral of his father. Charlie no doubt hopes his dad's death, which occurred while singing a song in a Karaoke bar much to Charlie's embarrassment, will put an end to his own state of perpetual embarrassment. That is the closure Charlie seeks. But the old ladies who made up his Dad's circle of friends tell Fat Charlie that their father was something of a god, in fact a spider god. They also tell Fat Charlie he has a brother. Fat Charlie, of course, will have none of this nonsense and returns to England.Of course, life is never so simple for any character drawn by Neil Gaiman. It turns out Fat Charlie does have a brother, Spider, who is everything Charlie is not. Spider is personable, charming, glib, and has the ability to charm the pants off just about anyone he desires. As the name Spider implies, Charlie is soon drawn into the parallel world inhabited by Spider a world of small gods and vengeful animals. Fat Charlie is introduced to a whole new universe of characters and his ability to distinguish between fact and fantasy grows increasingly thin.Anansi Boys worked on two levels for me. First, I actually grew attached to the character of Fat Charlie. I was surprised that I developed such empathy for Fat Charlie. Generally, I do not find \`passive' characters all that attractive, but, as the book wore on I felt myself rooting for him. Second, Anansi Boy is, at its heart a story about a dysfunctional (but very funny) family and explores how its members try to reach some accommodation with their past and their present relationships. This is not meant to imply that the book is weighed down with ponderous statements on the meaning of life or families; far from it. The great success of Gaiman's writing in my opinion is that he can handle a topic with both humor and sensitivity. The story does not bog down in \`deep thoughts'. Gaiman spins his yarn and leaves it up to the reader to read between the laughs. I found the conclusion to be particularly well done.Anansi Boys, like the spiders that form its conceptual heart, draws you inexorably into its web until you cannot get out. Fortunately, Gaiman has spun such a fine yarn that you don't mind being ensnared at all. This was a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I have a comment on the CD version because, frankly, it was much more magical and interesting than the written work by itself. Anansi stories were made to tell around a fire at night, or out on the trail to pass the time, or, ever so quietly, while casting in a line to fish.They are stories for people who do things, not just read things.You can't read \\"Evil-doers beware!\\" and not think it's all a bit silly. But when you hear it around the fire, and thrill to the sound in your own blood, it doesn't sound silly at all. THAT's the power of stories told instead of read.More importantly, Lenny Henry's voice captures every character as a unique creation. At first, the island accents are a little hard to follow, but then you get into the spirit of the thing. I know Lenny Henry as a comedian. I think the best comedians are observers and Henry has clearly observed a lot.I enjoyed Mrs. Higler and Graham Coates the best, I suppose. Mrs. Higler is the voice of every well-meaning-but-meddling old woman who ever lived. Graham Coates is a fat weasel of a man who wants to be a big man. We've all met their type before. Lenny Henry takes us into their hearts with just a little bit of pacing and a fake accent or two.Truthfully, though, I liked the stories BEHIND the stories, the original African tales worked into the novel, most of all. I played them for the toughest audience in the world-- my five-year old son. My son listened to the Anansi stories with a smile on his face that could outshine the sun. At the end of the tar-baby story he laughed and asked for more.(Unfortunately, some of the book is a little too intense for young kids. So, I'm probably going to spend a fortune on e-bay to find some tapes Lenny Henry made of Mother Goose Tales. If they're half as good as Gaiman's & Henry's tale, it'll be worth it.)I saw that a lot of people didn't like the book and all of those reviews compared this book unfavorably with American Gods. I suppose that's so. American Gods is a dark ride through the landscape and the psyche. It's magic at it's most threatening. A tale of terrors long-forgotten. A tiger tale. And those have their place.If that's the only type of tale you like -- then neither this book nor this recording are for you.But if there's a little \\"flexibility\\" in how you view the world. . . if you like to hear someone new tell an old story. . . if you think Br'er Rabbit and Bugs Bunny are zen philosophers in disguise. . . .Well, then, this might be the best story you've ever heard."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys started off a little slowly, I thought. Fat Charlie was such a drab anti-hero, but I found myself wondering how this guy was going to become interesting, because I genuinely liked the character despite his awkwardness. Neil Gaiman does a fantastic job pacing this story. We get sucked into the eccentricities of Charlie's brother, Spider, right along with Charlie. I found myself getting frustrated with Spider, much as I imagine Charlie was.By the second half of the story, you could see the brothers' relationship changing. They were feeding off each other in a way, taking on characteristics of each other. Brilliantly done.An interesting addition to the book was the 2 or 3 fables about Anansi that were spaced out in the first half of the tale. It made for a great lead-in to the interaction at the beginning/end of the world. I especially liked the scene with Tiger and the weasel. More so than in American Gods and Neverwhere, I felt Neil's writing was up to the task of his creativity. Definitely recommended to anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"You think your dad is embarrassing? Well, at least he isn't an African trickster god -- now that would be nothing but trouble.But it's what you'd expect of Neil Gaiman, who is best known for his witty, slightly wonky brand of dark fantasy -- and his ability to spin up the most absurd stories in an entertaining fashion. And \\"Anansi Boys\\" features Gaiman getting in touch with his lighter, playful more humorous side, in a sort-of-sequel to his smash hit \\"American Gods.\\"Fat Charlie's dad has always been weird -- brass bands for the terminally ill, nicknames that stick, and much more. But even away from his dad, Charlie isn't happy. Then he gets the news that his dad died during a karaoke song; when he goes to the funeral, an old neighbor tells him that Daddy was really Anansi the spider god. Even worse, Charlie finds out he has a brother.Spider is everything Charlie isn't -- charming, debonair, witty, and magical. Soon he has not only taken over Fat Charlie's house, but his fiancee as well, distracting Fat Charlie from his boss's attempts to frame him. Determined to get rid of Spider, Fat Charlie enlists the Bird Woman's help -- but soon finds that his pact will only get them in deeper trouble with the ancient gods.Trickster gods -- like Anansi, Loki, Kokopelli, or even a bit of Hermes -- are always the most entertaining part of old myths and legends. They're unpredictable, unmistakable, get all the best lines, and perpetually wild'n'crazy -- and they are also the worst kinds of dads you could imagine. They probably wouldn't make wonderful brothers, either.So of course, Gaiman goes to town with \\"Anansi Boys,\\" by simply forming a story around that idea: what if a trickster god had two kids, who were nothing alike, but suddenly had to deal with one another? Gaiman also sprinkles it liberally with corporate intrigue, romance, and the old Anansi legends (which he inserts periodically). Don't expect the darker overtones of \\"American Gods,\\" because this is a very different story.With this lighter tone, Gaiman sounds a lot like his pal Terry Pratchett, right down to wry humor and on-the-spot comic timing. And the dialogue is pure gold: \\"There are three things, and three things only, that can lift the pain of mortality and ease the ravages of life. These things are wine, women and song.\\" \\"Curry's nice too.\\" Gaiman seems to be having a lot of fun in this book.And nowhere is the fun more clear than in Spider and Fat Charlie. They're like yin and yang -- one brother is charming, conscienceless and self-consciously divine in his attitude, and the other is nervy, awkward and painfully mundane. Spider's charm leaps out from the page, while Fat Charlie is sort of Gaiman's \\"Charlie Brown.\\" Don't worry, Fat Charlie improves as the book goes on.Everyone gets annoyed by their siblings and embarrassed by their dad, but the \\"Anansi Boys\\" have a life more complex than most. Lighter than most Neil Gaiman books, but hilarious, dark and perpetually clever."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I think that if Anansi Boys had not been written by Neil Gaiman, I would have been inclined to give it a much higher rating. To be clear-- I enjoyed it; I laughed out loud; I was interested the whole time to see what would happen next as the book continued.It is unfortunate for me that the book suffered a little bit by comparison to Gaiman's other work. When I compared it to Neverwhere and American Gods, the enjoyment got just a little bit paler. I liked it, but I did not love it. It somehow felt like much more of a toss off than either of those two great books.This said, I would still recommend the book to Gaiman fans and non-Gaiman fans alike. You should be aware that it is not a sequel to American Gods, just sort of set in the same universe. Even if I do not like it quite as much as is other books, it has a really nice Tim Powers flavor to it which gives it some punch."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman has the uncanny ability to take supernatural things and make them part of the day-to-day life that so many of us stumble through. With his keen insights, warmth, and wit, Gaiman shares those words - supernatural and everyday - in a manner that is delightfully hypnotic.ANANSI BOYS is an off-shoot of sorts of AMERICAN GODS but succeeds terrifically on its own. Anansi is the spider god, the trickster god, of certain cultures in Africa, and it only seems just that Gaiman spins his tale with a lot of sleight-of-hand twists and turns that may catch even his veteran readers off guard.I had a blast with this book. The story and characters were solidly built and presented, but I had the additional joy of listening to the novel on audiobook in my car. The narrator, Lenny Henry, is an absolute godsend to this book (no pun intended). His voice characterizations are spot-on and every character he brings to life is unique and separate. Henry is the master of understated British inflection and Caribbean sing-song dialect, as well as male and female voices. I hung on his every word, and there are plenty of characters for Henry to showcase.The story revolves around Fat Charlie Nancy, who didn't know he was the son of the trickster god, Anansi. Fat Charlie had known his upbringing had always been different because his father wasn't like anyone else he'd ever met.The way that Gaiman starts the story drew me in immediately. It's just the story of a guy, the kind of guy you've probably met over and over again throughout your life. Fat Charlie doesn't take chances and doesn't live a big life. He does just enough to get by, but not enough to attract success or ire.However, on the eve of his wedding, he learns that his father - from whom he's been estranged - has died. I liked the way that Fat Charlie didn't know how he was supposed to react to that news. Not only that, he didn't know how he felt. It wasn't like he was going to miss the father that was never around.At the funeral, weirdness steps in. One of the old women he'd known as a child hands him a shovel and tells him that he has to bury his father. I was rocked by this because I didn't know what I would have done. Fat Charlie thinks about it a moment, then rolls his sleeves up and gets to work.Afterwards, the old woman and Fat Charlie start talking about family. She reveals that Fat Charlie has a brother - Spider - that he apparently has forgotten. The way Gaiman works in his twists and turns is awesome. He'll just hit you between the eyes with them, let you know they're there, then turn whatever you were thinking on its head and surprise you again.When Fat Charlie gets curious and calls out to his brother, Spider shows up. And that's when things get really weird. Magic seeps into the book, and its stealthily trailed by menace. Both of those additions continue to grow until the fate of the world literally hangs in the balance.Gaiman is an absolute master of showing interpersonal relationships that we all have. He knows the good parts and the bad, and he dishes on both. His dialogue shines, and his humor ranges from deadpan to over-the-top that left me howling out loud. Best of all, this is a book that you can share with your kids on long drives. The story is simple and the characters are unique. There's no objectionable material, and the problems of family can be understood by kids as well as adults.One of the best parts of the book is the integration of the Anansi legends among the story. I enjoyed listening to those tales, so much like many other folk legends I've heard.ANANSI BOYS is a great book about family with a hint of fantasy, or maybe it's a fantasy novel with a great message about families. Either way, it's a delightful tale that will keep you and possibly your family entertained for hours whether on the page or in the CD player. Best of all, it's a story that I'm planning to read or listen to again because it's going to be a perennial favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I am very picky about the audiobooks I'll listen to on my long commute. I've opened up books that I was very much looking forward to \\"reading,\\" only to throw box and all against the rear window of the car after ten minutes of some boob murdering the prose. So when I find one I like, that means I like it a lot.Commedian Lenny Henry's rich voice and delightfully accented character readings really bring Neil Gaiman's Anansi Boys to life. Henry floats easily between an Americanized urban accent, thick British types, a hilarious cabal of little old black ladies in the wilds of Florida, and a number of Caribbean voices. His voice can be light enough that the females don't sound ridiculous.Revisiting a character from American Gods, but zooming in on a more focused set of players, this is the story of \\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy, an easily embarrassed, buttoned-down accountant in London with a dead-end job and a nice finac&eacute;e. He makes a call to a family friend in Florida to invite his debonair, estranged father to the wedding, but finds his father has just died. After the funeral Charlie learns his father was the god Anansi, and that he had another son, Spider, that Charlie didn't know about. Not really believing any of it, he summons Spider, who quickly turns Charlie's life inside-out. Ancient animosities and modern crimes merge in Gaiman's fast-moving narrative. His sense of humor does not fly in your face -- you have to be paying attention and thinking things through -- but the comedy is rich and rewarding, in that restrained way the English are so bloody good at.Several times listening to this I've laughed out loud, and kept chortling for another mile or so at some turn of phrase or quirk of character, or one of Henry's particular voices. I can recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoys Gaiman's sense of whimsy and storytelling."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Start with a strong story...No, a Charles Atlas of a story... a story worthy of the Owner of Stories, Anansi himself. (Yes, Gaiman's story was Just That Good).Then find the Perfect Voice to tell that story.Even if you've read Anansi Boys in book form, do yourself a favor and get the audiobook. Lenny Henry brings it to life with a vocal characterization that will astonish you.Spoil yourself, do."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm not reviewing the book, or the author but only the audio tape. I have not read this book, but have read other Neil Gaiman stories. I didn't think I would ever listen to anything better than Jim Dale's narrative of Harry Potter, but I was wrong. Lenny Henry is fabulous!! I can't say this is a good read since I've only listened. It is a wonderful audio tape. (assuming you enjoy fantasy) Lenny Henry should win a Grammy for this. I didn't put it away half way through the book, in fact I couldn't wait for the right moment to start listening again. This is not a heavy story like \\"American Gods\\" or Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\", it is more like \\"Stardust\\" with less mythology and more fantasy. I found it light hearted yet absorbing."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I love Neil Gaiman's work. I buy short story collections solely for his parts. I own every sandman comic book, in fact, every comic book he's ever done, including some only released in Britain. I was so excited when i heard about American Gods... and boy was I disappointed. Dull, slow paced, glacial, even.Luckily, this book is everything that American Gods was not. Funny, sweet, sad, wonderful. I devoured this book like a gourmet treat in 2 days after purchase and I would read it again in another 2. It's one of the best things he's ever written."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I finally read a Neil Gaiman book,after years of recommendations. Or well, listened to the audio version. I was hesitant at first and while Fat Charley was an ok character, Spider initially annoyed me. After several pages of humorous chaos and magic, magic all around, I eventually came to love all the characters and Mr. Gaiman's writing, which is witty and very funny, while still maintaining a serious book. I loved the incorporation of the old lady characters, specially Mrs. Higler, and Rosie's mom. They were a hoot.But the best, best, best part of this book was Lenny Henry, the man that reads this audiobook. He made it magical. For hours and hours of listening I completely forgot this was only one man reading, and I actually thought there were men, young women, old women and even tigers talking. He is amazing and somehow added to the magic of the book. I still can't figure out how he made me forget about him. I had never heard of him (which is surprising since I'm a huge fan of Dawn French), but now I'm his biggest fan. I just have to hope that he's read more books I can listen to.So all in all, I'm a new fan of Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"By far one of the best novels I've ever read! Ok, it started off a bit slow for me but I found myself utterly HOOKED to this book. Fat Charlie comes off as a very nervous person, while he unknowingly, but later learns of his cool suave brother, Spider. The relationship between them is faulty at first glance, but as the story progresses, they become closer when all history and challenges are known. The character Spider has got to be the most significant character for me, but I really wish that his relationship with Rosie would have been elaborated more. The ending could not have been any better, and infact, almost brought a tear to my eye."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Okay, let me first start out by saying...Something is seriously... different about Neil Giaman. Where does he come up with this stuff? Is he a drug addict, or is he crazy, or maybe just a genius! I vote for the latter. I LOVE this guy's work. Funny, Fresh, and, well, Terrific. This is one of my most favorite books! Maybe someday I'll write something this good... MAYBE! No spoilers here, sorry. There are enough reviews you can get the gist of this book! Just know it is a great,crazy, and fun read!Thanks Neil!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm not sure I would have picked this up had it not come so highly recommended to me, but I couldn't pass it up after hearing its high praises.This is the first Neil Gaiman book I've read (or, listened to, to be more accurate) and I can see why he's so loved. I was constantly reveling in his way with words, his delightful way of putting things, and his fantastic vocabulary. It truly is a literary feast.Anansi Boys is not a rambling book by any means, but it also isn't a typical page turner. I was always curious to read more because I liked the characters, but it's not packed with action or cliff hangers, so it might not be everyone's literary style (though, it's not pretentious in the least!)The story itself is totally enjoyable! More of a character story than anything else, the main focus of the book (at least at the start) is the struggles of \\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy - his confidence, his relationship with his father, his mother-in-law-to-be.... But when his father passes away, things start to come out - secrets withheld from him that are truly out of this world. Perhaps Charlie's life isn't as simple as it seems...Another thing I was pleased about was how \\"clean\\" the book was. If it were a movie, I doubt it would receive much more than a PG to PG-13 rating.Now, if I'm being truly picky, there were a few plot points that felt a little hazy - but that could be part of Gaiman's goal, to give the story a slightly mythical/fable-ish feeling (or, it could be because of the slightly scratched library cds...) Either way, it didn't bug me, and didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of this tale. The characters are very realized and I felt quite attached to all the protagonists.I loved, loved, LOVED the audio version of this! Expertly produced and perfectly read, the narrator made this tale such an enjoyment to listen to! The voices were so rich and varied that I was always amazed it was done by one man.Definitely recommended highly!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The story was generally likable, it played with traditional African story telling elements quite well and to top this off at the end it became, in certain parts, a laugh out loud funny book. However that's all I can pretty much say about it. It isn't the type of book that's bound to stay with me for any length of time although I certainly wouldn't object if I found myself trapped on an airplane with nothing but this to read. In short - I'm going easy on my review and am giving my real 3 1/2 star rating the bump up service to 4 stars instead.I suppose if I were pressed to say what it was that failed to leave a great impact on me was perhaps the fact that it played its cards a bit too heavily on the side of the traditional folk tale. Much like the stories of its title character we do not sit down and retell Anansi stories because they are rip roaring adventures or anything new. From the beginning we know that things are bound to go A Certain Way. For example from page one I knew that Rosie wasn't going to maintain her currant role in Fat Charlie's life for long and I was right. Not because I posses any kind of psychic powers or read any online spoilers, but just because that was what her functional roll in the plot was supposed to do. Likewise with anyone or anything else in the story. This is not to say that Anansi boys is boring in it's predictability, because it's not, but rather that in some ways it's a story we've heard many times before - only made a little new and a little fresh to keep our attention.Is this a bad thing? No. Should it have tried to unfold its self in another manner? Again I have to say that I would say no. Perhaps by sticking to close to its source material it took a bit of the mystery out of the whole thing but then again it does manage to pay homage to its humble beginnings in traditional folk tale. After all we do not continue to listen and repeate real Anansi stories because they're any great, complex works of art. We continue to do so because they are amusing and they make us laugh, keep us entertained and are a fine way to pass the time and with this in mind I'll say that Anansi Boys has yet to do me a disservice by not continuing in a similar vein."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This book is great; with Lenny Henry's audio, it's magnificent. I picked up Anansi Boys knowing nothing about the premise (fromAmerican Gods: A Novelor even the jacket flap). This might be the best way to read Gaiman: jump right in without preconception. Trust him. He crafts a comfy little everyday world of people who spark, here and there, with eccentricity: The kindly old neighbor lady, the clumsy hero, his dutiful fianc&eacute;e, her acidic mother, his grinning and predatory boss and his carefree father. Think you know them? Watch out: some of those sparks catch fire in very surprising ways. Like the best writers of fantasy, Gaiman begins with the mundane and then, with surprising feints, introduces the bizarre. His supernatural world is revealed in fits and starts, keeping us perpetually off-balance as to its rules. Start to guess where the magic lies, and Gaiman will twist reality into another unexpected contortion before you can catch him. Like Fat Charlie, we fumble through the story feeling confused and then smart, tricked then triumphant -- and Gaiman stays a step ahead of us, weaving it all together as deftly as Anansi himself.Anansi Boys is an epic story of family, identity and courage -- both the unworldly courage of gods and the more impressive, everyday courage of women and men. This translation of the Anansi story -- bringing Caribbean and West African animal gods to life in London and Florida -- breaks free from clich&eacute; into utter originality. And Lenny Henry's voice work (especialy his laugh-out-loud timing)elevates the entire book. This might be one of the most diverse casts of characters in literary memory, and this incredible talent with accents and dialect brings each one of them to life.Could anyone else transform fear into birds (and back again) one moment, and bring down the house with a karaoke rendition of \\"Under the Boardwalk\\" the next? If there is magic - if there are gods among us - they might just tell stories like this."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"What can I say about Neil Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\"!?! It's definitely Gaiman's deliberate and very successful attempt to bring comedy to his storytelling gift of rustling up the reader's imagination. Before everything, I have to say the part that made me laugh out loud was the part deep in the story where Daisy was expressing her dread of her job, much like a particular movie character (many of you can relate to this already, can't you?).The images the 1st chapter brings to mind are nothing short of an adult-like look at a Saturday-morning cartoon! And, that's just setting up the \\"real story\\" that the rest of the book tells.The premise of a family member who comes into the main character's life and just WON'T go back home is a situation with which many people can relate, much to their own chagrins, and that is what happens here. But, this particular family member has a very special talent and he uses it to impose on his brother's life...!The sub-plots are kept to a minimum, unlike in Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\" [yet, that is a very good book]!The interesting thing about \\"Anansi Boys\\" is that Gaiman reverently \\"nods\\" to the ART of storytelling in the African and African-American traditions; in somewhat the same way as he did in \\"American Gods\\", he puts in short stories of that genre at the end of certain chapters, but [thankfully] not as many.Gaiman also respectfully nods to the ART of song and singing, which is very interesting and, I would imagine, challenging and he arose to the challenge very well: I mean, have you ever read a book where the narrator described a song as it is being sung? Plus, at a few more points throughout the story, especially at the end, Gaiman expresses just how special songs are; that's a really nice touch!As you read Gaiman's books, you find that the main character, at some point deep in the story, must go through a major rite of passage, that death doesn't necessarily mean \\"dead and gone\\" and that YOU WILL get a full-length, real-life history lesson late in the story; perhaps this is Gaiman's means of re-establishing the balance of FACT and REALITY to all the IMAGINATION and FANTASY that he has stirred up in the readers' minds; my favorite \`lesson' of his is in \\"American Gods\\" (it's about Lookout Mountain). Gaiman also makes it evident that he loves to EAT! In this and in \\"Neverwhere\\", he has major scenes that describe the food being eaten at a certain meal, and the tastes, smells and the sounds and how much the characters enjoy their meals!If you like chuckling while you read, you must read \\"Anansi Boys\\"; and then watch out for a 7-legged spider :o ..."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Want good reading? Neil Gaiman's your man. Unfortunately, now that I've read Anansi Boys, I've read all of his books. I guess I'll have to work on my Sandman collection -- \\"Collection\\" being my way of saying \\"I have two of the books and maybe I can buy more someday!\\" I like \\"collection\\" better.Gaiman has become one of my very favorite authors over the last year or two. I loved Good Omens and American Gods, which were the first two books of his I read; when I found The Sandman I was even more impressed. Now that I've read Neverwhere, Stardust, Smoke and Mirrors and now, Anansi Boys, I think I can safely say that he's become one of my heroes. He has this amazing ability to inspire me, since I enjoy everything about his books: his humor, the characters, the themes and the concepts.Anansi Boys was as good as the rest. It's the story of the son of Anansi the Spider living in modern day England. Anansi dies, and his son, Fat Charlie Nancy, discovers that he has a brother that he didn't know about; wackiness ensues, along with some rather spooky bits and some really interesting thoughts about the power of storytelling. One of the big themes of the book is how much our stories influence our lives; Anansi owns all the stories, they say, because he stole, bought, and earned them from Tiger, who had them before the Spider came. When the Tiger had all the stories, they were all about savagery and bloodshed and being the strongest and fiercest, because that is what Tiger is; it was Anansi that made the stories focus on cleverness and fun, on getting the greatest reward for the least effort by using your brain. Because the stories focused on cleverness, that became the favored attribute in the world that told those stories; Anansi's stories were what made people grow and evolve, and use their minds to become more than animals.So stories are what make us human, and what make us what we are. I like that. I wonder just how much of me comes from the first stories I learned, the books I read that stuck with me -- like Tolkien and Sherlock Holmes and Poe and Dr. Seuss and King Arthur. And Harriet the Spy and Alvin's Secret Code. I think the answer to that is: quite a lot. I think how different I might be if my first important stories had been about athletes, or rock stars, or war heroes.Anyway, I loved the book, very funny and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is the story of Fat Charlie Nancy, who's not fat, but his father gave him the nickname and it stuck. His father has been the bane of his existence--always embarrassing, always a womanizer. And then he dies, and even his death is embarrassing, but Charlie returns to Florida for the funeral, thinking the torment is over.Then he finds out that his father was Anansi, the spider god, and that he himself has a brother, Spider, who inherited his father's powers; and when Spider moves in with him, Charlie realizes it's only just beginning.In true Gaiman fashion, the story is full of humor, fantastical things made real, and an abundance of twists and turns such that you give up trying to figure out where he's going to take you next and just hang on for the ride. There's even a wonderfully romantic, if slightly skewed, love story. It's the same universe as American Gods, where the gods are real and live among humans, though it's not really a sequel, and the two books can be read separately. And it's a coming-of-age-story of sorts, in that Charlie and Spider both grow up emotionally.I can't think of anything else to say that hasn't been said already, and much more coherently--I'm rendered speechless by extreme fangirlishness. Great book. I knew it would be."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is billed as a sequel to _American Gods,_ but the only character in it from the earlier book is Mr. Nancy, the old black guy with the fedora and the yellow gloves, and he's dead, of a heart attack in the middle of a number at a karaoke bar. But Mr. Nancy -- Anansi -- you will remember, is a god, though a minor one. He's a storyteller, a songmaker, and, above all, a trickster. So maybe he's not really dead. Or not permanently. But the story is really about his son, Fat Charlie (who isn't fat at all, but when Anansi names something it stays named), and his son, Spider (charming and largely amoral), each of whom has inherited some of his father's talents. And it's about Rosie and her terrifying mother, and about Detective Constable Daisy, and about Grahame Coats, a dastardly criminal, and about the four old ladies who knew Mr. Nancy when they were young. Gaiman tells it all in rollicking good humor, though it gets somewhat darker as the narrative progresses. Not the heavy truths of _American Gods,_ just some smaller ones, but still important. A very pleasant afternoon's reading."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"ANANSI BOYS by Neil GaimanReview by Nickolas CookFor those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling &eacute;lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition. With \\"Anansi Boys\\" he again proves all of those qualities and more.'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, \\"American Gods\\"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death. 'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human. And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider. Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fianc&eacute; right out from under him.Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human. But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self. For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother. He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death.Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace. There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven.\\"Anansi Boys\\" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of \\"American Gods\\" and the extraordinary \\"Neverwhere\\", but fits nicely along side his \\"Stardust\\". It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by some of his other fiction.--Nickolas Cook"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I loved this book. However, I did not buy it here. When I noticed the Mass Market Paperback was $2 less than the digital kindle edition, I got pissed off and got it out of the library. My willingness to buy books digitally for the convenience only lasts so long as I feel that I am not getting *completely* ripped off."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Who can suspend disbelief better than Neil Gaiman? This book was released in 2005, and it's still a bestseller. I've read all of Neil Gaiman's Sandman graphic novels, and now I'm making my way through his other books.I liked Anansi Boys even better than American Gods. This book had more developed characters (the sons of Anansi), and Gaiman seemed to enjoy filling them out. It's amazing how Gaiman can make a character likeable (Spider), then unlikeable, then likeable again. Who else can create characters that are outlandish, petty, and still endearing? What a storyteller.I read the book in a single 24 hour period, and even though I was exhausted, it still kept me up until midnight. That's the sign of a really fantastic book."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is not Neil Gaiman delivering his best story. I'm not going to speculate as to what is, and I'm not saying that the story telling in Anansi Boys is poor, but his oeuvre is such that it's hard for an odd little book like this to compete. What Anansi Boys may deliver is Gaiman's best *writing*. There's a certain way Gaiman has of phrasing things -- of moving between and linking ideas -- that has always kept my rapt attention every bit as much as his storytelling, and it finds what may be its perfect vehicle in this narrative. I rarely mark my books in any way, but I have at least a dozen pages in my copy of Anansi Boys dog-eared so that I can easily find specific passages for inspiration while writing.If you require an urgent plot to keep you reading, Anansi Boys may leave you feeling unfulfilled. If, however, you're willing to enjoy a tale about sons of a trickster god coming to terms with the consequences of their lineage conveyed in language that I, at least, could sustain myself on, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This book is hilarious and even better than American Gods. It makes for a light, quick read with plenty of British humor to make you laugh out loud. Of course, there are serious parts to the book when danger is imminent, but you know it can't all go wrong. After all, how could their father leave them to fend for themselves...or does he? I love the character development, especially for Spider, and the sibling rivalry is great. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman knows no limit to creative uniqueness and literary genius. He is similar in his writing style, genius (yes I said it again) and knowledge of mythology and history as another master of literature, Brad Steiger (if you don't know him, you must be living in a cave! Look Steiger up!). In this book, Gaiman brings us into the ancient stories of Anansi the Trickster Spider and what future his offspring have in our modern, gritty world. If you are a fan of comedy, mythology or just want a great read with non-stop slapstick humor and that unique Gaiman-esque creativity that comes with his work, you absolutely MUST pick up Anansi Boys! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"American Gods had some flaws in it that I seriously didn't like. But this one, the only possible complaint I might make against it is that the initial premise of a half-god who doesn't know he's half-god, thrown into a world which is otherwise our world but for the presence of all the ancient gods anyone's ever believed in, who live and walk among us like regular people, who is suddenly made aware of this state of things. He might have at least created a new cookie cutter for the formula in other words. (Christopher Moore, who wrote on a very similar premise and is the only one who attained even greater awesomeness, made sure to use a different cookie cutter all 3 times between Practical Demonkeeping, Coyote Blue and Bloodsucking Fiends by comparison). But just like \\"V\\" vs. \\"Independence Day\\" sharing the same beginning, that is where the similarities end. Not that V or Independence Day were nearly as cool as this.But this is just great. In every way. Except that maybe tiger could have learned to show mercy. But the part of the ending that involved him wouldn't have been possible if he had. I thought the evil boss was kind of built for a different role than the tiger but they kind of ended up filling the same role there. He was the seriously deplorable villain, in other words, undeniably after the way he moralized the most detestable things that he did, so maybe tiger should have been a little softer, since having established one completely deplorable character, it's not necessary to try to construct another completely independently and later on in the story. Just my thought.But anyway, what few flaws I may find while grasping at straws are in no way worthy of downrating this from the maximum by even one point. This book is great. And I have high standards. I'm a pessimist and I look for the flaws in things much more strongly than their positive attributes. The best part is the ending. Everything perfectly wrapped up, and extremely satisfying in any way. Something certain authors cough cough Michael Crichton Joe Haldeman cough cough (Pardon me! Must be a frog in my throat!) could never accomplish in 65 million years of trying. Enough said.Add to that, the fact that few times has anyone ever suggested an idea that really makes me think. And the idea it brought up in the middle of it - that the human race changed because the stories became Ananci's instead of Tiger's - that they started using their minds because they started creating tools not as weapons but as ways of avoiding work; that really made me think about it. It could even be true. It's incredibly plausible. If it is, it would mean the legend of Ananci is in no small way responsible for elevating the human race above the level of the other animals, for however brief a duration this status may turn out to be. Of course, it could also just be a deceptively enticing thought invented entirely by Neil Gaiman. In which case, hat's off to you Neil Gaiman, because that's no small accomplishment either; making me think about something as being a very clever and interesting notion.EVEN SO, it deserves a serious mention that I have a serious bone to pick with the complete doofuses who designed the back cover to this book. I wonder if they're the same doofuses who designed the cover to \\"The Indian in the Cupboard\\". Doofuses who obviously didn't read 5 whole pages into the books they designed the covers for. The respective authors should have been contacted for approval, is all I'm saying. You don't have to get very far into the book to realize that Fat Charlie is black. His father's an ancient African god who in his human form is specifically described as very dark. The old-women friends of his family were all old Cajun black ladies. Fat Charlie is described as lightER than Spider, but that doesn't change his ethnic status. So then! What's that adolescent white guy doing on the back cover? Who's he supposed to be? Huh? Ticks me off it does."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"\\"Anansi Boys\\" is not so much a sequel to Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" as it is more of a spin-off, a literary \\"Rhoda\\" or \\"Facts of Life.\\" In \\"American Gods\\" there was a trickster god called Anansi or Mr. Nancy, who was a spider but also manifested himself as a swinging black man in the mold of Cab Calloway.When \\"Anansi Boys\\" begins, Mr. Nancy is dead. He leaves behind two sons. One is \\"Fat\\" Charlie Nancy, who is not fat but the childhood nickname given to him by his father has stuck no matter what he does. Though he grew up in Florida, Charlie moved to London as an adult, where he works for a sleazy talent agent and is engaged to a charity worker named Rosie. By any standard Charlie's life is pretty boring.That is until he meets his brother. Charlie's brother goes by the name Spider. He has no job, spending his time flitting from place to place, having a grand old time. He has no steady girlfriends either. What Spider does have is magic. This is what he inherited from his father and that he uses to make himself the life of the party.Charlie makes the mistake of inviting Spider to stay with him and before long Charlie's life is turned upside down. And like house guests everywhere, Spider soon overstays his welcome.If the plot sounds like a sitcome, it's because for the most part it is. It's like \\"Two and a Half Men\\" without the kid. And with a bit of island magic. That makes the book more lighthearted and fun than \\"American Gods\\" but it also doesn't have quite the same impact. Though a fun and engaging read, it's likely to stick with you as long as it takes to flip the channel.Still, I'd recommend it, especially if you're a fan of books like Terry Pratchett's Discworld series that similarly combine humor and fantasy.That is all."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I listened to this one as I drove back and forth to work, 40 minutes each way.

The best thing about this book is how Neil Gaiman can write about black characters without blundgening people over the head with their blackness.He simply weaves the culture into the novel in a seemless way.

Fat Charlie finds himself and his true nature, Spider realizes that he's not immune to love, and even Anansi himself, Daisy (the policewoman), Rosie (Charlie's girlfriend), and the truly evil, cliche-spouting Grahame Coats get what's deserved for better or worse.Add the liberal use of creative similes, metaphors and imagery, and you have a fantasy winner!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This was my first Neil Gaiman novel and I liked it enough to go on to &#34;American Gods&#34;.

You know that old 1960s footage of the all the American girls jumping up and down screaming hysterically when the Beatles visited the US? That's how I feel about Neil Gaiman. (Okay, maybe I wouldn't scream or pass out, but I sure think he's cool.) I like his style -- his writing is easy, intelligent, well-edited, dryly humorous, and just plain charming.Anansi Boys is no exception, and it's especially charming in audio format, thanks to Lenny Henry, an English stand-up comedian whose deep rich voice and character comedy is absolutely perfect for this novel which is based on the African/Caribbean mythology of the trickster spider god Anansi (introduced in American Gods). Henry's voices are brilliant (especially the old Caribbean women) and he had me literally smiling nearly all the way through the story. Actually, if it weren't for Lenny Henry, I'd have to say that I probably would only give this novel 4 stars instead of 4.5.That's because this is not Gaiman's tightest work. It's about Fat Charlie, a Floridian turned Englishman, who was leading a rather dull life as an honest accountant until the brother he didn't know he had turns up and he finds out that they are both the sons of the god Anansi. This is all very entertaining, especially for a Floridian who enjoyed Charlie's travels to places I know, and Gaiman tells his humorous story with the usual charm:\\"Fat Charlie tried to remember what people did in prison to pass the time, but all he could come up with was keeping secret diaries and hiding things in their bottoms. He had nothing to write on, and felt that a definite measure of how well one was getting on in life was not having to hide things in one's bottom .... Nothing happened. Nothing continued to happen. More Nothing. The Return of Nothing. Son of Nothing. Nothing Rides Again. Nothing and Abbott and Costello meet the Wolfman...\\"But at the end there were some things I still didn't understand: what exactly was the origin of Spider (I can't say as much as I'd like to about this because I don't want to spoil it), why weren't the other gods (and even Anansi himself) more fully characterized? The scenes involving the god-world were sketchy -- we really get only a minimal understanding of Tiger, Anansi's eternal enemy -- and Charlie's sudden understanding and acceptance of his powers happens too fast. And then there were some oddities that just didn't seem to fit in -- like the ghost of one of Charlie's boss's clients.But, even with these minor disappointments, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this novel because Neil Gaiman wrote it and Lenny Henry read it. Recommended, especially in audio format.~FantasyLiterature.net"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"ANANSI BOYS (hereinafter AB) is the archetype tale of the hero's quest but in place of the typical warrior hero is a fool, and, oh, it happens to take place in our days and there is the wonder of something magical yet not totally seen.Our fool of a hero is Fat Charlie. He used to be chubby as a kid but now he's in good enough shape yet everyone remembers him as Fat Charlie so the name sticks, much to his chagrin, and, it's all the fault of his father.Wait, did I tell you his father is a trickster African God?That makes it even harder on Fat Charlie because he's not dealing just with a mortal father but a father who is an African God and who can usually persuade people to do almost anything and make them usually laugh over it. At one point, back in the day, when Fat Charlie was a kid, his father tricked him into dressing like President Taft on President's Day and told him everyone else would be dressed that way, too.Well, they were not and Fat Charlie was belittled to tears by the other kids and his father thought it was all amusing.Now, don't start thinking Fat Charlie's father is overly cruel because there are other stories that favor him doing kind things for his son.Did I mention this father, known as Anansi, by the way, has two sons? Fat Charlie is the mortal one and this other son, known as Spider, is the one with all the powers.After Anansi appears to bite it while singing karaoke (something Fat Charlie could never do) there's a big funeral and a series of steps in the story lead to the two brothers linking up for the first time.Spider finally meets Fat Charlie, who lives in London but who grew up in Florida, and Spider decides he wants to live with Fat Charlie for a while.But . . .It turns out that Spider likes Fat Charlie's lifestyle so much that he steals his fiance and takes over his job while Fat Charlie goes off to talk to some witches (four old ladies living in a suburb) to have Spider banished. In doing so, he goes to another dimension where life first began and makes a deal with Bird Woman who has a grudge against Fat Charlie's family.What then takes place is a situation where a mortal and his demigod brother are attacked from several different fronts by this immortal, godlike Bird Woman.Oh, and Fat Charlie gets it for another girl but has to rescue his old fiance and her mother from another superpower in the Bahamas where he learns what it means to be a hero, even if he is truly the archetype fool.Overall, a superb urban fantasy with overlapping themes of coming of age, Pandora's Box, the twists and turns of life andhow we all have family members we really want to get away from. Heh.And, on a far deeper level, one could also say this is about being human, even around the face immortal Gods."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi is the African folktale trickster god brought to the new world by African slaves. Anansi is constantly tricking people and other gods, especially the Tiger god. Humanity was once directed by Tiger stories, beset by violence, power, and stealth. Now that Anansi tells the stories, humanity is fun, tricky, and driven more by intellect.The book starts with Anansi in his human form charming young ladies in a karaoke bar. Anansi keels over with a heart attack leaving his sons, Fat Charlie & Spider. Spider has the powers of his father, he is informal and glib. Whereas Fat Charlie is an awkward bumbling Brit devoid of any god-like powers. The two son's meet and duel as any sibling pair would.The book is filled with adventure in the human and god world. Fat Charlie is constantly fighting with his smarmy boss Graham Coats (Tiger) & his brother over his fianc&eacute;e Rosie. The story takes us from London to Florida and finally in St. Andrews in the West Indies. It's a fun book, much shorter than Neil Gaiman's American Gods. The book wraps up the ending a little hastily as Fat Charlie grows into another character too quickly. Depsite this, it's a fine book and worth a read."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"What do you do when your deceased dad was none other than Anansi, the West African trickster god? This is essentially the tale of Anansi's son Charles \\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy in Neil Gaiman's beautifully told sequel to \\"American Gods\\", the contemporary fantasy novel \\"Anansi Boys\\". Once more Gaiman shows his unique gifts for language and storytelling by conjuring a contemporary fantasy about a deceased god and his two sons. \\"Fat Charlie\\" is one of the most likeable literary creations I've come across lately; an ordinarily passive person who finds unexpectedly that he is not only the son of a god, but has a trickster demigod, \\"Spider\\", for a brother too!Gaiman offers an hilarious update of West African mythology that's played out mainly on the streets of a hippish, but still rather urbane, modern London, with more than a passing nod or two to the spirit of Douglas Adams. I guarantee you that there are laughs a plenty when Spider decides to become involved with Fat Charlie's fiancee, Rosie. Without divuling any more fascinating plot turns and twists, I will note that Gaiman has become one of our most important voices in contemporary fantasy literature. \\"Anansi Boys\\" is without question one of the funniest books from 2005 which I've come across."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"\\"We do not really mean, we do not really mean what we say,\\" is how the Ashanti start their stories about Anansi. \\"It begins, as most things begin, with a song,\\" is Neil Gaiman's preferred formula. Not that it matters, since, as Gaiman points out, all songs are really stories, and all stories are tied together by a web, as are all people. At the centre of the web is Anansi, the spider-man god to whom stories belong, and have done since he tricked them out of Tiger.Anansi has something in common with Loki from Norse mythology, and more with Brer rabbit. He is an inveterate joker, even if the butts of his jokes find the consequences distinctly inconvenient; but it is impossible to dislike him. In that sense, Anansi represents someone we all know well, the charming, irresponsible chancer and teller of tall tales. This book is, at heart, a shaggy dog tale.Gaiman is best-known for his Sandman series of graphic novels, but here he demonstrates an equally vivid ability to portray the mythic and the fantastic in comic prose. In the dedication, he tips his hat to the ghosts of P G Wodehouse and Tex Avery, and slapstick and verbal pyrotechnics are the primary motors of the book.Fat Charlie Nancy (he was fat only for a short period in his childhood, but the nickname stuck), who works in a crooked actors' agency in London, is embarrassed about almost everything. Then his father in Florida keels over with a heart attack while singing in a karaoke bar, tearing the top from a busty blonde during his fall. (These things happen. A friend of mine in his fifties died on the dance floor of Madame Jo-Jo's, the transvestive nightclub in Soho. It wasn't a dignified end, but he'd have enjoyed its comic aspects.)So too with Fat Charlie's dad. As Charlie soon discovers, his father was Anansi the spider, and a god. He finds out, too, from a Caribbean neighbour with a sideline in voodoo, that he has a brother, Spider. Unwisely, Charlie summons up the brother, who seems to have inherited all the family's luck, charm, ability to work minor miracles and, above all, determination to enjoy himself in the most irresponsible manner without any heed for consequences.Like Fat Charlie, we know that actions have consequences, and have no doubt that they will be visited upon the luckless Charlie. From this point, despite excursions into magic and voodoo, the plot brings to mind Waugh. Charlie's life collapses spectacularly; his brother steals his girlfriend, loses him his job and gets him arrested on suspicion of fraud and murder.The resolution of all of this involves, as it always does in comedy, a certain adjustment of the personalities of all the characters, an understanding, and an untangling, of crossed wires in love, and that the bad end badly and the good live happily ever after (or nearest offer). Gaiman's artfulness is to make this template also a story about the nature of stories, and his own considerable charm is expended in telling you what he is going to do, and how he is going to do it, all along the way.The chief pleasure of Anansi Boys, though, is in Gaiman's writing, which has all the casualness of a yarn told in a bar, or while fishing off a bridge with a bottle of beer by your side - Fat Charlie's dad, asked what he does, answers that he \\"loafs and fishes\\". Leaving aside the small details of engaging with the world of the animal gods of the West Indies and Africa, and the incursion of magic into south London and Florida, it also exhibits the ruthless logic essential for comedy of this sort. As in Wodehouse or Decline and Fall, the wheels never come off.Gaiman does not reach those heights, but the apparent effortlessness of this sort of writing requires planning and execution of a very high order. It has moments of predictability, but they are those inherent in farce. Some of the jokes are too facetious for some tastes, others perhaps slightly too macabre. But this is a very accomplished comic novel; the slickness and the slightness are the product of someone who knows exactly what to do with his material. Neil Gaiman is a very good writer indeed, and this is a very funny bedtime story."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I was so excited to see Neil Gaiman's Anansi Boys on the list of available books, because I've always been a big fan. Gaiman's prose always makes me want to write. I don't mean this in the \\"I could have done better than that\\" way, but instead Gaiman inspires me to great heights whenever I read anything by him. Anansi Boys is even better than American Gods, with the story being more personal and, if anything, more intimate. I've been a big fan of Gaiman's since the Sandman comic series, and nothing here will change any of that. Anansi Boys is fantastic.Fat Charlie (not his real name, but it's a name his father gave him, and names his father gives always seem to stick) was taken to England by his mother when he was younger, mainly to get away from his father. Fat Charlie has had a good life, and is now engaged to a wonderful woman, but things start to spiral downward when his fianc&eacute;e, Rosie, insists on inviting his father to their wedding. Fat Charlie finds out that his father has just died, and goes to Florida for the funeral. Thus begins a sequence of events that will introduce Fat Charlie to his charming brother, Spider, a man with the powers of a god. The powers of his father, truth be told. Spider is impulsive and always looking out for his own pleasure, which just makes things worse. But things just get out of control when the other gods get involved. Their father, who is known as Anansi, wasn't exactly well-liked by the other gods, and their revenge may just affect the boys too. Fat Charlie is in way over his head and, for once, so is Spider. Even the old ladies who seem to know what is going on may not be able to help them before it's too late.Turning any of the pages in Anansi Boys was a pure treat for me, as Gaiman's prose just leaps off the page. Gaiman seems fascinated with stories, as most of his other works indicate as well, and here is no different. Anansi stole the stories of the world from Tiger way back when the world was new, and Tiger has forever resented it. Gaiman's love for stories shines through, the words sounding almost lyrical.\\"Stories are like spiders, with all the long legs, and stories are like spiderwebs, which man gets himself all tangled up in but which look so pretty when you see them under a leaf in the morning dew, and in the elegant way that they connect to one another: each to each.\\" Pg 39The narration of the story is interesting. The book is told in third person, but occasionally the narrator will turn and talk to the reader. Just an aside or two, and then back to the story. It's a wonderful technique, which just adds to the mythological aspects of the book. There isn't a clunky word in this book anywhere.Gaiman also gives us a variety of interesting characters, whose stories intertwine gracefully, though a couple of the coincidences grate just a little. This isn't as annoying as it could have been, perhaps because of the mythological nature of the book which seems to require these sorts of things. Fat Charlie ends up meeting Daisy, a financial cop who just happens to be called in on a case involving him? Whatever the case, these were only minor annoyances, and were lessened by the type of story Gaiman is telling.Fat Charlie and Spider make an interesting pair, and while their secret did surprise me, it fits wonderfully in hindsight, given the personality that we see in Fat Charlie. He's not a go-getter, reluctant to put himself out in the middle where he might get hurt. He's a great singer, but he gets complete stage-fright when he's supposed to do it in front of people. He seems to have settled for Rosie and he doesn't have a lot of drive. Spider, meanwhile, is almost the exact opposite, living everything in the moment and moving on when he feels like it.Another good character is Grahame Coats, Fat Charlie's evil boss, who moves from scam to scam whenever things start to get a little hot for him. He always has a contingency plan, but this time, things seem to be going very wrong, and he starts acting crazier and crazier. One thing I didn't like about Coats is how unclear it was how much of Coats personality comes from another source, or whether it's just at the end where this happens. Ambiguity can be good, and I'm sure that's what Gaiman was aiming for, but I think it was a little too ambiguous where Coats was concerned.The main female characters, Daisy and Rosie, aren't as strong as I might have liked, but they do have wonderful moments within the narrative. Where the relationships between these four characters end up is a bit obvious, but I enjoyed watching how they got there. Daisy is an impulsive cop who is willing to walk away from her job to get the bad guy and Rosie, while she seems fairly weak at the beginning of the book, shows an inner fire later that belies that image of her. The old women are background characters (both Rosie's mom and the old women who help Fat Charlie), but are all entertaining in their own way.The plot of the book is very straightforward, despite its supernatural origin. There aren't any inexplicable flights of fancy in Anansi Boys; instead, every trip to another reality is grounded solidly in the story. I enjoyed the mythology that Gaiman uses, and I loved how the revenge motif traveled throughout the old gods for what Anansi did to them for all those years. And I found the relationship between the two brothers fascinating.All in all, Anansi Boys is yet another winner from Gaiman.David Roy"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is a superb book, along the lines, but not really related to his fantastic \\"American Gods\\". I highly recommend this modern world fable/fantasy to anyone who likes a good, if quirky read. I simply could not put this book down after pickingit up. Other reviewers have done an excellent job of summarizing the plot. For me, the flow of the story is also remarkable. Gaiman's pacing is quick, with useful interludes of mythos thrown at the end of chapters. Unlike some books, where the changing perspective can bog down an otherwise excellent read, this book picks up the reader quick, and never lets you go. For me, this was 5-6 hours of pure reading joy.Thank you again Neil Gaiman! (And thanks for dedicating this book to me!)"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Wow, Neil Gaiman just keeps getting better and better. I thought \\"American Gods\\" was a terrific book, but this sequel is much funnier, cleverer, and more imaginative. Gaiman takes his Anansi character and \\"kills\\" him off (although we know you really can never kill a god), leaving his sons to live up to his trickser legacy. Along the way, he skewers the London lifestyle, little old ladies in Miami, international money launderers and anything else he can think up. He also sets up a couple clever romances and turns a milktoast accountant (one of Anansi's sons) into a demi-god who can stand on his own two feet.Readers should be warned that this is contemporary fantasy, which means anything can happen, logical or not. So, if the idea of venegeful ghosts and invisible tiger gods bother you, don't pick up the book and expect it to make logical sense.Gaiman has a brilliant, creative mind and creates a world that's a delight to visit."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is best known for his witty, slightly wonky brand of dark fantasy. But he gets a bit lighter for \\"Anansi Boys,\\" a sort of unconnected sequel to his hit \\"American Gods.\\" You think your dad is embarrassing? Well, at least he's not a trickster god.Fat Charlie's dad has always been weird -- brass bands for the terminally ill, nicknames that stick, and much more. But even away from his dad, Charlie isn't happy. Then he gets the news that his dad died during a karaoke song; when he goes to the funeral, an old neighbor tells him that Daddy was really Anansi the spider god. Even worse, Charlie finds out he has a brother.Spider is everything Charlie isn't -- charming, debonair, witty, and magical. Soon he has not only taken over Fat Charlie's house, but his fiancee as well, distracting Fat Charlie from his boss's attempts to frame him. Determined to get rid of Spider, Fat Charlie enlists the Bird Woman's help -- but soon finds that his pact will only get them in deeper trouble with the ancient gods.Trickerster gods -- Anansi, Loki, Kokopelli -- are always fun. And Gaiman makes the idea even more fun with \\"Anansi Boys.\\" Sibling rivalry forms the backbone of the book, but it's also sprinkled with corporate intrigue, romance, and the old Anansi legends (which Gaiman inserts periodically). And of course -- lots and lots of humour.With this lighter tone, Gaiman sounds a lot like his pal Terry Pratchett, right down to wry humor and comic timing. \\"There are three things, and three things only, that can lift the pain of mortality and ease the ravages of life. These things are wine, women and song.\\" \\"Curry's nice too.\\" Gaiman seems to be having a lot of fun in this book.And nowhere is the fun more clear than in Spider and Fat Charlie. They're like yin and yang, one charming, conscienceless and godly, while the other is nervy, awkward and mundane. Spider's charm leaps out from the page, while Fat Charlie is sort of Gaiman's \\"Charlie Brown.\\"Everyone gets annoyed by their siblings and embarrassed by their dad, but the \\"Anansi Boys\\" have a life more complex than most. Lighter than most Neil Gaiman books, but hilarious, dark and imaginative."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Typical Neil Gaiman entry. Once again you're in the normal world until you find that what we consider the normal world is just a thin veneer. While based in the same world as \\"American Gods\\" you will find none of the characters from \\"American Gods\\".This book revolves once again around the offspring of a god who was unaware of his origins. The main protagonist in this book is Fat Charlie who discovers not only that his father is a god but he has a brother.While similar to \\"American Gods\\" this book is much more light hearted. The book definitely has its sinister moments but you will find yourself smiling through much of the book. It's a quick light read that you can get through in a day but like most Gaiman stories it has a surprising depth. It reminded me in many ways of the movie \\"Big Fish\\" with its conflict between a charasmatic father and a serious son.Fans of who preffered \\"Good Omens\\" over \\"American Gods\\" will probably like this novel better. I enjoyed them both so I liked this book that was in a way a combination of the two."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"As a fan of Neil Gaiman's work, I was mildly disappointed with Anansi Boys. It's wry, sly, and well written, but I expect those things from Gaiman. In my opinion, it feels too much like his other novels, and that sameness keeps me from fully endorsing it. Again, the protagonist is an Everyman, a good guy who is not enjoying life as much as he should be. At first he's adamant against participating in the story (so he's swept up by events), then he reluctantly goes with the flow, and finally he makes decisions and actively participates. I wish Gaiman would forgo this formula and present something different. There's also a vagueness that I don't embrace. It's often a challenge to decipher what's actually going on, and the main source of the problem is that Gaiman's stories tend to unfold in a dreamscape, as opposed to in reality. The Everyman is transported to an alternate, fantasy world, and while there are repercussions in reality, the story never seems grounded in reality (to me at least). I suppose my disappointment can be traced to my preference of stark, edgy stories. I like it when the characters are genuinely in danger, which Gaiman's characters never seem to experience, in my impression."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've got something of a love/hate relationship with audiobooks. I love to be read to, and I love filling up the time on a long commute with a story. I hate abridgements, I hate readers who ham things up, and I hate productions that feel the need to underscore the mood with music cues (taking attention away from the story). A great performance can make a poor story interesting, and make a great story shine.In every respect that I can think of, Lenny Henry's reading of Neil Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\" is the standard which every audiobook should reach for.THE STORYis excellent. Neil has given us something of a comedy of manners, a family story that is very much a comedy in the P.G. Woodehouse mode (except with supernatural beings, their progency, those who love them, and their blogging roommates). Its one of those tight stories that take the time to show you what's going on and still astonishes. I'm not going to take up too much more time gushing on this front. Let's end this section with the fact that I had more fun reading this book than anything else I've read in a couple of years.THE PERFORMANCEis what I really wanted to mention. Lenny Henry SHINES! His pace is easy and not too rushed. His accents (Carribean, American, English; and regional/cultural subsets of each) are good without being camp. And most importantly, he offers a dozen or so exact, distinctive, age appropriate and recognizable voices for each character.I cannot stress that last one enough. One must sympathize with the difficult task of one voice coming up with all these voices. Some audiobooks solve the problems by having more than one reader or just having the reader read in their own voice and use cues in the text (\\"...said Virginia hotly\\") to fill in the blanks. Other books too are first person narratives that lend themselves better to audiobooks.Far too often, though, an actor will exaggerate something to create a distinctive voice for a character (ESPECIALLY a male reader reading a woman's part). It is painful to hear someone adding an inappropriate speech impedement or something like a southern drawl just so that the listener can tell characters apart.Lenny avoids all of these pitfalls without the need of crutches. In a third-person situation telling a sprawling (if short) tale in three different countries, his performance is masterful. 10 hours never flew by so fast.I'm now going to purchase other audiobooks he's read just so I can hear him!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"If you liked American Gods then you'll be happy to find the basic concept of gods walking the earth and rubbing elbows with humans revisited here but with less menace (for Neil Gaiman) and slightly better character development than we saw in American Gods.If anything this books suffers from a slightly twee convention of Gaiman-storytelling where we break from the action to have The Way The World Works explained to us. I'm a fan of Gaiman's work and I've been watching this particular stylistic indulgence for some time. I'm afraid it's beginning to wear a bit thin. He is capable of brilliant story-telling but has a mildly annoying penchant for whimsy. The ending grated on me slightly but you'll have to read yourself to find out why. For all Gaiman's darkness and vivid imagination I think he's basically an upbeat sort of guy and I think Hollywood will one day come to adore him as it rightfully should by turning both novels into appalling films that will make me cringe.In summation: A fun yarn with loads of dense images and ideas. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I just finished reading this book and although it was fun to read it (all Neil Gaiman stuff is), there wasn't much to the story. Rather, the story seemed too simple, not magical or otherworldly enough. I thought that character and location development were weak. I just recently read Neverwhere and I found it to be by far a much better \\"story\\" than Anansi Boys. I might have expected too much as I absolutely love Gaiman stuff...or it might just be a matter of taste."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Voice performer Lenny Henry has been quoted as saying that he likes to work with Neil Gaiman because he gets free books and comics. Undoubtedly said tongue-in-cheek, nonetheless one would think he'd like working with Gaiman for the sheer joy of reading such exciting stories related in ingenious prose.Whatever the case, Henry gives an outstanding reading of Anansi Boys - light when called for, threatening as needed, and frightened when the plot takes a chilling turn. It's a thoroughly enjoyable listen as Fat Charlie Nancy learns of his father's death and treks from London to Florida to say his final goodbye to fellow he didn't know much about in the first place.It's a bit of a shocker when he learns that Dad was a god, albeit a trickster god in human form. Further, Charlie also learns that he has a brother, Spider - that should be spelled \\"trouble\\" because that's about all Spider brings.Brothers they may be but laid back, insecure Charlie is absolutely no match for man-of-the-world (or nether world) Spider. If Charlie ever wants his life to return to normal he must either best Spider or dispose of him. Now, for some real fun!Enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Fat Charlie thought he had escaped to a life of complete, boring normalcy in England, working an average job, engaged to a normal girl, but when his father drops dead, he is forced to return home to Florida to attend his father's funeral--and his life takes a swift turn towards the bizarre. He never knew his father was the god Anansi. He never knew he had a brother named Spider. After his first meeting with his brother, Charlie begins a journey that will drive him away from, and then bring him closer too, his brother, his father, and his own past and nature as one of Anansi's boys. This novel takes place on a smaller scale than some of Gaiman's other work, dealing primarily with Fat Charlie, his family, and his friends. However, it still takes place in a supernatural world that exists, largely hidden, beneath the world that Charlie and the reader are familiar with: a world of gods and magic, specifically the stories of Anansi the Spider and other animal gods from Africa. The book is humorous and engaging, but lacks the depth and lasting import that some of the other Gaiman novels have. I recommend it, but would recommend Neverwhere and American Gods more highly.The limited scale of this novel immediately separates it from Gaiman's other work. While books like Neverwhere take place in the whole of London Above and London Below, and books like American Gods determine the fate of both old and new generations of the gods in America, Anansi Boys focuses on individuals at a very local level: Fat Charlie, his brother Spider; Charlie's fianc&eacute;e and her mother; Charlie's boss. Their various plotlines take them from London to America to Jamaica as well as into and out of the world of the gods, but they never extend beyond the individuals to a more cosmic scale. Whether the personal scope is a good or a bad aspect depends largely on the reader. Personally, I like the cosmic importance layered into Gaiman's other novels, and found the limited scope of this one to be disappointing. Other readers may disagree.I also found this novel to be a little more humorous and a little less grave than Gaiman's other work. While there's no doubt that all of Gaiman's novels contain ongoing irony and aspects of humor, those aspects seemed to be more prevalent and blatant in this novel. There are still some dark and dangerous otherworldly aspects, but the amount of humor draws attention away from them and makes the story seem more light-hearted. Whether or not that is a good thing also depends on the reader, and again I personally found it disappointing--it reminded me too much of Good Omens, a book that I didn't really care for. But then, my sense of humor is pretty narrow and very dry.Both in terms of theme and plot, this is a skillful novel: Anansi the Spider is the god of stories and songs, and the interwoven plot reflects that. The stories of the individual characters weave together and thread apart in a rhythm that keeps the plot moving and the reader interested without rushing the text or the conclusion. Some of the morals of the book also arise from the storytelling theme--the rest come from Charlie's increasing knowledge about his brother, father, and with them, himself. All in all, Anansi Boys is an enjoyable read but not my favorite Gaiman novel--but I suspect that it falls flat for personal reasons, and may appeal more to readers with different tastes. I do recommend it, but I enjoyed Neverwhere and American Gods much more, and would urge the reader to pick up those first."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The fantasy element did not integrate particularly well to the rest of the story for me.Gaiman is masterful and writes with such captivating style but I personally found the imaginative elements and the anthropomorphism dissonant.However, that did not detract from the enjoyment of the rest of the book, such was the power of his characterisations and plotting.It is not 'American Gods' which is a hard act to follow, but nevertheless a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I rented Anansi Boys audio book by accident. It turned out to be a happy accident. I couldn't wait to get in my car each morning to listen to the book on my way to work and after work to listen on my way home. I laughed out loud so many times. The story line reeled me in and kept me intrigued until the end. I felt sad when I finished the book. Now I'm going to have to purchase a copy so I can listen again, in a few months.

If he was broken down off the side of the highway I would totally pull over and help him."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Although American Gods was a great book and had more of the novelty feeling, I would have to say I enjoyed Anansi Boys more. This is because the plot is more concise and straight forward, taking on a smaller cast of characters and allowing them to interact with each other more closely.His writing style is the same as American Gods and flows easily. My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that the plot towards the end came together a bit too neat, but by that point what do you care? You are already sucked in and will continue reading. Beyond that the same allure of god figures roaming our world with us is present and captures your interest immediately.

I will read another Neil Gaiman book in the future, perhaps this wasn't his strongest effort."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I have enjoyed all of the books I have read by Gaiman but this one in particular, I found exceptional. His style reminds me a bit of Christopher Moore with his subtle tongue in cheek humor. This story is about a \\"God\\" who dies and unbeknownst to his son Charlie, leaves him a portion of his godly powers. Charlie is a plain man with a bland life and no aspirations. He is getting married to a equally bland and uninteresting woman. This is how he comes to find out his father has died. His bland bride insists he contact his estranged and thoroughly embarrassing father and invite him to the wedding. Upon doing so he hears of his recent death. After his fathers death Charlie meets his brother, whom he was never aware of having. Spider is the exact opposite of Charlie, he is exciting, outgoing, carefree and careless. He seems to have a undeniable allure for women and in general Spider tends to get what he wants. What he wants most is for his brother to liven up and join him in his party lifestyle. Charlie just wants Spider to go away but complications he had never foreseen arise when he finally does. This is fantasy at it's best. I don't read a lot of fantasy but I know quality writing, so while not all fantasy fans will necessarily agree with me, because I am sure there are more fantastical books in the genre, I would highly recommend this to fantasy fans and those new to but open minded enough to enjoy the magical."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I remember Gaiman from comics and was excited to see he had moved to novels. Anansi Boys is no disappointment. I immediately liked Fat Charlie as an honest and defective main character and equally hated the antagonist, Grahame. Gaiman builds scenes that easily paint themselves in your mind and make the experience of reading almost surreal. I can gauge how much I like a book by the speed at which I read it and I savored each word. I was disappointed when it ended because the ride was over.On the other hand, I had a different experience with American Gods."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys, by Neil Gaiman, is a strange book. Like its cousin American Gods, I didn't quite understand everything that happened along the way, but I did enjoy myself all the while. Anansi is a prominent African and Caribbean god. He is a spider in form, but often takes the guise of a man.Fat Charlie Nancy has never really got along well with his father. As a child his dad would play jokes on him, often resulting in loads of embarrassment and humiliation for Fat Charlie. When his father died on a karaoke stage in Florida, Fat Charlie flew across the Ocean to attend the funeral and finally make his peace with the man. But fate had something else in mind. A strange, old neighbor and family-friend tells Fat Charlie that he has a brother, and that if he ever wants to talk to him then all he needs to do is tell a spider. She also tells Fat Charlie that his dad was Anansi, and that he was a god. Confused and uncertain, Charlie heads back to England to return to his bookkeeping job and his fianc&eacute;e, Rosie, ready to get on with his life.Indeed, life goes on for Fat Charlie, albeit somewhat dull and mostly uneventful. But one night, while a little drunk, Fat Charlie is taking a spider outside and remembers the words of his old neighbor. He tells the spider to tell his brother hello. And from there things will never be the same.Part of me really liked this book, but part of me simply thought it was okay. Neil Gaiman is a wonderful word-spinner, and definitely at the top of his craft here. The writing is beautiful. The prose flows smoothly and reads easily. I found myself laughing at some of the word choices because they were perfect. The style of the book isn't too serious, but it's not not-serious, either, and this worked well with the many different characters. Below are two of my favorite quotes.\\"I knew that the meeting of two brothers, well, it's the subject of epics, isn't it? I decided the only way to treat it with the appropriate gravity would be to do it in verse. But what kind of verse? Am I gonna rap it? Declaim it? I mean, I'm not gonna greet you with a limerick. So it had to be something dark. Something powerful. Rhythmic. Epic. And then I had it...\\"\\"Daisy looked up at him with the kind of expression Jesus might have given someone who had just explained that he was probably allergic to bread and fishes, so could He possibly do a quick chicken salad?\\"Like the web shown on the cover art, the plot is one large tangle of different characters' lives, all connected. Some characters you can't help but love; others you only wish their ill will. Grahame Coats, Charlie's boss, is one those kind of characters that exist solely to get on your nerves.Another thing I really liked about this book was how simple and imaginative it was. Fat Charlie's story could almost pass as real, but for the minor magical and unexplainable occurrences that happen to him. The fantasy is very mild and toned down throughout most of the novel, but there are a few instances when Gaiman spins a wonderfully vivid, imaginary world. But I did feel that Fat Charlie was a relatable protagonist, and that's usually a plus.I also enjoyed Gaiman's excellent use of mythology and folklore. The man truly knows his stuff, and can tell it like no other. On the surface, Anansi Boys is a story about Fat Charlie and his long-lost-brother. But once you get reading it, you find that the life of a god (or of his children) is never quite that simple. Tiger wants his stories back from Anansi, and he'll stop at nothing to get them.I suppose my unlikes were very few and rather vague. It's really just the overall story that seemed to be lacking. On one hand, everything was connected and worked out wonderfully well. On the other, I was occasionally lost and unsure, but I get the feeling that the reader is supposed to feel this way. Still, not enough to complain about, just being a bit picky. Also the story is not as grandiose as I was expecting, but instead rather straight-forward: Charlie wants to get his life back to normal. And this, is the main source of why the story was simply okay.Overall, I did rather enjoy Anansi Boys. The lighthearted tale was fun to read, and the interspersed dark parts added enough conflict to the story to propel the book along nicely. If you're curious about Gaiman, I wouldn't start with this novel, but instead opt for American Gods or the Sandman comics. However, this book is a standalone and does not have any prerequisites. So if mythology interests you, particularly African mythos, or if you're wanting something quick and fun to read, I easily recommend Anansi Boys."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is one of the funniest and most surprising books I've read in a long time. Gaimen is never disappointing. His story of gods and brothers is scary, strange and hilarious and if you are at all interested in myths, tall tales or folk wisdom as I am, it is simply a must read."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Let's get the easy part out of the way first: YES, I liked it. I enjoyed it. I highly recommend it.I'm talking about Neil Gaiman's latest, Anansi Boys.Pre-press and plenty of interviews should have everyone understanding that this is not a sequel to Gaiman's American Gods, despite the fact that Mr. Nancy (aka the Trickster Spider God Anansi) appears in the much thicker, more serious novel. (If you want a sequel to AG, seek out the Legends II anthology and read the novella \\"Monarch of the Glen,\\" which finds Shadow, the hero of AG, wandering Scotland. It's a fun read.)Anansi Boys's tagline is \\"God is dead. Meet the kids.\\" Which tells you little about the plot, although it gives you a good sense of the tone of the book.Here's the plot synopsis, for those that need such things in a review: Fat Charlie Nancy has been estranged from his dapper, devil-may-care father since early childhood. Mr. Nancy embarrasses Fat Charlie, you see. The ultimate embarrassment comes when Mr. Nancy dies in a case of \\"karaoke interruptus,\\" taking off the shirt of a buxom blond as he tumbles from the stage. In short order, Charlie finds out not only that his father was far more than human, he also discovers the existence of a long-lost brother. Much hilarity ensues.Gaiman works his usual charm here, far more whimsically than his work on AG -- in fact, this book is probably more in line with Stardust or Good Omens than with AG or Neverwhere.I found myself sympathising with Fat Charlie. Haven't we all been embarrassed by our fathers at some point? Even when some of those moments are not intentionally embarrassing, it is the role of sons to be embarrassed by their fathers. I felt the deep confusion and angst of Charlie's fiancee Rose, caught up in events she doesn't realize are spiralling out of control around her. And I found myself growing to like Spider(the aforementioned brother) despite his best efforts to remain unlikeable. Even the supporting characters are well-drawn and come across as people you'd meet in real life -- the magic and myth are incidental to the fact that these are people you know even while being central to the point and plot of the book.The book takes more sharp turns and sudden shifts than a plane caught in turbulence. It's not quite a roller-coaster ride, but if it were it would certainly inspire a certain level of motion-sickness. As the tone shifts, so does the narratorial voice; one minute you're hearing fairly proper English in Gaiman's voice, then you're deep in Carribean patois with perhaps the bass rumble of Geoffrey Holder playing Storyteller. Rather than distracting, the change in vocabulary and voice helps the reader move from light comedy to romantic yearning to slapstick to cliffhanger drama seemlessly.People ask me all the time what kind of material Gaiman writes, and I always have a hard time answering. It's not horror, it's not fantasy, it's not fairy tale and it's not magical realism. It's a realm where all of these collide. Someone needs to coin a term for it if they haven't already.\\"All stories are Anansi stories,\\" Gaiman says. And reading this, you can believe that's true."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Charlie isn't fat anymore, but when he was a kid he was for awhile and his father called him Fat Charlie and the name stuck to \\"like chewing gum to the sole of a tennis shoe.\\" His life is an embarrassment and he embarrasses easily. He came to London from Florida when he was a boy, mainly because his mother wanted to get him away from his father. He has a dead end job, working for a slimy boss he hates named Graham Coats. He is engaged to a nice enough girl named Rosie, who won't sleep with him till after they're married and she wants him to invite his father to the wedding. So Charlie calls Florida and learns his father has just died of a heart attack while on stage in a karaoke bar and, if that wasn't embarrassing enough for Charlie, when the old man went out he fell to the floor ripping the top off a blonde bombshell.After the funeral Charlie visits four little old ladies he knew in his youth. Woman from the Caribbean who just happen to be witches. From them he learns his father was the spider trickster god Anansi (who also plays a part in Gaiman's epic novelAmerican Gods) and that he has a brother named Spider, which was kind of a shock for Charlie, as he'd thought he was an only child. He's told to tell a spider if he ever needs his brother and his brother will come. And sure enough, when he's back in London he saves a spider in his bath and tells it he'd like to see his brother.And come Spider does, creating havoc in Charlie's life, not only does he get him fired, but he seduces that fiancee who wouldn't sleep with Charlie and before he knows it, Charlie is back in Florida, trying to get Spider out of his life and this is going to require a journey to the Caribbean island of St. Andrew and to the spirit world where if he gets out, he'll never be the same.I came to this book straight fromAmerican Godsand expected more of the same. I didn't get it, but I wasn't disappointed. Gaiman has borrowed a bit of Christopher Moore's cheeky humor/horror style and blended it with a touch of Richard Laymon, a dash of Stephen King, a Pinch of Dean Koontz and come up with something truly original and hard to define. His characters are laid out quickly, his story takes you to who knows where and back again before you know it and all the time you're marveling at the prose of a genius."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I have read almost all of Neil Gaiman's books.All of them are good but I personally liked this one the most.You fall in love with the story and the characters and settings are so exotic and colorful...What does Neil Gaiman see when he looks at the world?I want to see that!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"As a Neil Gaiman fan I try not to be prejudiced when reading his literature. I like to venture into a book without previous thoughts of books and how fantastic they were. I feel like I succeeded with keeping my love for Gaiman literature at bay and have still found that this book is now one of my favorites.We meet a man, nicknamed by his father, Fat Charlie. Not that he is fat anymore, but once his father gives a name, it sticks. He happens to be a son of a god. Anansi, his father, being the god in question. Fat Charlie was always embarrassed by his father's actions to the point where he, at the beginning of the book, contemplates inviting him to his wedding to an Englishwoman: Rosie. Very soon we learn that his father has passed away and we also find out that Fat Charlie can be embarrassed without the need of his father. It is the definition of normalcy. Fat Charlie has made himself completely normal and cannot handle the eccentricities of life. That is, until he comes in contact with his brother, Spider.Fat Charlie takes advice from a few old ladies of his home town which will soon act like cruel Fates in Fat Charlie's life. Unlike the Fates of mythology, however, these old ladies are simply assisting in the choices that Fat Charlie makes. In a way, they are part of his web, part of his story and they simply tell him which strand of web to follow, if he wants to follow it at all. Desperate for solutions, he will often follow their advice instead of the advice of his own smothered conscience. If he could just open his eyes perhaps he would find that he's more like his father than he thinks.We follow Fat Charlie through an odd assortment of events that are typical of Gaiman creativity. Just like Spider's manipulation in Fat Charlie's life, we find ourselves weaved into a web that we feel there is no escape from. Helpless marionettes being controlled by some outside force when, in fact, we weave our own webs and simply need to make a choice, a daring choice, to be ourselves. To, most importantly, sing our own songs.There is so much to talk about in this book but I would not want to spoil it for you. So let me just end by saying that this book is a story of mirror images, and mirrored people. An example is the mirrored image of Fat Charlie in Spider. Not only in look but in how opposite and how alike they are. The story is easy to ready, funny, exciting, and daring in its creativity. Gaiman makes you work for an answer but does not make it too hard to find it and to be given confirmation soon after. This is the working evolution of human kind and of a story, a very important one. A voyage of discovery that very rarely comes to fruition in literature in such a phenomenal way.My only warning is to not read this book if you are deathly afraid of arachnids or birds. If not, please pick it up and give Gaiman a chance. If you are already a Neil fan, pick up American Gods first."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I like to call the kind of fantasy that Gaiman writes \\"archetypal fantasy.\\" As opposed to many excellent writers in this genre, Gaiman doesn't create his own fantasy universe, nor does he overlay a wholly new fantastic structure onto our current universe. Instead, he takes our world and our oldest legends and weaves them together into a seamless whole. In Gaiman's worlds, you have Spider fighting an eternal fight against Tiger. You have Odin seeking to regain some of his old strength against the new gods of Technology and Entertainment. In reading Gaiman's work, I often feel as though I am somehow being incorporated into the larger pantheon of Storytelling as it has existed since the time of per-historical cave-painting. In his work, the gods first created by the earliest stories (or, perhaps, first recognized by the earliest stories) still exist, still walk among us, and still shape us and our experience of the world. It's hard to put a finger on it, but I find that this resonates deeply for me, and turns what many might consider to be light fiction (it is fantasy, after all) into a richer experience.Gaiman has said that he owes much to Harlan Ellison, and you can see his influence. Ellison's Deathbird Stories isn't as explicit about its gods as Anansi Boys is (and American Gods was far more clear about who its gods are than AB), instead filling these roles with unnamed chthonic forces. If nothing else, Ellison's world is certainly far darker. They both, however, posit that the world in which we live has more to it than meets the eye. That there are dark and powerful forces at work that we knowingly or unknowingly tap into for our strength, inspiration, and at times darkness. That we in turn are tapped into and as a whole provide, though our actions and our worship, the life force that these gods need to exist.While American Gods is a relatively serious (in tone) exploration of this, Anansi Boys is a much more lighthearted approach. In short, Charles Nancy (Fat Charlie) is a young Londoner who has always been embarrassed by his father, and to the world, appears somewhat weak, with a soft underbelly. He allows himself to be pushed around, and for the most part, tries to simply get by and live under the radar. He probably has more in common with many of us than we would like to admit. In Florida for his father's funeral, he learns that his father is actually the god Anansi, and that he has a brother named Spider. When he gets home, he lightheartedly summons his brother by talking to a spider, as he was instructed by an old Caribbean family friend. When Spider turns up, Fat Charlie finds his life turned upside down. His virgin fianc&eacute;e sleeps with Spider, he is thrown in prison, and finds himself not only out of a job, but framed by his crook boss. Spider, of course, won't leave. He likes being in (taking over) Charlie's life. Needing help, Charlie flies back to Florida, and with the aid of a witch who used to live in his old neighborhood, is transported to the place at the beginning of the world, where he seeks assistance in removing his brother from his life. It would be easy to say that while there, he made a deal with the devil, but in Gaiman's world, there isn't so much a devil as there are many gods with conflicting desires and natures. Charlie's deal is with the Bird Woman.Of course, the whole thing backfires, and in the end draws Spider and Charlie closer together. It should surprise no one that Charlie finds within himself deep reserves of strength and miracle (not magic - Charlie is the son of a god) that he uses to undo the mess he's made, forge himself a new life and identity, and in the end, really, because this is what 90% of fiction seems to be about on one level or another, grow into a man. I probably enjoy Gaiman's work (this book included) too much to really write any sort of objective review or opinion. Simply put, this book is very satisfying, and very funny. It's hard to explain in a review or essay why something is funny, but take for example the following situation. Charlie and Spider are being pursued by Bird Woman, and Spider wants to know what's going on. Charlie begins to tell his story, and in the end concludes:\\"She offered to make you go away. And, um. Well, I took her up on it.\\"\\"That,\\" said Spider, with a movie-star smile, \\"was really stupid.\\"\\"I didn't tell her to hurt you.\\"\\"What did you think she was going to do to get rid of me? Write me a stiff letter?\\"\\"I don't know. I didn't think. I was upset.\\"\\"Great. Well, if she has her way, you'll be upset, and I'll be dead. You could have simply asked me to leave, you know.\\"\\"I did!\\"\\"Er. What did I say?\\"\\"That you liked it in my house and you weren't going anywhere.\\"Like much good British humor, it's not so much laugh out loud humor, but rather a general tone that pervades the entirety of the book. It makes you smile, and it makes you sympathetic to the characters. In the end though, although I'd recommend it to anyone, Anansi Boys is not as good as American Gods, and is one of Gaiman's weaker works. There's too much clich&eacute;. I think he knows it, and maybe it's a part of a larger joke missed by yours truly. I can't get over the schlubby character in the wrong relationship who stumbles on true love, partial deity, and lifelong satisfaction and happiness. It's fun, but it's not powerful in the same way as Gaiman's other works."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi stories derive from Jamaican folklore. Gaiman has expounded on those stories and brought them into the modern world with only limited success. I never reviewed \\"American Gods\\" but I would have given it 5 stars. Had I not read \\"American Gods\\", I may have given this novel 4 stars, but I know that Gaiman is capable of so much better. It's a nice effort and a great premise, but it never fully gels. I don't believe the characters or situations. A great fantasy novel sucks you into its world and you believe the characters and plot. A mediocre one feels forced. Have not given up on Gaiman though. Plan to read more of his work."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"If you enjoyed Christopher Moore's Coyote Blue, you should alsoenjoy Anansi Boys. Both books are lighthearted and whimsical, andboth center on a trickster god--one of many gods: a spider god inGaiman, and a coyote god in Moore. Gaiman's American Gods is amuch darker novel. This is a milieu where humans and godsinteract--not an all-powerful God of the Bible, but lesspowerful and more personal gods who you might go to lunch with,or who might have you for lunch. In this milieu you might bump intoHopi, Navajo, Norse, etc gods.In Anansi Boys the hero, Fat Charlie Nancy, learns that hisfather Anansi was the spider god, and that his brother (who henever knew he had) inherited some of their father's powers.As with Coyote Blue, this god enjoys a good joke, althoughCoyote's tastes tended to be more prurient. In both novels,hanging out with a god presents some problems, and this is whatmakes both novels particularly enjoyable.As with Coyote Blue, Anansi Boys is--to be blunt--a lot of fun.As with Coyote Blue, after about 30-40 pages, you know that youare going to hang onto the book and enjoy reading it again ina year or so."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is clearly a creative guy who presents some great themes in \\"Anansi Boys\\". The perpetually embarrassing father who turns out to be a deity: personal and ironic. A fantasy based on neglected Afro-Caribbean mythology with a black protagonist: both overdue. Unfortunately \\"Anansi Boys\\" seems a little flat and maybe overly enthralled with its own cleverness.This is my first Neil Gaiman book, but it reminds me of other British fantasy/science fiction authors like Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams, who draw sympathetic characters that engage the reader, but never manage to make me feel deeply. I appreciate the humor, irony, charm, and all that, but it's too detached for my taste when the story and characters deserve better."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I just finished reading this book, and now I'm sorry I turned it back to the library because I would like to read it again.Fat Charlie Nancy is engaged to Rosie Noah.

Things get worse when Charlie tries to get revenge.American Gods is one of my all-time favorite books, which is why I looked forwards to Anansi Boys as much as I did. Anansi Boys and American Gods are, however, very different. Anansi Boys is much more light hearted and humorous. It's still good, but if you're looking for a sequel to American Gods, Anansi Boys isn't it.The book has interesting characters and a fun, original plot.

An American Gods spinoff without Shadow, who is without a doubt my favorite charachter from Mr. Gaimans works(Besides Dream of course.)But I of course went and preorded it the day of it being able to preorder. The story isnt as complex and mysterious and epic as American Gods, but, thats what makes this book special. I can relate alot with Fat Charlie as I find my dad rather embarassing and sometimes wish he wasnt there. I'll admit the simplicity of the plot was hard to get used to, but, once I caught on I was wishing I could skip school to stay home and read it. This book may not be for everyone, esspescially those favoring the darker aspects of Mr. Gaiman's work, but it is still a very good read.

Considering the other works of Neil Gaiman that I've read, this was a major disappointment.This might have made a good - if predictable - episode of the Twilight Zone, but the quality here is way, way below Neil Gaiman's previous work.I sense that someone at the publishing company waved a lot of money under Neils nose while saying \\"Give me a sequel to American Gods and make it snappy.\\""},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Haven't read all his books, but this one was a big let down from Neverwhere.

True, some of the shticks and jokes were cute, but that doesn't make a novel.

Funny as \\"Good omens\\", thrilling as \\"Neverwhere\\", dark and scary as \\"American Gods\\". Neil Gaiman abandons clutches, and shows himself as a great contemporary novelist. Neal Stephenson, beware, here comes somebody that's at least your peer!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"In a huge departure from his last novel, Gaiman writes a book about the son of a minor god.Unlike the rest of the reviewers and critics here, I remember when Gaiman was good--Neverwhere, Sandman, etc., but with the exception of Coraline (which was perfect) everything he's produced in the past few years has been crap. American Gods was long-winded and boring, but at least it had a plot. This book has nothing.Boring characters (Rosie, for God's sake! Fat Charlie! Spider! What inspired names!), a meandering plot, a complete lack of suspense or mystery, and no investment whatsoever in the story makes this among Gaiman's worse efforts. I can't figure out why he wrote this book--if you read Neverwhere or Coraline you can see the time and effort, the craft, the imagination in the characters. There are characters to fall in love with in those books. Everything here is made of cardboard.Gaiman is not a bad writer, even if he has lost his touch, so there are funny bits in the book. I saw him at a signing and he read the Anansi story about tiger and Anansi's grandmother, and he did a very good job. That's one of the good parts in the book, and there are some funny bits of dialogue, but overall it's a three hour read and if you're honest with yourself by the end of it you'll wish you hadn't bothered."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaimain is an author whose name has been thrown, repeatedly, in my direction from various sources. Since this is a generally common occurance, I tend to take little heed to books recommended to me (generally, I can choose good books for myself and maintain a queue of some two-dozen books at any given time). It was only a few weeks ago when Gaiman published an op/ed in The New York Times about Halloween. Rather than ghoulies and ghosties, he waxes poetic about the different frightening things we encounter; his writing was strange, dreamy and absolutely captivating. Agoggle at my desk, I wrote down his name, and immediately purchased the first book that caught my eye at Borders. Thusly, my foray into Anansi Boys was born.Anansi Boys is ambitious; it tries to string together the African myths of the spider Anansi with modern-day English Blokes (\\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy and his oft-magical brother, Spider). The story follows a simple storyline: Fat Charlie is engaged to Rosie, Fat Charlie's father dies, and then, Fat Charlie's life is turned upside-down from the intrusions of his irresponsible brother.For sure, Gaiman knows how to tell a good science fiction story, but his attempt at dialogue and interrelations is forced, at best. The character writing is forced and a bit awkward (and therefore, unbelievable). His characters are remarkably underdeveloped (as is the plot) after nearly four-hundred pages. The inclusion of African myths breaks the monotony of a linear storyline, but these myths are included sporadically - until they completely dissipate by the middle of the book. Indeed, the inclusion of old-world myths may very well 'make' the book worthwhile, they are entertaining and interesting, written with a sort of delicious style that makes the pages a pleasure to read.The novel's crux is its central two-hundred pages: the story drags, with more of the same plot devices (which become noticeably stale). Throughout, the novel is peppered with plenty of individuals and micro-stories that are superfluous, at best, and boring expansions, at worst.Gaiman's capacity for quintessentially stiff-upper-lipped British humor is excellent. His talent shines through an unremarkable plot. The ideas are certainly there, and his intentions are only good: the execution of the story remains poor, for no other reason than a weak story premise. It seems almost as if Gaiman knew he had a stellar concept (to utilize African myths), and certainly the writing ability, but had only the loosest of abilities in tying the ideas together. The result is a generally sloppy effort with small gems scattered throughout."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've read many a Gaiman book in my day and this might be his best. You will not be able to stop turning pages.Even though I won't question genius...I could have dealt with a darker second half.Overall, really enjoyed this one.Imagination like no other."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is the first Neil Gaiman book I have read and he definitely did not disappoint. Charlie Nancy, the main character. is lovably inept and heart rendingly human. When his brother, Spider, comes to visit, things really get crazy, and Charlie has to figure out a way to get rid of him. Gaiman's sense of humor is spot dead on. There were portions of this book where I laughed out loud. (In particular, when he was in a cab lost in London. I won't give any more away. But you will howl with laughter.) If you are into fantasy, you have to give this delightful novel a read."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is a sort of sequel to American Gods - it features \\"Mr. Nancy\\" from American Gods - or more accurately his progeny, much like American Gods featured the child of another diety.I don't want to give away too much but like all Gaiman's books this is very well written and keeps you wanting to read more. This one has a bit more humor in it than American Gods - it reminded me more of Neverwhere than American Gods but that was OK too. :D"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Having found \\"American Gods\\" disjointed and too dark, I'd avoided \\"Anansi Boys\\" until recently hearing that it is more in the vein of \\"Neverwhere.\\" Indeed, although the book includes a murder, ghosts, deadly supernatural foes, and the most ominous flocking of birds this side of Hitchcock, it's great fun. The mingling of the macabre and the funny isn't quite up to the level of \\"Neverwhere,\\" but that deficit is counterbalanced by the themes of family and self-discovery in \\"Anansi Boys.\\""},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi boys is written about a modern day mythology, complete with gods, mortals, song, and stories. The novel starts out slow, but eventually develops into a wonderful story about stories. I thought the ending was a bit of a let down, but the development is a joy."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"When I bought books to read to my kids, there was one dealing with Anansi the Spider. Anansi is a West African Trickster God, right up there with Coyote, from Native American legends. Neil Gaiman's first story of Anansi came from the award winning book \\"American Gods\\", and now we get to see, as it were, what happens next.Fat Charlie Nancy is an American expatriate living in London. Why \\"Fat Charlie\\" for a guy who isn't particularly overweight? Well, for some reason, he does look a little soft around the edges, and besides, his father, Mr. Nancy, gave him the name when he was a kid, and it just seemed to stick. Fat Charlie lives a dull, but pretty contented life, and is about to be married when he learns that his father has died back in Florida. So he isforced to head back to a place he hasn't been in decades, where he learns that not only is his dead father a real African God, but that he has a brother he's never heard of; \\"Spider\\". And all hell begins to break loose.Neil says in an interview at www.threemonkeysonline.com:At his father's funeral (he) learns that Mr Nancy Sr. was actually a God, an incarnation of the West African spider god Anansi. Learning this, he asks, not unreasonably, why as Nancy's son he has no supernatural acumen. His mother responds, nonplussed, 'Oh, your brother got all of those'. Describing the book, Gaiman comments that it is a \\"funny, scary, romantic comedy, thriller about Gods and the Supernatural and the power of stories and so on. I guess it's about how to survive families....Anansi Boys is spiced with horror, and it has humour in it, and it has myths and detectives, and balls to the wall horror and thriller stuff and so on, but that's not what it is. What it is is a book about people, but I get to do all these other things.\\"No doubt... When he meets Spider, his new brother steps in, takes over his house, his job, and his fiancee'. And then, things get even worse.\\"Anansi Boys\\" is heartwarming, chilling, entertaining, and at times, laugh-out-loud funny. I highly recommend this book as a premier example of the story-teller's art."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I love everything by Neil Gaiman so my review is biased I suppose. If you have not yet read anything by Neil I suggest picking this book up. If you liked American Gods you'll like this, the book follows the blood line of Anansi the Spider. It was great! Extremely satisfying to read."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Perhaps my expectations are too high, as I've followed Gaiman's work for years and feel he's the one of the brightest stars to rise, but I've not been blown away by his past two books, and find them somehow less than Neverwhere and his collection of short stories, Smoke and Mirrors, both of which I thought were some of the finest examples of fantasy literature of the past two centuries (easy to say since it's only 2005!). Primarily, I found it hard to root for the protagonist, as he lacks energy. The reader finds out he's like that because he lost something, which he eventually regains, so to speak, but all that aside, it's still hard to root for the guy. As such, one never really becomes enthralled by the book.Still, I read it in about three days, which isn't typical of me these days, and I enjoyed it.And, Neil, we want to go to Faery more, in whatever form you care to provide."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The West African spider-trickster god Anansi in an incarnation as Mr. Nancy has died and was buried in Florida. He left behind an adult son Fat Charlie in England. Ironically Charlie is not overweight but instead is a half god who lost part of himself due to a grudge and a curse. His other part is Charlie's unknown brother Spider.Spider tricks Tiger and ends up gaining control of all the stories in the world as well as a deadly enemy who wants to kill him whether he is reincarnation of Anansi or just a demi God. Using animistic magic, Spider flees to England where he meets his sibling's fianc&eacute;e Rosie and odious boss, Grahame. Being a trickster, this is not a joyful encounter as Spider steals Rosie from Fat Charlie and causes troubles for his brother with Grahame. Meanwhile Tiger is coming to regain the stories stolen from him and if killing two brothers and other innocent people will achieve his goal so be it.Sort of a loose sequel to the AMERICAN GODS, ANANSI BOYS is a fine fantasy tale that combines myths from different cultures. The story line is much more complex than what is presented above, but Neil Gaiman keeps his subplots straight, ultimately tying back together in a final High Noon confrontation in which the power of story-telling is the real magic. Mr. Gaiman's fans from novels and comic books will take immense delight in his latest wild thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Well, I've now read three novels by Neil Gaiman, AMERICAN GODS, ANANSI BOYS and NEVERWHERE, and thinking back, I seem to be unable to escape the very, very strong feeling that I have read the very same novel three different times. Of course the characters have different names in each novel, and slightly different sequences of events occur, but basically all three of these novels are the same book, with the same central character, a nonentity in a secure but dull job, with a girlfriend who is completely wrong for him, and whose world is turned upside down when he encounters one or more characters from a totally different level of reality. The particular problem with ANANSI BOYS traces to the various attempts at Wodehousian humor, which never work at all. Consider the sequence in which the ghastly mother of Fat Charley Nancy's very inappropriate girlfriend unexpectedly calls at Fat Charlie's appartment, with Fat Charley dreadfully hung over and a lovely naked girl in his shower (all perfectly innocent of course). If it had happened to Bertie Wooster it would have been extremely funny. Here, it never becomes funny, escalates up only slightly, and then fades to nothing.Gaiman is a good writer and has the particularly British gift of being able to create very likeable characters. His villains are also interesting, complex and frightening. What he needs to work at is plotting!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"When Fat Charlie Nancy's father drops dead (rather extravagantly and ridiculously), while singing karaoke, Fat Charlie decides to invite the brother he never knew he had into his life. The only problem is, now Spider doesn't want to leave. He's taking over Fat Charlie's life and turning Fat Charlie's careful boring world on its head.Fans of Neil Gaiman's American Gods will enjoy this similar tale of old world gods and even meet some old friends. Though Anansi Boys does not possess sheer volume or characters quite as engaging as American Gods it plunges the reader back into Gaiman's enchanting world where everyday people hold the power of gods made flesh. The story is rather like a spider web, in which single strands seem quite independent of one another until they are slowly wound into a beautiful pattern at the center.Though I cannot say that Anansi Boys has become one of my favorite novels it kept me thoroughly entertained bother with Gaiman's witty prose and interesting plot twists. In whatever he is doing Neil Gaiman's work is always a rather unique brand of fantasy. I have never read a novel quite like Anansi Boys except, of course, for American Gods. Gaiman is a fantastic writer whom I would recommend to lovers of fantasy and a good laugh."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Have you ever not cared when a family member died? If so you can't have feelings far off from \\"fat\\" Charlie. When his dad, a man who never showed him love, dies, he is pulled into a magical world. Author Neil Gaiman brings us into the world of \\"fat\\" Charlie and his brother Spider. The Anasia Boys is a thrilling page turner that is always changing.\\"Fat\\" Charlie, with a name given to him by his father, lived a normal life in New England. He has a good job and a lovely Fianc&eacute;e, what else could he want? When his dad dies he find something that he wished he'd never found, His brother Spider. Spider is the total opposite of him with \\"movie star good looks\\", a singing voice that could calm anyone and a cocky charm all the girls fall for. He also finds out his father was a god, the god of theft who can change anyone's mind with a blink of an eye. It's up to Charlie to uncover the truth and save his brother from the evil bird lady and tiger. But it's hard to stay on track when your brother is taking over your life, job, and all of the people he loves.Anasia Boys is for teens and up, since the book can get confusing at some points when switching between characters. The genre of this book is fantasy with some mystery. Its fantasy because there are god-like people who they find in a world with magical powers. The mystery comes in when someone is murdered and Daisy, a British cop, goes out on a limb to find the killer. It is definitely not for comedy lovers. I recommend this book for people that have read other books by Neil Gaiman.Some of the things I liked about Anasia Boys was the plot. The plot was very different from any other Author, with the characters only seconds away from death it's a page turner that twists your mind. Some of the weaknesses are that he doesn't describe the characters visually. You never truly know what the characters look like, but you have to guess how they look by how they act. He also could have described the setting more, other then a basic outline and saying where they were. Lastly it could have been explained more why certain things happened, like why Rosie's mom was in the hospital dying. Not all of it made sense at times. If you liked Coraline, also by Neil Gaiman, then you will like this book. They are similar because they both have a plot that is like no other. They both are twisted and take the reader to two different, crazy, worlds."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is a very enjoyable novel. It takes a little while to get going, but once it does it is a lot of fun. The book is full of humor, action, and some fantasy elements. Anansi Boys tells the story of Fat Charles Nancy after he discovers that he has a brother named Spider, and his father is Anansi the trickster god. If you are looking for a novel that is different, a lot of fun, and exciting- give Anansi Boys a try."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is my first foray into a Gaiman novel. I was pleasantly surprised to find that he is a very talented storyteller and he shines in two elements of storytelling in particular. He draws characters incredibly well and their dialogue never seems contrived or flat. Secondly, Gaiman has a great handle on how to deal with mythology and how it lends itself to a contemporary narrative.Fat charlie, Spider and the rest of the cast are spot on accounts of humanity. Fat Charlie's angst and his difficulties in handling his new found brother, his mother-in-law-to-be as well as his jerk of a boss are all handled expertly. In addition to Gaiman's characterizations is his undeniable ability to write comedic dialogue as well as a narrative voice that manages to infuse laughter along with suspense and poignancy. It's a tough hat-trick to pull off but Gaiman makes it happen. This is a trademark of a truly talented novelist. I find that some writers can do a few things well in the course of a novel. Some excel in description, others in dialogue or character back story. Gaiman really has a deep repertoire and he commands his gift with elegance.The mythology of the Anansi was a valuable and interesting way to add a magical touch to the story. Once Spider is thrown into the mix he becomes a catalyst for hilarity, desperation, frustration, vengeance, and in the end: unusual happiness. That was the feeling I was left with when I turned the last page. All the characters were given a unique and touching conclusion that matched the style in which the story was told. While I did enjoy the mythological aspect that the Anansi tales brought to the overall theme of the tale, I must confess that I could have done without them. While they all served to illustrate a connection to the activity in the remainder of the text, there were a few occasions when I got distracted by them. It's hardly a \\"problem\\" with the text, but I'd be lying if I said the text was perfect......It's almost perfect. The book is well paced, hilarious and memorable. There are a ton of quotable lines from the book and this is one of the few books I've read in a while that I thought might make an interesting film in the right hands."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi, one of the gods featured in Gaiman's American Gods, is a spider god who owns all the world's stories. This is probably the most important thing to understand about him. His son, Fat Charlie, though, is a man who doesn't even live his own story. When Anansi dies and Charlie meets his brother, he is forced to face the two parts of himself: the part that is Fat Charlie and the part that is Spider, who lives a life Fat Charlie could only dream of.This story is many things all at once. In a way, it's a coming of age story (even though Fat Charlie is an adult). It's also a story about families, love, and the nature of life and death. It's a thriller, with its own maniacal killer, and it's a story about the history of the world and how we came to understand it, mainly through Anansi's stories. It's fast-paced, moving, hilarious, and scary. I would recommend this book not only to fans of modern fantasy, but also to anyone who simply wants to read a great story."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Ah Neil you did it again..I just love anything this man writes!!And this one was no exception!I won't go into the whole story you can read that above,but the characters in this book had me laughing.There wasn't any flat characters at all they were all so fleshed out so you cared what happened to each and everyone of them including the bad guy!Loved it!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"For me, \\"Anansi Boys\\" was one third Douglas Adams, one third Robert Rankin, one third Jasper Fforde and one third Neil Gaiman. (I know, but it's that kind of book.)There's the \\"wacky things happen when you least expect it, but roll with it\\" aspect that I always enjoy. An ordinary bedroom in a London flat can suddenly seem the size of a football field with a different view out the window than what is really there, one person can be seen as a completely different person even to those who know him best, and there are gods walking the earth. Supernatural meeting the mundane with witty banter along the way.I certainly wouldn't say this is one of my favorite books of this type - but it was an enjoyable read. I picked it up mostly because I recognized Gaiman's name from Coraline which my kids saw and liked. Based on that frame of reference that I had, this book was NOTHING like that. Which is fine. Oh, but before I go further, I should mention that the main character's name is Fat Charlie.\\"Fat Charlie tried to remember what people did in prison to pass the time, but all he could come up with was keeping secret diaries and hiding things in their bottoms. He had nothing to write on, and felt that a definite measure of how well one was getting on in life was not having to hide things in one's bottom.\\"It's an interesting story with colorful characters as Fat Charlie discovers the world behind the one he had been inhabiting all his life. He has a good set of eyes with which the reader can see this unusual world, and sometimes his vision provides the reader with more than one might expect.\\"Different creatures have different eyes. Human eyes (unlike, say, a cat's eyes, or an octopus's) are only made to see one version of reality at a time. Fat Charlie saw one thing with his eyes, and he saw something else with his mind, and in the gulf between the two things, madness waited. He could feel a wild panic welling up inside him, and he took a deep breath and held it in while his heart thudded against his ribcage. He forced himself to believe his eyes, not his mind.\\"Fat Charlie is the definition of everyman, plodding along through life until he is forced to learn more about his father and his newly discovered brother, Spider.\\"If he (Spider) had not been perfectly certain of his own sanity, certain to a degree that normally is found only in people who have concluded that they're definitely Julius Caesar and have been sent to save the world, he might have thought he was going mad.\\"I guess, in the end, I enjoyed this book but didn't love it. I liked Gaiman's easy writing style and most of the supernatural goofiness and found several of the parts to be funny in a gentle way.\\"Charlie pushed his fedora back onto his head. Some hats can only be worn if you're willing to be jaunty, to set them at an angle and to walk beneath them with a spring in your stride as if you're only a step away from dancing. They demand a lot of you. This hat was one of those, and Charlie was up to it.\\"Charlie, who somewhere along the way, stopped being Fat Charlie and became a man of his own. With a jaunty hat."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"In this book Gaiman picks up Mr. Nancy's character from American Gods and sets a wonderful story woven around his two sons, Fat Charly and Spider, the good brother and the bad one. Charly is completely unaware that he has a brother and when his father dies an old friend tells him about it. He then calls his brother into his life only to realize that it was a huge mistake and that he wants him out! But Spider refuses to leave and Charly resorts to divine intervention that will place the two of them, and the woman they both love in danger.I highly recommend this book to anyone that loved the action of American Gods and the humor of Good Omens."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Every once in awhile it is great to change your perspective and break the laws of science. This story gives you that chance and keeps enough plausibility that you have to stop and think a little about the possibilities. Is it possible for gods to live amongst us? Are these gods responsible for both good and bad things that happen to us? These questions pop up while reading this book, but at the same time it is a funny story with good moral issues involved. This is a true story of brotherly love/hate."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"A wonderful fantasy story, unlike anything I have ever read before. Highly recommended, especially if you like a happy ending."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The Good: If you can't sleep, read this.The Bad: Fat Charlie, Fat Charlie, Fat Charlie, that seems redundant right? Well that's what the narration was like. Neil beats you over the head, with his obvious points, (Fat Charlie is an average Joe, Spider is just too cool) which makes reading not enjoyable when you feel like Neil's wasting your time, with repetition. There were a few scenes that have a nice touch of imagination, like how Spider was able to magically transform Charlie's spare room into having a waterfall."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Gaiman has succeeded in writing one of the least likeable protagonists in the world in Anansi Boys. There are no redeemable qualities about Fat Charlie, and after hearing about how much of a loser he was for 200 pages I returned this book to the library. The other characters aren't much better: the wife who does pretty much nothing except be charmed by the handsome men, and Charlie's brother who has no negative qualities at all."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Being a fan of Gaiman, and having read all his novels, I am sorry to say that this is (in my opinion) his worst work.

I can honestly say that Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite writers - and this includes \\"heavyweights\\" such as Tim O'Brien, Vladimir Nabokov, Michael Chabon, etc. Neil simply cannot be matched when it comes to writing stories that are whimsical, humorous and weighty all at once. In person, he is exactly like you would expect: approachable, affable, gracious, accomodating. I will be looking forward to his next novel while I re-read his collection in the meantime."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi boys is a fun, beach read type of book. Gaiman does a good job of keeping you on your toes and interested. Still, I found the book on the predictable side; a fact that takes away from the interest of the plot line.Otherwise, Gaiman has great charm, and some very funny moments. I'm going to watch him as an author. I predict that as he develops his style, he'll get to be an amazing author!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'll not bore you. The main characters stunk, and it's the biggest reason why I didn't enjoy the book. The narrative was boring and terribly unfunny. It was embarrasssing to read it, considering that I do admire Mr. Gaiman so much. A chore to read, indeed."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Judging from some of the reviews on here, I must be the minority who didn't enjoy this book. I am very hesitant to write a review unless it is positive, but I was suprised that this one didn't live up to my expectations. I've been wanting to try Neil Gaiman for some time, so I picked this. I really really liked the first several chapters. The writer interested me in his characters, and the writing was top notch. After a while, I was completely lost and had no idea what was going on. I had a vague idea, but I no longer cared. I happened to buy the audiobook, which is probably the best reading I've ever heard, but I admit I fastforwarded all the way to the end after hitting the half-way point of the book and no longer being able to tolerate it. Not that this author is untalented, I just don't know what the point of this story is. I have enough faith that I'd recoomend to you, and to myself, trying another of his novels."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil is my favorite author, so I read this twice to make sure I wasn't missing something the first time around. This book has none of the mystery+humor that makes his other books worth reading. The plot reads like it was conceived as it was written (or like a Dean Koonz novel, you pick which is worse)."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I have read many of Gaiman's other books and liked them, a lot. Anansi Boys was a huge disappointment for me, twice. I tried to read it years ago and put it down due to lack of interest. Picked it back up and started over recently and got halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore. Boring."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I probably should not be writing a review for a book I did not even finish, but I want to spare other readers the agony and the money. Generally, writers get better as their careers progress, but Neil Gaiman is bravely bucking that tide by getting worse."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This book is a joyful rolick through the strange lands of gods and spirits and a very boring suburban London existence. The main character is one pushed-around and put-upon fellow, till his long-lost brother shows up and pushes him around and takes everything he owns, in the nicest and most unassumingly entitled way possible.In the end, a darkly comic, magically fun ride."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This was a delightful story by Neil Gaiman. I collected his \\"Sandman\\" comics for several years and I didn't realize that he wrote novels. It was so refreshing to be engrossed in a novel that wasn't littered with coarse language. Gaiman pulls from African folklore to spin a tail that was funny and slightly challenging; not in language, but in terms of relationships, our distrust of animals, our mortality and the afterlife. Sometimes, authors chose to have unresolved endings, but it's just lazy writing. Gaiman doesn't leave the reader hanging and very few authors can show character development as well as Gaiman. Put a smile on your face and read this novel."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This was my first Neil Gaimen novel and I can appreciate why he is so well loved. His prose is elegant and imaginative. The characters draw you in, and his description of fantastical worlds come alive in my mind.Anansi Boys is the story of two brothers. One, named Spider, is a pseudo-god who has no trouble living like he's above mere mortal concerns. Which he is, of course, for the most part. The other, named Fat Charlie, is a seemingly timid average joe who has never heard of his brother Spider nor his godly ancestry.My reading experience was that the story began slowly, intrigued me by the middle and then everything came together for a strong finish."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"while reading this book i feel in love with neiil gaimans poetic writing. i cat wait to read more of his books."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Fat Charlie has been called \\"Fat\\" Charlie since his childhood, even though, as a middle-aged man, he is no longer even slightly pudgy. The name stuck because it was given to him by his father, Mr. Anansi. Charlie escaped his father as soon as he could, mostly because his father caused him so much embarrassment. When Fat Charlie finds out that his father has died of a sudden heart attack--while entertaining a crowd at karaoke--it starts a string of events that slowly unravels his, frankly, boring life. He discovers he has a twin brother, Spider, who is a terror: Spider moves into his apartment, gets Fat Charlie fired and arrested, and tries to steal his fianc&eacute;e. As if that wasn't disorienting enough, Charlie discovers that his deceased dad was the god of storytelling. That's when things get really strange.Anansi Boys is another mind-bending book by the author of the creepy children's story Coraline. Like all Gaiman books, Anansi Boys weaves between reality and fantasy, and your brain can't help but be stretched as you are shuttled between each world. This is his funniest book too; throughout the book, Charlie's boss speaks only in strings of clich&eacute;s, so of course he has a rotten soul. This a story about story-telling and in the hands of a master like Gaiman, Anansi Boys is epic."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"(4.5, really)Anansi Boys follows a similar formula to Gaiman's American Gods: take characters from folklore and mythology (in this case, Afro-Caribbean) and put them into a modern setting. This book is more light-hearted than American Gods, though, and I found it more fun. If you don't get a laugh out of Gaiman's colorful conception of Anansi as a smooth-talking, fun-loving, and thoroughly incorrigible old man, or the ultra-cool, multi-talented, and equally irresponsible Spider, or the many lines of witty dialogue and description, you might not have a sense of humor. The story, which involves a shlumpy but decent-hearted office worker nicknamed Fat Charlie, who happens to be Anansi's son, making a wish that he comes to regret, and trying to rectify it with a bargain that he comes to regret even more, follows familiar folklore tropes, but it's charmingly well-excuted.Possibly my favorite of Gaiman's books that I've read so far, but American Gods is enjoyable, too. However, I have to say that you're missing something if you merely *read* this novel -- the audiobook narrator renders the characters with the color and storybook flair that they deserve, effortlessly switching between Carribean, African-American, and British accents. Get it from audible (I found it on sale) or seek out the CD version."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I enjoyed this Audiobook a great deal. I love Neil Gaiman and I think after you've experienced one of his books, you'll be hungry for more. He is a masterful storyteller with a precise ear for dialogue. The supernatural blends in with the everyday in a way that is both seamless and absurd. Also, Lenny Henry deserves praise for performing this with sensitivity and humor."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is a very good, if not great, writer and he proved he is a smart writer as well with \\"Anansi Boys\\" (if there was any doubt). Whether you call it a sequel, or a spin-off, \\"Anansi Boys\\" is not an attempt to reproduce the amazing and incredible \\"American Gods\\". Instead, Gaiman produces a humorous novel, much lighter in feel, and much narrower in scope than its predecessor. By doing so, he has created a novel which can stand on its own merits, and will largely avoid a detailed comparison with its predecessor because the two are clearly very different.The main character is Charlie Nancy, who is usually referred to as \\"Fat Charlie\\", though he isn't fat, but it is a nickname that his father gave him and it has stuck with him throughout his life. Charlie has become engaged, and his fianc&eacute;, Ruth, queries him about inviting his father to the wedding. This artful trick allows Gaiman to fill the reader on Charlie's history, the tricks his father played on him, and how he got to London while his Father lives in the U.S. At this point, Charlie is unaware that his father is the god Anansi, and he is unaware that his father has just died. In going to the funeral, Charlie's unusual family tree is revealed by old neighbors and friends of the family. They reveal not just the true nature of his father, but also the existence of Charlie's brother, Spider.Initially Spider is quite different from Charlie, but throughout the book Spider becomes more like Charlie, and Charlie more like Spider, and they have the connection of brotherhood which allows Charlie to forgive Spider for the numerous tricks he plays on Charlie. Spider has inherited the magic and the trickster aspect of their father, while Charlie is much more mundane. His one great talent turns out to be singing, though stage fright prevents him initially from displaying it.In spite of being dead, Anansi is also a key character in this story. Not just because these are his sons, but Gaiman artfully weaves the stories of Anansi with the rest of the story to make Anansi a critical character and to provide insight into Spider and Charlie. Those are by far the most important characters, but there is an additional cast of characters who fill out Charlie's life and are important to the direction of the book. Humor is key to this book, and it is present throughout, even through murder, torture, kidnapping, and prison.I know that some have categorized this as Horror in addition to Fantasy, but I don't personally think it fits in that category. Certainly some horrible things happen, and there are a couple points where suspense builds a bit, but the humor aspect prevents me from putting it in that category. Regardless of what category it is put in, this is a very enjoyable novel, and while I would not put it on the same level as \\"American Gods\\", \\"Anansi Boys\\" stands quite well on its own.Amazingly, Neil Gaiman refused the nomination for the Hugo award, but that didn't stop \\"Anansi Boys\\" from winning the 2006 Locus award for Fantasy Novel, the 2006 British Fantasy August Derleth Award for best novel, the 2006 Geffen award for Fantasy Book, the 2006 Mythopoeic award for Adult Literature, and the 2006 SF Site Poll for SF/Fantasy Book."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"\\"It began, as most things begin, with a song.\\" [p. 1]Most Neil Gaiman novels are bizarre explosions of creativity and off the wall plots. While I would have to be insane to say that Anansi Boys is anything but bizarre, it's bizarre in a calculated way that sets it apart from many of Gaiman's other works. Anansi Boys is, above all, a story of deceiving simplicity, from characters, to plots, to themes.Characterization is, at first, broad. Our first glimpses of Spider, Fat Charlie's divine brother, for instance, show him as glamorous and heartless, the kind of man that'll drag his brother to a bar and then promptly forget his charge to begin a night of wild partying. Over the course of he narrative, however, Spider grows into a fully developed character with such subtlety that the reader misses all the usual road signs of I'm a well rounded person, now. Gaiman's characterizes by showing, not telling, and moments of epiphany aren't the beginning of sudden change, but rather the recognition of a gradual transformation that's well under way by the time it's remarked upon. Gaiman's characterization shows a deep understanding of how people think of themselves and the world around them:\\"Each person who ever was or is or will be has a song. It isn't a song that anybody else wrote. It has its own melody, it has its own words. Very few people get to sing their own song. Most of us fear that we cannot do it justice with our voices, or that our words are too foolish or too honest, or too odd. So people live their songs instead.\\" [p. 189]And yet, as anyone who's read anything that the man's written can tell you, Gaiman is anything but pretentious. His writing is, at all times, light hearted, and he imparts truths and tragedies with an understanding wink and a friendly tip of his hat:\\"Take daisy, for example. Her song, which has been somewhere in the back of her head for most of her life, had a reassuring, marching sort of beat, and words that were about protecting the weak, and it had a chorus that began 'Evildoers beware!' and was thus much too silly ever to be sung out loud. She would hum it to herself sometimes though, in the shower, during the soapy bits.\\" [p. 189]Gaiman's game is not one of sudden reversals. At the beginning of the book, we learn Fat Charlie's situation and watch as events in it play out as expected - or, at least, close to it. Soon after, Fat Charlie leans of his father's death, and we see the consequences of that. When Spider comes into the picture, it still isn't a dramatic call to adventure, followed by the two gallivanting around the globe. Instead, the relationship between the two develops naturally as their various personalities affect the course of the other's life. This is a story that is, above all, organic in its growth, introducing a new element and exploring all of its possibilities before moving on.That is not, however, to suggest that Anansi Boys's plot is predictable or uneventful. Over the book's course, Gaiman explores the full range of emotions and events, from the comic, to the heart warming, to the terrifying, each reached with a naturalness that keeps the tale from ever growing outlandish or unbelievable. As each new piece is added to the puzzle, the amount of delightful bizarreness skyrockets, but there are no extraneous elements here; every element proves vital to the tale's survival and continuation:\\"Stories are webs, interconnected strand to strand, and you follow each story to the center, because the center is the end. Each person is a strand of the story.\\" [p. 302]Every one of the aforementioned pitches is well done, but the books true highs occur when Gaiman balances them at once. Towards the end of the book, scenes of outright terror and suspense are wedded to moments of outlandish comedy, each set up so well that the combination doesn't feel contrived, but rather inevitable.Thematically, Anansi Boys treads little new ground. This is a story of familes and relationships, of people, and of decisions, and of the consequence of those decisions. You've probably read a story with similar themes before. In fact, I'm sure of it. Odds are, you've read a whole boat load of them. This one's different, though. How so, you ask? Well, it's because nothing that Gaiman does is quite like anything you've ever read before. Oh, I'm sure that you've heard that statement about a whole encyclopedia's worth of authors, but all I can say is that, this time, it's true. Gaiman illustrates rash actions with flocks of homicidal birds and depicts a father son dynamic with a heartfelt talk, both scenes feeling as fresh and poignant as anything I've read.Anansi Boys's isn't perfect. The lackadaisical pace of the first few chapters meant that the book didn't suck me in until page eighty or so (and then what a blissful, airborne ride the rest of the book was), and I initially thought that Grahame Coats's law firm might actually manufacture coats or something similar...but, judging by how absurdly stupid that last one was, I think it's pretty clear that Anansi Boys's is pretty damn close to perfect, and I think it's worth you getting up out of your seat, driving to the nearest booksellers, and forking over your hard earned cash."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'll preface this review by saying I've made a habit of avoiding Neil Gaiman. I'm the kind of person who instantly hates things that everybody thinks is awesome and having worked the better part of a decade in a comic book store Neil Gaiman has always been at the top of everyone's slurp it down list.It was only the sheer power of the library that made me even put my hand on this book. (I don't know what it is about that place.) Long story short this is one of the best reads of my life. I don't know how Gaiman manages to write such over the top circumstances in such a cool real way. (Sorry, but I couldn't find a more literary way to say that.) I loved all of the characters. I want to play the Bird Woman in the movie and I want to go see that movie in the Ritz. I love this book in the same way that I love the No.1 Ladies Detective DVD. It's the kind of experience I've been waiting for my whole life."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've been a fan of Neil Gaiman's for many years now and I look forward to his rare novels like a third date and a weekend spent with an old, dear friend. I knew from the synopsis first released that this book was related to his last novel, \\"American Gods\\". I expected it to pick up where the other left off. It doesn't. Instead it shows us yet another aspect of the first gods, walking among us. I loved the folklore asides, telling stories about the gods the way Uncle Remus would. The characters are lively and down to earth, especially for gods. Humor was more prevalent this go 'round. The good kind - subtle, sarcastic and self-deprecating. One change I've noticed is that Gaiman has shed some of his morbid layer (or maybe just taken off his dark cloak of dreams). There are still elements that verge on disturbing, but they are mere glimpses into the shadows. This is not said to diminish the book in anyway. I think it's akin to Johnny Depp making Disney movies...when you're a thankful parent, your children bring too much light into your life to dwell on the dark stuff. You want to create something to share with them one day, not give them nightmares. I truly enjoyed this book and am not sorry to have forked over the money for the hard cover, it's a keeper. Anytime Neil Gaiman deigns to tell a story, he'll have my full attention. Buy it, read it, love it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I listened to this on CD. Awesome reader, great story. The reader was so good, that at some points, I thought that there might have been two or more readers. I didn't start suspecting who Spider really was until nearly the very end.For some reason, this book seems to lend itself to being read aloud. I almost can't imagine reading it without the narrator voicing the characters for me. The blend of mythology and modern life was an amazing ride, like riding a gandola on the moon.Don't miss this. I highly recommend listening to it on CD instead of reading it. The narrator adds so much to the story, that it's a shame to miss out on his outstanding, lyrical talent in bringing the characters and the story to life.Well done."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Enough people have given synopses of the plot that I don't need to reiterate the story or the laugh-out-loud quality of the writing. What I do want to add is that Lenny Henry does a fabulous job of narrating this book in the audio version - all his characters are recognizably different voices, the accents are spot on, his timing is great. I listen to a lot of audio books while exercising, driving or going about other tasks, and this is the best performance I've heard in a long while. Simply brilliant."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I wasn't expecting this to be such a funny book (as in ha-ha.) I haven't read Amrican Gods, but I'm going to read it now. Gaiman mixes ordinary family life with magical powers in a way that makes you believe it, and the humor makes it even better. I also liked An Audience for Einstein and Class Dis-Mythed, two other great books."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Although Neil Gaiman did use similar themes to ones he's used before (and what's wrong with that?), I thought his crafting of the novel showed his growth as a novelist and it was my favorite of his so far. I really liked American Gods, but I felt it went off on a few too many tangents that could have been tightened up. The pacing of Anansi Boys was perfect for the story, the characters were delightful, and the scenarios were hilarious."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Who is the best fantasy writer around nowadays? It is, of course, a matter of opinion. If we narrow the field a bit to adult fantasy (and thereby take folks like Rowling and Pullman out of the equation), a good argument could be made that the best in the bunch is Neil Gaiman. While most other fantasy writers are busy writing Tolkien knock-offs, he presents original stories. While most others can't seem to write a story that doesn't span several volumes (which is probably driven as much by commercial considerations as artistic ones), Gaiman gives us standalone novels.Anansi Boys helps solidify his standing as one of the best (if the best) in his field. The story follows Fat Charlie Nancy (who is not fat), who as the novel opens, finds out his father has just died. Fat Charlie was by no means close to his father, but his fiancee Rosie was not fond of the estrangement. Fat Charlie flies from England to Florida to attend his father's funeral. While there, he learns some interesting things, most of which he finds hard to believe.One unbelievable idea is that his father was actually the trickster god Anansi, which makes it more surprising that he actually died. Furthermore, Fat Charlie has a brother who has apparently has inherited Anansi's powers. This brother, Spider, comes into Fat Charlie's life soon enough and starts turning things upside down: he seduces Rosie and puts Fat Charlie in dangerous peril with his crooked boss. When Spider will not leave, Fat Charlie comes upon a method to force him to go; this method, however, is actually part of a grander scheme that will threaten both brothers.Among the people Gaiman thanks on the dedication page is P.G. Wodehouse, and this novel has a wonderfully comic feel that fits right in the Wodehousian tradition. This is one of those books that is a constant delight from beginning to end. You don't have to be a fantasy fan to enjoy Anansi Boys; in fact, since the book doesn't adhere to the genre's cliches, it may even be better not to be one."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi is the African trickster god. He made a brief apperance in American Gods. Anansi has a son Fat Charlie Nancy and when Anansi dies Charlie's life turns upside down. He finds out he has a brother who has all of Anansi's powers and creates havoc for Charlie. This is the story of how the two brothers who didn't know each other cope with meeting for the first time. It also has a lime. Along with other gods that poke around in our world. I found myself laughing out loud at times.Neil has written a very intriguing story. It weaves into our world along with its fanciful characters and makes you empathize for Charlie as he tries to figure out how to deal with the effects of finding his brother. In this book Neil Gaiman has shown why he is one of my favorite writers. It is interesting because this is the first book I have read after reading his journal daily, I can see his writing style flowing through everything. It will be interesting to see a few of his movies that he has written(Mirrormask, Beowulf) to see if I can see his traces there."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is without a doubt one of our most original and imaginative authors. Everything he touches is full of wit and humour, as he invents worlds and places we've never seen before. Anansi Boys is no exception. After having been disappointed by his last effort, American Gods, this novel brings you back to the greatness of Neverwhere and Stardust.Gaiman once again deals with the theme of gods. Only this time, the story is from the offspring's point of view. Fat Charlie hadn't spoken to his father in ages when he learns of the man's death. Having lived in London for many years, he had severed all ties with his past. He is now forced to return to Florida for his father's funeral. That's when he learns of the existence of a twin brother he never knew he had.Only, this brother is not just any ordinary guy. He is a god with magical powers, just like his father was. Spider is his name and the only way to get in touch with him is through spiders. Not thinking much of it, Fat Charlie jokingly asks a spider to call for his brother. And, soon enough, upon his return to England, Charlie's brother is right there waiting for him.The man truly is a God as he can get and take whatever he wants without any real consequences. And soon enough, Fat Charlie's life becomes miserable as Spider pretends to be him and destroys his career, his relationship with his fiance and pretty much everything else Fat Charlie holds dear.In an attempt to get rid of his brother, Fat Charlie calls on another God, a great mistake that will soon explode in a series of very funny and imaginative coincidences. The last 100 pages is a real thrill ride that made me laugh more than once. I just couldn't stop turning the pages.I have to admit that I was disappointed at first to see Gaiman deal with the subject of gods yet again, but Anansi Boys is the novel American Gods should have been. There is never a dull moment in Anansi Boys. It's the kind of book you just can't put down.The story would not have worked so well had the characters not been this well-developped and different from one another. Fat Charlie, Spider, their fiance Rosie, Rosie's mother, Charlie's Boss, the female officer carrying an investigation against Fat Charlie... All of these characters have their moments of brilliance. I particularly liked the ghost of an old rich woman who wants to seek vengence on her murderer.Anansi Boys is Neil Gaiman at his best. It's not as great as Neverwhere and Stardust, but it sure beats 98% of the stuff you'll find out there."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Many of the few-star reviewers seem to have missed the depth of Anansi Boys. It's deceptively simple, yet rich and deep. Perhaps they would have understood this had they, instead of reading the book in its flat, black & white print, listened to the thoroughly engaging audiobook version, read by British comedian Lenny Henry.Lenny Henry's accents are spot on--and no wonder, as his parents were islanders who moved to England in time for Lenny to be born there. He uses a wide range of voices and captures the nuances that make up each character. Lenny Henry is an amazing reader who brings Anansi Boys to life--magical life.In print and in audio, Gaiman's characters are absolutely, positively--or should I say, \\"absotively\\"--delightful, right down to that scoundrel Grahame Coats. The book is a fun, calypso-colored read on the surface, yet at its dark depths, it is a study in human character and the choices we make that make us who we are."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This was definitely an interesting read and I'm glad I listened to those that recommended this book. While I may not have seen it in Stardust, I can see why people consider Gaiman a fantasy god. His writing, when he's not trying to write in a specific style like Stardust, just takes you fluidly from one end of the story to the other. It's not high brow literary nor is it a fantasy that takes itself way too seriously. It's just good writing telling a story that I've never heard before.I'm sure, if the story of Anansi was broken down into it's more baser parts, there'd be your standard fantasy fare in there somewhere (know-nothing guy saves of the day of the other guy that everyone thought could do it all) but the story of Anansi, of all the animals and the transcendence from their world into ours is nothing like I've ever read. I believe the Anansi and other gods myths are actual myths that Gaiman expounded on but even if they weren't, the story was told so well and in such an authentic voice that they could have been. And that's all that matters, right?Fat Charlie is immediately relatable-slightly awkward, doesn't think too highly of himself, has something of a go-nowhere job, less than stellar relationship with his parents. And then Spider comes into the picture, the sibling that's so much better, and ruins everything even more for him. It certainly doesn't help that Spider is half god, nor all the interesting that was taken out of Fat Charlie.I don't know about you but I wanted to punch Spider in the face when he started to move in on Rosie but during and after the shift, when you begin to see that it's better for both Rosie and Charlie that they not be together and that Spider and Rosie really are in love, you can't help but be endeared. And Charlie doesn't walk away empty handed either.I thought the role reversal, though, was the strongest part of the novel. While reading it the first time, it felt abrupt, as if I'd just turned the page and Fat Charlie was Spider and Spider was Fat Charlie. But with hindsight, the change was much more subtle.When Spider was taken into the Bird Woman's world, he seemed to have done a complete 180, especially when Fat Charlie came to rescue him. Their personalities just switched bodies. But closer to the end they pretty much leveled out on each other, each taking pieces of the other's person for their own. Spider was, himself, a little more humbled and Fat Charlie walked away with more confidence and a thicker backbone. In the end Spider was never as much god as he thought and Charlie always had some of his father in him, however latent.The only downside to this book were the numerous typos I kept coming across. At first I thought they could have been stylistic choices but then it became pretty obvious that there was some rushed copy editing involved. I don't know if this book came down to crunch time when it was released but there were a few too many typos for comfort. It got to a point where I would get pulled out of the story because I'd hit yet another typo.All in all, this was an excellent book. It's surefire proof that you don't need high fantasy to have a fantasy story and a unique view on a slightly less traveled road can make all the difference. Gaiman is not only an excellent storyteller but an excellent writer as well. I think I'm going to have to invest in a few more of his books now."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I read the kindle version of this book. It was funny and had great charactors.

Until I'd read Anansi Boys, I'd only read two other books by Gaiman before: Stardust and The Graveyard Book. I adored both.

Now I'm on a mission to start collecting and reading any and everything he ever has put out and will put out.Anansi Boys was an odd story of family, mythology, fantasy, and humor. I laughed out loud a few times. It was fun. It was vivid. It was charming. I couldn't put it down. I'm so glad that I found my way into reading more of Gaiman's work.

It takes the fantasy-based-in-reality model of its predecessor and adds an emotional thrill ride about the relationships between two twin brothers who are anything but similar, a son coming to grips with his estranged father and a man trying to win back his fiance. An absolute must-have for any fan of Neil Gaiman, American Gods or fantasy in general."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've come to notice that yes, anything can happen in a Gaiman novel and it usually does..Anansi Boys is like one of the Anansi stories I the novel.

I won't call this a sequel since none of the characters or settings are re-used. But, it does involve the same \\"gods among us\\" theme. Interestingly, even though \\"American Gods\\" read nothing like the Neil Gaiman I was familiar with (much more serious and dark), \\"Anansi Boys\\" is written much closer to what I consider the \\"real\\" Neil Gaiman. It's a very well-written book with a lot of humor and wit, good pacing, and excellent characters. I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"If you are like me, you can't afford and don't want to scale K2. BUT, if you have, anywhere in your literary soul, a desire to read (or hear) one of the 100 best stories of all time, before your demise, you need to hear \\"Anansi Boys\\". I recommend hearing it, because the recording adds a lilting Jamaican accent to the story, and some island music to make it all more fun. You do have to be able to believe in African gods who come back to 21st century America, demi-gods who can lead a Conga line on the surface of an L.A. swimming pool, and very nasty Tigers, who crave blood and darkness. Spoiler alert: There is also a sort of nasty murder. BUT, again, if you never read any other fantasy novel, WITHOUT (thank you, God) dwarves and dragons and remarkably stupid bad wizards, READ THIS BOOK. As my three year old says:\\"oh please oh please oh please please please please\\" read this book. You don't know me, and you won't ever meet me. But- I promise you, you will thank me."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"After the relatively poor, in my opinion, American Gods, Neil Gaiman finds his voice again in Anansi Boys. We have the general idea of American Gods crossed with the humor of Good Omens in Gaiman's own undiluted voice.Gaiman is a storyteller, and often a teller of old tales that aren't always his and that is where he excels. In plundering the lore of Anansi he has found the inspiration and impetus for a wholly enjoyable read that is not only humorous, but also touching and suspenseful as well.If I had a complaint, it would be that it is a rather lightweight book. There are some issues of dysfunctional family relationships touched on, both with Spider/Fat Charlie and with their fiancee and her mother, but all done in a most humorous almost shallow way. That's ok though, because it is a very fine entertaining book on it's own. A pure story to while away a few hours and take you somewhere else. Which is what Gaiman does best, tell stories."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"ANANSI BOYS is a wonderfully entertaining novel set in the universe Gaiman created in AMERICAN GODS, though the connection is only through common characters, not a shared plot or anything like that. Gaiman's writing is, as always, sharp, witty and fresh - nothing feels cliched or even mundane in his rich, humourous writing.The plot will be obvious, so no need to summarize here. What really charmed me was the audio version I downloaded. Lenny Henry is an incredible vocal talent: in a cast that required fully a dozen separate voices, Henry was always spot on in his inflections and accents and brought an already engaging story even more to life. 5 stars for the novel, 5 stars for the audio version."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"You know that guy down the street who acts awful snake-like? What about the cashier at Walmart who is catty? And there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys. Neil Gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize. In this novel, gods (which represent animals) roam the earth in the bodies of humans. The main character is the clever, trouble-loving spider who interacts with other animal-gods in everyday human life. This book, along with other science fiction books, has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination.The strong point of this novel is the humor employed by Neil Gaiman. On par with Douglas Adams, the author of Anasi Boys fills the pages with quirky, pop-culture laden humor. The main character, Fat Charlie, I found much in common with. His awkward moments with friends, family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with. The story, however, isn't anything special. I like witches and animal-gods as much as the next guy, but the plot is uninteresting. It is a rare book that combines wit with plot, and this is not one of those rare books."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This book was so awesome I didn't want it to end. A great story."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is a remarkable book. A few years ago Neil Gaiman broke with traditional fantasy with American Gods, a book that demonstrated that American mythology was a lot more than Paul Bunyan and Kachinas. The waves of immigrants have each brought a people's stories into the mix so that we are part a blend, and part a repository for legends, some of which new have America as their last home. Gaiman made this complicated inter-relationship work, and I still view American Gods as something groundbreaking.Anansi Boys lacks the temerity and weight of American Gods. It is a lighter, more personal story when an old woman splits you into two personalities and the other guy got all the luck. Fat Charlie Nancy is the brother who got the short end of the stick. Somehow he has managed to get engages, to find a job he almost likes, and scratch out a reasonable life style. But the sudden death of his father back in the USA reintroduces him to a world he carefully has tried to forget. Before you know it, he has told a spider to call his brother and Spider (the one with all the luck) jumps into Charlie's like and proceeds to ruin it.Life is tough when you and your brother are the sons of a God that decided to take a break and die for a while. Spider discovers a money making scam at Charlie's work place, moves into Charlie's flat and, for the first time ever, falls in love -- with Charlie's fianc&#65533;e. Soon our hapless hero is being hunted by the police as he flits from continent to continent trying first to get rid of his brother and then desperately trying to get him back.While American Gods was an investigation of the concept of an extended pantheon, Anansi Boys delves into one possibility among many, twisting African and Caribbean archetypes into thoroughly modern characters. I also suspect that Shakespeare might have been pillaged as well. The resulting heady concoction is the kind of book that grows on you as you read it until, finally, you cry out with some dismay as the last wry bit of the finale comes to a close."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"this book is no neverwhere (still sharing my favorite gaiman rating with good omens). it is not a deep story, nor a terribly complex one. gaiman gives superficial insights into his characters, just enough to keep the reader interested while he keeps the story moving. that being said, it IS enough to keep the reader interested and it is hysterically funny in parts. i read it on a plane and had people giving me funny looks as i laughed out loud. it is a little less complex than american gods, but it moves much faster and is a lot more light-hearted. i recommend it, but as a good, fun, read, not as a masterwork."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Like most Gaiman books, this a awesome. A must read. Neil Gaiman is one of the best story tellers of this age. The stories that he comes up with !!! whew! man... this guy is something."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Without even trying, Neil Gaiman has become one of the most important voices in literature, and Anansi Boys is his best work yet.After the breakout success of American Gods, one might think that Gaiman would try to write something huge, some magnum opus that would mark his place in things. He's done just the opposite. Following the whimsey of his own imagination, he's told a simple tale of family, set against a backdrop of fantasy and myth.We follow a character named Fat Charlie, whose family in turn embarrasses him and then ruins his life. Desperate to rid himself of his family burden, he enters the tenuous world of gods and myth seeking help. The path he stumbles upon is one of self-discovery and redemption.Anasi Boys is a very personal story, following just a few characters closely. The writing is humerous and clever, but never too clever, and never, ever melodramatic, making it unique in the fantasy section of the bookstore.That uniqueness is Gaiman's great contribution to the art. The genre of modern fantasy literature has been very one-dimensional since its inception with Tolkien. Neil Gaiman has found a new way to tell a story that stretches the imagination. I look forward to where he'll take us next."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The first 100 pages were a bit of a slog for me, but afterward, ANANSI BOYS' pace picked up and the novel was difficult to put down. Fat Charlie Nancy cannot ever recall being overfond of his father. \\"Dad\\" always had this tendency toward playing practical jokes, for instance, giving him the name \\"Fat Charlie\\" in the first place. Then, there was the time \\"Dad\\" told him that kids in the US dressed up as US Presidents for Presidents' Day...When Charlie got word his father had died, he wasn't particularly sad. His Mother had left the 'old goat' years before when she couldn't keep his attention.Then, things start going wrong and Charlie discovers his Father was a God--not just any, mind, but the Trickster God Anansi. And, oh by the way, he has a brother, Spider, the lucky one who inherited the godlike powers.Things only get worse when Charlie sees a spider and wishes to be reunited with his brother....From there, we go to broken romances, arrests, murder and attempted murder....All in all, a good romp. If you don't like the book at first, hang in there. It does get better!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Fat Charlie Nancy has issues with his father, but they are rather everyday issues; an estrangement following his parents divorce exacerbated by the fact that his father is in many ways Charlie's polar opposite - happy loquacious and extroverted.So news of his fathers death from a heart attack in the middle of a karaoke session is a surprise but not a tragedy. What however is a greater surprise is the news provided by an elderly neighbour that his father was in fact the trickster and storytelling Spider God Anansi. And stranger still that it is Charlie's previously unknown brother \\"Spider\\" who has inherited his fathers godhood. At this point the rationale act would be to forget all of this new and unwelcome news and to continue on with his life. Charlie however decides to invite his brother around for a visit. And in no time spider has taken over his life, his job and his fianc&eacute; Rosie.So what do you do to get rid of a unwanted god who just happens to be your brother? You strike a deal with another god, a god with a history of antagonism towards your family, a god who is best left alone. And that is when Charlie's problems truly begin.Anansi Boys is a follow on story to Neil Gaiman's previous tale American Gods, which examined the life of \\"Small Gods\\" in America where worship is transitory and gods are constantly being replaced and superseded by modern cultural icons. Anansi Boys is a less serious tale than its predecessor focusing on smaller more immediate themes of family relationships and conflicts.Although I enjoyed Anansi Boys less than American Gods, I can still highly recommend this tale for the same reason that I enjoy all of Gaiman's writing; for his understanding of story and myth, and for his wit and humour."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"No one gets me righteously indignant over what happens to imaginary people like Gaiman. He is a true master of \\"the schmuck with the unexpected something extra\\". Written in the same universe as American Gods this is a much gentler story which I rather enjoyed.A story of the painfully self-conscious Fat Charlie Nancy, his embarrassing father, and his infuriatingly cool brother who is preternaturally good at charming the pants off of everyone; this is a tale of unlikely heroes, getting what you want and realizing that it couldn't be farther from what you need, epically dysfunctional families, pretty (and competent) girls, personal growth, ancient grudges, and as always (and probably most importantly), it belongs to Spider."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Charlie Nancy can't shake the name 'Fat Charlie', which his departed father bestowed upon him - nor his other unwelcome gifts: a good-looking stranger who might be his brother, and the discovery his father was really Anansi, a trickster god embodying the spirit of rebellion. Taking up where AMERICAN GODS left off, Gaiman returns a new novel of intrigue, fantasy and a light touch of humor to provide a read both adults and young adults will find compelling and vivid.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Enjoyed this book on cd very much. The narrator was excellent, and worked well with the material. Getting used to Gaiman's universe, which can be very strange for the uninitiated- but found this book to be very interesting and engaging."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Here Neil Gaiman has put together elements from his two best books of the past, American Gods and Neverwhere. Some reviewers will grumble about a supposed lack of new ideas, but who cares, because this is Gaiman's most readable and enjoyable novel yet. From American Gods we get the concept of forgotten minor gods causing mischief in the real world, still acting out scenes from various ethnic mythologies. Meanwhile, this new book's protagonist is much like the guy in Neverwhere &#8211; a bumbling zero who thinks he's doomed to an uncool and unexciting existence, but turns out to have the potential for greatness if he would only apply himself. In fact, Gaiman is great at the dork-with-potential archetype, and here Fat Charlie (not really fat of course) is a truly loveable character. Gaiman has also perfected his own brand of dark comedy here, with sarcastic word choice and irreverent dialogue as we guiltily watch Fat Charlie stumble through an embarrassing life as the under-achieving offspring of a mischievous god figure. And for the record, Gaiman's mythology here is based solidly in the Anansi legends of West Indian/Afro-Caribbean folklore, with assistance from Nalo Hopkinson, a great speculative fiction writer from that tradition. In the end, this is a book about family and how you're stuck with your relatives and all their flaws for life, no matter how embarrassing or empowering they may be. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"If only this novel was a good as all the hype I'd of been very happy. I myself hoped after reading Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" that his follow up novel would be an improvement upon it. As it so happens I find it's not even as good as \\"Gods\\", which I rated as a 3 star read. This in my view only get's a 2 star award. Nothing wrong with the writing and the story has a few funny passages that made me laugh. The problem is the story for me, It just didn't grip me and I've held back from posting a review for a few weeks so as to resist diving in with a bad review. I wanted to reflect about the story and I'm afraid that I still feel dissapointed with \\"Anansi Boys\\". I'm hoping I find Gaiman's collection of stories ,\\"Fragile Thing's\\", the 5 star Gaiman book I'm waiting for."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Not everyone's cup of tea, but a talented twist on old tales. You get completely different stuff from this author."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've been a fan of Mr. Gaiman's for a long time. I've read pretty much everything he's published, some of it several times. His Sandman series still stands as the best arguement for the legitimacy of comics-as-literature I've ever heard. Its interesting that he describes his popularity as being sexually-transmitted (boyfriends turning girlfriends onto his stuff). I don't know how many ex-girlfriends read Sandman because I gave it them, but it was a lot.I didn't care much for Good Omens and American Gods seemed like a one-trick pony to me. Both had ok storylines, but compared to Sandman, Signal to Noise, Books of Magic and Mr. Punch, they were good fiction, just not good Gaiman fiction.Now along comes Anansi Boys and I have to tell you, this is better. Its very funny in parts but the story is involving. The people in the book are people for whom you come to care. There are no cardboard cutouts, there are no throwoff characters. Instead, there's a fun story that you'll (that I) whip (ped) through and finished with regret.When Neil Gaiman is ON, there's nobody who is more ON. When he's off, he's still better than most. Here, he tells a story about a trickster god and his wayward children that make me wish I worshipped the deity."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Living under the shadow of Sandman and American Gods, Gaiman has difficulty impressing me with other works because those two are so utterly superb.Anansi Boys is an unfortunate example of just such a case.It tells the story of Fat Charlie, the son of the trickster god Anansi. Early on in the story his father dies, and Fat Charlie finds himself more relieved than anything. Fat Charlie's life continues on with the dull routine most of us suffer, until his long-lost brother appears at his doorstep. From that moment on, Fat Charlie's fianc&eacute;e, job, sanity, and freedom are put in jeopardy.Anansi Boys begins rather slowly and takes its time establishing the main characters' traits--perhaps too much time. However, once the book gets rolling about three-quarters of the way through, it moves very quickly and becomes a bit of a nail-biter.I wouldn't consider Anansi Boys one of Gaiman's must-reads, but it also isn't something I'd say you should avoid.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This modern fable has a lovely story arc and impressive characters. The motif of music is uplifting and soulful. I've read it twice and it just gets tighter with the second read. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I was so impressed by American Gods that I ordered this book, which is supposed to be a loose sequel of AG. While American Gods is a book you want to read again and again (and has some of my favorite passages), Anansi Boys is a book that you quitely chuckle at, and then pass on to the next person. The book is pretty good, a current of humor runs throughout, but I liked AG better. I'd say borrow this book from a friend."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"all gaiman books tend to read like the comic books that he was so great at. an old girlfriend of mine read my copy of Neverwhere and noted that the characters came off two dimensional. And to be fair, Neil has gotten far far better at novels since this effort. Anansi boys is fairly sharp, good setup, good imagery, humor, tight storytelling and most of the plots are tied off well. It's a good fantasy setup, though I saw many parallels in it with the old Sandman plots. Things like birds coming of people's mouths [Sandman's Game of You Cuckoo villain], the use of song as a power [like Orpheus], the four witches were like the Kindly Ones [especially when Fat Charley goes to them for help, like Lyta Hall does the Furies]. There are many of these and that's not unexpected, Neil's body of work is vast. Stardust is the better book but this one is a good quick read. Still, he didn't reveal the deal that Bird cut with Tiger... what was up with that? Or maybe I missed it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I am not a huge fan of audiobooks, primarily because I often find them tedious to listen to compare to reading the book. I am a fast reader, so I can invest three hours or so to reading a novel compared to twelve or more sometimes to listen to an audiobook. As a consequence, I usually only listen to audiobooks on long drives or sometimes while exercising.I am also a big fan of Neil Gaiman's work - novels, short stories, comics, at al.So, I'm calling this audiobook edition a rare thing because, as much as I like the novel (and I read it on paper first), I think the audiobook may be better than the \\"real\\" book due to the confluence of the story and Lenny Henry's wonderful characterizations and reading. The novel is simply more nuanced and emotional when given voice by Mr. Henry.I'm also a big fan of the MP3 audiobook format, even if I don't always have access to a CD player with MP3 capabilities (like my current car stereos) since they are much easier to transfer to MP3 players."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Let's start by saying that I am not a hard-core fantasy fan but Gaiman's Anansi Boys won me over and AB has become one of my favourite books.Perhaps it succeeds so well because it focuses on the very likeable main characters and engaging plot rather than on the nuances of the fantasy world. The fantasy elements add a level of action and symbolism that deepen the message and its reach. It's a good book that also happens to have fantasy content.In this way, Anansi Boys differs greatly from American Gods, which I struggled through. (A real Pyrrhic victory, that one.) AG gets caught up with the details of the book's milieu and a heavy, not-terribly-likeable main character.(Gaiman's short stories seem to follow one or the other track too.)Even if you are not a fantasy fan, read this book. It's a great ride, very entertaining and humorous, with a little romance, some powerful darker moments, and philosophical food for thought to boot. It may open new fiction worlds for you."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman has a gift for weaving tales of the fantastic into modern life. This tale of a trickster god and his offspring leads the reader on a journey of discovery and wonder that can be a little scary, often hysterical and always entertaining. It is a quirky and lively tale that will ensnare you from the beginning and while it doesn't clobber you over the head with deeper meaning, like all great myths the meaning is there for you to discover, if you choose to look for it, lying in the middle of a wonderful modern myth that is fun and memorable long after you've turned the last page."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This story opens with Charlie. He lives a very ordinary, somewhat dull life in England. He travels home to Florida to his father's funeral. While there he is told that his father was not an ordinary human, but the human form of an Anansi (an African Trickster God). Charlie doesn't believe it. While there he is also told that he has a brother named Spider. Charlie is shocked as he believed he was an only child. He is told that if he is ever in trouble and needs his brother's help that all he has to do is tell a spider. He is warned, however, not to do so since the consequences could disrupt things for him.Back in England, he feels some despair as well as a desire to meet his brother. So he sees a spider and whispers to it to tell his brother Spider to come to him. From the moment his brother arrives, his life is turned completely upside-down. Spider seems to bring nothing but trouble into Charlie's life. To tell more would ruin the story for you.This was my first Neil Gaiman story and it won't be my last! This unabridged audio of his novel \\"The Anansi Boys\\" was very well narrated and the story was so good that I often stayed in the car to listen to more of the story after already arriving at my destination. Now that I've enjoyed the audio version so much I plan to buy the book. I highly recommend this fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm not as long-winded as some other writers. I know what I like and know what I dont like...I liked this book. Its a quick, fun read. \\"Fat\\" Charlie Nancy is an unlikely hero and I loved how I rooted for him towards the end of the book."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Good thing I was already accustomed to Neil Gaiman's introspective and randomly humourous style of writing otherwise I'm not sure I would've 'gotten' this book. I always thought the 'Sandman' series was bizarre and occasionally a little too philosophical for my liking and I don't think I've ever read anything by Neil that hasn't been obscure in some way so the randomness in this wasn't too daunting at first. The humour and warm undertone ties a lot of nonsensical elements together in a way that makes the overall story seem almost logical and linear in some elusive way. I decided somewhere towards the middle to take-in this story like almost any form of folklore. This was easy to do since ancient mythology and the fantasy realm inhabited by animal Gods was interwoven through the story anyhow. If you were reading a book of Russian folklore you wouldn't try to rationalise too much how certain things are obtained and a person can cross between two worlds by simply turning to a 'new direction'.Anansi Boys was a delightful and intriguing read. The characters have very strong personalities and motives and Gaiman clearly went to great lengths to ensure they were multi-layered and complex as real people. The contrast between Fat Charlie and Spider, for instance, the first impressions that were established and the way in which their relationship pans out is absolutely enthralling and feeds you a great deal of information. As the story progresses, things get a little more metaphorical and comparisons to animals and animal Gods who possess unique powers are thrown into the mix. I must admit though, that I felt the final chapters dragged on a little too long didn't really seem necessary. There didn't really provide any sensible closure and the pacing even seemed somewhat rushed as attention to detail was thinning out and everything was narrated in a straight-forward, day-by-day fashion. I also thought that (spoiler alert) Grahame Coat's tiger transformation was pointless and the suspense building to Mauve Livingstone's final act of revenge was tremendously let-down. All-in-all, I'm not saying it was a bad book. In fact, I've never read a book of this size so fast and that was because I was so hooked - but there were, I personally felt, lots of plot-holes and the ending was unsatisfactory. Still, I adore Neil's writing style and I would love to read more of his work."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This book was a bit of a let down to me as originaly I had heard it was to be a sequel to American Gods, however it is not.The book is good though, once I got past my dissapointment. Gaiman is a great author and I love both this and American Gods as they have gods living on earth along side us. The characters are interesting in both books and I highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.-Ryan Mercer."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is the first audio book I finished in its entirety. Normally, I grow annoyed with fake accents and droning voices. This one, I couldn't put dow...take out of my ears.There were two parts to this: first of all, Gaiman has written a wonderful, touching, kind story of brotherly (and other kinds of) love that triumphs over even the most powerful evil. The story itself is very old: Fat Charlie, your everyday kinda guy, nothing at all spectacular about him, finds out he has a brother--who is EVERYTHING spectacular, cool, smooth and destructive. Unhappy with his brother, Fat Charlie enlists the help of something powerful and malevolent against him--and soon lives to regret it very much. He is then faced with cleaning up the mess he's made--the process, which will pull him out of his safe world and make him a real man.Gaiman's language is lovely, his metaphors are light and airy, his humor is subtle and sweet. His characters are well-written and sympathetic--you really care about Fat Charlie, Spider, Daisy, Rosie--and even Rosie's mother. Additionally, Lenny Henry does such a wonderful job with reading the book, I could almost say that this book should be *heard,* and not *read.* With his rather uncanny ability to speak with different accents, and to make a woman sound like a woman, and a man like a man, he truly breathes life into Gaiman's characters.As for an inevitable comparison with The American Gods, this is a happier book, with a happier ending, more sympathetic characters and all-around better gods."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've very much enjoyed most of Mr. Gaiman's other books, but have to admit I found this difficult to get through and not much worth the effort. What separated Gaiman from other writers, I feel, is his ability to create and describer an atmosphere in which the characters live. This seemed stunted and rushed and, as others have said the characters themselves were not compelling. Hopefully this is an aberration and not a sign of diminished works going forward."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman has done it again! Humor! Mystery! Sibling rivalry! Well written story! This book has it all! A must read!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Good Writing, as usual, but he relies on too many clich&eacute;s and coincidences to keep the story going. If you strip all the classic Gaiman elements, the story is pretty dull."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is certainly a writer with imagination. The story is about a Floridian family that mimics some of the Jamaican folktales of Anansi, the Spider Man. Magic is wound around a dad and his son (or sons). Maybe the dad is Anansi, maybe he (or the next-door neighbor lady) weaves a spell to divide the boy's existence into two different worlds in order to control his wilder side here on earth.Meanwhile, the father delights in embarrassing his son Charlie at every turn in his development. Charley is stuck with the name \\"Fat Charlie,\\" and his dad regularly plays tricks on him, making growing up more difficult. After his mother's death, Charley moves away to England. When his fiancee insists that they invite his father to the wedding, Charley reluctantly flies back to Florida to find that his father is being buried that very day. He races to the cemetery (at first haplessly going to the wrong ceremony), and learns from his next-door neighbor that he had a brother. All this blossoms into layers of reality, outrageous circumstances, and some very funny dialogue, much like the stories of Anansi."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Gaiman takes the opportunity of Anansi Boys to do what he usually does: mash up a lot of mythologies and make confusing statements about the collective unconscious of mankind. The conceit in this story is that the African spider god Anansi has died, leaving two sons behind to sort out the mess. One is fully aware of his lineage and potential, while the other is a nearly worthless slob living a mundane life. Hilarity ensues.The actual drama of the novel is not thrilling, nor particularly insightful or fascinating. An old enemy of Anansi resurfaces to take his revenge on the sons, while the sons travel through worlds of apparently Jungian origin. Every build up of tension is released with a confusing bit of magic and with questionable logic. It's too bad, really. Gaiman's characters are best when they are humans dealing with a fantastic world, not when they are fantasy creatures in a fantastic or semi-fantastic world."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is a fantastic writer. He can make his words flow like he is writing music! This is the first book I'm reading of his but have heard some of his audio books. It's very humorous while being very well written. I highly recommend reading this book. If it's your first Neil book, I would suggest reading American Gods first, though its not necessary."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Let's get this out of the way at the get-go: Neil Gaiman is writing circles around 99% of modern authors. Now, I know this novel was published some 7 or 8 years ago, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more entertaining novel between now and then. Picking the book up initially, I honestly thought I would hate it. The premise, to me, sounded cliche and overdone at best. Father dies, brings two brothers together who were estranged from each other? Spice it up and make their father a God? Blech. Thankfully, I gave this novel a chance and it was so worth it.Within the first few pages, I was tickled by the humor laced in the work. The witty dialogue, the ridiculous, borderline slapstick, circumstances our Fat Charlie found himself in, and his utter embarrassment with his father's actions struck me directly in the funny bone. It was not just hilarious, it was relatable. How many of us have felt that our lives could double for a rerun of a Comedy Central movie somedays? I know I have. Especially the lower quality movies. Despite my feeling that the premise of the novel was cliche and probably something I had seen on Comedy Central before, it was presented and structured uniquely and seasoned throughout with strong themes focused of the nature of storytelling, the importance of family, and ultimately being honest with yourself in the realm of love. The plot is intelligently laid out in a weblike structure in which everything is connected in one way or another - the characters all act independently and as a result come together in ways no one could put together, and it doesn't feel forced but natural. That's something else very beautiful about this novel: the characters are strong and REAL. All the way down from the main character, Fat Charlie, to menial background characters like his mother-in-law or Maeve Livingstone, this novel showcased some of the strongest characterization of most modern reads I've encountered. By the time I was halfway through the novel, I knew each and every character inside and out, I cheered them on, loved the benevolent ones, and scowled adoringly at the more malevolent ones. The prose manages to be both beautiful and interesting, and it made this novel a real page turner that I had a very hard time putting down.All in all, I found this to be one of the most entertaining reads I've had lately. My only regret is that I waited until 8 years after it was published to read it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The book had such an intriguing description. As little information that was presented about Anansi Boys I was curious to see what this was really all about. Sadly it was not as good as I expected. I had heard this was one of Gaiman's better novels and since I enjoyed The Graveyard book I decided it was worth a shot. I found myself very interested at first waiting for the fun to begin but once Charlie and Spider became acquainted I found I was bored as they figured out who each other was.I don't have to much to say about this book other than really it only earned about 2.5 stars, but I will be fair and list it at three. I expected a more thrilling story with more action and intrigue. Instead I can say I liked it enough where I wasn't waiting for it to just end but I was actually curious as to how it would all turn out. If you are wondering if I would give this a re-read the answer is no. I have read it and it is time to move on, I don't feel I wasted my time, but was not overjoyed about it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman delivers once more. A wonderful blend of reality, mythology and fantastical dream worlds. He takes you places you forgot you once visited."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":":) I really enjoyed this book. I think the whole story line is really creative and I was glad it had a happy out come for everyone."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Was really hoping for an American Gods sequel. This is my third Gaiman book; the second being American Gods which was great. American Gods showed me what Gaiman is capable of and Anansi Boys just fell short of his abilities. It wasn't bad, just not excellent."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Gaiman manages to blend both humor and suspense in his loose sequel to American Gods. Using the familiar notion that people are often not who we think they are- even those close to us- Gaiman re-introduces Gods and magic in a suspenseful story with whimsical moments that held my interest start to finish. With a unique sibling rivalry (to say the least,) this is a story of a family unlike any you've ever encountered. The main character's attempts to settle the score with his greedy brother results in unintended, dangerous consequences, which only serves to show how revenge can backfire badly, doing far more damage than good. Well-written and with the hint that there's more to come, Anansi Boys is a worthwhile story. Also try: An Audience for Einstein and Feed."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Lenny Henry is one of the best book readers I've ever heard. When speaking for the wild party of minor characters inhabiting this story, Henry gives them beautiful Jamaican accents - and lends Anansi Boys an exotic flair and makes it almost a song. He does Fat Charlie in a flat London accent that well embraces the main character's passivity. And his voicing of Graham Coates, FC's slimy boss, hides the evil inside him until the rotten core seeps out and destroys what flimsy humanity he possessed. But his best voices are for the older women: the fiance's mother who is a tough old bird, Mrs. Dunwiddy the very elderly queen of the witches, and the pride and joy of the whole tape - Mrs. Carrie Higler toting her huge mug of coffee. Gaiman needs to do Mrs Higler justice and write a whole story based on her - and then have Lenny Henry read it. Now that would be a great Anansi story!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Nearly forgotten in today's modern world, the old gods live on. They exist in those shadowy and obscure places far from the limelight, and their power has waned, but they live on. In \\"Anansi Boys\\", Fat Charlie Nancy discovers this fact much to his surprise and discomfort. The circumstances of Fat Charlie's ordered life shift drastically and humorously as author Neil Gaiman leads us through a wild and wacky tale that teeters on the brink of what is real and what is not of this world.Fat Charlie is not at all fat, yet he cannot rid himself of the unflattering nickname his father bestowed on him. He has done all he can humanly do to distance himself from his father, an eccentric and embarrassing old man, including a move to England to put an ocean between them. Fat Charlie hasn't spoken to his father in years, but Rosie, his fianc&eacute;e, pressures Fat Charlie into inviting the much senior Nancy to their fast-approaching wedding. In his conversation with an old neighbor, Mrs. Higgler, Fat Charlie learns his father has died suddenly and unexpectedly--not to mention embarrassingly--on a karaoke stage.Fat Charlie returns to Florida to pay his last respects and bury his father, although he hadn't planned on doing quite that much shoveling. While in Florida, Fat Charlie learns the utterly unbelievable truth about his father. And the truth is that old Mr. Nancy was none other than Anansi the Trickster, a god from the beginnings of time itself. As if that news were not enough, Fat Charlie also learns that he is not, as he had always believed, his father's only son.It is only after he returns to England that Fat Charlie meets this brother, Spider, and the pleasantly drab life Fat Charlie had so carefully woven begins to unravel in an series of bizarre events that defy explanation using any known natural laws of the universe. At the forefront of all of Fat Charlie's difficulties is his carefree brother, who appears to be a magnet for mischief and mayhem. The author points to two critical forces that drive the events in Fat Charlie's life. First, \\"Human beings do not like being pushed about by gods. They may seem to, on the surface, but somewhere on the inside, underneath it all, they sense it, and they resent it.\\" And, second, there is an ancient rivalry between Anansi and Tiger -- a bitter enmity between elder gods that now centers on Fat Charlie.\\"Anansi Boys\\", Gaiman's side-splitting sequel to \\"American Gods\\", is a tale to be treasured for the author's keen wit, stinging irony, and inimitable blend of dark and whimsical humor. But be very cautious; once you've read Anansi Boys, you'll be tempted to read it again - just to be sure Anansi, the trickster god, hasn't changed the story since you closed the cover."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"If you liked American Gods you'll like Anansi Boys for different reasons. These two Neil Gaiman novels are set in the same reality --gods living as \\"ordinary\\" citizens-- but that is where the similarities end. While American Gods delivers a serious, dark tone, Anansi Boys comes across as lighter and more humorous.Charles Nancy is a loser. He meets his brother, Spider, who got all the god power between the two, and Spider takes over Charles' life. Charles' job, home and even fiance are seduced by Spider's inherent charm, but it's wrecking Charles' life.Anansi Boys can stand alone--no need to read American Gods before this one unless you want to. Much shorter and lighter in tone than its predecessor, Anansi Boys will make you laugh out loud with the crazy antics of the memorable characters. Fun reading."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"What if you found out that not only your father, but also the brother you never knew you had were actually ludicrously powerful and endlessly mischevious Gods (that's right, Gods), and your only superpower seemed to be the ability to suffer endlessly from their pranks and hijinks?To say much more would spoil this lighthearted (yet pitch black) comedic sequel to \\"American Gods\\" (though you don't need to have read the first one to enjoy \\"Anasasi\\"). Plenty of laugh out loud moments -- much fun and a quick read that I conistently found tough to put down.All in all, it's kind of a supernatural \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" with a bit of Douglas Adams & just a pinch of Python.\\"Anasasi Boys\\" would make a great movie, but only if directed by Terry Gilliam."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys was an extremely entertaining read. It is as though Anansi himself is spinning the story, with tricks and twists and turns each chapter, and a vivid descriptive style that never takes itself too seriously, as a seance-type ritual is conducted with whimsical penguin-shaped candles, \\"Fat Charlie\\" acquires a lime in the Caribbean, and mortals, gods, animals, and ghosts interact with each other left and right.Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller. Anansi Boys is an inspired novel, a real pleasure to get lost in."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Just a very well read book that sticks with you long after you read it. Wholly unique in story and plot, the characters are warm, bright, real and imaginitive. Many books tend to fade after time, but months later I can recall this book so clearly. I loaned my copy to a friend who does not read often and they loved it - found it so easy to get into yet hard to put down.Poor Neil, he works so hard and yet we devour his books sooo fast and look to him for more!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anansi Boys. It was clearly a change in tone for Gaiman, though not really in content. He retained his allusiveness, his sense of detail and plotting that made his other works so rewarding. And while I breezed through Anansi Boys much more quickly than any comparably sized chunk from American Gods or The Sandman, I don't think that reflects poorly on this novel. Gaiman has written a highly entertaining comedy."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Mr. Gaiman possesses the knack of creating multiple interesting characters from all walks of life, stringing them along on a wild journey of a fairytale, and bringing them all together for the conclusion. He is not afraid to kill off a character because even as a ghost the personality plays a great role in the story. It is a tale of a person - son of a cunning African god, to be exact - discovering his true self as he ambles through life's many stumbles. His ordinary calm life turns chaotic when the father dies and a previously unknown brother refuses to leave him be. Mr. Gaiman's language is compelling while his wit and perceptive writing entertaining. The fiction may be lengthy but each page is filled with undeniably immense happenings thus making the book a pleasurable read. The ending is a little bit sentimental but it is narrated with a nimbleness of an adept raconteur."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This was a really enjoyable book that made me remember how much I like Gaiman's books. This is a piece of urban fantasy, a la de Lint, in which gods/totems interact with humans, including one of them being the father of the protagonists, who have to deal not only with human problems, but the problems of outwitting gods/totems who all seem to have a grudge against their father. This is a delightful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Fat Charlie's embarrassing father dies, and suddenly his life-wrecking brother, Spider, crawls out of the woodwork, stealing Charlie's fianc&eacute; and getting him arrested. But that's just the beginning when Charlie realizes that his father was actually the trickster god Anansi, to whom all stories belong. Gaiman weaves a brilliant, deep and beautiful, moving and frightening tale where the gods exist right beside us, in every way possible. The stories, the truths, the truths of the stories, they are all still with us. Anansi Boys is exactly why Gaiman is one of my most beloved, favorite authors.

He is extremely talented at reading his own work and it feels like a whole troupe of readers) Unfortunately, he spends too much time writing just children's stories.Compared to other book I have listened to from this author, this was was just an ok book. It get's a little tedius and is somewhat predictable. Not on par with Neverwhere, or Stardust but worth listening to if you like his writing."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Had it not been for some of the other reviewers comments, and the love that I've had for Mr. Gaiman's other stories, I might not have gotten past the beginning of this one. It picks up a bit, and the distaste that I felt for Charlie, etc. (hard to say without spoiling), passed, but I'm still not particularly enthusiastic about this story (in great contrast to American Gods and Neverwhere). Too much of Charlie's discomfort projects; sometimes reading this feels like watching a train wreck."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is the book that made me fall in love with Neil Gaimon. When I read this, I had not yet read \\"American Gods\\", which is a prequel to Anansi Boys. Although I might have understood the world and the characters a little sooner had I read American Gods first, it really wasn't necessary, since the only character really introduced in the first book is Mr. Nancy (aka Anansi), and the book follows the story of his son after Nancy's death.The tale is masterfully spun, though a little slow in getting there. I think it took about a 100 pages until it really started to get interesting (before that it's just setting the stage, introducing these characters while you're wondering, \\"Where is this all going?\\"). Then, without revealing the plot, it gets good. REALLY good. I was totally hooked, and literally couldn't put it down. The characters are very well developed and fascinating, and the ending was just amazing. I have since read several more Neil Gaimon novels, and although all have been enjoyable, this one is my favorite by far. In general I don't re-read books once I'm finished, but for this one I may make an exception. Even as I was reading the first time, as certain things were revealed I found myself going back and reading excerpts with new understanding. Gaimon is a masterful storyteller, once who hides details in little stories that originally seem like they have little to do with the plot, but they are building blocks for things revealed later.Overall a delightful read, a memorable story that will have you thinking about it long after the last page has turned."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm not going to go all into this with an extended review, just get it and enjoy!! I have read several Gaiman books and this has been the best ride so far. What a great read!!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This was a lovely, quick read, full of Gaiman's intelligent humor and few of his darker angles. I consider this a good \\"starter Gaiman\\" story for adults. Also good for anyone with a sibling that they love and hate and don't understand and completely want to be, all at once."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Well I thought this book was just great - but I personally feel that goes without saying. I am an avid Neil Gaiman fan and he has yet to disappoint me. All of his writing is just so unique it's difficult to give him anything under a rating of 5 stars for any of his books. I was a little nervous to purchase this book as I bought it blindly without reading the sample, but I knew Neil Gaiman wouldn't let me down. I had heard from other Neil Gaiman fans that this book was their least favorite out of his books, but I strongly disagree, it may even be one of my favorites. I especially loved the little interruptions of Anansi's stories throughout the book - they brought be back to the days where my mother would read me Uncle Remus stories...but as you'll learn if you read the book, those are nothing but Anansi stories too.Also, what fantastic character and plot development. I am so dumbfounded with the ideas that pop into Neil Gaiman's head. It's almost as if he's living in a completely other world and he makes me believe that I'm in it. Something about his writing transports you to a different place where you get to know these unique people. I think I might have even developed a little literary crush on Spider. Is it possible that his wiles grasp young ladies hearts through the pages of a book as well? I wouldn't doubt it...I'm not sure if I would start with this book on my Neil Gaiman journey. I think reading American Gods before Anansi Boys was appropriate but not necessary. To those who have not yet read Neil Gaiman I typically recommend Neverwhere, but others swear by Stardust (I just haven't gotten around to it...I'm \\"saving\\" it).It was also cool that there were some \\"deleted scenes\\" at the end of the book (at least in the kindle edition). I'm always down for little tidbits from Neil.The only serious negative remark I have to say about the book is that it was difficult to put down! I'm supposed to be studying for the GRE's and reading the book took a significant amount of time away from my studies! It was certainly one of those books that when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about when I could start reading it next. I certainly caught myself reading my kindle while walking home, which is not safe or recommended living in a busy city like Boston."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Not unlike everything in life having it's ups and downs, Neil Gaiman, is right up there with the rest of us. He's capable of writing fun and interesting stories that are addictive in the sense that you want to keep the high and so you return time and again. But then something happens; It may be that the author is testing the water for new direction or may want to see just how far he can go or what he can get away with. \\"Anansi Boys\\", is one of those times for Mr. Gaiman. He began the story in typical fashion and about where I suspected he'd shift into what I call \\"wow\\" gear he did, but, instead of settling into it for a bit he shifted almost immediately into what I call \\"holy ----\\" gear. And he just kept going. I suspect the difficulty was that right moment that signifies the time to tie everything together and slow into an ending mode never made an appearance. Mr. Gaiman knows how to write and this story has direction, the characters develop nicely too. For a good part of the book I found myself involuntarily laughing and getting fun with it but then it became a bit audacious for my liking. If you enjoy really pushing the envelope sort of fantasy and magic then you'll love the \\"Anansi Boys\\"."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is a humanistic novel interwoven with deities and fantasy, which challenges the reader's belief in the archetypes of good and evil. Hysterically funny and suspenseful, Anansi Boys is a roller coaster jaunt into sibling rivalry and family dysfunction. Fat Charlie's life is turned topsy turvy, forcing him to work toward congruence and potential self-actualization."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The problem with reading Neil Gaiman books is that he has awfully big shoes to fill - namely, his own. I'm a squealing fangirl for Sandman, and I loved Neverwhere and American Gods, but was totally underwhelmed with Stardust and Coraline. Somewhere in the middle of those two emotions comes Anansi Boys.For the first, oh, fifty to sixty percent, I felt like Anasi Boys was going to be a big letdown. Then somewhere along the line, I didn't want to stop reading. It wasn't that I loved it all of a sudden, but I really wanted to find out what happened next.I have the feeling that if this book weren't written by Neil Gaiman, I'd have loved it a lot more. As it is - I enjoyed it, but I am still a bit disappointed. I think something about the characterization was just not deep enough to win my heart. And it's a shame, because I could see the shining pinnacle of story that this book wanted to be, but it just didn't reach it. It was like the skinny kid who is trying so darned hard to ring the bell at the carnival with a big hammer, but just can't get the oomph behind it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This book is my second foray into the world of Gaiman, and I am now certain I'm a HUGE fan!!\\"It begins, as most things begin, with a song. In the beginning, after all, were the words, and they came with a tune. That was how the world was made, how the void was divided, how the lands and the stars and the dreams and the little gods and the animals, how all of them came into the world. They were sung. \\"\\"Fat\\" Charlie Nancy was an unexciting man living in London in an unexciting flat, working at an unexciting job while planning an unexciting wedding with his fiance Rosie. And he was fine with that, until one day it all changed. Fat Charlie's father died in a horrible Karaoke incident, once again causing Charlie major humiliation. When he flew to Florida to the funeral, he once again met up with old neighbors and friends of the family. And Charlie found out a secret....his father wasn't just any of man. He was a God.....the human form of the trickster Anansi. And not only that.....but Charlie had a brother who inherited all the God \\"stuff\\" from good ol' Dad. All he had to do was whisper to a spider, and his brother would come. Now to Fat Charlie, this was all too much. He didn't really believe any of that nonsense. Of course, that didn't stop him from whispering to a spider one night in London after a few too many glasses of wine. From here, the quest to find out more about himself begins for Fat Charlie.What I loved so much about this book is Gaiman's sense of humor. Where American Gods was more of a serious book, this one showed his sense of humor. This definitely falls in the folklore category of the Once Upon a Time Challenge. There were a lot of stories about Anansi, the Trickster. Since ALL stories are Anansi's! Gaiman wove a tale, like that of a spiderweb. All things are tied together somehow. And when Charlie opens the Pandora's box by whispering to a spider, it's really kind of a coming-of-age story. Gaiman sucks you in immediately and all you have to do is enjoy the ride!!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"On impulse, I grabbed a copy of \\"Anansi Boys\\" at the grocery store while rolling through the magazine aisle; the cover design was colorful and clever, and I was just drawn to pluck it out. And then, when I saw that it was Gaiman (who I've been thinking about reading for some time) it just seemed like destiny. I felt vaguely ashamed for purchasing a grocery store paperback - pretty certain that I'd be disappointed and simply put the book aside as quickly as I'd bought it. Not so, not so at all!Gaiman turns out to be everything he's cracked up to be (and, frankly, even better than that), and \\"Anansi Boys\\" was about as clever and enjoyable a book as I've come across in years. The wry and informal style of the text gives an effortless feel to the prose - reading it was like riding on greased rails. But don't let that create an impression of shallow writing - to the contrary, I found nothing shallow about the book at all. The plot was complex, but not contrived, and Gaiman moves seamlessly between wit and sensuality and tender asides.All of the magic and mythology aside, this is a story of brothers, and of sons and fathers - and while not necessarily telling us anything original about such relationships, it affirms them, and affirmation is good and powerful. As I turned the final page (enjoying every word), I was left slightly uneasy - I wanted to go right out and pick up another Gaiman book. But then, could anything compare favorably to what I'd just finished? That's high praise for any novel."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"With a serious tip of the hat to the Trickster God, Neil Gaiman taps into mythology once again with his excellent take on African lore in Anansi Boys.For those who read and enjoyed the Hugo Award winning American Gods (also by Gaiman), you'll no doubt love the themes covered here.Fat Charlie is the son of Mr. Charles Nancy, a true embarrassment to his only son. He hardly works, runs around singing lame songs, and mostly ignores Fat Charlie (he also gave \\"Fat\\" Charlie his embarrassing nickname). But then Fat Charlie's father has the \\"big one\\" on a karaoke stage and passes away. Fat Charlie, who lives and works (an embarrassing job, too) in London, must fly to Florida for the funeral. It is here that he learns much more about his father than he could ever have imagined. Mr. Nancy was a God, not just a man. He was the spider God of old known as Anansi, a God who stole all the old stories from Tiger and made them his own (done, of course, through trickery). Fat Charlie doesn't believe this at first, but as an old friend continues to discuss Charlie's father's Godhood, she also drops a bomb in his lap: Charlie isn't an only child. He has a brother named (strangely enough) Spider. She tells Fat Charlie that all he has to do to meet him is to talk to a spider and ask him to send Spider to him. And one stuporously drunk night, Charlie does just that. And much to his surprise, guess who shows up on his doorstep the next day?As we work through Anansi Boys, we get to see all of the old African Gods come to life (from the Monkey God to ones that have gone extinct). We also get to see an awakening of Fat Charlie's spirit with the help of Spider and a few unusual plot twists. Most of these are hilarious takes on sibling rivalry and learning about your own inner God.Fat Charlie winds his way through this world and the next, meeting up with all manner of strange beings and gaining a bit more understanding of who his father truly was and how \\"tricky\\" he could really be.From Gods to ghosts, this is a riotously fun book to read. And something all Neil Gaiman fans will be happy to have in their collection."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Half way through reading \\"Anansi Boys\\" I wondered if the spirit of Douglas Adams had somehow taken root in part of Neil Gaiman's psyche. The book starts off fast and funny. Fat Charlie, a transplanted American in London, discovers that his recently deceased father is, or was, the African spider god know as Anansi, a trickster god on par with the Norse deity Loki. To make things more complicated, Fat Charlie discovers he has a godly brother named Spider who he mistakenly invites into his life. Once Spider and Fat Charlie meet, reality bends and the two brothers are sent down a path that will change both their lives forever.Known to some for his work in comic books, most notably the Sandman series, Neil Gaiman has also written several novels like \\"Neverwhere\\" and \\"American Gods\\" His themes tend to be similar in that he writes of hidden fantasy like worlds that exists just outside what most of us would call reality. He's also very keen on incorporating angelic or god like characters into his stories. \\"Anansi Boys\\" is no different in theme but it does add the wonderful element of humor which seems to blend seamlessly into this story. \\"Anansi Boys\\" plays like a dark comical companion to \\"American Gods\\" (another tale of mythical gods in a modern world).The only criticism I have for the book is that the ending drags slightly, in fact it seems to have several small endings, one after another, after another. This is neither good nor bad, but by the last ending I was ready to move on."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Ever since I read \\"The Monarch of the Glen\\" (found in LEGENDS II) based in the American Gods world, I've loved Gaiman as a writer. I had always known of him as a comic book writer, and had previously written him off as nothing more than that. I had always thought writers of comic books inferior to \\"real\\" writers. Why, I don't exactly know. Perhaps the American mentality of comic books being a lesser form of literature has slowly seeped into me over time. Now I know better. After I read \\"Monarch of the Glen\\" I picked up AMERICAN GODS and soon after that CORALINE, plus between those two books I read Gaiman's numerous short stories and poems in anthologies I also bought over time. What I got from these books and stories were this: Gaiman is capable of anything, whether it's erotica to children's stories, he can do it with excellence, and he has writing awards to prove just that.Anansi Boys is, in many ways, a novel that shows just how wide Gaiman's range is. It's a story of self-discovery, of brotherly-love, of earning the love of ones father, plus, to add to those more dramatic themes, it's a story of simple humor, some childhood fantasy as well as some adult fantasy, mischief and mayhem, and gods and monsters. All of this, squeezed nicely into three-hundred pages.Anansi Boys is about two brothers, one named Charlie Nancy (or Fat Charlie, as everyone else, to his chagrin, call him), the other named Spider. Fat Charlie is nervous and easily embarrassed. Spider just isn't. In fact, the only thing they truly have in common is the fact that their father is the spider god Anansi, a trickster who owns the stories of the world. So, obviously, when these two meet, bad things happen. Spider begins to steal Charlie's life from Charlie, including his fiancee and his job, and Charlie, since he's the less gifted of the two, can't do anything about it. But he finds a way, one that causes chaos and makes Charlie realize just how rash he had been, and must correct his mistakes. During this time, Charlie must avoid police, a crazy, embezzling, cliche dropping boss, and a future-mother-in-law who chooses only to hate everyone her daughter finds an interest in. And, of course, the animal gods themselves.The odd thing is that, though this book contains so much, it never gets overwhelming. Every separate element of the story is presented slowly, with enough time for you to digest before the next element comes in. In fact, the fantasy elements of the story don't come in until about one-hundred pages in, yet it maintains interest with humor as we follow Charlie around in his mundane life.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's a quick, satisfying read, one most people can take down in two or three days. It's funny enough to actually make you laugh out loud (no cliche intended). So, if you're a fan of Gaiman in any way, then pick this up. It's one of the better fantasy books of last year."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I really couldn't tell you wether my overwhelmingly positive reaction to the unabridged CD for this book is due more to Neil Gaiman's writing or Lenny Henry's performance.I read American Gods, and it was the best book I read last year. So, I know that I enjoy Gaiman's writing style. But Lenny Henry's reading is so spot on, that I can't imagine having \\"read\\" this story any other way. The voice he uses for the character of Spider is so distinctive, it's truly hard to believe that there weren't two people in the recording studio as Fat Charlie and his brother speak to each other.This was very much an experience of hearing a performance that was meant to be. Even if you've read the book, listening to the CD would be an absolute treat. Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys was widely promoted before its release as a sequel to Gaiman's novel American Gods. But it has little relation to that earlier work. Anansi does appear briefly, and some stories are told about him, both in dialogue and in the narration. However, this novel focuses principally on Fat Charlie Nancy, Anansi's mortal (and oblivious to his heritage) son.At first, the story comes across as very similar in structure to Gaiman's earlier novel, Neverwhere. Fat Charlie (like Richard from Neverwhere) is a luckless loser, who starts out the story in what is clearly the wrong job, with a girl he is clearly not meant to be with, until he finds himself drawn into an unbelievable world he never knew existed.To summarize the novel would be to give too much away, and the book really thrives on the freshness of its surprises and twists. And to summarize it wouldn't do it justice. All that ought to be said is that Fat Charlie lives a relatively safe and comfortably boring existence until his estranged and embarrassing father dies in a spectacularly embarrassing way. Returning to the United States from his home in London to put his late father's affairs in order, Fat Charlie finds his world thrown into turmoil by the twin revelation that, not only was his father a god, but that Fat Charlie has a brother he never knew about. His troubles truly begin in earnest when he casually invites Spider, his brother, into his life, and then finds he is unable to make him leave it. Spider causes havoc with Charlie's life at home and at work. Desperate to get his life back, the steps Fat Charlie takes to get rid of Spider lead to their own problems for everyone, and what follows is a high-speed adventure to control the damage, save some lives, and maybe bring Charlie out of his shell a little.Perhaps popular trend and the market right now are flooded with \\"modern fantasy\\" and Anansi Boys isn't really breaking any totally unexplored ground in that regard. But this is a genre that Gaiman himself helped to pioneer and popularize, and this novel is far from the worst of its kind. Gaiman employs the premise that the old gods walk among us, as he did in American Gods, and in this book we find that a few mortals know a little bit about it.Gaiman uses very abstract mechanics for his ideas of the nature and power of divinity. The methods are very iconic and primitive. His use of totemic or archetypical animal beings, otherworldly creatures who are simultaneously wholly human and wholly animal in appearance, is very well-described. As he writes, \\"It all depends on how you look at it.\\" The exact details of How Things Are Done (capitals for significance, of course) are loosely defined, and in the course of the storytelling, they don't really matter that much. Reality is flexible for certain people, and that's all you really need to know.The characters are mostly well-developed without being described in endless detail. For example, Gaiman never once says that Fat Charlie is black, but he describes some people as being white, such as \\"She was a white woman who...\\" It's all in how you look at it. This technique works, but a few characters could be described in more detail. We never really get into the head of Rosie, Fat Charlie's fianc&eacute;e, even though we occasionally get the narration from her point of view. Likewise, the role for Daisy, another girl with a flower name, whom Fat Charlie meets after a night on the town, is never really in doubt, and we sort of accept the inevitable, unlikely or loosely founded as it is. One could guess by their names their relative significance to Fat Charlie. Nevertheless, they, and all the other characters, take their parts in the drama in their own unique styles. There are no boring characters. The book is far too short, and flows too quickly to ever be boring.And this is the book's true strength. Gaiman's writing style is very enjoyable, and this novel fairly flies by. If a book about a spider god can be said to fly. The tale is fast-paced, and once into it, the reader is very reluctant to put it down. Gaiman's wit, humor, and storytelling skill entertain and educate, the latter with the use of the various legends of Anansi, which he tells through dialogue and narration. The tone is humorous, and almost conversational, as if this is your buddy Neil telling you a story at a party about a guy he knows.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and though I rarely reread novels, I will probably give this one another reading after a few months. It was a fun time, and the worst part about the ending was that it arrived too quickly."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm a Neil Gaiman fan; American Gods is one of my favorite novels. This book never quite reaches the scope of American Gods for me, it's still entertaining and the book itself would actually get a 4 from me, most likely.But the binding of this book, it's the best around. I'm very buggy about my books, if I'm to buy a book I can't stand reading Mass Market Paperback, I enjoy this format, of quality paperback and words that are somewhat bigger so I feel like a page doesn't take too long.So I may seem a little nutty about books, but regardless this is a great book with great style, and any Neil Gaiman, or fantasy fan for that matter, will enjoy this book.PS: American Gods is NOT a prerequisite for reading Anansi Boys. They take place in the same universe and share a character, but Anansi Boys was an idea conceived before American Gods, so you can read either one first, if you're curious."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is the story of how Fat Charlie got his chutzpah back and how Spider got Rosie. \\"Anansi Boys\\" is sweeter than its predecessor, \\"American Gods\\" but there are still a few razor blades hidden in the sticky buns.Readers who don't like fantasy because of the overworked magician/dragon theme should read \\"Anansi Boys\\" anyway--just call it a work of magical reality. Yes, there is a dragon in the book, but only for the few sentences it takes to evolve into a glorious joke.Neil Gaiman is like that. You can never predict what's going to show up on the next page. Each of his books is unique.However, if you did read \\"American Gods,\\" Fat Charlie is the son of funniest, dapperest bowler- hat-cocked-over-one-eye, seducer-of-women characters in the book. It is like being the son of a god with a Dave Barry sense of humor, and having your father pick you up after school in the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile. You are totally embarrassed in front of all of your friends. Even though you grow up, move far, far away, and acquire a cool British accent, your life is still a series of unintended pratfalls.Until your father dies, that is.Then you discover a brother you never knew, who seduces your fianc&eacute;e, takes over your apartment, alienates your boss, and ultimately gets you arrested. And your readers? They set you aside and fall in love with your brother. He seduced them the minute he walked into your life.What can you do except call a curse down upon your brother's head, even if turns out to be your head too?Reading Neil Gaiman's books is like getting tiddly on champagne: no hangover, just regret when the last bubble has been drunk."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Rather an adult version of Neil Gaiman's book.

Good stuff, looking forward to the re-read when the class starts up.Without talking about the book, per se, I'd like to take a quick second to address the \\"It's not really like American Gods\\" and \\"It's more like {insert other book name here}\\" kind of comments. It is certainly not, word for word, the same as any other of his books, or of any other books of which I am aware of. It is certainly not of the exact tone and timbre, of the exact hue and saturation, as any other book. It is, however, remarkably evident that it is done in the style of Neil Gaiman, which, considering he is the author, is a Good Thing. Apparently, the quality of authors and of books is such these days that one comes to expect formulaic sequels and series. Those can be quite fun, but one must not forget that there are at least a handful of authors producing excellent, unrelated work - or, at the least, pieces that may have bumped into each other once or twice, perhaps in a dark alley, but just as nearly as likely as in a white marble amphitheater with a silvery reflecting pool and the soft sounds of a fountain or waterfall or three."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"No need to recap what it is all about or the other things that Neil has managed to crank out these past few years as the others have already done an outstanding job at doing that.The book takes you out to the edges of a giant spider web and slowly draws you in as the characters run about and find themselves drawn to the center, the heart of the thing if you will.The characters are very well developed and done so with a minimum amount of words used to do so. The story goes from sad to outrageous to absolutely adorable in less than 400 pages.Take a step into another world that is not quite like our own where mortals, gods, and other things live, play, and sometimes compete.

Anansi Boys is no different. It is the myth-making of Neil Gaiman that I love the most. He taps into the deepest fears and dreams of human beings. In this case, it is the story of brothers, of fathers and sons - and of finding oneself in the process. And it is a story of telling stories, of how stories shape us and reality. I have always loved the story of Anansi. Here, Gaiman brings Anansi back to us in glorious form - trickster, lover, storyteller, and survivor. If you like this book, you should read American Gods, Neverwhere, and the Sandman series."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"In Anansi Boys, Neil Gaiman has sung us a terrific tale. It dips into his enormous stockpile of myth and folktale--in this case, African Anansi lore, with a nod to god-tales and creation myths of all stripe--and blooms with imagination and humor.Fat Charlie Nancy, a well-meaning young bumbler living in London, flies back to his native Florida for the funeral of his father, a charming old Island-born drifter and erstwhile Karaoke singer who also, unbeknown to his son, happened to be a minor god. There, through a network of old crone former neighbors, Charlie discovers that he has a brother. All he has to do to meet him, after a lifetime apart, is \\"ask a spider.\\" What happens when he does, and how he nearly ruins his life in the process and must set about to right his world, is the stuff of a classic \\"trickster\\" quest, updated into an engaging, exciting and very entertaining novel.This book hit all the marks I so relished in Gaiman's illustrated novels. His gods are deliciously human, and while he doesn't shy away from necessary violence, he treats his characters kindly and his readers with respect. I found myself laughing aloud at several points, and when I put the book down for the last time, I felt a little lighter, a little more care-free, a little more able to contend with the craziness of reality.Thanks, Mr. Gaiman--and a tip of the old cheeroot-stained fedora to your ability to spin a story.Susan O'NeillAuthor, Don't Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Viet Nam"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"In \`Anansi Boys', master storyteller Neil Gaiman weaves a story where the mundane meets the fantastic in explosive and modern manner. Steeped in African folklore, magic, and pure comedy, Gaiman's new story that is a sequel of sorts to the huge hit \`American Gods' is as equally entertaining as it is weird. While not a grand, sweeping fantasy, \`Anansi Boys' is surrealism at its finest that manages to entertain the reader long enough for them to appreciate Gaiman's talent that is so evident in the story's pages.\`Fat' Charlie Nancy lives a life of perfect boringness in London, with his content fianc&eacute;e Rosie. But, when the father Charlie barely knew suddenly drops dead on a karaoke stage, Fat Charlie's life suddenly starts to go downhill. First, the brother Fat Charlie never knew, Spider, shows up on his doorstep, and he's the complete opposite of Fat Charlie; confident, charming, and smooth with the opposite sex. It turns out that Fat Charlie's father was a god, Anansi, the African trickster god at that, and Spider has inherited some of their father's godly abilities. With these abilities, Spider somehow steals Fat Charlie's fianc&eacute;e, gets Fat Charlie fired from his job, and even manages to present Fat Charlie as the main suspect for a fraud and embezzlement crime. Fat Charlie goes to desperate measures, using magic to get rid of his brother, and suddenly everything goes from bad to worse for everybody, including Fat Charlie.The story is an odd one. You can tell Neil Gaiman marches to the beat of his own creative drum. Character descriptions don't came till fifty pages after you meet the character, odd interludes from the story regarding an Anansi fable are planted every here and there, and Gaiman even refers to himself every now and then. But the story is so entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny that you can't help but be amused. Fat Charlie's attempts to return his life to the perfect boringness he once knew is so endearing and is the core of the story that you root for him as he tries to deal with his quirky relatives; a situation that anyone can relate to. It is with this familiarity that makes the story relatable to all readers, but it is the mythology that makes the story so unique. Tales of African folklore and African gods run deep through the story, and whenever Fat Charlie visits the Beginning of the World where the gods reside, it is like a journey into one of Dali's many Surrealist paintings. Gaiman is so crafty and so imaginative with his imagery and words that magic seems to jump off the page and into the reader's very imagination that you can't help but marvel at his talent.\`Anansi Boys' is not a blockbuster of a novel, but it is very entertaining and endearing. Any reader will fall for Gaiman's wonderful and relatable characters, sense of magic and total disregard for order and what limits the imagination. Surrealism at its best, \`Anansi Boys' is not to be missed and highly recommended adult fantasy."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I haven't seen a reviewer discuss the unabridged CD with voice actor Lenny Henry as the reader. Henry adds so much to the pleasure of this work: his voice is smooth and melodic when voicing Spider and baffled and wounded as Fat Charlie. Henry handles the women's voices beautifully changing from confused Brits to singsong islanders and the gods are all distinct and ferocious in their own right. I especially loved the voice he gave Fat Charlie's overbearing, unctious boss, Graham -- what a hoot! Even if you've read the book, Henry's vocal talents will make it seem new and if you haven't read the book, try this CD first and I know you will fall in love with this talented reader and wonderful words given to him."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is the first book by Neil Gaiman I've ever read. He was talked about on a blog I frequent called 'Smart Bitches, Trashy Novels' and I decided to give him a try. Why not? I've been on a disappointing streak reading romance novels, time to try something different. I have to say, I am the most critical reader in the world. I thought East of Eden needed more development, I am that critical! No, really. But I enjoyed Anansi Boys. Not that I see NG up there with Steinbeck, we'll see. I wasn't sure at first if I would. I found the writing style stuck me as a little to low key, subdued. And I was having some trouble with Fat Charlie - what was his problem? But I did relate to how self-conscious he was, how unaware. And I found the mythic concept intriguing. So I plodded on and found myself drawn in and liking it. This book was well-written, well-researched, imaginative. It was funny and original. I was sorry to see it end and it's been a while since I've felt that way about a book. My one quip (well, I said I was critical!) was that he promised terror to come, more than once, and I didn't get any terror at all. But I did get other things so I'll let it go. Good Book. I'll read American Gods soon...Good Neil"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi is Coyote's African brother, a trickster who is also creator. Anansi Boys lives up to its mythological task, but like all true myths, it is also about love and life and healing in the here and now. Its enchantment and delight are so irresistable that this novel might just heal the reader as well."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The world of fantasy can take us on many different adventures. We might expect things like magic wands, mythical creatures, and a journey full of dangers. But readers will not expect anything like Anansi Boys.In Neil Gaiman's dark fantasy, we follow the life of Fat Charlie Nancy in London, whose is about to change. It starts when we learn about Charlie's life, which includes his rough relationship with his misunderstood father, his anxiety over his engagement with his beloved Rosie, and other worries in his life. Next, he learns that his father unexpectedly dies while singing on a karaoke stage in Florida. Then, Charlie is shocked to find out at his father's funeral that his dad was a real-life god known as Anansi. To top it all off, he learns that he has a brother whose name is Spider, whom he meets on the doorstep of his home. Shortly after, they get acquainted with each other at a bar, and then Charlie's life takes a dark turn.This book is one exhilarating thrill ride. It manages to blend fantasy with touches of thriller, horror, and occasional humor. The minute I started reading this book, I was already interested in the characters and the story. To me, it's more of a thriller than a fantasy. What readers will like about Anansi Boys is the mind-bending journey of Fat Charlie and Spider and the moments of unexpected frights. Anyone who is looking for a ride on a thriller fantasy will very much enjoy Anansi Boys."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"A fantastic book, one of those you don't want to finish because it's so entertaining.

Characters are interesting, plot is funny and all the events tie in brilliantly. Must read."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"For a large portion of this book, I was thinking \\"It's enjoyable. It's sort of like a less engaging American Gods.\\"Because I do that sort of thing in my head--build descriptions of what I'm reading or listening to or watching by creating one of those pastiches made entirely of clippings from magazines. Anyway.It was enjoyable, and once we got past the rocky part at the beginning where our protagonist was foisting his power and agency off on anybody walking past and I nearly tossed the book aside, I was liking it and looking forward to what came next. I was worried that I could see what was coming, and to some extent I was right. But for the important things, I was delightfully wrong. And the last couple of chapters, from Fat Charlie's big number on I'd say, were lovely. Which is nice, because endings can be a real bear.So there you have it--four wags from Uncle Coyote."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Normally I don't like spiders. They're creepy and they always show up at the wrong time and in the wrong places. This book is as much about spiders as it is about stories and the web of events that make up everyone's lives. It's also a story about 2 brothers who are more alike than they realize at first but at the same time are very different. Most of the book is about their conflict with each other and how one brother wants the other out of his life after only having met him for the first time as an adult. The book has magic in it (if you believe that sort of thing). If you love stories simply for being what they are then the premise of this book will resonate with you. In between the various events that unfold like a web is the story of Anansi the spider. An African folklore figure who did amazing things and was always very clever. The personality of that character is conveyed though the main characters and how they each deal with things that are bigger than themselves.I suggest this book to anyone who loves stories and appreciates the little ways in which the things we do affect everything else."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Absolutely loved this book.

It started off kind of meh for me, but then I suddenly found myself wanting to keep reading to find out what would happen next. I tend to really enjoy books where actual mythology is weaved into the story and Neil Gaiman does great with this. He throws in some of the actual stories of Anansi, the African spider/trickster god. That was a nice little touch to the story.

My daughter (who recommended the book to me) warned me that Anansi referred to the REAL Anansi. What, this is a book about Anansi legends and stories that I read to her as a little girl? Well, yes and no. The stories are in here, and they are arranged and introduced so masterfully that the plot requires them. These Anansi stories are not filler! Best of all, the book begins with characters that are more real than those produced by many fiction writers. In the library, this book is labeled \\"Sci-Fic/Fantasy.\\" It certainly isn't science fiction, and I looked at it more as an adventure yarn than traditional fantasy. If you put Carlos Castaneda and Dick Francis in a room together and forced them to collaborate on a book, this would be the result.This would have been an excellent book to listen to as a \\"book on CD.\\" If you've got a long trip planned, consider the Anansi Boys as potential company. It has a quick pace, colorful characters, surprising twists and turns in the plot, and... well, if I said any more, I'd start giving away the plot. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is a triumph. Sophisticated, urbane, and mythologic, this tall tale is a delicious read. Redolent of the American South and the Caribbean, Neil Gaiman's dark humor carries the reader from start to finish, and sprightly asks us to examine the duality of our core nature.Fat Charlie lives a semi-reclusive life of underachievement, fear, and self-loathing in London, unaware that his father is Anansi, the Trickster God. To Fat Charlie, his dad has always been a source of social embarrassment. When the flamboyant father suddenly dies (pitching off a karaoke stage face first into the bosom of a young woman), Fat Charlie is sent sideways into a spirit journey that brings him to his incorrigible brother, witchy-poo aunties, and a netherworld that is neither good nor bad, but is what you make it. Criss-crossing the Atlantic, the story is non-stop snorting fun; fun that is, that carries a good message: embrace who you are: there is a piece of God in you, whether you feel separated from it or not.The imagery is fantastic. Anansi's animal symbol is the spider, and Gaiman expertly weaves arachnid symbology throughout. Guaranteed: after reading this book you will find yourself talking to the little eight-legged creatures in your home and sending them off to do your bidding."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Fat Charlie's father just died. Even in a normal family, the death of your father leads to all sorts of changes in your life. When your father (unbeknownst to you) was the African trickster god Anansi, these changes can be overwhelmingly strange. Fat Charlie meets his brother Spider for the first time, and in the process loses his job, his fiancee, and very nearly his life and sanity. In the end he regains an even better version of his life, and he learns who and what he really is.I loved this book. It was everything cool about American Gods and more. It was funnier and the characters felt more real, and at the same time more fantastic."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I just finished reading this book, which I picked up on Sunday along with Pratchett's newest novel. Gaiman really lets his whimsy run free in this one, which may be off-putting to fans of his last novel, the brooding but often listless American Gods. This latest work uses the same principal myth of American Gods (that all the old gods of cultures from the past live and interact with everyday humans) but puts a much more lighthearted spin on it. Where American Gods was rooted in the Sturm und Drang of Norse Mythology, Anansi Boys takes the sometimes careless, sometimes cruel, but always lighthearted mythology of Anansi the Spider to frame its tale. Clear influences can be seen in the silly yet clever similies Gaiman uses throughout the book, as well as the improbable and almost too-cute situations the characters encounter.This novel runs at a reckless, almost manic pace from character to character and place to place, never bogging down in meticulae but describing large amounts of details in terse yet witty and strangely accurate passages. It's definitely a one- or two-sitting readthrough that will keep you up well past your bedtime.Gaiman's work seems to fall into two camps: the brooding, mysterious mythology seen in Sandman, Neverwhere, and American Gods and the whimsical but subtly dangerous fairyland seen in Good Omens, Stardust, and now Anansi Boys. I enjoy both equally and hope to see many more original, entertaining, and magical works by one of the best young authors in the business."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"this novel is a spin off from gaiman's american gods novel using mr. nancy's character and his family. i purchased this novel the day it was released off amazon.com and it was worth every penny. gaiman does a wonderful job of developing characters and putting you inside their thoughts. you feel for them, even the villians, you understand their reasons behind their actions. fat charlie, the lead character is sent to hell and back, and emerges like a butterfly from a cocoon. which is a horrid cliche\` and does not do this novel justice. if you are a fan of gaiman, it is a must have, if you are a reader of fine writing its a defintely a must have."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Great imagination, using reality and mithology in a very interesting way.

You forget it's a fantasy story after a couple of pages and you find yourself sucked into a new world. Charlie Nancy, Fat Nancy, is a fairly normal man living in South London, engaged to be married to Rosie. So far nothing strikes us as peculiar, does it? We are introduced to his childhood and the continuous embarrassments caused him by his father when living in Florida. His father used to be a quite charming man. No one could resist him and the day he died, Fat Charlie not only had to fly back to a place that wasn't home anymore, but he also had to deal with a weird inheritance he didn't quite expect. A brother, Spider, who apparently inherited all their father's magic. Fat Charlie will discover his father's true nature, that of a god, Anansi: The spider god. He will learn how his father managed to bother quite a lot of other gods through the ages. But the biggest problem will be his brother, who will gradually steal his fiancee, get him in trouble with the law and make his whole existence miserable. With the help of three old ladies, some kind of witches, Fat Charlie will try to get rid of Spider, but he will somehow just mess things up for both of them. So if you want to know whether the Anansi's bloodline is going to survive all this mess, you will have to read this brilliant story."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Like most of Gaiman's stories, the idea behind, and prose of, this book is awe-inspiring. It's rich, enthralling, funny, and, at times, infuriating. The characters are fantastically constructed, both literally and figuratively, and the stories about Anansi's troublemaking add a dark, enriching, mythic quality to the book. The only thing that I don't understand, the one thing that keeps nagging at me (what has kept me from giving the story a five-star review), is that Fat Charlie, the protagonist, is such a pushover--I mean, he really needs to grow a pair. And even though there is some eventual confrontation, it's not as satisfying as it could be. Sure, it all comes out in the wash, but I wish Fat Charlie would use those big fists of his to knock some heads in. Still, this is a great book and worth twice the price.That said, if you don't like stories about gods, demigods, hateful humans, and/or spiders, then this might not be for you. Also, if you've read American Gods, then you'll love this. Personally, I liked this book better."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite fantasy writers, and ANANSI BOYS didn't disappoint me. This is a very entertaining novel.ANANSI BOYS is a very funny and original story about a man named Fat Charlie, who suddenly learns that he is the son of the trickster God Anansi. Fat Charlie also discovers that he has a long lost brother name Spider, who has decided to re-enter his life and turn it upside down.Gaiman has a lovely writing style that incorporates a lot of gentle, whimsical humor. It's hard to describe, but it makes his novels a pleasure to read. This is a comic novel, so many of the characters border on caricature, but Gaiman does a good job of making them human and believable for the most part.I wouldn't say ANANSI BOYS is a great Gaiman novel -- I think NEVERWHERE, STARDUST, AND CORALINE are better works -- but it's a very good one and I had a lot fun reading it. Highly recommended for fans of comedic fantasy."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Gaiman hits a home run! Lenny Henry does an excellent job reading. When I read American Gods, I was mildly impressed. This book leaves me wanting more and more from Gaiman. I will also be on the look out for more from Lenny Henry."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman's novel \\"American Gods\\" was epic in scope, telling the story of a massive conflict between gods old and new, homegrown and carried from old countries, in which nothing was what it seemed. \\"Anansi Boys\\" is nothing like that - or is it?Set sometime in the same world as \\"American Gods\\", \\"Anansi Boys\\" tells the story of everyday loser Charles \\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy, who learns only upon the death of his supremely embarrassing father that the old man was in fact the trickster god Anansi. Oh, and Fat Charlie has a brother too, Spider - the one who got all the cool, all the daring, all the self-confidence that Charlie has grown up without. It's when Fat Charlie takes the advice of an old wise-woman who knew his father and tells a spider to find his brother that everything starts to change...\\"Anansi Boys\\" takes a totally different slant on the world that \\"American Gods\\" opened up, and does it charmingly and effectively. Instead of smoothly consorting with all-powerful gods, Fat Charlie muddles through his education in the ways of belonging to a divine family, and more often than not screws it up. But his very humanity is, in contrast to his brother's assumption of divine capability, what pulls him through. In the end, the Anansi boys discover a lot more about what each of them is and wants than you think is possible at the beginning of the novel, and the evolutions they go through to realize these things are believable, funny and a little sad.I suspect Neil Gaiman had a lot of fun writing this book - it has its dark moments, but on the whole it's as light-hearted a work as he's written (excepting \\"Good Omens\\", and I think Terry Pratchett had something to do with that...)"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I definitely enjoyed the book. Gaiman is funny and unpredictable, but still ties up the loose ends, which I appreciate. This is a good story of a very unusual father and two very unusual sons, and how they all manage to relate to each other."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is an excellent book by Neil Gaiman. A very interesting and funny story about gods (from folklore of various cultures). My wife and I listened to the audio book and found ourselves mesmerized and laughing out loud often. I highly recommend this book to scifi and fanatasy readers (even though there is no science in this fiction :-) You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"On its surface, Gaiman has written a compelling story of a young man's introduction to the world of fantasy--in this case, several worlds, actually--as he comes to terms with the fact that his father was a god (albeit, a minor god), and that he has a long lost brother (Spider), who (Charlie is told) inherited all of their father's power. Charlie, the central character, embarks on a journey to discover his past, motivated by his desire to straighten out the mess he creates when he invites his demi-god brother into his rather mundane middle class life, following the death of his father. As the plot pulls us along, Charlie discovers that he too has god like powers, and struggles coming to terms with himself, his brother, his love life, and his lifelong bitterness towards his now deceased father.However, Gaiman has also written a book about writing. As Charlie (and we, the readers) learn, central to the god like powers of Charlie's father and brother is the power of the story. As Charlie's brother puts it, his magic consists of bending realty--not much, just a little around the edges. And after all, isn't that what novelists do--bend reality a little around the edges to make their stories more real than reality? Novelists create an entirely new world, with obvious connections to our physical world, but also completely separate.He who controls the story, controls the world. Charlie's father understood this well--he controlled the story of his entire family, and all he met. Spider, Charlie's brother, uses the power of the story in an entirely selfish way--to bring himself pleasure--until he realizes that when he actually cares about someone, it is much harder to bend reality, without destroying the very thing you care about. In other words, he matures as he realizes that the world does not revolve around his pleasure and entertainment, but is instead made up of other people, each of whom has his (or in this case, her) own equally valid needs and desires.Of course, on a different level Gaiman controls the story--not only for his characters, but for the reader as well. He therefore exercises even more powerful magic than either Spider or his father.This is the same thing that King has been writing about in most of his recent books--at least since Needful Things. Gaiman uses the form of fantasy, while King uses the form of horror, but both authors are really writing about writing--and doing it very, very well.Enjoy. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is an interesting novel that Gaiman has produced. It is a story of gods based on African parables. The protagonist is an Anansi Boy. The Anansi is a spider trickster god of whom all stories are about. Fat Charlie, the main character, finds out that his father is dead and that he has a brother he has never met. Fat Charlie is about as boring a person their ever was. His brother on the other hand is a god who drums up rock star status where ever he goes.Fat Charlies brother comes to live with him for a short time in London and destroys Charlies life. Charlie decides to try and rid his brother from his life and this is where the story takes focus.Gaiman, when he is writing well, is one of the more interesting authors out there. His stories have many asides. By this I mean that his narratives go off on tangents, you will find many stories within stories. This really pulls the tale along in an amusing fashion.One thing that I have against this book, is the overall plot. It feels kind of strained and is a little unclear. Sort of like Gaimans earlier \\"Fairy\\". Its kind of hard to describe exactly what is wrong here, because all the components are in order for a first rate book. But I have to say that I was finding this a little long in the tooth by the end. The story gets a little weary. Gaiman seems to have hurried to finish the story where as he seems to have really enjoyed writing the first half.All in all, this is a decent tale. Not great. If you like Gaiman, I think that you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Let me say at the outset that Lenny Henry does a marvelous job as the narrator. His English accent is delightful, his voice loud and clear, the impersonation of the different characters a delight as well. I always find a bit awkward male narrators' imitations of women's voices, but this is not a big deal. Overall, I think this is a bright audio version of a good but not great book. I definitely enjoyed much more some other of Gaiman's stories (for instance Coraline, and especially the first of the \\"Two Plays for Voices\\", which is pure genius). The characters are funny, but I didn't find any of them particularly lovable. I did not care too much about what would happen to them one way or another. There are a few moment of great story-telling in this book, but not many. Overall, definitely worth listening to (even if it's very long), but I don't think I will listen to it again at least for a very long while."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I was first introduced to Neil Gaiman in the book \\"Good Omens\\" which he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett. I loved the book and was immediately intrigued by this author. However, though I loved the story of the second Gaiman novel I read, \\"American Gods,\\" I was slightly turned off by the mean-spirited nature of the book.Anansi Boys is a return to the lighter side of Gaiman that I first read in \\"Good Omens.\\" The story is brilliant and funny, even when things get dark. I would definatley recommend this book to fans of Gaiman as it is one of the better books I have read lately.On a small side not, my one issue with the book, an issue that reflects solely on me rather than the author, was my lack of knowledge regarding African mythology. While I wouldn't like to see the book changed, it would be great to see similar stories in the future that feature more well-known mythological characters (yes, \\"American Gods\\" is a pantheon of myth, but I am talking about stories in the light-hearted vein of \\"Anansi Boys\\")."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Since there are already many reviews about the actual storyline and characters, I'll focus this on what I thought about the writing and style of the novel. In short, I really, really liked it. Although I had been a big bookworm as a child, I have not read very much fiction as an adult because I did not find many books I really enjoyed. This book has sparked my interest again. I bought it on a Friday afternoon and kept reading until I finished it around midnight of the next day. This might stand out as one of my favorite books.The story was well-thought out and paced at a good speed. There are plenty of twists and turns, but not so many that it becomes confusing. And even the supporting characters are for the most part life-like and interesting. It's not all perfect, of course. There were some moments where I thought the reactions of the characters were a bit too flat and unrealistic when they encounter the magic that occurs at times, at least enough to stop and ask \\"Huh, what? Why?\\". But thankfully these are few and far between enough to not ruin the story or attachment to the characters. And best of all, it fits my ironic, hectic style of humor, and had many parts that I felt I even could relate to if I was in the characters' shoes.As a suggestion, I could see this book as a good gift to teenage readers. This was the first piece of work from Niel Gaimon that I'd read, and because of it I went on to read American Gods, which was his first book in this same \\"world\\". I didn't enjoy that one as much, but I would still recommend it for mature adult readers."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I purchased this audiobook via Audible two years ago on the recommendation of some friends, and I'm not quite sure why it took me so long to read. Maybe because it's not Young Adult or Middle Grade, and so much of my reading falls in those categories? Still, the majority of my audiobooks are adult, and after listening to bits and pieces of about five other audiobooks in my library, I finally skimmed down the list until I came to this one and remembered I never listened to it.ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman (HarperTorch, September 26, 2006)As for the book, here are five reasons you will love ANANSI BOYS:1) You, like me, are a mythology buff, and even though you think you mostly like Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, you will be fascinated by the god Anansi and his trickster ways. I want to say one more thing about this. So many times when I read about less well-known mythologies, I find them vague and hard to grasp since I have not grown up with the stories. Not the case with ANANSI BOYS. The mythology is present yet so fun and perfectly easy to understand.2) You don't always like to predict the endings of books after the first fifty pages. Seriously, I loved the ending of this book. Yes, it was happy and so many strings were tied neatly. Just not in ways would have thought.3) You like when even minor characters who are introduced have some important role in the story.4) I'm telling you this book is seriously worth checking out. The humor is laugh-out-loud funny, the plotting is clever, and you're looking for something a bit different to read.5) You think Neil Gaiman is brilliant.As for the audiobook rating, this one kept my interest completely. I mentioned I'd listened to bits and pieces of maybe five other books from my library, and seeing as how I now have something like 500 titles in my audiobook library, I can be choosy in what I settle upon reading. ANANSI BOYS started out strong, with a great narrator, and entertained me throughout.Overall, highly recommended for fans of Neil Gaiman, fans of mythology, and fans of fantasy. Since it is technically an adult book, I'd say high school and up.Source of book: Purchased"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Right from the start Mr. Gaiman nail it. A fast, humurous and dark ride he presents in this novel. Fat Charlie, Rosie, Grahame Coats, Spider and Mr. Nancy, all characters that will haunt you and most probably make you smile when you are not reading the book. No mistake. Mr. Gaiman did it again, great book!!!"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"ANANSI BOYSNeil Gaiman has created a wonderful tale about Gods. One may begin to think that this will become a staple of Mr. Gaimans writing when considering his previous book \`American Gods'. Anansi Boys is not to be mistaken for the much darker novel previously mentioned. This book is light, witty and tame in comparison.The guest who wouldn't leave, the mischievous brother who causes what else; mischief, the embarrassing but lovable father, the nosey cruel neighbor, these real life situations add to color this story. I found myself nodding and smiling at poor Fat Charlie's dilemma.The crux of the story is the story. Anansi the spider God stole all the stories from tiger and made them his own. Tiger wants the stories back and will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.This is truly a terrific tale.4 1/2 STAR RATING."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman was born 3000 years past his time. There was a point in history when people dug deep down into themselves and pull out a story so fantastic that people begged for its telling every night. These imagineers were a rare breed, and the best stories even rarer. Apparently, Neil is a reincarnation, or at least a medium, of such a dreamer. All of his stories are so original, so unpredictable, and so memorable that I continue to think about them long after the book has been read. Few books tickle my imagination and haunt my memory like Gaiman novels.Anansi Boys is not like any other book, not even like another Gaiman novel. You can tell it was written by Gaiman, but it is not comparable to anything else--it stands alone. The story made me laugh out loud, squirm in discomfort, and gasp in delighted suprise. It'll twist on you, it'll trick you, but you won't let go until \\"The End\\".By the way, I also listened to it on CD from my library, and that is an experience in itself. Henry Lenny's bass voice and masterful dynamics made a long drive seem shorter, and really brought out the sexiness of Spider and the humor embedded in the story."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"A wonderful book full of great humor, improbable characters and an engaging rhythm and pace. The narrative moved fluidly between the world of man, animals, ghosts and gods. It introduced me to a new culture of story telling."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman's Anansi Boys has been pegged by some as a sequel to his Hugo-winning American Gods. It's not, really, though it shares some characters with the earlier novel. But that's about it. Anansi Boys carries a considerably lighter tone. It's not that it's played for laughs, just that Gaiman's approaching his subject with a bit more humor. It's a trickster story. It's the story of a person reconnecting with his heritage. It's somewhat similar to Christopher Moore's Coyote Blue, but of course Gaiman does his own thing with it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"While not actually a sequel to American Gods, and while very different from it in its tone, Anansi Boys shares a common character with that novel -- Mr. Nancy, the modern face of the ancient African spider-god, Anansi.Anansi Boys is an entertaining, clever, and often very funny novel about how ancient mythology can bleed into the \\"real\\" modern world much more easily that we are usually inclined to think. Alternating between a drab and rainy England and the vibrant and steamy Caribbean for its setting, the novel's two main characters, Fat Charlie Nancy and his brother Spider represent similar opposites. And of course, there's always a girl -- in this case, two: Rosie and Daisy (both flowers). :)The novel is full of imaginative scenes, clever turns of phrase (look for \\"nook / cranny\\" and \\"gruntled\\", just two of many examples), and a genuinely poignant message about family. Highly enjoyable! As I said, it's different in tone and scope from American Gods -- it \\"feels\\" lighter -- but it's no less satisfying. You can think of Anansi Boys as just one of the possible satellite stories from that larger, more ambitious novel. Let's hope Mr. Gaiman has more like it up his sleeve."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This story opens with Charlie. He lives a very ordinary, somewhat dull life in England. He travels home to Florida to his father's funeral. While there he is told that his father was not an ordinary human, but the human form of an Anansi (an African Trickster God). Charlie doesn't believe it. While there he is also told that he has a brother named Spider. Charlie is shocked as he believed he was an only child. He is told that if he is ever in trouble and needs his brother's help that all he has to do is tell a spider. He is warned, however, not to do so since the consequences could disrupt things for him.Back in England, he feels some despair as well as a desire to meet his brother. So he sees a spider and whispers to it to tell his brother Spider to come to him. From the moment his brother arrives, his life is turned completely upside-down. Spider seems to bring nothing but trouble into Charlie's life. To tell more would ruin the story for you.This was my first Neil Gaiman story and it won't be my last! This unabridged audio of his novel \\"The Anansi Boys\\" was very well narrated and the story was so good that I often stayed in the car to listen to more of the story after already arriving at my destination. Now that I've enjoyed the audio version so much I plan to buy the book. I highly recommend this fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is a marvelous example of how to take something classic, and infuse it with just enough of a twist to make it modern and exciting. Gaiman uses many of the themes that readers with even a casual familiarity with mythology will recognize; like the power of love to change a life, the effect of family on one's existence, and the need to undergo a quest in order to embrace one's destiny. Instead of simply rehashing those themes, he infuses them with both a strong narrative and characters that are whimsical, yet memorable. The result is a book that is both familiar and new. Anansi Boys is further proof that Gaiman's reputation as the best current \\"re-interpreter\\" of myths is well deserved."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"you know, when you reach the end of a good book, there's a certain sadness-- a bittersweet sadness like you've just lived through something amazing and dangerous with people you didn't know a week ago and now they're all going off without you-- a feeling of 'oh, it's here. i knew it would come but i was really hoping it wouldn't'. it's a feeling you have to sit in, to suffer through the way you suffer through something very good but very trying, something you have to let sit on your tongue and settle into the spaces in your brain, to shift around and find out where all the new pieces of you go as you metabolize this book and it merges with all the things you brought with you when you started it. as it becomes something you'll bring with you when you go to read the next book. anansi boys is one of these books, full of beauty and violence and life and myths and stories and spiders and wonder and the weight of reality. it leaves a mark, but not the kind you'll rub at to get rid of-- the kind you'll start arranging your clothes so it doesn't get covered up, the kind you'll tattoo around so it isn't forgotten. that kind of mark, that kind of book."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"...i can honestly say that Anansi Boys was one thrilling adventure to experience. A day or so before reading this novel, I'd just completed Gaiman's book of short fiction, a book called Smoke & Mirrors, which was so incredibly good that, naturally, it made me wish to see more of what the author was capable of creating. The tales in that book were so imaginative, so light, so dark, so brilliant, that i just had to make another forray into the worlds of imagination that Gaiman is very capable of of weaving. And I made no mistake about wanting to do this. The characters within this novel are very believable, very three dimensional ink and paper people. The story is pretty simple, but Gaiman makes the simple complex, and very intertaining. I won't go into detail, but for those of you who had sort of embarrassing parents or guardians while growing up, well, this book will make you laugh...and it will make you think, too. The supernatural aspects of the book are present, which I love, but they aren't overwhelming at all, an area where a lot of fantasy writers tend to go overboard as far as I'm concerned. If it is something that is called for, that is to say, if the book is complete Fantasy, then, well, good. But if it is not, in my opinion, well, I am not a professional writer, but it must be a hard feat to pull off. The magic never comes before the story, the plot, which is something that Gaiman is brilliant at. And it was very refreshing to see that the main characters within this novel are black. I am a young black man, and I read quite a bit, and it is good to see that there are people like me within such fantastic worlds. English authors tend to not care very much about what race their main characters are, and I love that about them. American writers have a lot to learn when it comes to character diversity within fiction. There isn't enough good that I can say about this novel, so i will merely say that reading this book would be a very worthwhile thing to do to those who have yet to experience the Magic that is Reading Gaiman.Hawksmoor...From The Bleed."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Charlie Nancy's father ruined his life. And he goes on ruining it even in death-dropping dead on a karaoke stage in Florida, forcing Charlie to go home, leaving his London refuge from his embarrassing parent to attend the funeral-right before his wedding. And even in death, he keeps giving Charlie embarrassing gifts, like the handsome stranger who turns up on his doorstep, once he's back in London, claiming to be Charlie's brother, Spider. In short order, Charlie's life is reduced to utter havoc-he's fired from his job, arrested for embezzlement, his fianc&eacute;e is spending an awful lot of time with Spider, and Charlie has to go back to Florida and take a journey through the spirit world if he's ever going to get control of his life again. Not to mention having to defeat Tiger and prevent all the stories in the world being turned into brutal, hopeless Tiger stories...With Gaiman, as with Gene Wolfe and John Wright, it's not so much the story as how it's told-you go along for the ride and see where it takes you. Except for the marvelous command of the language, though, he's not really anything like them-his stories are much wilder and crazier, and even harder to predict. Partly this is because he's drawing on different mythologies-African and Native American, where Wolfe and Wright draw more on classical and northern European sources-but, mostly, I think that he's just a wilder and crazier guy.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I can find few flaws with this book, aside from typographical errors which really should have been caught. Gaiman's wit makes this story a treasure for mythology buffs, who doubtless read American Gods and loved it.This book was exquisite, yet somehow light and fluffy at the same time. Like a well-baked cobbler, there are layers to explore, and, also like a well-baked cobbler, it's quite a treat."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Neil Gaiman wears many hats. He wrote the stunningly devised Sandman graphic novel series. He has dabbled in the film world, most recently with the beautiful and mesmerizing Mirrormask. And he has won awards for his written work, both in adult science fiction/fantasy and in his books for children. He is an artist so inventive and worldly that his product often cannot be categorized easily. In fact, the kudos displayed on the back of his recent book, ANANSI BOYS, brings high praise from authors whose realms Gaiman frequents but never stays in --- Susanna Clarke (fiction/fantasy), Christopher Moore (humorous fiction), and Peter Straub (horror). It is this cross-section of the literature world that easily exemplifies what you will find within the covers of this eagerly awaited new novel.While Gaiman has produced a string of quality work, it was 1991's AMERICAN GODS that blew away critics and readers worldwide. Now he has returned to the universe of AMERICAN GODS yet spins a tale that is not a clear sequel but more of a snippet of a life plucked and set on its own stage. And it certainly produces.Mr. Nancy is Fat Charlie's dad. He is also the African trickster god, Anansi. When Mr. Nancy dies, estranged Charlie flies to Florida to pay his respects, having never known that his father was more than just an annoying man with the ability to make his life miserable. Things go wrong, as they always do for Charlie, and after learning of his father's otherworldly power, he also discovers that he has a brother. The only way he can meet him is to summon him, and to do so he must ask a spider to bring him by the house. Disbelieving, as any logical person would, Charlie speaks to a spider and requests his brother to come by.Imagine Charlie's surprise when his brother, Spider, stops by, bringing with him a series of downward spirals that hurl Charlie headlong into disaster. With the world on the precipice of doom, Charlie seeks help to enter the spirit world and set right all that has begun to go wrong.Gaiman's true gift in his writing is his ability to take normal everyday people like Charlie and his fiancee and put them in outlandish and remarkable situations. Although there may not be a trickster god wandering the streets right now, Gaiman, through his masterful writing, makes you believe in this world he has woven around you. Before you know what has happened, you are in as much trouble as Fat Charlie, and it is your human self that connects with Charlie as he struggles to make amends.All of this is done with stunning vision and clarity, at breakneck speed that does not hamper the telling of the tale. A work of compelling quality, ANANSI BOYS is equal parts humorous, terrifying, adventurous, and epic in the standard mythological style. Yet, for its epic scope, it is an intimate story about the beauty, and danger, of family.Side by side together, AMERICAN GODS and ANANSI BOYS are beautiful and brilliant works that leave you hoping Gaiman will not take too long in returning to the world in which he has so richly enveloped us."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The story of Anansi Boys treads very similar ground as American Gods--gods exist, the old gods who are largely forgotten or novelties now, and they walk among us in modern times, sometimes as people, and sometimes as gods--but is much more lighthearted. Which is appropriate, because AG centered around war gods, and AB follows the family of trickster gods. It's not like the plot isn't predictable, he tells us in the very first chapter... all stories belong to Anansi (the spider). Anansi gets into trouble, Anansi gets out of trouble. You're not trying to get tangled in the spiderweb of the story, you want to see it as a whole, beautiful reminder of the interconnected web.You don't need to read American Gods to understand Anansi Boys, but if you like one, you'll probably like the other.I've realized that I pretty much judge books on a simple rating: was the time I spent reading wasted or not. In this case, I'm going with \\"or not,\\" so if you're looking for a reccomendation, that's it. Everything else is just gushing or ranting to explain it."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Just finished Anansi Boys - and I would recommend it to everyone. For me it is Gaiman's most enjoyable novel. As with American Gods, this story puts mythical gods into our modern world (or at least a nearby parallel one). But where American Gods took this idea very seriously, Anansi Boys is much lighter in tone. And it is funny. Not just, 'Oh, yes, that was funny' funny, but actual laughing funny. But still the characters are always taken seriously and the humor never distracts. The result is that, by the end, the story has an emotional impact.The story has got elements from a lot of genres, part detective novel, part romantic comedy, and part fantasy. It's all good stuff, never a dull moment. The fun part is that with all the diverging plot threads - you can have faith as a reader knowing that Neil will make it all work at the end, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.A lot of Neil's books tend to have a similar theme - a &lt;seemingly> ordinary guy gets pulled into a crazy alternate reality. Sometimes I am bothered by the fact that these protoganists never really ask enough questions or seem properly irked by their new surroundings. But since Anansi Boys has a more light-hearted tone, it was much easier for me to just accept what happens to Fat Charlie & the gang.So what are you waiting for? Books like this don't come around very often! But that's okay, because this one is good enough that you will want to reread it a whole bunch in the interim. And keep a lime nearby."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is one of those book that has something it in for just about any taste.There's certainly humor. When your father dies on a karaoke stage it's bad enough, but when you then find out that he was (or had been) a god it's pretty funny.Then there's your brother, the one you never knew you had. But of course he now shows up. You combine all this with a bit of mystery, a ghost, a little romance and bit of British wit to get this story. This book is set in the world of his previous book, 'American Gods.' That is to say that it's not the same set of characters, but it is set in the same kind of environment.The book has the same feeling of normal life, but then the gods get involved and strange things seem to be happening. This book seemed to me to be a bit lighter than Americna Gods, more humor, easier reading. I enjoyed it very much.Mr. Gaiman is certainly a productive person with the books, the new movie (Mirrormask) coming out and more. I expect we will see a lot more from him in the future, and I guess that we'll just have to wait."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I won't waste time with a lengthy synopsis, I'm sure you've read the publisher's synopsis above.Upon the death of his father Anansi, Fat Charlie Nancy finds out that, (1) Dad was a god, and (2) he has a brother, Spider. The two brothers are essentially mirror-image opposites of one another (Spider is basically a bizarro Charlie), and Spider quickly wreaks havoc upon Charlie's life. The rest of the story is really a \\"coming of age\\" tale as Charlie figures out how the take upon himself the mantle of his father, while at the same time trying to clean up the mess Spider has made.In many ways, the story is an elaboration of certain themes in \\"Neverwhere\\" and \\"American Gods\\", namely, how does a normal everyday man react when confronted with the abnormal (whether godhood or an alternate universe).I certainly liked the book and would recommend it, but don't expect the scope or epic qualities of \\"American Gods\\". This is more a whimsical farce like \\"Stardust\\"."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"At 50% it would have been 4 stars...75% 3 stars...80% 2.5....100% 2.I just thought since I heard so much about Mr. Gaiman's books being so great that I figured I would give Anasi Boys a go.The writing at the beginning of the book sucked me in, but towards the end I just got so tired of Gaiman trying to put a neat little bow on a ridiculous package that I just went to the end to find out what happened. I very rarely, if ever, do that with books but this one just DRAGGED on and on.The character development also was a bit lackluster since there really was no depth to the characters other being super ordinary people thrown into a crazy magical situation that was trying to weakly tie it to African mythology.I might give Gaiman the benefit of the doubt and try another one of his books, but this one was a real disappointment."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Another excellent book from Gaiman! It doesn't have the epic scope of American Gods, but it is a clever and entertaining addendum to that story, featuring the sons of the trickster spider god Anansi. Definitely highly recommended."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"A cool sort-of follow-up or prequel to American Gods, which I really enjoyed. It was a fast and easy read. Some of the fantasy stuff was a little \\"off\\" for me, but I found the story and the characters and their relationships interesting. It was fun, and it triggered a need to go back to American Gods and refresh myself about the Anansi appearance in that book."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"It's a special kind of disappointment when your favorite author puts out a lack-luster book. And that's just who Neil Gaiman is - my favorite author.An enormous fan of both his comics and books, Gaiman has never ceased to amaze me in his fantastic ideas, engaging storytelling, and masterful reconstruction of familiar lore and legend. Like many Gaiman fans, I eagerly anticipate his books months before their release. Tragically, Anansi Boys was a let down for me.Gaiman's previous novel was American Gods - a story with a fascinating concept and wonderful cast of characters to fill out its book jacket. For me, Anansi Boys felt like I was treading the familiar ground of American Gods without finding anything new. Granted, this story had a smaller scope and hinged on fewer characters, but it was still old gods living in modern days with a little more quirk and less horror.Anansi Boys is not a bad book, but I found American Gods more memorable between the two. From a different author, I might have been more charmed with it but I anticipate more with Neil Gaiman."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Gaiman's Anansi Boys is shiny example of great, silly writing. As a big Douglas Adams fan, this novel harkens me back to those halcyon days when Arthur Dent was so befuddled to discover that his best friend was not an out of work actor after all, but an alien. Here is another befuddled man who, despite hating his job and his boss, continues to come in and do his job. His only light appears to be Rose, the one woman who, in someways, understands him. But, like Arthur Dent, Fat Charlie discovers how his ordered and somewhat basic life, can become completely unwound like a slinky when the death of his estranged father leads him to find out his true heritage.If Gaiman's intention was to pay tribute to Adams, he's succeed in many ways. There are many lovely bits here and there that I found very much in the vain of Adams. The bit about the monkeys in the barrel was cute, along with Grahame Coats -the evil, yet very stupid villain. Then there's the tragic death of Maeve Livingtone, who needs to see her killer come to justice before she can \\"go into the light\\", as it where.Fat Charlie's brother Spider is more of an annoying relative who can't get the clue he needs to go home, than evil. And while Charlie will stoop to magic of three Shakespearean style witches, he realizes that despite all the chaos Spider makes, it did get him out of the house.Being a tricksters son can do that to you."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys is a return to Mr.Gaiman's confidence of his Sandman days. The characters are fully fleshed and sympathetic, no matter if they are mortal, god,animal, or all of the above.Morality is a mater of shifting light, and circumstance, showing the weaknessess and streangths that surprise us all daily.Hopefully this one will earn Mr. Gaiman's another Hugo to add to his growing pile."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"While \\"Anansi Boys\\" had some interesting pieces to it, I don't think it comes anywhere close to the caliber of its predecessor, \\"American Gods\\".True, \\"Gods\\" had the advantage of the concept of modern-day gods being new and novel. But while \\"Boys\\" doesn't have that advantage, I think the book could've worked much better if only another god's story had been used. Anansi just didn't appeal to me as a reader. And there were so many other, far more interesting stories that could've been branched off from \\"Gods\\". The god of the railroads and the god of the Internet, for example, would've made far more interesting stories to be fleshed out.I think my biggest problem with \\"Boys\\" was that the characters never really popped out at you. Their texture was so lacking that it's only at the very end of the book that you get any sense of them as \\"real\\" characters. Throughout the rest of the book, Gaiman uses very broad brushstrokes to portray them.In his author's note, even Gaiman admits he didn't initially think the story for \\"Boys\\" warranted an entire book. That his agent or editor convinced him to give it a shot. In retrospect, Gaiman should've listened to his first instinct."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm just about to order this. I thought American Gods was one of the best books I've ever read and the other reviews make this one sound promising. I'm really struck, however, by how similar the plot sounds to Coyote Blue by Christopher Moore. That was also an excellent book - mythological and psychological and surreal, as well as uniquely American. Check it out if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Always witty and a bit wonky, Gaiman's Anansi Boys offers great escapist fantasy. A follow-up to 2002's American Gods, Anansi Boys picks up with Londoner \\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy, who learns that his recently deceased father was the human form of Anansi, the African trickster god. After acquiring this knowledge at his father's funeral, Fat Charlie's life spins into disarray as he becomes reacquainted with his brother, Spider. Unfortunately for Fat Charlie, Spider seems to have inherited much of their father's trickster ways and begins to wreak havoc in Fat Charlie's life."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Has a weird sounding summary but this book on more then one occasion has moved me like a beautiful piece of music. One of the best books ever and Neil Gaiman's best as well (I have almost read everyone of his but thers no way to top this). As literarily perfect as can be."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Having been recently introduced to Neil Gaiman through _American Gods_, I just HAD to read _Anansi Boys_. Perhaps it was because I was so impressed with _American Gods_ and the high bar Gaiman has set for himself as a result, that I was less impressed by _Anansi Boys_.The first quarter of the book was difficult to get into - I missed the wit and humour of Gaiman, and the plot was slow to develop. However, once the \\"boys\\" (from the title - I don't want to spoil the story) get together and the mischief for which Anansi is so well known begins to happen, the magic of Gaiman's storytelling shows through. Were it not for the slow start, the book would certainly warrant five stars; as another reviewer remarked, if the book were written by another author, perhaps I would be more forgiving and award it five. As it is, Gaiman is a victim of his own brilliance in this case, hence the four.I do recommend the book - the anecdotes and wit that Gaiman is so well-known for is here, as is his unique ability to weave mythology with reality. Still, _Anansi Boys) isn't Gaiman's best work by far."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I've come to appreciate Neil Gaiman's use of dark British humour together with insatiably touching Moments ever since I first read Neverwhere several years ago.Being a story about an African trickster god and his bloodline, Anansi Boys can't be the dark epic that American Gods -- focusing largely on the Norse All-Father, Odin -- was; I missed a certain level of interwoven coherence that Gaiman's led me to expect. Regardless, it's still a very entertaining read, and had any other author made me cry \\"only\\" once in a book, they'd have earned a 5."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"If you like Gaiman's humor, you'll love this book. You don't have to read American Gods to know what's going on, either. It was humoring the whole way through."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I enjoyed this Novel by Gaiman. A bit different then his other work. The plot carries on well enough, very different and refreshing. The resolution at the end wraps everything up very well. The audio book version makes the story even better. I listen to a lot of audio books and this actors voice stuck with me the longest. Very clear and convincing, even when making the voices of all the character's (and there are a lot). I would recommend this book for recreational listening, it won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I sat on this book for over a year before actually getting around to reading it for two reasons. First, because I had just read another Gaiman book, Stardust, and found it a better than average but ultimately flawed read. The second reason was because I discovered that that the Anansi from the book was the same Anansi the Spider from African folklore and worried that the story would be just an homage to African mythology. Neither of my fears were justified. Anansi Boys succeeds in all the ways that Stardust fails. They both have that warm, campfire kind of storytelling but Anansi has a much more compelling, well paced story taking place in contemporary London with occasional trips to Florida. Anansi the spider does appear in the book but not in any way I would have imagined.To summarize, the book is about a young man named Charles Nancy who has both parents die in quick succession. After his pops funeral Charles is informed that his old man was more than just an erratic father who seemed to get just a bit too much enjoyment out of playfully tormenting his son. He was in fact a God, specifically Anansi the spider. Charles is, not surprisingly, less than convinced particularly given the fact that he himself seems to lack any godlike abilities. He is also told that he has a brother who can be contacted by asking any household spider. Despite his understandable skepticism Charles does end up later whispering to a spider and soon enough his long lost and previous unremembered brother appears except unlike Charles he managed to inherit his father's godlike powers.At the risk of obsessing over Stardust my biggest complaint was that many of the characters and story threads were essentially irrelevant to the core tale whereas Anansi is much tighter despite being longer in length. Anansi Boys seems like the perfect kind of book to be made into a film; in fact it almost seems as if Gaiman wrote this book specifically with an idea of it eventually being put onto celluloid. His style here reminds me quite a bit of the late great Douglas Adams who died way too young and produced way too little. Gaiman is a bit more restrained than Adams but he displays the same whimsical, breezy pacing in a slightly off kilter universe. Anansi Boys is easily one of the best fiction novels I have ever read and I look forward to reading more books by Gaiman."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I'm not a big fan of fantasy, but my bowling alley book club recommended this one, and they rarely let me down. Author Neil Gaiman recently won the Newberry Award, so he can write.Gaiman borrows liberally from the Brer Rabbit tales. He even uses the Tar Baby story in one anecdote. Fat Charlie Nancy is the main character here; he's so embarrassed by his eccentric father that he moves to London. When he returns to Florida for his father's funeral, he discovers that he has a brother who takes after the old man. He also learns, from a next door neighbor, that his father was god of the spiders, who owns all the stories.Fat Charlie, who isn't very fat, works for a entertainment agent named Grahame Coats who is embezzling money from his clients. Mrs. Higgler, his former next door neighbor in Florida who could be a witch, tells Charlie that if he wants to get in touch with his brother, he should talk to a spider. When Charlie does, his brother Spider comes to live with him, irritating him more than his father ever did. Spider has inherited his father's personality and apparently most of his powers.There are four witches in the story, Mrs Higgler, Mrs. Dunwiddy (the strongest of the bunch), Mrs. Bustamonte, and Bella Noles. They help Charlie to cross over into the nether world when he's in trouble.Charlie also has a girlfriend named Rosie, who features prominently in the story; there's also a policewoman named Daisy who's investigating the Grahame Coats embezzlement case. She seems to be a better fit for Charlie than Rosie, who's more drawn to Spider. There's also a bunch of ghosts wandering in and out of the action to add more craziness to the brew.If you like a little suspension of disbelief in your fantasy, you probably won't like this (Gaiman doesn't even try), but it's certainly better than Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"This is a very nice addition to Gaiman's book \\"American Gods\\"--one of my favorites. It is a thoughtful, character driven story with good humor and an interesting take on traditional folk tale characters. I highly recommend this book, especially if you enjoyed \\"American Gods.\\""},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Gaiman did it again. Delighted me thoroughly and completely in a most satisfying manner. Had me chuckling through the day and left me lying in bed with a smile on my face (and my husband reading Murakami in equal pleasure beside me, so wipe that smirk off your face. We only invite authors in covers under the covers with us. Kinky, we're not.)I don't rightly recall which Gaiman was my first, though I was the first in the family to discover him. Devoured Good Omens, Neverwhere, Smoke and Mirrors and Stardust with equal abandon and delight. Nearly wept with joy when American Gods came out. Whipped through Coraline in a skinny minute. Bought Anansi Boys pre publication and had it in my hot little hands the day it came out-- only to have it snatched away by Boyczuk, who we have raised right-- he likes Gaiman. (Gaiman's blog is one that the lad checks daily and since he knows his father and I are fans, he'll give us updates on what's happening in Gaiman-land. Filming is just about concluded on Stardust with Michelle Pheifer and Robert DiNero for starters-- Gaiman says the bits he's seen are like nothing he's seen before. I'm pumped!) Then the book was taken over by mr czuk, and elder brother, and shoveled into some corner of the house where it languished for far too long. I finally dug it out from a shelf in the guest room, where it had slid behind a John Irving and a Christopher Moore. I sent it up to the mountains in a box of hardbacks, knowing that I had too big a TBR pile in Charleston, but that at the cabin, someday this summer I'd finish whatever book I brought up with me, then be able to curl up with my sweet Neil and read uninterrupted. Which I did, and I did. Ah bliss.So now on to the book, or back where I started. Everyone and his or her brother (including mine) has probably read this by now. Gaiman doesn't sit around unread on fans' shelves for long, except with the rare (read \\"such as happened to me\\") mishap. Mythology for the modern age, gods with dysfunctional families-- wonderful. Even the liner notes had me grinning like a fool. \\"God is dead. Meet the kids.\\" I followed poor sap Charlie Nancy (aka Fat Charlie) through his embarrassing childhood, and dull as dishwater (except for do-good Rosie) life as an accountant. Saw him get mixed up in stuff he was too dense to even pick up on, deal with the death of a parent he despised, discover Spider--a dashing and daring previously unknown brother, and then see his life go to a proverbial hell in a hand basket. All told with clarity, humor and a wit that is utterly delightful. Into this mix, introduce aging and sometimes angry gods, legends of the trickster Anansi and you're off and running. Sometimes, the sheer ridiculousness of it was enough to carry me along, other times the plot ran away with me and made me miss my tea. All in all, it was a fun day of reading Mr Gaiman provided me with. (And I still think him to be utterly charming in interviews and utterly darling in pictures. Plus, he likes BookCrossing! Any wonder why he is one of my favorite authors?)"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Anansi Boys tells the story about a man named Fat Charlie Nancy, who leads a normal if not boring life. He works for an awful man named Grahme Coats. He is engaged to a very nice woman named Rosie. Rosies mom hates Charlie. He and Rosie are in the process of planning their wedding when Charlie gets a call that his father died. He flys out to the funeral and find out information that he never knew. One is that his father was a God and the other is that he has a brother named Spider. Spider comes into his life and turns it upside down and Charlie tries to make sense of everything. This book contains magic, murder, love, deception, along with a bit of singing and dancing. This is a fun and well written book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"Fat Charlie was dubbed so by his dad when just a chubby child. Unfortunately, even though he shed the pounds the name stuck. Many years later Fat Charlie is living an unremarkable life, with a crappy job and a girlfriend who insists on making him \\"wait until marriage\\". When Charlie's dad dies he learns some amazingly unbelieveable things and his boring life is forever changed.This one has a lot of wit and was just offbeat enough to hold my attention. Charlie is an every-guy sort of character who is easy to like as he bumbles his way through some very odd changes in his life. The book is populated with interesting people and takes a lot of twists and turns that aren't expected. Gaiman wrote it and it reads like a twisted fairy-tale so how can you go wrong with that?"},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"I read Neverwhere before digging into Anansi Brothers. The two books have different settings, but reside firmly within the realm of fantasy. The story is beguiling, especially in the beginning, but flags toward the end of the novel. I think the pacing is a tad slow toward the middle of the book, and some descriptions of characters feel repetative. However, Gaiman does masterfully tie together all the tails woven throughout the story in the end. Neverwhere is a better story, but Anansi Brothers isn't bad."},{"Title":"Anansi Boys","review":"The might be the most tightly plotted of all Gaiman's work. It was a pleasure to read, with the right blend of humor and gothic horror. He also did a fine job of making each character strong and unique.Gaiman's best work is always so flawed; he can create a dream world but has trouble controlling it. He can be sloppy. Anansi Boys is less dream-like, and more grounded in reality (or rather, Gaiman's magic alternate reality) than Sandman and Neverwhere - and it's a stronger work for it."},{"Title":"Red Cavalry","review":"Babel's Red Cavalry is a remarkably candid look at a little known subject of the Bolshevik's effort to export their revolution to Europe via Poland.

Babel writes in short, choppy and sharp sentences that score point after point with the reader. He paints pictures that are clear and vivid and he opens the reader to feel the scene.

This is not always a good thing to hear, but, whether an infertile couple eventually have a child or not takes second place to the agony of waiting, and to the pressure of coping with a daily grief that affects every area of a couple's life - from career decisions, to the marriage relationship, to faith in God's wisdom, and compassion.Jill Baughan had a birth child in 1981, but she and her husband have struggled most of their married life with infertility, as well as secondary infertility.She's written a book that's meant to help, and even if you're in the middle of things which are confusing, she offers practical, gut-level emotional hope and encouragement. And this is as it should be.

I really enjoyed it a lot. Edith Hamilton has a style that seems to bring one back in time. One almost believes he is there experiencing that ancient time. But moreover, one receives a personal feel of all the charactors she so richly describes. Caesar, Cicero, Catullus, Horace, etc. all seem to come alive. Above it all, Ms. Hamilton has a wonderful writing style that manifests itself throughout. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"I was first exposed to this classic in high school, but, of course, lacked the experience and maturity to appreciate it. I am glad I was exposed to it anyway because I was indeed impressed by it and remembered it in spite of my immaturity. I picked it up again and re-read it and was delighted. Hamilton is a voice from another time, a time not just of ancient Romans but a time when educated people in the modern West were really educated in what really matters and will always matter: the best that has been written and thought about the drama of human life throughout the ages. With that classic outlook, the reader cannot but help to recapture some of the balance, insight, sensitivity, and maturity that are the best fruits of a classical education. Now, more than ever, we need the classic restraint and equanimity that comes from the best of classical civilization. Reading Hamilton is a great tonic for a society increasingly fragmenting into more and more lunatic and decadent dead ends. The classics mature our personalities--and we need that in a time when egotism and undisciplined emotionalism are so rampant."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"_The Roman Way_ (1932) by Edith Hamilton is an easily readable, highly informative account of the mindset of the Romans as illustrated in the lives and exploits of the great military and political leaders; the oeuvre of Roman poets, playwrights, and historians; and the insights of her philosophers. The Roman Way spans a period of roughly four hundred years, from 200 BC to 400 AD, the high water marks of both the republic and the empire. The breadth of the work is incredible.In treating such a wide range of subjects, Hamilton offers a rich, dynamic story of Rome. She introduces the major figures in enough depth to make their voices come alive, in their own complexity as well as in the context of what was taking place in Roman society. As a result, _The Roman Way_ is very useful either as an introduction to Roman society for a general reader or a synthesis of knowledge for those who have already studied these authors and history in detail.Within Hamilton's history are two ideas, woven throughout the text. First, while demonstrating Rome's debt to ancient Greece, she contrasts Rome's pragmatism in the arts and sciences with the Greek interest in abstract philosophy and metaphysics. Second, she traces--often in asides--rudimentary similarities between the Roman and the American worldview (of the 1930s), particularly with respect to the arts. She points out that American pragmatism and culture often draw more from Roman values and virtues, as opposed to the Greek penchant for philosophical speculation. This latter point is suggestive but is, rightly in my opinion, not a major focus of the work.Hamilton is skilled at quoting from writings and accounts of historical figures and then explaining the context for these words. For instance, in her chapters on Roman comedy she summarizes a number of plays by Plautus and Terrence while translating key passages. The reader is exposed to a range of plays, actually experiences the language of specific scenes, and then has a chance to consider Hamilton's broader insights about the playwrights. In a few short chapters, Hamilton covers the nature of Roman comedy, the role of women in the plays and society, how comedy competed with gladiators and other spectacles, and the influence of Greek drama on Plautus and Terrence. She covers considerable ground while offering a direct feeling of the content of the plays and, most importantly, their humor.For example, she notes that Roman comedies are often situational and studies of the ordinary rather than philosophical or poetic, which is more typical of Greek comedy. To show exceptions to this generalization, though, she excerpts two of the more far-reaching statements from Terrence and Plautus. Terrence remarks, \\"I am a man and nothing in mankind do I hold alien to me.\\" Plautus expresses about the poet: \\"The poet seeks what is nowhere in all of the world, / And yet--somewhere--he finds it.\\" In acknowledging these exceptions, she strengthens her point, showing the difference between the everyday and the more philosophical. Both epigrams meanwhile satisfy a reader on their own terms: they are worth contemplation.Hamilton's chapters on Cicero, Julius Caesar, Catullus, Horace, Augustus, Virgil, and Juvenal are similarly structured with engaging quotations and close analyses explained in their larger context. Hamilton draws comparisons to Roman contemporaries and \\"the Roman Way.\\" Hamilton's chapters offer snapshots of Rome at specific historical moments through memorable anecdotes and quotations that give a sense of each figure's character.As a writer and historian, Hamilton is exceptionally clear. Her knowledge and erudition are deep, and yet her prose is direct and unadorned. The validity for her characterizations is supported by the ease with which she can discuss an entire field, from specific to general, from her own interpretations to those of others. The work has a clarity that one often finds in scholarship from the 1920s to the 1950s, which tends toward synthesis in discussions and specificity, uncluttered by qualifiers or tangents.The final two paragraphs of _The Roman Way_ are a plea on behalf of the importance of history. Hamilton writes, \\"History repeats itself. The fact is a testimony to human stupidity. The saying has become a truism; nevertheless, the study of the past is relegated to the scholar and the school-boy. And yet it is really a chart for our guidance--no less than that.\\" Hamilton's work, while suitable to scholars and students, appeals to a general reader who is interested in the lessons of the past. Hamilton's book invites the reader to venture into large fields of understanding and is filled with insights about human nature and personality."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"Greece and Rome are the foundations of the modern world system and Western culture. We all owe a big debt to the spirit of those two little countries in southern Europe who gave so much to the world. &quot;Roman Ways&quot; should be read with &quot;Greek Ways&quot; if the reader wants to get a better picture of the achievements of these two sister civilizations. A good introduction to anyone who is learning the classics."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"After reading the first two chapters of 'The Roman Way' I almost gave up. Hamilton's use of Roman theatre and comedy to introduce the reader to \\"The Roman Way\\", well quite frankly, bored me to tears. I just couldn't get into it. It seems that other reviewers enjoyed this approach so I suppose this is just my personal taste. That being said, I found the rest of the book to be mostly enjoyable. Hamilton's elegant writing style is certainly unique and I would agree with the reviewer who said that her writing seems to be from another era. Incidentally, this book was first published in 1932 so I suppose you could say it IS from another era. Hamilton brings to life many of the biggest names in Roman history including; Caesar, Cicero, Catullus, Horace, Virgil, Livy, and Juvenal. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Caesar and Cicero where Hamilton describes their peculiar relationship. I also enjoyed the title chapter where Hamilton succinctly contrasts the Romans (disciplined, pragmatic, heroic) to the Greeks (beauty, pleasure, intellectualism). All in all, a different but enjoyable introduction to ancient Roman culture and the personalities that constituted it."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"\\"The Roman Way\\" was a useful introduction into the famous figures of Roman literature, and the mindset of the people who built a great empire. Although sweeping generalizations about the Romans might prove irritating to anyone already very familiar with classical history, I think Hamilton still has plenty of insight about Roman culture--how it was at once noble and brutal, disciplined and imaginative."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"Edith Hamilton's \\"The Roman Way\\" should not be considered if one is looking for a complete and definitive historical analysis of Roman civilization. I would consider it more of an informative pamphlet on certain aspects of the Romans. Hamilton uses only primary sources in her book. In this way she is able to avoid any misquided interpretations or exaggerations that some secondary sources contain. But what she gains in her use of primary sources exclusively, she loses in the more contemporary analyses of available secondary sources.She attempts to depict Roman civilization by the great writers of the period, and she is partially successful in her attempt.I, like other reviewers, particularly enjoyed her chapters on Cicero and Caesar as well as the title chapter. Her concluding chapter is an excellent summation of the Roman Empire. Unfortunately many of her chapters in the book are lacking in their support of her conclusion.Hamilton does tend to get lost in the writings of the romantics, stoics and other authors and occasionally the reader is left with the notion that her book is a study of Roman literature. Bear with her and you'll see her view of Roman history come about eventually.I would consider this book to be an excellent supplement to anyone studying the Romans. Especially for its analysis of the relationship between Caesar and Cicero and its analysis of Cicero himself. However, I would consider it an excellent supplement only, not a complete and thorough study of the whole of Roman history by itself."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"This is a companion to the Greek Way, and it uses the same method: study Roman civilization by studying its greatest writers. Each writer allows Hamilton to study Rome from a different point of view: everyday life (the comic dramatists), politics (Caesar and Cicero), romance and epic (Virgil, Lily), common-sense philosophy (Horace), religious philosophy (Seneca), the dark underbelly (Tacitus and Suetonius), even private affairs (Catullus).The best parts come when she is able to make contrasts. Financial matters are ignored by Cicero but frequently mentioned by Horace; Hamilton uses this to demonstrate the vast rise in wealth as Rome became an Empire. She also contrasts a coarse after-dinner entertainment (reported by Horace, with Virgil and Maecenas also present) with Plato's SYMPOSIUM to demonstrate the Greeks' superior culture.A pity she didn't include the scientist-poet Lucretius, who actually foresaw modern concepts such as evolution and the uncertainty principle. Likewise the fact that no major Roman writer discussed Law means that she undervalues that part of Roman culture. She also mostly ignores what Gibbon praised as the high point of Roman civilization, the Era of the \\"Five Good Emperors\\", simply because it produced no outstanding writer except for the emperor Marcus Aurelius himself.It's because of these omissions that I'm knocking off a star. What she does write about is excellent."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"I never studied Latin formally and my orientation to the Roman classics comes down to a 101 World Lit survey course in college that galloped through the antiquities faster than you can say \\"Virgil.\\" It was time to fill in some gaps and I was pleased to see that Edith Hamilton, whose books were the wallpaper of school units on mythology in my baby boomer public schooling, had also written this book. I'd forgotten what a bright, unmannered voice she brings to the table, how lucidly she orders her information and how she can make it matter.For Hamilton, the Romans moved into the center of western culture, usurping the Greeks' place, from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd AD. In The Roman Way she looks at the exemplary writers and forms who have had a lasting impact on western culture, and she never wavers from the view that understanding the Romans is key to making sense of modern public and private life. Her purpose is to palpate the Romans themselves--their values and social systems--believing the best way to understand them is through their writing. She helpfully compares and contrasts Roman romanticism with Greek classicism throughout the book. Obviously, in an introductory text like this, not every writer can have his due; those to whom she pays the most attention are Plautus, Terence, Cicero, Horace, Catallus, Juvenal, Virgil and Seneca. Through them, she reveals the Caesars, the Claudii, the Stoics, the art, the bloody warfare, the greed, the corruption, gender relations, class structure, the political intrigues and paradoxes, and the empire's demise.Is this a complete concordance to the Roman canon? No. A comprehensive history? No. It's about getting a feel for who the Romans were and what mattered to them in their own words and why they continue to matter. It is a compelling overview made lively by Hamilton who does not look upon her topic as dead but rather quite vital."},{"Title":"The Roman way","review":"In this book, Edith Hamilton focuses on the poets, playwrights, and other writers of Rome from approximately 250 BC to 150 AD. She chooses to do this because of the rarity of historical data for the earlier part of that period.I do not rate this book as highly as her The Greek Way, because she seems not to have the sympathy for Roman culture that she does for Greek culture. Also, she gives very little in the way of explanation as to how Greek culture became Roman culture, e.g., the transformation of the Greek gods into the Roman ones.Still, this is probably the best summary of the Roman culture of this period for the casual reader; Hamilton's prose is always lucid and energetic."},{"Title":"Serving with the urban poor (Cases in holistic ministry)","review":"Urbanisation has had a profound impact on the church.

Cronin's style is enchanting and romantic. That is not at all to say that he exagerates or romanticizes his subject, Matteo Ricci. Rather, Cronin tells the facts and the truth of Ricci's life and work better than I've read in ages. It was really a joy to read.Although it was written many years ago, it is not out of date and still well respected. It is a great book, as said in the headline, to introduce yourself to Ricci.There are other good books about Ricci and the Jesuit missions in China, including 'The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci' (which is excellent) but it would pay to read Cronin first to set the background for the rest.After reading &quot;Wise Man Form the West&quot; you will have a much better sense of those first tentative steps of Orient-Occident relations, a deep respect for the old Jesuits Missionaries, the Chinese who welcomed and taught them, and most especially, for Matteo Ricci himself. This is, of course, the purpose of Cronin's book, and he does so magnificently."},{"Title":"Saga of the Norse King: Part 2 (Everyman's Library) (Pt. 2)","review":"Heimskringla was one of the best finds of the year for me.

Yosano Akiko's beautiful poems broke with tradition and spoke of love, the emancipation of woman, and the pleasures of the flesh. Attacking conventional morals, she glorified the female body and defended sexuality, but there is more to her poems even, than that. The title, Midare Gami means &quot;tangled hair&quot; and is a typically oblique Japanese expression that, despite its indirectness, is utterly fraught with nuance and meaning. Tangled hair refers not to hair that is messy or untidy, but to hair tousled by love making and is a constant theme in her poems. Yosano Akiko brought new meanings to the term, and used it to connote female emancipation and sexual freedom.Although Yosano Akiko is important in Japanese literary circles because she wrote about things that no one had ever dared to write about before, her poems are more than just historical curiosities. They are hauntingly beautiful, and her choices of images are incredibly vivid.She says so much in so few words, that one can spend days thinking about a simple three or four line poem no matter how many times one reads her work, one can always find new things that one had not seen before. It is fascinating to read the thoughts of a woman who truly lived her life for love and art, and who was constantly struggling to come to grips with the conflict between one's ideas about the way that life ought to be and the way it really is. Her poems about being betrayed by men who go off to have affairs, or the sad verses about women waiting for men to come home, or the lamentations on the emphemerality of beauty and youth are unforgettable. As Pico Iyer discusses in his book The Lady and the Monk some of her best poems have to do with the conflict that the monk faces when he is torn between his love for a woman and his quest to escape from the longings and desires of the material world.Yosano Akiko's poems are very difficult to understand, as the many of the cultural references and symbols she uses are not familiar to westerners, but fortunately there is an excellent appendix which provides explanations for all the poems."},{"Title":"Tangled Hair: Selected Tanka from Midaregami","review":"The tanka collected in this volume are simple and elegant.

This book was such a vacation from everyday life. I thouroughly enjoyed Henry's soiciopathic ways (although he's not a sociopath because he does feel guilt. Sort of)and loser personality. This is the story of a man who has been emasculated by his wife, his job, and has little to look forward to until he decides to poison his wife. His thought process is so deliciously evil! He actually acts out on his thoughts though, whereas most of us would stop ourselves from even thinking that way for longer than a micro-second. This book is like what would occur if we took away all consequences and morality from a person. It's a fantasy, and that's why it's so enjoyable. It is also hilarious, because Henry is such an impulsive poisoner, he can't seem to get it right and leaves a path of bodies strewn around his neighborhood as he tries to get his wife. he digs himself deeper and deeper in only a way a total loser can (funeral speech) and doesn't know when to stop. Very funny. I wanted this book to keep going and it has actually sparked a desire to write again.

Rubik's cube","review":"If you enjoy math, especially geometry, and enjoy the pleasure of figuring things out - BUT, like many good problem-solvers, after playing with the Rubik's cube for days, you found that you could easily solve one face, even managed to get a couple of rows lined up going down, but just can't figure out how to get that bottom row and opposite face in order... AND you'd like a book to help you figure out how to do it, without being so explicit as to take all your fun away from you or make you feel too much like you cheated... THEN I recommend this book for you.This book teaches a handful of simple combinations - like a combination for interchanging cubes that lie in the center of an edge, or a combination for changing corners, without messing up other important cubes in the process. You have to study these combinations carefully (and first you have to study the basic moves), which means reading a little at a time, looking at diagrams, and some thinking. Then you have to practice the combinations to learn the steps. Then you have to use your brain to apply the combinations.This book is not a Rubik's cube solution for dummies that tells you explicitly just how to solve your own Rubik's cube. It describes the handful of basic combinations, along with useful diagrams, and describes conceptually and strategically how to go about solving your Rubik's cube by putting these combinations together. I find that a lot of people who like the Rubik's cube also like visual puzzles, like to think, and like to solve problems on their own. If that's you, but you need a little guidance to finish your Rubik's cube, then this book should be a good fit."},{"Title":"Gott'cha!

A Small Garden Designer's Handbook is not only chock-full of gorgeous photography, it actually shows you how you can turn the smallest plot of earth into a personalized piece of Eden.With chapters on ground planning, enclosures, plants, and focal points, you'll see the options are abundant even if your acreage is not. There is an insightful emphasis on the \\"architecture\\" of the garden: using it to support plants, or using plants AS architecture-- helping to make the garden an extension of the home, not just a separate entity. With attention paid to details like paths and paving, entrances and eye-catchers, as well as ornaments and containers, you needn't worry if your thumb is not the greenest around.From the inside flap:There are many elements - apart from the plants themselves - that make a garden different and special. All too often they are seen as playing a secondary role, but in fact they dictate the flavor of the whole garden. Used wrongly, they can destroy its harmony; used with skill, they can pull disparate features together and can give structure at a stroke; used with bravura, they can lift the mundane into something spectacular."},{"Title":"A Small Garden Designer's Handbook.","review":"My wife and I are both big fans of Roy Strong and this book did not disappoint us.This author is a must have in all garden/plant library's.We have based our current garden on his views.Very well recommended.Hookie"},{"Title":"The Buddha: Buddhist Civilization in India and Ceylon (Pelican)","review":"This is an exceptionally interesting book, though I wonder how much of what it presents has been superseded by 40 years of research since first published in 1973. Trevor Ling was an English scholar of comparative religion who read Pali and Sanskrit. Besides holding appointments at the University of Leeds and Manchester University, he served also as the pastor of a Baptist Church at the University of Rangoon (where he is said to have practiced what he studied, making weekly offerings with his children at the Buddhist temple of the Shwedagon Pagoda).Ling argues that Buddhism as we know it today is but a fossilized relic, the remains of something much grander than what we think of now as \\"religion.\\" The same is true for Christianity and Islam, all of which were conceived as having greater domains of influence than personal psychology. They were in their wholeness ways of understanding and working with the entirety of life.In this context, the Buddha's mission was to establish a way of living that underpinned economics, politics, ethics, and spirituality. His intention was to birth a new civilization. The Buddha wasn't interested purely in personal transformation, but in transfiguring the world. \\"He may justly be described as a social and political theorist, and indeed this aspect of his historical significance has been so generally ignored that it needs heavy emphasis.\\" (Ch 8: The New Society)Lings sees in early Buddhism a humanistic endeavor concerned primarily with the inculcation of moral behavior as an antidote to the increasing chaos brought about by rapid urbanization. A dedicated group of practitioners known as the sangha would serve as the axis upon which this new society was to be built, exhorting villagers and townspeople on how to be good citizens while advising the monarch on how to properly manage the people. Though the Buddha never lived to see the wide-spread implementation of his ideas, his dream was not to be unfulfilled. For a few decades in the 3rd century BCE a Buddhist civilization flourished under the Mauryan king Asoka. His empire collapsed within a few generations of his death, but his legacy lived on in the work he did to sow the seeds of a second Buddhist civilization in Sri Lanka.Among the three pillars of the community - sangha, laity, monarchy - Ling argues that the determining factor in the spread or decline of Buddhism as a tool for building civilizations has been the health of the sangha. Where the vinaya (the monk's code of conduct) was less well enforced, the teachings degenerated into elaborate metaphysics or acquired a heavy coloring of folk religion. At the time of Ling's writing, Thailand had not yet been overcome by capitalist development nor Sri Lanka by sectarianism, nationalism, and war, but still Ling saw little hope. \\"The Buddhist Sangha seems now...to have accepted the role of being the bearers of a religious cult....\\" And in the West he saw even less cause for optimism: \\"It is in Western countries, on the whole, that there is the strongest insistence on regarding [Buddhism] as a religion competing with other religions....\\" (Epilogue)#"},{"Title":"The Buddha: Buddhist Civilization in India and Ceylon (Pelican)","review":"A great book for those interested in the actual teachings of the Buddha. Ling tries to objectively describe the political, economic, and religious environment in which the Buddha lived and taught, plus the development of Buddhism through Ashoka and its spread to Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Although some additional information may have emerged since this book was written in the 70s, it nevertheless offers a very useful background for understanding 'Buddhism without Beliefs'.

I found this to be extremely informative and maybe the most comprehensive guide to Buddhism. I used this book for a research project and was extremely satisfied with the information it provided."},{"Title":"The Buddha: Buddhist Civilization in India and Ceylon (Pelican)","review":"This is a very interesting and informative book by Trevor Ling about the political situation in Northern India and Ceylon affecting the establishment of early Buddhism. The Penguin paperback is titled in full as The Buddha: Buddhist Civilization in India and Ceylon. It was published in 1973 just after Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka. The main thesis of Professor Ling, a reputed English scholar of comparative religion, is that Buddhism started not as a religion but as a civilization (hence the use of that word in the book title). By civilization is meant a code of social conduct, such as in the Buddhist case, a belief in non-violence, non-stealing, sexual restraint, truthfulness and the cultivation of virtues such as generosity. Professor Ling claims that early Buddhism was not theistic like Hinduism or Islam or Christianity. It did not dictate belief in any divine being. It was a rational theory of existence worked out by the Buddha based on his unique insight that all suffering can be traced back to \\"ignorance\\" which means the delusion of self-existence, or in other words the belief in a self or a soul (sometimes the origin of suffering is said to be \\"craving\\" instead of \\"ignorance\\", but they really mean the same thing because craving is a manifestation of individualism). In marked contrast to prevailing religious concepts, the Buddha taught that a self or soul does not really exist. The object of Buddhist practice is to realize the truth of this in one's own life and experience, not merely accept it on faith, in order to extinguish suffering once and for all.Professor Ling claims that Buddhism reached its peak as a civilization about two hundred years after the Buddha's death during the reign of Emperor Ashoka. When Ashoka became a Buddhist convert, he prohibited the animal sacrifices performed by the Hindu Brahman priests, provoking their opposition to Buddhism. He erected many pillars around the country exhorting the people to live righteously. Shortly after his death following a long and prosperous reign, the priests managed to regain control. They suppressed Buddhism which they considered to be a competing religion, not a rational code of civilization based on non-violence and moral conduct. Buddhism continued to thrive in more favorable conditions in Ceylon until the British colonization in 1815 because of three key factors: political support of benevolent rulers, absence of Brahman class antagonism and economic surplus of rice sufficient to support the Sangha. Meanwhile, in northern India and points beyond, the Mahayana and Vajrayana schools transformed early Theravada Buddhism into a popular religion by elevating the Buddha to divine status as a supreme being to be worshiped. His personal history was embroidered with miracles. A pantheon of deities and bodhisattvas was expanded. The extraneous Hindu concepts of karma and rebirth were embedded into Buddhist doctrine. The Tibetan Vajrayana school adopted the Hindu tradition of insisting on total, unquestioning obedience of a student for his teacher.This book helps distinguish the original teachings of the Buddha before they were converted into a religion. It explains the political, social and economic context of the early days. It is recommended by Stephen Batchelor, a contemporary Buddhist thinker focusing on the original message of agnostic or atheistic Buddhism with its humanistic code of civilization not bound by concepts of karma and rebirth."},{"Title":"The Buddha: Buddhist Civilization in India and Ceylon (Pelican)","review":"Because Buddhism has been reinvented by each new culture into which it has migrated throughout its long history, a clearer picture of what Buddhism was in its original inception has emerged only in the past half-century in the West. Ling was one of the Western educated Asian scholars most responsible for bringing about the necessary awareness of what this great teaching was. Gotama Buddha was foremost a social reformer. His epistemology is radically empirical, down to earth. He introduced a new psychological orientation to the conceptualization of religious cosmology. But, most importantly, as Ling documents with eloquent concinnity, he initiated a social revolution which, albeit has slowed, is still progressing is various and diffuse forms today. The Buddha was the first to espouse moral autonomy as the keynote of an ethics and invetiably a vision of society, more democratic, more egalitarian, and more peaceful, than any the world has known. Ling is meticulous in his scholarship, and I really appreciate the studied sociological orientation he brings to this important task.

Now - in response to the constant struggle between what ministers feel called to do and how they actually spend their time - comes this enlightening examination that can help clarify the role of the clergy and enhance the ministry of lay persons in the church.This perceptive book recovers the concept that administration is one of God's spiritual gifts to the church - the gift through which ministry occurs. \\"Ministry,\\" explain the authors, \\"occurs in and through administration. This is different from saying that administration serves ministry or that administrative insights may be used to manage ministry. Until the ordained clergy recognize that administration is a central locus of ministry and is itself ministry, there will be no central motivation, either for them or others within the community of believers, to exercise administratiove functions with sensitivity and joy.\\" -- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Escape to Live","review":"It is strange how sometimes we have to go through horrific experiences and reach rock bottom before we discover what it is that we were born into this world to do or be. So it was with Edward Howell, a man I met a number of times before he died and with whom my wife and I exchanged Christmas cards. By the time I knew him he had grown old and wise but he was still trim and sprightly and I could imagine him as a Douglas Bader type in his youth. It was young men of his caliber who gave the Germans such a tough time in the battle of Crete in 1940. These were the golden years when youth are self-sufficient and don't need God but he was shot down. The Germans were victorious and Howell was captured. From this point he went down hill fast as he was very badly injured. He was moved from hospital to hospital, always in the company of the dregs and barely hanging on. He hit rock bottom when the Athens hospital was closed and he was moved to Salonica - to the infamous Dulag 183 where he met Charles House and his wife whose father had founded the American Farm School in 1904. Charles House had taken over the school and now, in prison, he and his wife were a constant source of encouragement and practical help as they had friends who provided fresh milk and eggs. Their interest in people was such that each man in the ward felt they had come to visit him personally. At this point Howell discovered God and through a series of miracles the impossible happened and he made his way to Egypt just as Rommel seemed unstoppable in North Africa and then back to England.After the war he realized that he had been saved to complete his own special mission in life. The author tells us: &quot;This is a story of a man's journey. First, it is a journey in search of freedom. It tells how, after some difficulties and adventures, he found freedom at last. Then, it is the story of a journey into freedom. Where life had found its true purpose and direction. Where real satisfaction and happiness were not just round the next corner but were to be found in any circumstances, at any time, with any people and in any place. Finally, it is the story of how a man found how to play his part in the greatest adventure of all time - the discovery of a new world. It tells how it is possible to have this new world, free from fear and want, from misery and oppression. How anyone can begin to build it anywhere, any time he chooses. How it can come to our homes today. To the place we work tomorrow. To our nation, and, perhaps, to every nation in our lifetime, provided we are faithful and determined and united.&quot;The road to freedom for an individual or for a nation is marked by milestones of costly moral decisions, needing the power of self-mastery that is the key to human character. It is that power that shapes history through men and women who chose deliberately to become its instruments. It is that super-force on which we base our hope for the future - of change for ourselves, for a new and better world. This book is a remarkable account of Howell's journey to freedom. It is as relevant to us today as Howell's experiences in the 1940s."},{"Title":"Escape to Live","review":"This is a book to read when you believe your life cannot get any worse. Mr. Howell's true account of his escape from a POW camp in Greece during WWII is both unbelievable and inspiring. The prose is strangely amateur, yet appealing, even when Howell dwells on his newfound God and unshakable faith. Howell chronicles the events that led up to his capture as well as his grueling imprisonment and daring escape.The reader feels as if s/he is there with him, and skin crawls uncontrollably when he tells of his festering wounds, bedbugs, and wasted physical condition.Whether you are religious or not (and I happen not to be) this story is as inspiring as a book of such brevity can be. I have been to Greece on two occasions, and his descriptions of the Greek people and countryside could not be more accurate and touching. Furthermore, my mother has met this man, and he is truly a remarkable individual. This is a great little book to keep around when life seems to be assaulting you from all sides. You will come away with a new appreciation for what you have."},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin With Fabulous Desserts","review":"Since beginning low-carb eating, I have found it difficult to find good dessert recipes that I could share with my family and friends.

It turns out he used it as supplementary material in a class he taught at one time. I would have given it up after a chapter or two had I not been expected to render an opinion. Here are my objections:Kuhn says empirical observations are always transformed by the \\"spectacles one's wearing\\"... by the \\"shared assumptions of one's peers.\\" Hmmm...well, yea...I think that's always a potential hazard. Then he interpolates that interpretation of data is (by definition) an emotional event guided by mob bias...and that in science, truth is an optional and gratuitous concept. Wow! I wonder if he thought the science & technology involved in every inch of the commercial airliner he flies is optional and gratuitous. Then he says, \\"Does it really help to imagine that there is some one full, objective true account of nature, and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the event which brings us closer to that ultimate goal?\\" I would say \\"yes!\\" But Kuhn is more prone to think that science is nothing more than \\"a series of fads dressed up to look presentable.\\"In any endeavors involving humans, change is not usually easy, however, there are numerous examples both inside and outside of science that have caught on immediately. Example: ski stops instead of straps, and the revolutionary change of thought about linguistics and about Skinner's behaviorist theory - after Chomsky's published work. There are multitudes of ideas that plodded along and were accepted sort of \\"on schedule,\\" for situations that required controlled studies for documentation. Example: acceptance of helicobacter as the cause of stomach ulcers. Then there are examples that would seem more in line with Kuhn's theory. Examples: The unfortunate resistance and finally acceptance of tectonic plate theory, after decades of rejection.For objections other than the substance of Kuhn's book, it is difficult to read. His sentences are way too long and complex, making speed-reading difficult. As elaborated on by Einstein and Thomas Ockham, one should make an idea as simple as you can, but no simpler! Furthermore, as good a coined word as \\"paradigm\\" might be, it needn't be used in every other sentence!In summary, there is merit to Kuhn's position as stated in this book, but it could have been stated in a couple of chapters in plain English. The undeserved criticism of science methodology in this book is representative of postmodernistic thought...but it was readily welcomed by humanities departments in universities throughout the nature, anxious to gain legitimacy status equal to that of their neighboring science departments. It is unduly critical of the single most important change that took us out of the Dark Ages: the use of the scientific method. The fact is, even though the scientific method is performed imperfectly when administered by us humans, when the smoke clears, unworkable theories are left by the wayside and our total wealth of knowledge increases.

The term is also used to refer to particular problem situations that exemplify this framework and through which a science is learned by its practitioners. &quot;Normal&quot; science progresses, according to Kuhn, by elaborating a particular paradigm. When &quot;puzzle solving&quot; within a paradigm can no longer account for significant 'facts', a scientific revolution can occur, involving the birth of a new paradigm. Kuhn's views hint at those enunciated earlier by Alfred Korzybski, e.g., &quot;logical fate&quot; and &quot;abstracting.&quot; Korzybski saw what Kuhn called &quot;scientific revolutions&quot; as exemplars or paradigms of human progress.

It is, however, what Kuhn regards as normal science,\\" Karl Popper. The demarcation of science and metaphysics is Kant's problem: when is a science not science? If Kuhn's paradigms are describing the avoidance of objective criticism then he is talking about something other than science even if it may be an interesting sociological analysis.We should recall that falsifiability is based on the the \\"modus tollens\\" deductive argument.If the theory is true then the inference is true.The inference is not true.Therefore, the theory is not true.Falsifiability is thus a logical property of a proposition that is vulnerable to refutation by a true existential statement. The propositions of concern to Karl Popper were universal laws in the form: all swans are white. This is falsified by the statement (if true): here is a black swan.Falsification is, in contrast,the practical demonstration that a proposition has been falsified. Unlike the decisive logic of the modus tollens, the real-world process of falsification can never be decisive due to the Duhem problem, the uncertainty of observations and other avoidence of testing by production of \\"ad hoc\\" hypotheses and so forth.Kuhn mangled Popper's distinction between falsifiability as a logical property of a statement and falsification in practice as though Popper had not already anticipated the difficulties of conclusive falsification. This was just straight out wrong but created an indelible myth from which have been launched many virtual Poppers. A paradigm indeed!Kuhn is also making a risky assumption when he says competing paradigms are incommensurable. They are linguistic frameworks that are potentially translateable. There is the potential to reach a change of attitude, albeit not easily. Fruitful discussions may arise from culture clash. We need the Tower of Babel, after all the goal is not certainty or justification but truth.When Kuhn maintains that scientific inquiry begins where criticism leaves off, and that it is not criticism but the abandonment of critical discourse for faith in a paradigm that marks the transition to science he is actually writing a script for a closed society. This view drifts towards a justificationist view of knowledge based on institutional foundations rather than a perpetually critical one.Corroborations and Criticisms. Forays with the Philosophy of Karl Popper"},{"Title":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions","review":"Thomas S. Kuhn wrote this classic work in the early \`60's. He sought to describe how scientific revolutions occur. The \`60's were famous for numerous social revolutions, most notably in improving the status of blacks and women in our society. Books such as Charles Reich'sTHE GREENING OF AMERICArather famously made predictions on the direction of permanent social changes in America that never reached fruition. His book is now in that proverbial \\"dustbin of history.\\" Kuhn's book is far more notable, and enduring, for providing a paradigm, as it were, on how shifts in scientific perception occur. The \\"as it were\\" refers to the fact that Kuhn is credited with first using the phrase \\"paradigm shift.\\"Kuhn postulates that there is a model, or paradigm, if you will, called \\"normal science.\\" Virtually the entire scientific (and even non-scientific) community subscribe to this model. The role of a scientist operating within the normal parameters of a given paradigm is to \\"tweak\\" the model; that is, make further advances in our collective knowledge, but within the model's framework. But there always seem to be anomalies to a given explanation of the natural world, and the anomalies can mount, and seem to reach a \\"critical mass,\\" (itself an expression from another paradigm shift), and eventually the entire paradigm is \\"shifted\\" to a new one. Certainly one of the most famous examples, cited by Kuhn, is the revolution in our thinking about our place in the universe, which was led by Galileo and Copernicus. Prior to this revolution, the standard model was that the earth was the center of the universe, with the sun, moon, and all the stars circling it. And they did so in perfect circles, because that is the way God would have wanted it. Perfection. But the observed motion of the celestial bodies mounted, perfect circles were imposed on perfect circles, in an effort to explain the motions, but eventually such structures became unwieldy, and unworkable. The time became right for the \\"paradigm shift\\" that stated it was the earth that circled the sun, which was just a small star in a universe full of them. Kuhn cites other examples, notably when Lavoisier published his paper in 1777 on the oxygen theory of combustion, which revolutionized our ideas on chemical processes. Yet another example is the 19th century theory that the universe was composed of \\"ether\\" through which waves traveled. That too has been discarded.Kahn devotes specific chapters to detailing how the anomalies mount to a given paradigm, a \\"crisis\\" in scientific thinking occurs, followed by a revolution in that thinking, led by a very few men, and our world view changes, which Kahn declares to be progress. The author quotes Max Planck to sardonically and sadly note how that progress actually occurs: \\"a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\\" Another enduring quote for me came from Francis Bacon: \\"Truth emerges more readily from error than confusion.\\"In the final chapter Kuhn raises, and briefly discusses some still very unanswered questions: \\"Why should the enterprise sketched above move steadily ahead as, say, art, political theory, or philosophy does not? Why is progress a perquisite reserved almost exclusively for the activities we call science?\\" \\"Why should scientific communities be able to reach a firm consensus unattainable in other fields?\\"I've read the criticisms of this book which are posted in the Amazon reviews. Certainly one of the most valid is that Kuhn gave very limited coverage to the paradigm shift from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics.Lastly, I first read this book on the plane back from Vietnam (yes, as in \\"the war.\\") I was in desperate need to think about something else, and found it somewhat comforting that in some human enterprise some forward progress was being made. Still, the questions that Kuhn raises at the end of his book remain as valid today as 40 years ago: why progress in science; yet in the political field - and by extension, war , for example, the same old stupid mistakes continue to be made over and over again. Kuhn's work remains a five-star read, and I am pleased to see that as of this posting, his book is in the top 1000 best sellers."},{"Title":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions","review":"According to Kuhn scientific thinking rests on paradigms, on universally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners. The term paradigm, he adds, relates closely to normal science. The paradigm is a body of presuppositions which make science possible. No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation and criticism. Without these presuppositions, all data are equally relevant and equally meaningless. Thus a paradigm is an accepted model or pattern which establishes what shall be regarded as science. It defines both the problems of science and the area of the answers. The paradigm refuses by nature, you can say, to tolerate data which do not conform the presuppositions.It follows that scientists normally aim to invent new theories, and they are often intolerant of those invented by others. Normal scientific research is directed to the articulation of those phenomena and theories that the paradigm already supplies. A paradigm is thus a criterion for choosing problems. Other problems are dismissed as metaphysical although they may have been relevant previously. Science, says the author, progresses rapidly because it chooses only those problems it can solve in terms of it s paradigm. There is no science without commitment to a paradigm. Kuhn points out that circular reasoning is used to defend the basic presupposition. In times of change each group uses its own paradigm to argue in that \\"paradigm\`s defense\\" with a \\"resulting circularity\\". Paradigms so govern science that all past science is reviewed and seen in terms of progress towards the present paradigm.What is the conclusion to this all? That science does not know truth, but builds its own model of a \\"truth\\" which it strives for. Modern science is operating on the basis of two mutually exclusive paradigms. First it assumes the eternal degree of brute, meaningless factuality. Second it assumes the autonomy of man as the sole source of law and meaning in a meaningless world.In terms of its autonomy, modern science refuses to ascribe any goal or purpose to the universe. But, again, in terms of its autonomy, it can visualize a scientifically guided and created goal. This is an out crying contradiction.This is a disconcerting idea, that scientists absolutize themselves and seriously plan to remake humanity in terms of their imagination. They dream the dream of reason, limited by themselves. The choice they have had was between God\`s paradigm and man\`s paradigm. The widespread acceptance of Kuhn\`s paradigm clearly means that scientists have recognized their religious foundation, and they have self-consciously elected themselves as god-substitute, because they say what \\"truth\\" is, they command what is right or wrong. They are the modern priests. It seems that the relentless juggernaut of science is swiftly shattering the world we know and generating a blizzard of ethical, moral, and legal problems which mankind is already being called upon to solve."},{"Title":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions","review":"New term and just getting into the book, so far it's informative and a good choice by the professor.

The world of science was, for that century, a seductive one and people of retentive intelligence found themselves enamored of its methods in their search for meaning post-holocaust and post-Hiroshima-Nagasaki.As I sit at a computer in Japan writing this, the job of the 21st Century must be to begin to make sense of our collective recent history and to find the common threads that connect us all on the planet in constant global discussion on present issues as they present themselves.The search for fresh perspectives is the real stuff of great science and we should feel compelled to race forward in search of them concerning our past. History will teach us, if we can understand and supercede it, as described so beautifully in Tom Kuhn's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions","review":"\\"II. The Route to Normal Science.\\" A nascent scientific field is characterised by countless competing schools trying to make sense of a morass of facts. Normal science can begin only when a paradigm has been established. The paradigm provides a common ground of concepts, separates primary phenomena from secondary ones, and interesting problems from subordinate ones, thus enabling detailed and specialised research. \\"It is hard to find another criterion that so clearly proclaims a field a science\\" (p. 22).\\"III. The Nature of Normal Science.\\" Normal research is determined by and loyal to the reigning paradigm. It is concerned with articulating and improving and extending the domain of the paradigm in the directions suggested by the paradigm itself. \\"No part of the aim of normal science is to call forth new sorts of phenomena; indeed those that will not fit the box are often not seen at all. Nor do scientists normally aim to invent new theories, and they are often intolerant of those invented by others.\\" (p. 24).\\"IV. Normal Science as Puzzle-solving.\\" Normal science consists in solving puzzles that the paradigm suggests should be solvable with reasonable effort. Solutions are sought and evaluated within the \\"conceptual, theoretical, instrumental, and methodological ... commitments\\" (p. 42) implicit in the paradigm.\\"V. The Priority of Paradigms.\\" Commitment to a paradigm is prior to commitment to rules and assumptions regarding what constitutes legitimate scientific method and subject matter, etc. Such rules and assumptions can be abstracted from a paradigm to some extent but they are not needed for normal science (where the model problems and solutions of the paradigm provide sufficient guidance). They are, however, very important when a paradigm is called into question.\\"VI. Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries.\\" \\"Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induces expectations that govern normals science. ... And it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected.\\" (pp. 52-53).\\"VII. Crisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories.\\" \\"The emergence of new theories is generally preceded by a period of pronounced professional insecurity ... generated by the persistent failure of the puzzles of normal science to come out as they should.\\" (pp. 67-68). Theories are often \\"anticipated during a period when there was no crisis in the corresponding science; and in the absence of crisis those anticipations had been ignored\\" (p. 75). \\"Philosophers of science have repeatedly demonstrated that more than one theoretical construction can always be placed upon a given collection of data. History of science indicates that ... it is not even very difficult to invent such alternates. But that invention of alternates is just what scientists seldom undertake\\" (p. 76).\\"VIII. The Response to Crisis.\\" \\"Confronted with anomaly or with crisis, scientists take a different attitude towards existing paradigms, and the nature of their research changes accordingly. The proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, ... the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals, all these are symptoms of a transition from normal to extraordinary scientific research.\\" (p. 90). The purpose of extraordinary research is to establish a new paradigm, since \\"once it has achieved the status of a paradigm, a scientific theory is declared invalid only if an alternate candidate is available to take its place\\" (p. 77). \\"To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting another is to reject science itself.\\" (p. 79).\\"IX. The Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions.\\" Debates about paradigm choice are necessarily circular. \\"Each group uses its own paradigm to argue in that paradigm's defence. ... [This can] provide a clear exhibit of what scientific practice will be like for those who adopt the new view ... That exhibit can be immensely persuasive, often compellingly so [but] it cannot be made logically or even probabilistically compelling for those who refuse to step into the circle.\\" (p. 93). There are no absolute standards to decide problems such as whether to accept Newtonian innate forces (p. 107) or deciding which problems are more important when competing theories solve different sets of problems (p. 109). Thus a paradigm shift can hardly be called cumulative. One may protest that paradigm shifts such as that from Newtonian mechanics to relativity theory is surely cumulative since the old theory is contained in the new one. But there are problems with this view. To derive Newtonian mechanics as a limit case of relativity theory one must identify, e.g., relativistic mass with Newtonian mass, when in fact the concepts are quite different, e.g., \\"Newtonian mass is conserved; Einsteinian is convertible with energy\\" (p. 101), etc. Alternatively, one may argue that the shift is additive since relativity theory only matters at extremely high velocities and we never had any reason to believe that Newtonian theory applies at such velocities anyway. But not much is left of science if it is restricted to confirmed instances only. In particular, normal science (Kuhn's sine qua non condition, as we recall) is impossible with this restriction (p. 99).\\"X. Revolutions as Changes of World View.\\" Also contributing to incommensurability is the fact that paradigms are conceived through \\"flashes of intuition\\" rather than systematic interpretation of data (p. 122). Indeed, there may not even be such a thing as paradigm-independent objective data. Consider the way scientists have viewed pendulums. \\"To the Aristotelians ... the swinging body was simply falling with difficulty. Constrained by the chain, it could achieve rest at its low point only after tortuous motion and considerable time. Galileo, on the other hand, [saw] a body that almost succeeded in repeating the same motion over and over again ad infinitum\\" (p. 118), a crucial point for his science. One can argue on psychological grounds (e.g., \\"the duck-rabbit shows that two men with the same retinal impressions can see different things\\"; p. 126) that \\"the scientist who looks at a swinging stone can have no experience that is in principle more elementary than seeing a pendulum. The alternative is not some hypothetical 'fixed' vision, but vision through another paradigm\\" (p. 127). In the case of the pendulum scientists could presumable have agreed at least on numerical measurements. But in more complicated cases even this can be paradigm-dependent. Dalton's chemical atomism failed quite drastically to fit reliable measurements. \\"Even after accepting the theory [scientists] had still to beat nature into line, a process which, in the event, took almost another generation. When it was done, even the percentage composition of well-known compounds was different. The data themselves had changed.\\" (p. 134).\\"XII. The Resolution of Revolutions.\\" \\"The transition between competing paradigms cannot be made a step at a time, forced by logic and experience\\" (p. 149). But this \\"is not to say that no arguments are relevant or that scientists cannot be persuaded to change their minds\\" (p. 151). \\"Probably the single most prevalent claim advanced by the proponents of a new paradigm is that they can solve the problems that have led the old one to a crisis.\\" (p. 152). Other arguments include successful novel predictions (p. 153) and \\"appeal to the individual's sense of the appropriate or the aesthetic\\" (p. 154). \\"But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem solving ability ... Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in the future guide research ... The man who embraces a new paradigm at an early stage must often do so in defiance of the evidence provided by problem-solving. He must, that is, have faith that the new paradigm will succeed with the many large problems that confront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with a few.\\" (pp. 156-157).\\"XIII. Progress through Revolutions.\\" Progress through revolutions relies on the fact that \\"scientists will be reluctant to embrace [a new paradigm] unless convinced that two all-important conditions are being met. First, the new candidate must seem to resolve some outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in no other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a relatively large part of the concrete problem-solving ability that has accrued to science through its predecessors.\\" (p. 168). The nature of normal science may explain why the sciences make greater progress than other fields: there is a shared paradigm rather than competing schools, focus on solvable problems, etc. (pp 162-164)."},{"Title":"Hand Bone Age: A Digital Atlas of Skeletal Maturity","review":"This book has the advantage of being available for Kindle.

Harland notes that while the NASA History Office will publish the &quot;official&quot; history of the Galileo Project in 2003, he is only providing an account of the spacecraft's journey and its scientific discoveries. After reading the book, though, one might well conclude that Harland is being too modest and that he has accomplished much more. Like his previous book, EXPLORING THE MOON: THE APOLLO EXPEDITIONS, Harland does not merely chronicle a highly successful scientific endeavor, he also adds his considerable knowledge of planetary science to the task of interweaving an interesting narrative with a highly readable interpretation of the science results; in this case, from Galileo's exploration of the jovian system, as well as from the many targets of opportunity en route to Jupiter. From the inception of the Galileo Project in the mid-1970's, through its repeated launch delays (culminating in a launch in 1989), through the end of its primary and extended missions at the turn of the century, Harland literally traces the circuitous, politically volatile, and often star-crossed journey of this highly successful robotic explorer. Unlike his colleagues in this genre (e.g. Henry S.F. Cooper, Eric Burgess, Jeffrey Kluger, etc.) Harland provides more than just a serial history. In addition to first-person accounts from many of the key scientists and engineers on the mission, he draws on a plethora of primary sources that include formally published, peer-reviewed science papers and conference proceedings to give the reader a very thorough lesson on the Galileo Mission. The book is abundantly footnoted and richly illustrated with hundreds of images, many of which have been composited and mosaicked by the author from original datasets. A minor drawback is that the illustrations are all black and white, but Harland does provide full references so that one may access the original data in the Galileo archives, which are fully accessible via the Internet. I highly recommend JUPITER ODYSSEY to all readers, beginner to advanced, all of who will surely gain new insight into one of the most successful interplanetary missions ever flown."},{"Title":"Jupiter Odyssey: The Story of NASA's Galileo Mission (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"At last ... someone's written the full story of this amazing mission. The story of Galileo - a true space odyssey for 2001 - is long and complex, involving much trial and tribulation. Harland has decided to concentrate on the discoveries rather than the drama - the failed antenna, launch delays and uncooperative tape recorder - although he does cover these topics well and with authority. This book comes into its own with the description of the often mind-boggling discoveries made at Jupiter, and the lesser-trumpeted but equally-impressive observations made at Venus, the Asteroid Belt and of the Earth-Moon system. I particularly liked the account of the kamikaze Jupiter Atmospheric Probe - the little package of instruments despatched into the atmosphere of the giant planet itself and which, despite all the telecoms foul-ups, still managed to send back reams of priceless information to earth from the interior of a gas giant! And all this, with 1980s technology. Thee is full coverage of the discoveries made at Europa and Io, the ''sexiest'' part of the mission. The account of the geology of Io is particularly good, and the chapter dealing with Europa is as up-to-date as could be hoped for. Harland does not ignore Callisto and Ganymede either - these moons have not had the coverage of their more glamorous siblings - yet under their icy crusts there may lurk, as Harland says, dark oceans. Jupiter itself gets a good show here, with an in-depth account of the bizarre meteorological processes operating on this photogenic planet. Some of the more ''obscure'' stuff is covered in detail too. Tis is Harland's forte - covering the nitty-gritty of a space mission, the often arcane details that other accounts leave out. Thus we learn all about Jupiter's complex magnetic field, the tiny moonlets some of which are smaller than cities, and some fascinating stuff about interplanetary dust. This is a good read, quite technical at times but there is a substantial glossary at the back for those of us who have difficulty distinguishing out faculae from our calderas. Buy this book if you are interested in space. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Jupiter Odyssey: The Story of NASA's Galileo Mission (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"I bought this book because I have made generally good experiences with books in this series, however, I was deeply disappointed by it. David Harland tries to cover the whole of the Galileo mission, but overall, I consider the book a failure. If you want to read a 500p+ NASA press release, this book might be for you. If you want a summary of the Galileo mission, without many repetitions, with factual scientific information on a popular level, however, this book is not for you. Many things, for example the cause for the Galileo launch delay and many important scientific results, are never really spelt out, the illustrations (all in black and white, by the way, despite what the cover might imply) are all the same JPEGs that you can get cheaper from NASAs web-site, and without the strong JPEG aliases that suggest that somebody tried to compress them even more, and I just could continue with that. This is unfortunate, however, since seldomly an author has attempted to cover the results of a space mission as important as Galileo, in such a detail.

Although the first couple chapters describe the spacecraft and deal briefly with the administrative headaches and unfortunate events that led to the greatly delayed launch, the bulk of the book literally follows the robot around as it makes its 6-year interplanetary journey and subsequent groundbreaking observations of remote Jupiter and the Galilean moons.Despite communications being severely hindered by the early loss of the high-gain antenna, Galileo was still able to send back lots of high-resolution pictures of the Jovian system as well as tons of readings from other instruments. Many of these pictures are printed in this book. The previous reviewer was correct in stating that the pictures on the Internet look better due to more dramatic image scale, but this is a paperback book and the pictures had to be shrunk to fit in. Nevertheless, many of the photographs are stunning, especially of Europa and Io, the two moons closest to Jupiter.The story really sheds light on how much was lost due to the failure of the main antenna, because instead of a few high-resolution shots of selected areas of the surface like we got, all four moons would have been covered in glorious detail. Anyway, it's still remarkable what the programming team was able to achieve with data compression.Also, the accounting of the numerous radiation-induced glitches and resets suffered by Galileo helps us understand how incredibly hostile Jovian space is. If a well-shielded electronic device encounters so many problems with radiation out there, how much worse would it be for living creatures??Overall, a fantastic telling of an incredible story, somewhat accessible to the layman but especially so to the amateur astronomer or space science enthusiast."},{"Title":"Jupiter Odyssey: The Story of NASA's Galileo Mission (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"Overall the book details the Galileo mission and at a level suitable for higher-level readers.

Friedman starts by going through (although briefly) the Federal Reserve's history (of failures), and then explaining what changes he believes would make the Federal Reserve more effective in tackling recessionary issues. From there, Milton Friedman provides a \\"program for monetary stability,\\" or his idea of an optimal structure to keep market players from taking advantage of a market economy.The book itself is not very long in page count (110 pages) but in each page, Friedman stuffs multiple ideas and theories that make the book relatively dense and rich. I will admit, the book seemed slow at times, but not because the topic at hand was uninteresting or repetitive- Friedman just has a tendency to delve into complex ideas or ideas that do not seem obvious at first. If you were to purchase and read this book, I'd highly recommend reading through with another source (the internet, for example) and keeping a writing utensil and paper on hand to figure out the market shifts Friedman explains about. It's almost like reading a mathematical proof: at times, to understand the steps and conclusions Friedman makes, you must work through his reasoning to understand the argument firsthand.Milton Friedman's more popular books, like \\"Freedom and Capitalism\\" and \\"Free to Choose\\" are written mostly for the general populace; \\"A Program for Monetary Stability,\\" unfortunately, is not; if you'd like to read it, I highly recommend learning some standard macroeconomic theory first, or at least going through monetary policy and banking.To conclude my review, I will admit that \\"A Program for Monetary Stability\\" falls into the pile of books geared more toward academia than light reading, but anyone who chooses the read this book will greatly benefit in understanding how the Federal Reserve's economic policy functions, and how there are possibilities to curtail inflation and maintain a sound economic policy that's more robust against wild peaks and economic troughs.I'd give this book an A+."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of a ranchman,","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in western history. Mr. Bronson gives an eyewitness account of the last Sioux Sun Dance which by itself makes the book worth reading. His eyewitness account of Dull Knife's heroic fight to lead the Cheyenne 700 miles from their Oklahoma reservation, where they were starving, to the nortern plains where they were finally captured ranks as one of the greatest stories of courage ever told. This man was alive, and intelligent enough to write about a time in our history, when our country was changing.

Just:1) Genetic heritage. The same genes that cause the parents to divorce have on average some effect on children's personality etc.2) Socioeconomic status. Single mothers are usually poorer.3) Lake of stability. Single mothers move from neiborhood to another more often than married couples. This is damaging the children social relationships etc.There are other interesting finding there.I am not the last word in \\"approving\\" the conclusion. But they look convincing.

Keltner, one of the nation's leading grain market analysts in the mid-20th century and a market wizard in his time. You might be interested in this book if you trade commodities, especially grains; if you find the history and origin of mechanical trading rules, technical analysis and pattern recognition of interest; or if you want to learn how an expert analyzes the fundamentals of the grain markets to make trading decisions. Keltner has a clear writing style that is conversational and easy to read. The book is well-organized and detailed. There are charts, graphs and tables to support his analyses and a good glossary of commodity market terms.\\"How to Make Money in Commodities\\" was first published in 1960 for two purposes according to the author: 1) to explain how commodity markets function and how trades are made, for those with little knowledge of the commodity markets, and 2) to explain how to trade profitably in commodities. Keltner points out the strengths and weaknesses of both the price movement or technical approach and the fundamental approach to commodity trading.My copy dated 1973 is the seventh printing of this book. Clearly Keltner's message resonated with many traders seeking more consistent results based on a methodical approach and modern techniques. He sums up the book with a chapter entitled \\"Rules You Must Observe If You Hope to Trade Successfully.\\" These are:1) Adopt and follow a definite trading plan, one suitable to both your temperament and circumstances;2) Trade conservatively, with money you can afford to risk;3) Never risk all of your trading capital on any one situation;4) Never depend on trading profits to meet regular expenses.I rate this book four stars. It has value as a well-rounded introduction to commodity market analysis, as a window into the mid-20th century grain markets and a succinct presentation of how markets work that is largely applicable even today. One star is deducted over the absence of a detailed discussion of risk management or position sizing (he does discuss the merits and drawbacks of using stops to limit risk)."},{"Title":"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Sketches of Sport on the Northern Cattle Plains","review":"Roosevelt purchased two cattle ranches in present-day western North Dakota, and many times went out to hunt for sport or for &quot;meat for the pot.&quot;Hunting Trips of a Ranchman in effect provides essays on the description, behavior, habitat, and survival of several species known to the prairies and the distant forests and mountain ranges. He talks of wildfowl (grouse, etc), elk, buffalo, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, black-tailed or mule deer, and finishes with Old Ephraim, the grizzly bear. All of these books are good for armchair readers who have never been to the western wildernesses or prairies, where these animals can be viewed with perseverance and patience.Roosevelt speaks of elk as the most noble of the deer family and perhaps the most majestic of all animals (which I tend to agree). He speaks of the incredible speed but also remarkable (and sometimes fatal) curiosity of the pronghorn, who are able to outrun any foes and keep in the open to see them at long distance with their excellent vision. However, they run in a straight line to provide a fairly consistent target for a good marksmen. He speaks of the enjoyable hunting of both kinds of deer, the difficulty of approaching the haunts of the bighorn, and his big finale, one of the best accounts of hunting grizzlies that I have ever read. Roosevelt's respect for the bear's ferocity is manifest, almost amounting to an admitted dread, which shows his good sense.If you are interested in the American wild, are curious about the habits and habitats of these large species, and are drawn to the hunting and outdoor mentality of the President who helped strengthen the national park system, this will be an entertaining read for you."},{"Title":"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Sketches of Sport on the Northern Cattle Plains","review":"This collection of Roosevelt's hunting trips and adventures puts you right out there with him, on the wild plains. The clarity of his descriptions and the easy way he takes you through his experiences has made this one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.

They give an excellent overview not only of the flora and fauna of the north plains in the late 1800s, but also an interesting perspective on the people of the place and TR. The only drawback was the writing was a bit dated, and the two books were a bit overlapping in subject. Nonetheless, highly recommended to anyone interested in the outdoors, US history, and/or TR."},{"Title":"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Sketches of Sport on the Northern Cattle Plains","review":"The prose of TR takes me back to a time in America, a time before my own, but a time that I so wish I could have experienced in the saddle alongside TR. While the prose may be somewhat dated, as an avid reader and author I find it refreshing and relaxing. I use the present tense of the verb because I never seem to tire of reading and reading TR's sagas of life on the plains and the pursuit of big game. Today such pursuit is mostly for sport and I am but one of many who enjoy this great adventure, even to its fullest. Life on his ranch in the Badlands however required such pursuit for sustinence and as such required patience and persistance in far greater excess than many of us today possess. Many who choose to pursue elk, mule deer or antelope could do far worse than to read and absorb the lessons of one of the great plainsmen of history."},{"Title":"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Sketches of Sport on the Northern Cattle Plains","review":"I felt strongly enough to review this book from actually reading and owning the two original books which comprise this one collection.Teddy Roosevelt came west after his first wife died to heal and in the plains he found the spirit which made the gentleman who would become a world leader.Hunting Trips of a Ranchman is an early work of Roosevelt finding his way in writing. It is a wonderful historic work of the showing of the sportsman over the market hunter in America with all big game species detailed on his hunts, and, how Roosevelt felt that the virtue of freedom was based in Americans learning to experience stalking game, living in the wilds all to create the citizen soldier.The Wilderness Hunter is my favorite for in this Teddy touches upon the prose of his soul and is the best work I have found so far in crafting a beautiful stories in the experience of hunting.I have read this book twice and it is still the one I reach for to carry along in times to keep me company."},{"Title":"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Sketches of Sport on the Northern Cattle Plains","review":"Enjoyed reading this book.

I heard that it was good, and was eager to read it since the author is one of our Presidents. I was not disappointed at all by the book. It is quite the page turner as Teddy Roosevelt describes his adventures hunting near the ranch he purchased after the death of his wife.The biggest surprise from the book is how well the former President writes. I knew that TR was quite an active man, full of energy and adventure. But, I did not appreciate the fact that we wrote very well. In this book he describes hunting several different types of animals - deer, buffalo, goats, elk to name a few. You practically feel like you are in the saddle with him on these numerous hunting trips. Although TR wrote this book over a hundred years ago, it still contains content that is relevant today.If you appreciate a good hunting book, and have not read this one, then I recommend you do.

His writing style is highly contagious. The reader is with him every step of the way whether it is in the prairie, up the mountain, in the valleys or deserts chasing deer, antelope, elk, bear, and cougar or simply gallivanting in the countryside during the 1880's.Adventures were many in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana and all points west. Broken bones and bruises were commonplace to our future twenty-sixth president but the man was as tough as nails. Although he mostly hunted for food, he did occasionally hunt for trophy game.The man absolutely admired the wilderness and it shows when he put pen to paper. His conservation efforts are still with us today.Many people think the openness of the west is nothing but desolate, empty nothingness.

He finds a scarf, two raincoats, an umbrella, and a leak in the heating system. Then he finds the corpse and his discovery sets off the usual chain of events: ambulance, police, news reporters.But the title is &quot;The Sleeping-Car Murders&quot;: more than one. And indeed, the other passengers of car number 4 begin to die, violently and seemingly at random.Underlying these deaths, though, are the corrupt, evil, and stupid motives of greed and ego. By the final pages, we realise that the incidents are not random--yet even then the denoument is darkly surprising.Japrisot is a master writer. His prose is spare and evocative. He is able to create memorable characters and dark suspense in less than two hundred pages. He sweeps us up into a mystery which is intricate and twisted, and he leaves us shocked and saddened by the evil of human kind."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Car Murders (Pocket 50206)","review":"Frenchman Sebastien Japrisot wrote mysteries that were quite different from the usual, formulaic tales; at their best, Japrisot's novels are complex, original, and stylish. The Sleeping Car Murders is typical of Japrisot's excellent work.The plot involves six people who are traveling on a train from Marseille to Paris; someone murders one of the passengers when the train arrives in Paris. Subsequently, other passengers also begin to turn up dead.Japrisot's plots are among the most complex and original in the mystery genre; in The Sleeping Car Murders, one of the characters describes what is happening by saying that the case is like a merry-go-round; the police are chasing the killers, who are chasing the police. The motives for the crime are so obscure that it seems as though someone has attempted to commit the perfect crime.My favorite aspect of Japrisot's novels is the way that he uses words to create vivid pictures in his readers' minds. We use all five senses when reading Japrisot. Consider Japrisot's vivid description of a simple scene in which a police officer makes a cup of coffee while thinking about a murder victim:\\"The Italian coffeemaker was beginning to whistle at him. He reached out, turned off the gas, brought the pot back to the table in the same motion, and filled one of the two cups in front of him. The steam from the coffee rose in little threads before his face. It was black and bitter, and as he drank he thought about the apartment on the rue Deperre: small, neat, well furnished, and smeling almost sickly sweet, like all the apartments of women who lived alone\\" (page 33).There are, unfortunately, some drawbacks to The Sleeping Car Murders. The plot is so intricate that it is almost too clever; I think that attentive readers might guess \\"who done it,\\" but it would be very difficult to guess \\"how done it.\\" (Owing to the novel's complexity, it would be a great book to read a second time). Given the complex plot, it is easy to feel bewildered while reading this book; Japrisot explains what happened, but the payoff to the reader is all in the last few chapters. The reader has to keep plowing ahead through the puzzling early material prior to the explanation. Fortunately, this is a short book (172 pages), so the \\"plowing\\" isn't onerous.Japrisot chose to tell the story in different chapters from the perspective of different characters. These multiple points of view challenge the reader and cause him or her to work harder while reading. With each new chapter, the reader must reorient him- or herself due the changing perspective.If you enjoy mysteries, but want a novel that attempts to break from the genre's limitations, The Sleeping Car Murders is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Car Murders (Pocket 50206)","review":"Sebastian Japrisot's extraordinary noir tale succeeds admirably. His characters are believable and convincing. The plot is intricate but not contrived and the denouement is nothing short of brilliant. Atmospheric and vivid, one can nearly taste and smell the settings within which his characters live the story. A great read."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Car Murders (Pocket 50206)","review":"The first Sebastien Japrisot I read was One Deadly Summer - a book that caused me to have too high expectations of The Sleeping-Car Murders. The Sleeping-Car Murders is best read as you would read any book by Agatha Christie, etc. etc. ... read as a book of the mystery genre the book is well plotted and has an excellent, surprising and realistic conclusion. However, the reader is unlikely to identify with the &quot;detective&quot;; rather it is easier to identify with the young woman coming to Paris for the first time. And unlike One Deadly Summer, most of the characters are painted sufficiently well to carry the story but not so well that the reader particularly cares what happens to them.For a delightly, fun and casual read, I recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Car Murders (Pocket 50206)","review":"Japrisot's mystery about a murder on a train has a detective that is rather uninteresting, but like another one of his noir novels, &quot;One Deadly Summer,&quot; he manages to pull off a brilliant and original denouement. Japrisot knows how to surprise. His prose is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Car Murders (Pocket 50206)","review":"Seemed I just kept putting this book down out of boredom, and maybe that's why the plot seemed so confusing--it just wasn't interesting enough for me to follow. The concept was good (that's why I bought the book) &amp; it's the frist Japrisot I've read, but it was lacking in suspense. In the end, the only interest I had in who committed the murder was so I could put the darned thing down for good."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Car Murders (Pocket 50206)","review":"Pierre Grazziano, or Grazzi, as he is known, is a Paris police investigator who would rather do anything else than actually strain his mind to solve a difficult case. Instead of worrying about bringing justice to crime victims, his department is more intent on office politics and not rocking the boat about anything. And there's nothing that will make you look worse than bungling a complex investigation.So it's not Grazzi's day when he is assigned to investigate the murder of Georgette Thomas, a beautiful 30 year old woman. She was found dead from strangulation, in a sleeping-car of a train travelling from Marseilles to Paris. There were five other people in the sleeping-car with her and its up to Grazzi and his equally unenthusiastic partner, Gabert, to interview the other occupants to find out who had a motive for the killing. The problem is that one by one, those witnesses are being murdered, possibly by the same person that killed Georgette.The Sleeping-Car Murders doesn't really have a lot going for it. Its plot is uneventful really and cliched. Japrisot is unable to build up any momentum or tension because of the overall boredom that comes through the policemen especially. I feel sorry for any crime victim that would expect these characters to take care of their safety. If you don't really have passionate characters, how can you make a passionate book? The only people that are mildy interesting are the other occupants of the railcar, which Japrisot reveals when he tells chapters from their point of view. But these soon pale because you know they are going to be murdered no matter how interesting they are. It also seems like the police would have made more of an effort to protect those witnesses once they started dying like flies. I guess that was too much trouble though.In conclusion, I thought this novel was pretty mediocre and seemed like more of a hack job than anything else."},{"Title":"With a Pinch of Salt: A Collection of Nautical Expressions And Other Stories","review":"This is a great, fun little book.The Authors extensive professional sea experience and knowledge of maritime history combined with alight humorous touch add up to a very educational and enjoyable read.If you ever wonder where a lot of the expressions we use today are derived this book will answer a lot ofyour questions !"},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"The initial quote from Clarke's Law, that the highest form of technology is indistinguishable from magic sets the basis for this book. And in reading the Harry Potter books and watching the movies, one can't help but wonder, how does that work in the world of Hogwarts? The bottom line is that the world of Hogwarts has got a technology that far surpasses 21st century technology, so to us, it does appear like magic. Think of what the Aztecs thought when Cortes and his men fired their guns. Surely they thought the guns were magic, as that was alien to their civilization.The Science Of Harry Potter is the name of this book. What science, you might ask? Well, how about alchemy, astronomy, biology, genetics, physiology, quantum physics, time travel, And there's some more, like history and mythology, on where creatures like Fluffy the three-headed dog guarding the Sorcerer's Stone and games like Quidditch were based on. He also incorporates work from Einstein, Rutherford, Hawking, B.F. Skinner, John Nash (A Beautiful Mind) and Kip Thorne from the Muggle side.The Sorting Hat, which sent the first-year Hogwarts students into their respective houses, might have had some interface that interpreted brain waves from the students, but there's also the concept of recognizing personalities a la Jung or Keirsey, so I wonder if the Hat's technology can correlate the brain's wiring with that of a Guardian, Rational, Idealist, or Artisan, to use Keirsey's classifications, and then say \\"Gryffindor\\" or \\"Slytherin.\\"The theory of time travel in the Muggle world is that one can't go back in time before the machine was built, and also to prevent a mistaken killing of one's ancestors, because then one would be erased from existence. Hogwarts technicians must've overcome that glitch. Hey, if it's possible in Dr. Who, why not in Harry Potter?However, the fact that Nicolas Flamel is based on a real life 14th century alchemist and that Queen Elizabeth I's conjurer John Dee was the inspiration for Albus Dumbledore will jerk some eyes open.As for an example of a psychological aspect of Harry Potter, Highfield uses bereavement syndrome to explain the Mirror of Erised, with the mirror as an output device that's receptive to the brain's trauma-ridden visions.Apart from using J.K. Rowling's first four books, Roger Highfield exhaustively used respected biology, psychology, physics, and medical journals, and history books as his sources.If one is of a highly fantastical and romantic nature, not wanting to spoil the magic of Harry Potter by possible scientific explanations, go elsewhere. Those who are able to accept Clarke's Law and assimilate these theories into the Harry Potter universe without it spoiling the magic, this book's for you.

The basic structure of the book so far is: XXX happens in Harry Potter's world. Here's some real-life science that is tangentially related...Here are some examples:\\"Wizards are able to teleport or 'aparate', sometimes using portkeys, like Harry when he won the Triwizard Cup. Maybe portkeys function by creating wormholes in the space-time continuum. Or maybe they make use of technology used by real-life scientists who have 'teleported' a photon from one side of a lab to the other. Such technology will probably never be able to teleport a whole person.\\"\\"Wizards at Hogwarts are sorted into houses by the Sorting Hat. It must read thoughts somehow. Real-life scientists can use functional magnetic resonance imaging to see what is happening in the brain when a person thinks. Scientists aren't at the point yet where they can read thoughts like the Sorting Hat, and they may never be able to.\\"\\"After the wizards are sorted into houses, how does that society function, given that the young wizards of Slytherin House tend to be evil, including Voldemort, the evilest of evil wizards? Real-life economists use something called 'game theory' to describe similar situations. A classic example is the Prisoner's dilemma. Imagine that Professor Dumbledore catches Harry and his archrival Malfoy's chum Crabbe. One of them has committed a serious offense that could cost their house points. He offers each one of them a deal...\\"\\"Owls deliver mail at Hogwarts. In real life, owls have some amazing senses and abilities. Owls are not really that smart, but real-life scientists have trained parrots to do some amazing things...\\"So basically there are a bunch of things in science that the author thinks are cool, and he uses Harry Potter as an excuse to talk about them. He does a decent job of describing the science. But the Harry Potter references are pretty gratuitous. This could just as easily be \\"The Science of Star Wars\\" where Wookie language and society as an excuse to talk about game theory, and Luke's land speeder as an excuse to talk about some sketchy antigravity research."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"I suspect that this was written as a gentle way of introducing scientific facts to younger readers. The Harry Potter books were written with something else in mind, and beyond sheer entertainment, give some interesting insights to the complexity of life, particularly as one grows up.By examining the various phenomena described in the Harry Potter books, Dr. Highfield discusses how some of them can be explained or approximated by technology. However, the subtitle, \\"How Magic Really Works,\\" is extremely misleading, since the explanations effectively sidestep magic whatsoever.Dr. Highfield is clearly familiar with the Harry Potter books, through the Half-Blood Prince, but some of his speculations drift away from the stories, such as his antigravity thoughts about broomstick riding.Mixing speculations about magic with the latest understandings of scientific theory is chancy at best, particularly since Ms. Rowling's examples of magic are at slight variance with traditional lore on the subject.For youngsters, the book may be a mixed bag, since the \\"magic\\" stimulating their imagination about wizardry is presented as being achievable, in theory, by muggle technology.For older readers, particularly those with some nodding acquaintence with current scientific theories, the book is entertaining, like something the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke might have written.The glossary is a high point."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"My Book reviewThe book I chose to read is called The Sciences of Harry Potter by Roger Highfield. Highfield makes ties and connections between the magic in Harry Potter to science. I thought this book was excellent and very interesting. He brought up so many ties and justifications between the actual connections between the science world and the magic world of Harry Potter. For someone who may not be interested in biology or really understand the concepts of biology, this book puts so many things in an understandable perspective. It was such an easy read, because whenever he would name a complicated biology term, he would explain exactly what it meant in an easy way so that everyone would understand. I just thought the whole concept of the book was so funny and intriguing. When people who love Harry Potter but hate biology see the title of this book, I think they would be instantly interested to read it.This book wasn't in the form of story and didn't have a plot; it was more of an information based book. Each chapter was based around the different magical aspects of Harry Potter and how it somehow relates to science. Although this book didn't have a story, it was about the Harry Potter series, and I don't know many people who don't like Harry Potter, and if you don't it is still neat how Highfield talks about so many aspects of magic and how it relates to science. So in a way the book walks you through the story of Harry Potter, just in a more scientific way.The book was not in the form of the story as I said previously, but it was written in a very philosophical way Highfield was pondering all the ways in which science and the magic in Harry Potter relate to each other, and if events that happen in the movie can actually happen in real life. For example he was talking about the owls and how they deliver mail in the movie. They would travel long distances to deliver mail to their owners. Highfield goes on to describe the different species that the characters in the movie were, and if they were actually capable to even carry mail, and how big they were. He also describes that in reality the owls don't actually make good pets, they are better off in the wild, like the rest of the wild animals. He also talks about Fluffy the three headed dog could possibly be explained by molecular biology. These are just a few of the ideas and thoughts that Highfield talks about.I would definitely recommend this book to read. Anyone who likes Harry Potter, or the thought of magic, or even science and biology, you would enjoy this book. It was very informative, but also had a humor to it. It was about characters and ideas that people know, but turned into an education science book.

How do you use this Harry Potter obsession to maybe get them to learn some 'almost real' science (some of the science discussed in this book is very much in the realm of 'under research' - but a lot of it is associated with existing prototypes/applications - even if in a very limited form...)I think the concept of the book is original - it tries to leverage the natural curiousity of the vast majority of HP readers - and use it to convey some cutting-edge discoveries of science. Note that most kids will have a hard time understanding a lot of the science topics in this book - without the help of parents. Quantum physics, relativity, psychology of time etc. - are not exactly middle school subjects...Still - it is a good book for adults and children - who have a natural curiosity for all scientific things (and who are, obviously, HP fans)."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"This beautiful book, although NOT endorsed or approved by JK Rowling or Warner Bros, is an insightful look behind the magic, myth and mystery that is the universally loved \`Harry Potter' books and films. This book is as illuminating as it is enchanting, by shedding light on not only magic in literature, history, myth and legend but also within science labs in our own world. With the success of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, interest in magic spells, charms and potions has never been greater. Drawing on the help of dozens of leading scholars around the world, Highfield is able to explain and entertain at the same time, making the remarkable world of magic even more real to those who want to believe...Full of fascinating facts and information that connects science with magic (a strange combination one may think!), this captivating and far-reaching book illustrates how the two are deeply entwined. Delving into the Harry Potter books, award-winning science writer Roger Highfield reveals not only why we still believe in magic but also how magic COULD actually work - scientifically! Full of factual explanations of marvels and mysteries such as Giants, Dragons, Broomsticks and all the other oddities of JK Rowling's magical world this absorbing book was something that I just could not tear my eyes away from. The author delves into the archeology of Witchcraft, tracing the origins of wands and speculates on the surprising connection between flying broomsticks and the bizarre drug-taking practices of Witches. Combining personal opinions and viewpoints with cutting-edge research that explains the invisibility cloak, the ability of the Philosopher's stone to turn lead into gold and much more this really is an astonishing read.This unusual, original book takes a scientific view on the magical world of Harry Potter that is truly unique and like nothing else you will have encountered before. What if science could explain that magic IS really real and that it exists in a form that perhaps we overlook in daily life? Thought-provoking, factual and spellbinding this mesmerizing, captivating novel is something that I urge you to read; even if you are a bit skeptical about looking at magic through the eyes of a scientist. It leaves you with questions lingering in your mind for a long time afterwards, as you contemplate on how magical creatures (i.e. Hinkypunks, Giants, Lobalugs ect.) Could PERHAPS be the result of Genetic Modification.This scientific book may be met with a differencing of opinion by readers, for its entire design is quite singular and so I advise that one should remain OPENMINDED. It certainly got me thinking...but I am still not quite sure about all the theories contained within!"},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"The Science of Harry Potter is a fairly interesting study both of how all the magic at Hogwarts can be \\"explained\\" by science and how science has diverged from the magic explored in Rowling's wizarding world. Some of Highfield's observations are entertaining, popularised discussions of quantum physics or genetic engineering, using references to the Potter books as examples (sometimes quite tangentially). Don't expect much insight into the Potter books, however: it's clear that Highfield has read and obviously enjoys them, but he doesn't explore the books in any great detail; they are mainly a starting point for him to discuss various scientific topics. The effect, however, is tremendously reductive: broomstick flying is seen in terms of drug-induced hallucinations, the magical creatures can be \\"explained\\" in terms of genetic engineering, and so on. None of this either endorses Rowling's prodigious imagination or helps one understand anything that happens in Harry's world.More seriously, Highfield seems not to understand the complex relationship between Rowling's magical and Muggle worlds: much of the first part of the book tiresomely demonstrates how all of the magical devices used in the books have some parallel in the \\"real\\" world through recent technology (such as invisibility cloaks that could employ fibreoptics). But who cares? All Highfield proves is that Western science has finally caught up with what Rowling's witches and wizards have been doing for centuries; he misses the point that the wizarding world doesn't need Western science in order to function, and that, in fact, Muggle science is a radically different way of understanding nature which has eradicated what has traditionally been called magic from the Western (Muggle) mind. As a result, he reiterates hoary old notions that \\"primitive\\" people--those who believed in magic--had a greater degree of \\"superstition\\" which, of course, can be explained away by modern neuropsychology, again missing the point of the Potter books (and demonstrating an appalling anthropological naivite as well).If you're interested in popular science books, this one's OK; if you want something Potter-related that readable and entertaining while you're waiting for June 21, then by all means pick it up. There is a very good study of Harry Potter, magic, and science that remains to be written; this one barely fills that bill in the meantime."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"I got this book for Christmas and thought, oh please, some cash-in on the Harry Potter books. By Boxing Day evening I'd finished it, having read late into the night and all the next day.It rocks!As JK Rowling wouldn't know an atom from her armpit, Highfield really uses the Harry Potter books as a platform for great scientific storytelling, asking the question: could scientists make these &quot;magic&quot; things really happen? The answers, often supplied by real authorities in the field, are usually yes - flue powder, genetically mutating monsters, even getting brooms to fly.The scientists he interviews really get into the spirit of the books, and show us that there really are places like Hogworts, full of impossible seeming wonders and wildly eccentric characters --They're called laboratories."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"An interesting way to get some kids interested in science. It's a little like a leader ad in the paper. I honestly was hoping for a less serious take on the subject, with more interesting artwork similar to what we see on the cover of the book. I have to agree with other reviewers and say that, for some people, this books contents could diffuse the wonder of the original Harry Potter stories."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"I've had my eye on this for a while and finally bought it for a relative. I've looked through it pretty extensively and concluded that this is not a book for the non-scientists (including myself) among us.Perhaps the first sign of trouble should have been the international scientific A-team that the author thanks in the introduction. This is exquisitely researched and really very interesting, but if you're expecting a cheeky offering with medium-hard scientific explanations, this might not be quite what you're looking for. For though it is fascinating, there's some complicated physics in there. If you don't have some significant college background in this, at least half of it will probably go over your head.If you're wanting fairly hard-core scientific explanations, this is a great choice. It's well-done and (I assume) pretty accurate. However, if you're looking for something a bit lighter, you might want to to look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"Reading this book is much like eating a Hershey's chocolate bar. It is a wonderful idea ~ what a concept! ~ and entirely delicious in the way it has been worked out. That is, unless the person eating it happens to be someone who's actually eaten chocolate previously. In that case, it is a waste of time; a bar of paraffin wax has a more chocolaty texture, and its flavour is not too far behind. I wanted to like Highfield's book ~ just as i want to like Hershey's bars ~ but i couldn't. Compared with the masters of general science writing, Highfield is just a little too forced, when writing about Harry Potter, anyway. He might have done better to have left the Potter references out altogether, and simply write a book of science ~ although he would then have lost his pretext for writing ~ so intrusive do i find them in the text. There are several times that i found myself truly enjoying the writing, so Highfield can do it; most notably, memorably, when he was talking about the wizard in our heads, and how it can deceive us, and about the origins of and necessity for belief. If only the whole bar could have had that flavour and consistency."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"I was disappointed with the subject and the content of this book. I was expecting to read about how magic can be like an exoteric branch in science. I wanted to read a scientific understanding of how magic can be like muggle science! Instead the book is full of explication on how \\"muggle\\" science is a magic in and of itself! While that can be interesting, it is not really pertient to Harry's magical world! This book centers on traditional science and is not about magic!But if you are looking for a book about muggle science as a \\"magic\\", then this book is okay."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"unless you have a degree in physics, i wouldn't recommend this book. i had a very hard time wrapping my mind around alot of the concepts. the book also has very little to do with harry potter and much more to do with all of the scientific advances out there that semi-resemble things from the books."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"For a piece of school A level coursework, I chose the book - The Science of Harry Potter - By Roger Highfield. His best-known work to date gives a flavour for the kind of writer he is, \`Can Reindeers Fly?' a discussion on the science of Christmas.I personally love to read, no matter what the book is about. However unfortunately, I struggle on the imagination side, and most books I find it hard to get my head around the fictional creations - Including many of the Harry Potter Books written by J.K.Rowling. So I thought this book would be great in explaining the scientific side of how the magic really works.I was very exited to get started on this book, and my aim was to read the whole thing. However by the second page I found myself confused at Mr Highfields intelligent, though odd attempt to straddle the imaginative worlds of science and fiction. I had hoped this book was an effort to introduce basic science concepts to young Potter fans (After all, It is these people who will go out an buy his book - simply because it has the word Harry Potter on the front...) But instead I was met with the rational laws of science, quantum physics to ethnobotany and cosmic antigravity?\\"While special relativity deals only with flat space-time, general relativity deals with space-time that has been warped by gravity.\\"It should be noted that you will not be able to levitate a broomstick after reading it...

However, a student of science knows quite well that there is no such thing as magic and a believer in magic probably has no purpose for science. Probably most troubling is that a lot of younger readers will be coaxed into reading this book and end up being overloaded with various theoretical branches of physics, some of which have little basis in reality.The tip off with my disappointment was right in the introduction where the author waxes poetic about how \\"science\\" and \\"magic\\" might be a matter of interpretation based on experience. As any student, even of young one, who paid attention in science class knows, science is demonstrable, repeatable, and usually published. The line between science and magic is quite clear -- there is no such thing as magic -- so the entire book needs to be taken with a grain of salt (Arthur Clarke quotes aside - his quote is about the perception of magic, not the reality).On the positive side, there are a number of interesting science topics raised that might lead a reader on to more serious exploration of the topics. And I suppose a die hard Potter series fan might enjoy finding some scientific justification for the imaginary world of wizards. Ultimately, this was disappointing to this science reader and Harry Potter fan, but your mileage may vary. But be warned, some of the science pointed out in the book is real leading edge theoretical stuff that is probably beyond the enjoyment of your average young Potter reader."},{"Title":"Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works","review":"Mathematician David Deutsch says a QUANTUM COMPUTER could be programmed to do just what Lord Voldemort's magic diary could do in \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\".MIT is using NANOTECHNOLOGY and a technique called \\"phased array optics\\" to build an INVISIBILITY CLOAK (for the Pentagon, unfortunately).

He loves flowers. He loves the way they look and smell. He loves taking care of them. And nothing, not even his father's tricks, plans and bright ideas are going to shake his determination.....

Max is determined to become a florist, over his father's objections, which make the tale seem almost like a plea for alternative lifestyle equality as much as it is a \\"be yourself\\" tale. I suspect this is not intended, but part and parcel of the story being translated from a different language. The text is certainly not harmful, and it isn't a bad story at all, so you may see what I mean whereas kids may not pick up on it.Either way, the illustrations are just priceless. They bring out a dimension of humor not necessarily found in the translated text. An early illustration shows Max's father waxing nostaligic over a thought balloon with a little pig inside, neatly covered in dotted lines denoting the various cuts of pork. Another drawing shows the Father Wolf shaving first thing in the morning! Absolutely hilarious illustrations abound on every page, as the Father is continually frustrated in his attempts to make little Max into a Big Bad Wolf.I suggest you try this one out.

However the subject presentation seems geared toward high school age readers. A number of interesting example files are available and they integrate seamlessly with the chapter material. But the real problem is as follows. The author(s) will show a project (brochure, newsletter, etc.) that the reader is going to create using MS Publisher. Then the author will direct the reader step-by-step on how to achieve the desired end result. For instance: choose this option, pick this menu item, highlight this text, insert this file, and so on. But the author never explains WHY we did these things. Consequently if a reader is faced with creating a totally different project than the example he just worked on this book is no more useful than if the reader never opened it.Books should provide the reader with the overall scope of a computer program and relate the underlying theoretical concepts behind the package so that when the reader is later confronted with needs unlike any of the included examples, s/he will be able to figure out on his/her own how to consummate the project.

Fade is the ex-seal and elite special ops agent whose been pushed too far, one too many times.In the beginning of the book Fade's career comes to an abrupt halt when he is nearly killed while attempting the rescue of a young Arab girl. In a typical bureaucratic snafu (situation normal all \\"messed\\" up), the government denies him the complicated medical procedure that would have returned him to work and full health and as a result he is on his own with nothing to show for a life devoted to the most dangerous missions imaginable. Now, years later, the government has once again come calling for his unique services. Only this time it's Fade who has no desire to help. Threatened and pursued by the government and in turn the police (on trumped up government charges/lies), Fade does the only thing he was ever trained to do when attacked. He attacks back, and with all the skill and imagination that had at one time made him the very best in the business!Thrilling and absorbing weekend end read!"},{"Title":"Fade","review":"After a brilliant debut novel, Kyle Mlls wrote three or four good but not great books. Not so for his last two. These are page turners deluxe. Three weeks ago I read and reviewed his tongue and cheek novel about big tobacco, called Smoke Screen and was extremely impressed. Now I've just finished his latest book, \\"Fade\\" and I am again impressed.The title \\"Fade\\" is the name of the protagonist - Salem al Fayad, Fade for short - an ex CIA killing machine. Fade is a born and raised in the US, Christian Arab, who after being operational in the Middle East in the late nineties, found himself seriously wounded - a bullet near the spine - which threatened to paralyze him. There was an experimental operation which could remove the bullet and the danger but his friend and handler Matt Egan was unable to get anyone to pay for it.Fast forward to present day; Matt is now working for Homeland Security and he and his boss, Hillel Strand have been tasked with setting up an overseas ongoing Middle Eastern operation and while reviewing the files of possible candidates, Matt's boss, to Matt's chagrin zeros in on Salem al Fayad, deciding he would be the perfect recruit. Matt tries to dissuade Strand but he is unyielding and insists on a visit to meet his new would be recruit.Fade (Salem al Fayad) is bitter about his previous shoddy treatment by his country. When the government wouldn't pay for his operation, he went to work for a Columbian drug lord, in Columbia, helping him eliminate some of his competition, in order to raise enough money for the operation but alas, when he finally amassed the needed amount, it was too late as scar tissue, congregating around the bullet made the operation impossible. So when his old friend Matt and the imperious Hillel Strand showed up trying to enlist his services, they were sent packing in no uncertain terms.Hillel Strand was not used to not getting his way, so he arranged for Fade to be arrested on some phony murder charge, wherein he would clear Fade, thereby making him indebted but as if in response to Murphy's Law, the worst case scenario ensues, putting Fade on the run and Strand hiding out from Fade, who now has promised to kill him. (This is the one weakness I found in the story - The sheriff sending out a SWAT team in the middle of the night to arrest a man on an anonymous phone tip)Even though \\"Fade\\" is only 311 pages long, Kyle Mills manages to give the reader a good feel for his characters. Both Egan and Fade are likable as is Karen Manning, who enters the story as the head of a SWAT team sent to arrest Fade. The villain, of course, is the self important Hillel Strand, with runner-up honors to Manning's boss, Sheriff Pickering. Egan is put in the middle of the battle between Fade and Strand and you don't know which way he will jump.As with Mill's previous six books the narrative is strong, smooth and fluid, without being wordy. As mentioned the book is only 311 pages and that is because he doesn't drag the reader into loquacious dialogue or go off in unnecessary directions. Instead he seems to reel the reader in by increasing the suspense on a chapter by chapter basis, in which the reader finds it difficult to take a break.I'm further impressed that Mills seems to have an unending array of divergent plots. This is his seventh book and while some best selling writers seem to rehash different versions of the same plot, like Harlan Coben, Mills has not repeated any characters, nor has any of his wildly diverse plots have any similarities. So far, when you pick up a book by Mills, you are reading a fresh, new and well written story. Expect Kyle Mills to make the NY Times bestseller list in the future and eventually become a mainstay."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"The story told in FADE by Kyle Mills initially seems...well, familiar. A Special Ops guy --- in this case, a Navy SEAL --- is retired, quietly living his life and attempting to exorcise his personal and professional demons, when Uncle Sam comes calling, wanting to bring him in for one last mission. The ex-op, who is the best ever at what he does, refuses. The government tries to force him into it, and things go downhill from there, with the ex-op taking on the Army, or a town, or whatever. Like I said, it sounds familiar. At first. But FADE cannot be dismissed as another Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. By the time movies like Commando or First Blood end, FADE is just getting warmed up.Fade is Salam Al Fayad, an off-the-scale soldier who was forced to retire as the result of a grievous gunshot wound sustained in the line of duty. A bureaucratic snafu denied him the medical attention he needed; as a result, the bullet lies buried in scar tissue near his spine, causing him irrevocable nerve damage and bringing him closer to paralysis with each passing day. When Homeland Security decides to create a covert military surgical strike team, a career bureaucrat named Hillel Strand thinks that Fade is just the man for the job and assists on recruiting him, over the objections of Matt Egan. Egan, who had worked with Fade in the field and was at one time Fade's best friend, is well aware of Fade's bitterness toward his former employer --- a bitterness that includes Egan, who Fade blames (incorrectly) for the denial of his medical treatment.Strand and Egan nonetheless approach Fade, who is living in solitude, eking out a living by building and repairing furniture while stoically awaiting the paralysis that will eventually result from his injury. When Fade predictably rebuffs the pair, Strand engineers a wrong-headed operation that sends a local police SWAT team to arrest Fade on trumped-up charges, a maneuver that is supposed to force Fade back into the fold of the U.S. government. Fade, however, believes that the SWAT team invading his home is actually an assassination squad, and successfully wipes out the entire crew, save for one: Karen Manning, the SWAT team leader, who is quickly taken hostage by Fade. Manning slowly begins to realize that Fade was set up, but it is too late.Strand, hoping to cover up his duplicity in the action that has gone so horribly wrong, has set the might and majesty of the Federal Government against Fade. Well aware that his days are numbered, Fade has only his wits and planning abilities to aid him in his final quest, which is to obtain the ultimate revenge against Strand.It would be easy to classify FADE as an extremely entertaining novel; indeed, it is a fast-paced work, one during which the reader never knows what will happen from one moment to the next. But Mills brings an element of moral ambivalence to the work that places it several steps above the garden variety explosions-and-karate one normally encounters in the genre. Almost all of the primary characters in FADE --- with the exception of Strand, and one other, whom we do not meet until the end of the book --- are innocents, cast against each other in a deadly dance where fates seem preordained and no one escapes entirely unscathed.FADE, in its way, is a modern re-telling of the Frankenstein myth, done up in geopolitical dress and given a new relevance for our times. While there is plenty of action here for fans of the thriller genre, there is much for thoughtful, if disturbing, reflection as well. Recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Fade","review":"I read the Kindle version of this book and there were so many typos that reading was not pleasant. The word \\"the\\" was frequently replaced with \\"die\\", and many times words were run together with no space between them. It is interesting how many ways a series of letters can be divided into different words. Stopping to interpret destroyed the flow. I wonder if this is a problem with the conversion from print to Kindle; however, I have not seen the problem in other books.I found the story line interesting if not realistic."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"When a book starts off with an early scene depicting the protagonist committing violent acts against other 'good guys,' you can be sure that you're not in for one of those stereotypical Baldacci book by numbers.Kyle Mills delivers a fast-paced thriller in which many of the typical twists and turns and unbelieveable romantic side stories never appear.

Torn from the pages of current events in the wake of September 11th, Mills weaves a compelling story of Salem al Fayed (aka Fade) a former Navy SEAL and CIA operative who simply wants to live in obscurity following his service to his country. A simple twist of fate (and some duplicitous government actions) makes al Fayed both the hunted and the hunter. Old friendships are challenged, while new allegiances are established. Character development is very strong, with the reader quickly coming to understand the emotional underpinnings of the characters in support of the main storyline and interwoven subplots.All-in-all, Fade is fantastic.

I have enjoyed every one of them, but Fade is his best yet because of the depth of the characters, particularly the eponymous character Fade.

I found it rivating and could not put it down-yet hated to see it end. Bravo!!!"},{"Title":"Fade","review":"Where to begin, ok, there was a fair amount of tension and excitement in this novel. Some interesting situations. However, the whole idea of a former Seal trying to kill his best friend and vice versa was a little hard for me to take. I am wondering if K. Mills knows of any former Seals who would do such a thing. Men who become Navy Seals are so throughly trained, retrained and double checked that a emotionally troubled person such as Fade would never make it. The process is too well honed to turn out someone who would react as Fade did to his situation.Also the whole idea of good guys fighting good guys was annoying to me. With the exception of Hillel Strand and Roy Bucker (another unrealistic character)the other main characters were honorable and to see them constantly trying to get the best of each other was silly.I also didn't appreciate his political commentary in which he attempted to make our soliders look bad or ignorant for following orders to destroy an enemy. He diminished the sacrifice that hundreds of thousands of men and women have made for this country by suggesting many times that what they have done was not necessary or that it was useless.Fade's character didn't make sense, he was presented as someone who was trying to kill his best friend, yet at the same time he joked around and seemed like a decent guy.There are so many things I could talk about, but basically I found the novel's premise to be jarring and unrealistic. I won't even go in to the stupid Elise character who was angry at her husband for doing everything he could to protect her and their child and for serving our country faithfully as he had.If you want to read something of this type where the good guys fight real bad guys, try Brad Thor, Victor O'Reilly, Matthew Reilly to name just a few. I won't be reading anymore of Kyle's books unless I am desperate for a way to pass some time."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"I am a huge fan of Kyle Mills - usually.This thriller is anything but thrilling. The title comes from the main character in the book named Fade. He is a sad, dejected, somewhat scary main character.He is asked to \\"help save his country\\" after this same country basically left him for dead. Needless to say, he is more than a little mad.While this would have been an excellent storyline, the main character is so flawed - and the other characters so little in touch with these flaws that the whole thing just falls apart for me.Usually Mills writes explosive stuff. This one does not even get a mild flicker."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"It was OK. Not more than that. Don't blame Kyle. You can't win 'em all.

As we've seen with many authors -- have some success and the editor pays you less attention. Shame. Fade is poorly written with a story that is just contrived. Not up to Mills' earlier efforts. Won't be bad for a summer escapist piece, but if you're like me and crave a good read every time you invest in a book, then Fade will let you down. I finally had enough of the poor writing and gave up about 10 chapters in. Sorry, Kyle.

I have upgraded to 4 stars based on the story alone, for a highly readable if not quite perfect thriller. And kudos to Amazon for listening to customers and fixing the problem; I have more hope for the Kindle format now.Original review:I am less than 50% into the Kindle edition, and so far the story is compelling but I am getting frustrated with flaws in in the text. Just to mention a few: at least once on every page the word \\"die\\" is inexplicably substituted for \\"the.\\" How could this happen? I can think of no explanation considering that manuscripts are submitted and edited in digital form these days. Also scattered through the text are words in the middle of a line with visible \\"soft\\" hyphens, and conversely several words are sometimes run together. These might seem like quibbles but the distraction of constantly having to mentally correct the text detracts from the reading experience, and if the publishers want hardcopy prices for Kindle editions then we should expect the same content. It only seems fair."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"THE TEASERThe novel begins with a unnecessary teaser, a loathsome device used to catch bookstore browers with upfront action, but usually confusing the reader. However in this case the teaser does not cause as much potential confusion to the reader because the structure of \\"Fade\\" is very simple and straightforward and features only three (maybe four, depending on how you count them) principal characters.THE SETUPThe central character in \\"Fade\\" is Salam al Fayed (nicknamed Fade), an American ex-special forces warrior/assassin. Fade has retired because a bullet is lodged in his spine. He is angry because the U.S. government would not pay for (what then was considered experimental) surgery to have it removed. Someday, the bullet will shift and paralyze him. The chief of a unit of Homeland Security decides that Fade the is perfect man for a mission. When Fade refuses the mission, the chief leaks false charges to the Virginia State Police which sends a swat team to apprehend Fade. The Chief's purpose was simply to get more leverage on Fade. Fade, naturally believing that the attack team is a special forces hit squad, spectacularly escapes, killing them all, except Karen Manning the team leader, whom he kidnaps That's the setup. The rest of the story is the chase by the police and Homeland Security (including Fade's friend Matt Egan), and the evasion from them by Fade and Manning.COMMENTSThe question of the futility/necessity of police action--including the police action on an international scale as practiced by special forces is a well developed recurring theme. Pacifist will find the arguments compelling. Activist law-and-order types will find the arguments equally compelling.THE VERDICTThe character of Fade is well developed and compelling. The story is very well told: fast paced, exciting, entertaining, often humorous, ultimately satisfying, and even gives you something to think about This is one of the best action novels I have read in quite a while."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"I've read a number of Kyle Mills' books and I'd say this one is my favorite. Tight and quick-reading plot with wonderful characters and a dash of mystery and suspense. I was thoroughly pleased."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"\\"Fade\\" has restored my faith in Mr. Mills. With none of the gratuitous sex and violence that marred his last couple works, he has managed to tell a compelling action story about an operative trained to deal with morally-ambiguous circumstances who is shamefully abandoned by his government. Do not misunderstand--I do not issue a blanket condemnation of sex and violence, we are all impacted by such and such themes have a place in literature. However, a fine writer can leave much to the imagination that a lesser writer will force his reader to wade through. I applaud Mr. Mills for having sufficient faith in his plot and prose to avoid unnecessarily explicit writing.Even though the protagonist is a wonderfully-drawn complex character, I greatly enjoyed the skewering of a governmental weenie-type. The kind of fellow who masters office politics and rises far beyond his ability, Hillel Strand is the type of person who avoids ethical dilemmas by construing all situations in terms of self-interest.Sure, Fade is an action story and there is plenty of fighting and high-end carrying on--but it is much more than that. The novel has a depth that was missing in earlier works precisely because it treats issues of deep moral import and resolves them with a measure of respectful ambiguity thereby leaving the reader to think about the story rather than merely turn the pages. It is about who issues orders, whether they should be followed and how such orders change the world.I was gratified to find that Mr. Mills has, at least in this offering, abandoned much of the coarseness that pervades action thrillers. In so doing, he elevated both his prose and the power of his story. In a world where the sympathies of combatants in the battle of good vs. evil are no longer easily identifiable, it pays to think about the consequences of power and exercises thereof."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"This is an exciting, can't-put-it-down, thriller, post 911, that asks some interesting if not ancient questions. But I'll get to that in a moment.Salam al Fayad, Fade, is American born of Middle Eastern parents who finds solace in the service, the SEALs in particular, where he discovers what he is really good at: killing bad guys.Matt Egan, also coming from humble beginnings, ends up in the SEALs but his forte is thinking the mission out. At the risk of a terribly cliched comment, Egan is the rifle, Fade is the trigger. The two become best of friends until a mission in the Gulf War gets fouled up and Fade takes a bullet in the back, the projectile ending up within a hair of his spinal column. No problem. There's a surgeon with a new procedure that can remove the bullet and Fade, we assume, would be at least mobile again.But the government gets involved (reference Ruby Ridge and Katrina) and 'they' refuse to pay for the very expensive operation.Karen Manning is a beautiful, educated, physically powerful SWAT team leader, hated by her colleagues because of her gender, threatened by her bosses who feel incompetant next to her, and, I guess my father would have said, additionally she 'has a mouth on her,' no doubt fueling the fires of resentment and envy.The government (Homeland Security) now wants Fade back in service but Fade tells them . . . . well there are two words and the last one is 'no.'So in order to pressure Fade who has buit is farmhouse into something akin to the gunfight at the OK corral, without telling Manning any important information like, Fade was the best they ever saw, they send her and her team to arrest Fade on trumped up charges. And man, that's just in the first 30 pages.Very exciting novel. But it also asks the question of what we do for the men and women we train to do the hard jobs? Do we turn our backs on them when they are of no more use? That's my reference to Alan Ladd's Shane in the title. Gunfighters, the men of Easy Company, Vietnam veterans. We don't necessarily treat them well.Mills writes a great story. Certainly one of his best if not the best. And he poses some uncomfortable questions along the way. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Fade","review":"Kyle Mills has written a few good novels, primarily involving his hard-luck FBI agent Mark Beamon. Beamon is not in Fade, but that doesn't stop it from being Mills's best book yet, a top-notch thriller that avoids the usual cliches.Fade is the nickname for Salem Al Fayad, an American of Arab descent who in pre-9/11 days was an elite government assassin, with a definite gift for killing. A mission left him facing paralysis with a bullet in his back and the government unwilling to pay for the only surgery that could help him.; to try and come up with the money himself, he did some mercenary work in Columbia for a drug lord, and though he got the money, it was too late. The surgery was no longer possible and someday he would become a quadriplegic.Now, six years later, ambitious Homeland Security bureaucrat Hillel Strand has decided that he wants Fade for a mission. He is discouraged by his co-worker Matt Egan, who was once Fade's friend, but Strand decides he will recruit Fade anyway. When Fade, now a recluse, soundly rejects the offer, Strand comes up with a clever ploy: frame Fade for a crime, have the police arrest him, and then Strand will bail him out on condition that he will work for Homeland Security. Karen Manning, a SWAT team leader, is tasked with arresting Fade against her better judgment.Unfortunately, she proceeds as ordered, and Fade, expecting a raid by Strand's men, routs the cops and kills most of them, with only Manning left as a temporary hostage. He realizes what he has done and is regretful, but knows that now his days are limited: if the stress of his new battles doesn't paralyze him, then Strand will have to arrange his death to cover his own tracks in this debacle. Fade vows to kill Strand and Egan and the cat-and-mouse game is on, with both sides switching between the feline and rodent roles.Besides Fade, the story also follows Manning and Egan. Manning has to deal with the fallout of the botched raid and her mixed feelings about Fade: he is a cop-killer, but it seemed to be in self-defense. In addition, she is involved with the hunt for a serial killer called the Collector. How this subplot is resolved is interesting and a bit unexpected. As for Egan, he's also been involved with his share of government wet work, but now he wants a quiet family life; he knows, however, that he may not have long to live if Fade wants to kill him; his ex-friend is far too adept at what he does.Mills is at his best with this novel which fits the bill as a page-turner. He avoids predictability, offers plenty of action and has a few dashes of humor to lighten things up from time to time. This is a satisfying read that really works well."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"In Fade, Mills delivers a thriller that holds your attention from first page to last. His main characters are well-developed and not the run-of-the mill action figures, particularly Salem al-Fayed. What keeps this book from getting a 5-star rating is that while the plot is filled with action, much of it is predictable. Further, several of the secondary characters are one-dimensional and stereotpical. While Fade didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it based on its very exciting first half of the book, it is still worth reading and a notch above many of the other recent books in this genre."},{"Title":"Fade","review":"A gripping tale very well written.Very hard to put down.Lost some sleep because I always had to seethe next chapter.The ending is very satisfyingGuy Dombrowski"},{"Title":"Fade","review":"Simply put, Fade is perhaps the best thriller book I have read to date. Actually, to be more precise Fade ranks right up there with the best books I have read across all genres.Not only does Mills deliver fast paced, exciting and clever narrative and dialogue, but the depth of the character development throughout Fade is remarkable (especially for a thriller). As I read this book, I began to really get transported into the story and start to truly \\"feel\\" it come to life. This of course made it very hard, if not impossible for me to put the book down once I had started it.The action sequences in Fade are also worth mentioning separately as they are very well delivered. Although I am no expert in the fields of law-enforcement and military operations Mills' depiction of these seemed very vivid and realistic to me.I highly recommend Fade both to anyone looking to get into the thriller genre and seasoned thriller readers alike.

It is the story of Hannah Kemball, 21 years old, who has to go with her captain father who she barely knows, on his ship to China in the tea trade, because her mother has just died. It is a wonderful look into the life and ships of the Victorian tea trade. She meets Munro, who has definate feeling for her, as she quickly picks up the sailing jargon and ability. In China her father makes a bet with a fellow captain over who will make it back to England first- and the wager is her hand in marriage! It is a great story of Hannah's independence, determination, and strength, without giving too much away. The only problem I had with it were all the sailing terms, which I know nothing about. But those aren't hard to get through, or at least brush over if you don't know them. This is an amazing story, and I would definately recommend it to anyone who wanted a good read."},{"Title":"Wager","review":"This seafaring tale involves an interesting concept: a bet between two ships as to who can get that year's tea harvest to London the fastest. Riding on the bet is not only money and prestige but the hand in marriage of one of the captains' daughters. This is a cool idea, but it was nearly ruined for me by the author's inclusion of plot points I just couldn't believe in. Firstly, when her father the captain dies, Hannah takes over the ship. I can't conceive of this ever happening in the time period concerned: there is simply no way that sailors would have allowed a woman to command them. It's possible that Woodman could have made her takeover more believable by giving it a stronger foundation in the plot, but as it is, I just can't suspend disbelief for it. Secondly, Hannah falls in love with the captain of the opposing ship. This is someone she's barely ever talked to, has spent no time with and essentially doesn't know. I could accept her falling in lust with him, but at the end of the book she apparently intends to marry this person, and there's every indication that they'll live happily ever after. That doesn't sound realistic to me. What saves this book somewhat, despite the rather shallow characterizations and the implausible elements of the plot, is the occasionally excellent quality of the writing. The author describes ships and the ocean beautifully."},{"Title":"How the Greeks built cities, (Papermac 184)","review":"This is a wonderful book which describes the way Ancient Greeks planned and built their cities, fortresses, harbours, etc. It explains the cultural roots of Greek architecture and the importance of the public buildings, especially the agora.

Since she is obsessed with Teletubbies I bought her a bunch of used Teletubbies books for Christmas. She loves them! She brings them to me to read to her several times a day and also sits by herself, engrossed in \\"reading\\" them. She \\"reads\\" them out loud, mimicing me exactly in tone and cadence - except she doesn't manage to get a single English word in there *grin*. She even makes her voice high to do the Teletubbies voices, like I do. They are short and simple and have plots and actions a toddler can understand.This particular one is her favorite. She opens the first flap again and again, laughing and laughing as I exclaim \\"PING! It was a door!\\" Then she loves to lift each flap, finding more and more Teletubbies.It took a month and alittle effort for me to bridge the gap to non-Teletubbies books, but I am happy to say she now loves other books to. However, the Teletubbies are still her favorite, and I just ordered a couple more. (She has way more tolerance for \\"PING! It was a door!\\" in ten repetitions five times a day, than I do!)"},{"Title":"Lift-the-Flap Board Book: Big Hug (Teletubbies)","review":"I bought this book used, and it was in really nice condition.

Mr. Reed builds believable characters and knows his southern history."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"Naturalist and adventurer Redmond O'Hanlon's first travel tome is a timeless classic. His well-observed descriptions of nature are charmingly lyrical and his dry wit (and thatof fellow traveller, reknowned poet James Fenton) will leave you laughing on every page. Think Bill Bryson meets Charles Darwin and you might approximate O'Hanlon's writing style.I have read all three of his travel books - this one twice - and though \\"No Mercy\\" - his Congo odyssey, is the most breathtakingly ambitious and epic in scope, \\"Borneo\\", a lighthearted romp, remains my sentimental favorite.The reader should have a healthy taste for nature and anthropology to fully appreciate any of O'Hanlons works. Birds, insects and trees share equal billing with the human cast. ButO'Hanlon's infectious enthusiasm for flora and fauna, his deprecating humor, his gift of hyberbole and capacity for capturing the nuances of character are enough to keep anyoneglued to the page.Also in this book (and even more so in the ribald \\"No Mercy\\"), there is a surprising amount of sexuality, as the libidinous habits of the Ibans are often as frankly observed as the matinghabits of the Hornbills,Kingfishers and rhinos, adding voyeur to O'Hanlon's talents as naturalist and humorist."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"The book is about two educated englishmen who venture to the island of Borneo determined to capture the the sights of a rare albino rhino. The author sets the humor rolling straight off, and in his sardonic wit, recounts his adventures into the rainforest of Borneo.Duly noted are the risks to life and limb (and appendages)he must be aware of during his adventure. These lessons are given to him by his good natured guides who taunt and tease the overweight white (very white) man. All in good fun, the banter flows both ways. Descriptions of their meals may take a tough stomach on the part of the reader. He spared the reader nothing when it came to describing the delights of dinnertime. The recollection of some repasts, especially the gourmet monster lizard meals were among the more memorable (unfortunately). It was amazing what they scrounged up to eat. I will not spoil all the little surprises they had at mealtime, you will know soon enough when you read the book!Aside from the culinary experience, I found the travel journey delightfully funny and educational. While I know this is NOT the kind of trip I would care to have, I appreciate that the author had the guts to do it. At times, he doubted his stamina, but that is what made the novel work - he was a regular guy doing something outrageously difficult, not to mention dangerous. I can see that this kind of adventure would appeal to many others, but for me, I took his trip in an armchair where I was safe and knew what I was eating for lunch!He is a charming writer, hooking the reader with teasing references. I admit I learned alot about their culture and some of their more sensitive political and social issures. A quick read, I went out and bought more of his books and look forward to a similar experience."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"If a book has Redmond O'Hanlon's name on it, buy it. While reading this book, when I wasn't laughing out loud (and I never laugh out loud) I was enthralled with the subject matter. I hate to compare writers, but think Paul Theroux (but not mean), David Quammen and throw in a little Tim Cahill for good measure and you come close to Redmond O'Hanlon. I've read a quite a few travelogues and Redmond O'Hanlon represents the very best of the genre."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"This the fifth book I've read on traveling in Borneo, and in certain ways it rivals my favorite (Eric Hansen's \\"A Stranger in the Forest\\"). O'Hanlon is not only literate and well-informed on the subject (Borneo), but he's one of those highly-educated writers who doesn't take himself (or his elderly, unathletic) traveling companion (a famous poet) too seriously. The screamingly funny parts are when O'Hanlon is either making fun of himself sweating like a pig, covered with flies and falling down or up one muddy trail or another while his Borneo native guides are laughing themselves silly at his ineptness. O'Hanlon is fat and out-of-shape and his small, powerfully strong, local guides never let him forget it for a minute!O'Hanlon is able to describe characters so well, one feels as if you are on the boat with them; the three guides are lovingly drawn (unlike other travel writers who don't view their local guides as complete people).For those with an interest in the ecology of Borneo, birds, or river journeys, there is much to learn through this engrossing read. I recently saw a documentary that filmed the \\"remote\\" areas where O'Hanlon's journey took place and I am sad to say it has been totally deforested by the Indonesian timber industry; huge corporations that are destroying the Borneo rainforest due to graft and a lack of enforcement by the Indonesian goverment... Subjects that O'Hanlon writes about in this book. Think twice about buying teak furniture, much of it comes from poached wood that is illegally cut from Borneo's rainforest, a sad coda to this funny book."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"I picked this book up while I was vacationing in Holland several years ago. I found it to be one of the funniest books I have ever read. It tells about two friends looking for the elusive albino rhino in Borneo. The first few pages were completely riotous - how they were getting ready for the rigors of jungle travel made me fall out of my chair from laughter. This book is written by a funny guy! It tells his own story, in his own words from his point of view. It is sincere, hilarious and sensitive. A very good story! If you do not want to laugh, do not read this book. If you want to experience some humor in life about a place the majority of us will never go, read it and enjoy! Lighten yourself up a little!"},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"There are three things you should know about Redmond O'Hanlon's Into the Heart of Borneo: it's very educational, it's very funny, and it's a heckuva good adventure. The premise is that two middle-aged British academics, poet James Fenton and naturalist Redmond O'Hanlon, are dispatched to Borneo in search of the rare mountain Rhinoceros. Whatever their ultimate goal, after two pages you're hooked by O'Hanlon's clever writing and self-deprecating wit as he describes the preparations for their epic journey.You can learn a lot from this book. For example, did you realize that Borneo is the world's third largest island? that over 1,700 different species of parasitic worm can infest your bloodstream? that a bite from a Wagler's Pit Viper will lead to nothing worse than near-death? On the more substantive side, you will also learn about Borneo's history, native cultures, geography, flora, and fauna-especially its amazing birds! And funny? the education you'll receive about Borneo is a bonus because the book could carry itself quite successfully on O'Hanlon's hilarious writing. Imagine two English intellectuals travelling by foot and canoe through remote rainforest with three Iban tribesman; one of whom, Leon, could host the Letterman Show.I giggled continually throughout this book. One passage describing how Redmond and the Iban planned to \\"take Jam's head\\" upon returning to camp where a nervous but unsuspecting James was waiting had me laughing with glee.As a fellow middle-aged, balding, and slightly pudgy man, this book gave me great hope that I too could travel to Borneo and survive such an adventure. Read it to learn about Borneo. Read it to laugh. Just read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"I lived in Borneo during the same period that this trip was made. O'hanlon has done a wonderful job of capturing the essence of this magnificent land. I traveled the Baram river and found the experiences very similar. The Iban and Dayak are true party animals."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"This twenty-five year old tale of two Brits being transported by their faithful guides into the deepest jungle of Borneo is amusing and interesting.Redmond O'Hanlon and the smoking (as in smoking) James Fenton (improbably) the Queen's Poet Laureate embark on a journey to discover the highest mountain of Borneo and hopefully the white Rhino, possibly an island dweller and certainly unseen in decades.O'Hanlon takes a whimsical approach to this travelogue. The stars are his faithful tribal guides and the locals he meets as he journeys up river and away from modern life. Particularly enjoyable are the village stops where he and his crew are (usually) met with feasts, libations, dance and the occasional memory from the local chieftain's female relatives. The clash of cultures provides many funny moments without slipping into condescation.Although there is a lot of discussion of birds and waxing about the various properties of rushes, finches, yellow-bellied-sap-suckers and the like, the book is informative and interesting with the occasional chuckle thrown in. Altogether an enjoyable arm chair trip."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"This book is spit-your-Coke-out funny. I have read more than 100 travel/adventure books in the last ten years for work-related reasons and Into the Heart of Borneo is the very best one. O'Hanlon's other books are good but this first work is sublime. The only American writer that can compare to him is W. Hodding Carter."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"I stumbled upon Mr. O'Hanlon's account of his jouney into deepest, darkest Borneo and thoroughly enjoyed his humorous account of travel that is well off the beaten path.

I recommend any of his travel books."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"... comic ?It describes with no frills the jungle of Borneo and the life of its inhabitants, with some parts that seems written by a real comedian !If you like south east Asia and travel books IT IS something to read."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"With the exception of the first two or three chapters and about 20% thereafter, this travelogue/jungle study is a real snooze.The best of the book begins on page two where a Major Malcolm explains the potential dangers that lie ahead for the men. It ends on page six. Perhaps you are best reading only those pages in the library and then putting this back on the shelf.One thing you will learn for sure if you make it halfway is that Bertram E. Smythies wrote \\"Birds of Borneo.\\" The author refers to both about every five pages. If you are someone who likes knowing the Latin name for all species encountered on a trip through a jungle, you're in for a treat. If you are an ornithological aficionado or expert of any kind, this is no doubt a must read.But unless you are the kind of person who enjoys plowing their way through a tired, often confusing account written a man plodding through the jungle, I suggest you forget this one. Supposedly Redmond O'Hanlon has written better. Personally I'd try my luck with any number of other travelogue writers before trying another of his."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"Indeed, another reader stole my words: This is O'Hanlon's first, but not his best book. I too read the Orinoco book first, and found it fantastic. Edmond is crazy, and knows how to write about it. I fell for him head over heels. So imagine my disappointment and trying to chew myself through his trip to Borneo.... Luckily his third big book, about a trip to the heart of Africa, has the stroke of the master again. O'Hanlon, the last nutty professor !!"},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"From the first page, Redmond O' Hanlon shows us his true sense of humour. His adventure accompanied by poet James Fenton, Iban guides (Dana, Leon, Inghai) was looking for Borneo rhinos and it's a fun adventure indeed. Unfortunately, O' Hanlon doesn't stop his writing in the adventure's climax, he just continue and make the ending's very poor."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"Having read Eric Hansen's insightful Stranger in the Forest, I set about looking for more travelogue on this amazing island. O'Hanlon's book, unfortunately, doesn't shape up as insightful reading. The book is sprinkled with humorous and terrifying details which O'Hanlon knows are fun and engaging reading. At the same time, the attention to personal details, specifically his own discomfort, make this more of a whiner than a winner as far as travelogues go."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"A disappointing book. I made the mistake of reading In Trouble Again, Mr. O'Hanlon's second book, first. It was a more interesting adventure travel book than this one. At least it's nice to know Mr. O'Hanlon is getting better. If you've never read him, don't start with this book. A good story, whether fiction or non-fiction, has a beginning, a middle, and an end. This book has mostly a middle. However, it is readable through to the end, a quality that separates it from unreadable books adventure books which I would rate 5 or lower"},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"This was sent me by David Baboulene, who also sent me Mayle's A Year in Provence. Both of these books are considered humorous books on travel, but they couldn't be more different. Mayle's book is like a TV sitcom in some ways--that is, everything is familiar enough to us at sight, but it is the occurrences that seem to work at odds. In O'Hanlon, we are lifted bodily out of the world we know and placed in a situation where it is truly difficult for the modern person to cope. O'Hanlon understands the modern fears--of insects, leeches, snakes, aboriginals--but instead of horror, he plays them as mock horrific. Repetition breeds humor (as fans of Saturday Night Life know well). Still, this book is also full of information. Things like:... b) the longevity of memory in a place fairly devoid of writing, seen through the relations between the Ukit and Iban tribes; and c) the descriptions of the leeches, including the thin, threadlike one which hides in the water, attached to a rock, waiting to be drunk by some animal, and then attaches itself to the inner walls of the throat. Overall, an excellent book; however, I was more amused by the Mayle."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"The so called British humour! Here it is not always very entertaining if not flat. The art of humour should be not to practise it at the cost of others.The inhabitants of inner Borneo might be \\"primitive\\" in comparison with us, but their mind is not necessarily less civilized. Everybody who has visited primitive people and tried to get acquainted with their way of thinking has the opportunity to learn that they are not different to us and that in each one are the same capabilities that are found in our human race everywhere.I regard it as doubtful whenever book writers take a commercial advantage when they design their individual pictures of other people which they have not studied thoroughly. Such kind of reports may impress those who stayed at home, which is not at last due to the expectation of the reader.But the reality has a different look. Maybe my different experience in the inner of Borneo is owed to the fact that I was not in the same place, but I fear it would have impressed me even less. For me the book was boring. You do get some knowledge about the indigenous people and birds which both are not fit for cage-holding. But not so much more. How the protagonists behave in the jungle is partly nave or distressing, at least they see it as such. What types of drifters and trampers populate our last virgin forests! Poor natives!Nevertheless it is an astonishing performance to make money with such an eventless story, in which there is nothing spectacular found, neither inside nor outside, without deeper insight in the course of the wildlife and the ways of the wild people. This is what makes a good author, make a lot out of less. And the reader consumes it! Respect! But for anybody who wants to know how the proper rainforest and the people who live there is, I cannot recommend this book. Better read Alexander von Humboldt\`s South American journey."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"It was a few years ago that I had the incredible opportunity to visit Sarawak and Sabah.

Yes, because these two old British stuffies set off on this journey just the way most \\"inexperienced\\" travelers would -- by the seat of their pants. No, because I think I would like a better idea of cuisine before I went.This charming narrative of two British amatuer travelers inspires humor and awe. Of course they get into all sorts of problems and handle them with dry wit. But they also give stunning and lyrical descriptions of the people and the places they visited.This was a living travel adventure without a tour-guide in sight.Best of all, our intrepid souls showed respect and genuine affection for the native peoples they met. I didn't see any bigotry in this book -- except that which they found in themselves and discarded with ease.Readers should be warned that many of the descriptions of the cultures they visited are very vivid and weak stomachs may not enjoy the unflintching pictures the story evokes."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"O'Hanlon's hillarity almost hides the fact that he is one hell of a writer.

I usually enjoy most readings assigned but this book was drab and dull. It read like the author was trying to write his version of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I didn't even finish the book, it was that bad. I later discovered that the author wrote this book years (perhaps decades?) after leaving Borneo. He wrote too many detailed things from random days and nights that any person would be hard pressed to remember. Not worth the time to reading when you think it's non-fiction. I highly question the validity of this being a truthful telling."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"The viewpoint of an educated Englishman and his bookish sidekick regarding the most primitive humans on the planet is a 'rare bird' in the travel and adventure sector.

A middle-aged academic decides on an expedition to Borneo, accompanied by his buddy ... a poet. Hard to imagine two men more ill-equipped for such a difficult jungle trek. But thanks to some local guides who accompany them, they survive to tell the tale. Yes, it's a rip-roaringly funny one, but don't go thinking this is nothing but bungle in the jungle silliness. O'Hanlon knows his plants and birds and rocks and other things, and his observations are very astute and illuminating. Educational, enjoyable, laughable; this book has it all. A true travel classic."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"This was a great surprise. Borrowed it from a relative and found it was absolutely hilarious.

If you just want to laugh at another culture and the experiences of two Brits exaggerating their hardships then read this. They are funny, but too often I found myself annoyed by their condescension."},{"Title":"Into the Heart of Borneo","review":"This classic travel adventure recounts a 1983 trip into, well, the heart of Borneo by the author, Redmond O'Hanlon, his friend the poet James Fenton, and three local Iban guides. The purpose of the trip is, ostensibly, to try to rediscover the Borneo Rhinoceros that is believed to be extinct. The story evolves around the unlikely party's boat trip upriver from Kuching on South China Sea to Mt. Batu Tiban. The trip is at times dangerous, as they traverse rapids and face other natural challenges en route. Along the way the troupe comes across other ethnic groups--some of whom bear generations old grudges against the Iban--and engage in riotous celebrations with them. The book includes much interesting information about the people who live in inland Borneo. Redmond O'Hanlon is a naturalist by training (Oxford) and was for years the natural history editor for the Times Literary Supplement, so inevitably the book contains frequent passages describing the nature--especially bird life--that they encounter. The sympathetic Iban will have many a good laugh on account of the two clumsy Britons. In the end they confess that they never believed they'd be able to complete the trip, O'Hanlon being too fat and Fenton immensely old. O'Hanlon observes the world around him with a keen eye for detail and writes it all down in fabulously engaging prose. His sense of humour and self-depreciating style, as well as openness and empathy guarantee that this travel memoir is a definite winner."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"I'm a big, big fan of Ian McEwan's. I've read and loved virtually everything he's written, especially \\"Black Dogs\\" and \\"Atonement\\", so it's doubly disappointing for me to say that \\"In Between The Sheets\\", his second collection of short stories, is without doubt the worst and only substandard piece of work he has put out so far. Granted, what we have here is very early McEwan but that doesn't excuse the amateurish and shoddy quality of these mostly pointless vignettes. \\"First Love, Last Rites\\", his earliest work, wasn't McEwan at his prime but it was more than halfway decent and contained more than a trace of promise of his developing craft as a short story writer and novelist. \\"In Between The Sheets\\" just seems like scraping the bottom of the barrel.I can't name anything in here that is remotely memorable. Indeed, it was so bad I hardly finished the book. \\"Pornography\\" is mundane and pedestrian. It's been done to death (and better) by others. \\"Reflections Of A Kept Ape\\" almost succeeds - could the ape be the retarded child of the woman ? are the ape's sexual fantasies just its hallucination ? I haven't a clue what \\"Two Fragments\\" is all about. \\"Dead As They Come\\" is ludicrous. By the time I got to \\"In Between The Sheets\\", I lost interest and couldn't wait for this slim volume to end.The publishers should quietly delete this title from McEwan's catalogue as it diminishes his tall standing among the great contemporary writers of today."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"Ian McEwan has always been the doyen of the macabre. In this, his second collection of stories, his language can be both resonant ('I do not care for posturing women but she &quot;struck&quot; me') and profane ('I love the scent asparagus lends the urine'). Whether describing the 'love' of a tailor's dummy or bondage games in a metropolitan setting, McEwan's prose is masterly and his insights unsettling. Excellent but not as great as his earlier volume, 'First Love, Last Rites.'"},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"In these sketches, McEwan examines sexual and relationship dysfunctions. Each story has a bizarre twist-- which the characters never seem to recognize as strange-- that is used to emphasize the futility of human emotion. The effect is similar to \\"magical realism,\\" where an author uses supernatural elements but treats them as commonplace. Here are a few examples:\\"Tales of a Kept Ape\\" is told in first-person, through the eyes of a frustrated lover who cannot understand why the woman he adores has alienated herself from his affections. Bizarre twist: The jilted lover is a pet ape the woman has been sleeping with.In the title story, a middle aged divorced father worries that his fourteen year old daughter has fallen into a lesbian relationship with an older woman. Bizarre twist: The older woman is a three-foot dwarf.In \\"Dead as They Come\\", we watch an obsessive, arrogant millionaire fall madly in love with a woman, only to destroy the relationship out of uncontrollable jealousy. Bizarre twist: The woman is a department store mannequin.My complaint of these stories is that the bizarre \\"twists\\" are never explicitly dealt with by the characters. It's as if McEwan wants us to believe that loving an ape, or a dwarf, or a mannequin is no less strange (or less hopeless) than loving another human being. So, each tale becomes a plodding, why-can't-we-get-along diatribe that is neither interesting nor enlightening."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"Not as good as or as provocative as the other short story volume (First Love, Last Rites), but still worth reading..."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"If I had only read \\"Two Fragments: March 199-\\" and \\"To and Fro\\" from this early collection of short stories when they were published in 1978 by one of my favorite writers, I would have read no more and would have missed out on his later wonderful novels. These two stories should be forgotten. Mr. McEwan turns up the heat in three of his stories, which I would label the bizarre. \\"Pornography\\" is the tale of O'Bryne who is having a sexual affair with two women simultaneously. When each woman finds out about the other, O'Bryne meets his Waterloo as the two women descend on him, tie him up and sterilize surgical instruments. \\"Reflections of a Kept Ape\\" is told from the viewpoint of an ape, a former lover of his mistress. The narrator in \\"Dead as They Come\\" is in love with a store mannequin, whom he purchases and takes home with him. The remaining two stories are beautiful and good indicators of what is to come in McEwan's later fiction. \\"In Between the Sheets\\" is a sexually charged account a father whose fourteen-year-old daughter and her midget girl friend visit him. The two girls are involved in something resembling a lesbian relationship or maybe it's just a \\"phase\\" teenage girls go through. There are also undertones of incest in this emotionally tense story. The title has multiple layers of meaning, something we have come to expect in McEwan's novels. He apparently has coined a phrase in \\"Psychopolis.\\" The narrator is a Brit living briefly in California. While there he meets Mary, who works in a feminist bookstore in Venice and whom he chains to the foot of his bed for a weekend-- at her request. There is also George Malone who owns a shop under the narrator's apartment in Santa Monica,a shop specializing in items \\"for party givers\\" and equipment for sickrooms. Finally, there is Terence Latterly, someone the narrator had met \\"years ago in England when he was researching a still uncompleted thesis on George Orwell. . .\\" This story culminates when George throws a farewell party for the narrator who brings Mary and Terence with him to dinner. The evening gets out of hand when the conversation turns to religion, sexism, corporal punishment, sexual inadequacy and violence. (It's always fascinating to read foreign writers and get their views on the United States.)This last story is about as good as anything Mr. McEwan has written."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"The only reason I finished this book was because I was on an airplane and had nothing else to read. Turgid self indulgent and really not a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"If you're a McEwan fan then you must read this collection. If you're not, please read the novels first. These short stories do not offer comfortable closures, but they do examine some intriguing relationships in McEwan's usual keen observationalist style. These are fragments of people's lives. The plots hint at much but define little, therefore it has to be up to the reader to mull over the stories, just as one might mull over paintings. They invite us to consider human attributes that individuals might deny and suppress due to social mores, but that all of us may bear to greater or lesser degrees, simply because we are all human. I was absorbed by all of them except To And Fro which kept losing my attention."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"A hit and miss early book from one of our greatest living writers, In Between the Sheets, at the very least, is interesting enough to keep you reading. \\"Pornography,\\" the first story, isn't great, but it's pretty good, and the ending was creepy enough to leave me sick to my stomach.The next story, Reflections of a Kept Ape, is short but interesting, at least to an extent. It's bizarre enough to make it worth reading.Two Fragments: March 199-, is a story depicting a near future which is essentially primitive and boring, and that's how reading it is as well. This story, especially the second half, is easily forgettable.I actually quite like the next story, Dead as They Come, despite the plot line, which sounds like it wouldn't go anywhere. I won't give it away, I'll just say it's an interesting twist on a love story, which leads to jealousy and eventually \\"murder.\\"In Between the Sheets was another bizarre, but quite good, story. It involves a divorced man staying with his daughter and her friend, a dwarf. They seem to be involved in some sort of lesbian relationship, and it turns into a strange but good story.To be blunt, I hated the next story, To and Fro. It's a good thing it's by far the shortest: McEwan makes it deliberately confusing and it doesn't go anywhere. I respect him for trying to be unique, but he does it with more success on \\"Dead as They Come\\" and \\"Reflections of a Kept Ape.\\"The last story, Psychopolis, may well be the best in the collection: it starts with a mans odd semi-sexual experience with a female friend, and seems to go into a meditation on Christianity and short term friendships. Along with the title story, it takes a completely realistic tone, and is wonderful to read.All things considered, First Love, Last Rites is a more powerful read, but this book is interesting enough to make it worth the read."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"I read a lot of books, but I generally avoid the more \\"literary\\" authors. There are exceptions, however, and Ian McEwan is one of those. I have enjoyed the other books of his I've read (including Atonement, Amsterdam and Enduring Love), but In Between the Sheets, his early collection of short stories, is merely passable. It is well-written but not a great read.Whether it is a short story or a novel, my personal preference is more plot-driven stories, as opposed to the plotless, slice-of-life tales that may be more artistic, but tend to be less entertaining. Again, there are exceptions, but this collection is not one of them. The seven stories vary in quality: a couple are decent enough, including a tale of a philanderer who gets a comeuppance from his two lovers and the story of a wealthy man and his obsession over his new mistress. On the other hand, while most of the other stories are not bad, they aren't very compelling either. Only one story, \\"To and Fro,\\" I found to be almost unreadable (a matter of taste, I am sure, as I'm not much for more experimental fare).For the most part, this fits my definition of a three star work: while there is little bad about this book, there is also little good. I am willing to admit that the type of writing within is not my usual cup of tea, so your opinion may be different. To me, however, this is a book for only McEwan fans only, and even then, only to see what his early work was like. For others - especially those who prefer more plot with their stories - this is one to skip."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"There is little to recommend this slim volume of stories that reads very much like a reheating of the subtle horrors that had such an impact in Mcewan's debut collection, 'First Love, Last Rites'. Once again, the various characters slip, almost imperceptibly into a range of grand guignol predicaments, but the tone is less subtle than in the first collection and the book does not represent much in the way of originality or development from this early phase of Mcewan's early career."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"This is a book of short stories written by Ian McEwan. In a sentence, this book wasn't very good. McEwan's style is engaging, but these stories are not very well-executed in my opinion.I think McEwan was trying to be original and shocking, and while there are many &quot;original&quot; ideas presented, the stories themselves are lacking and leave you with a feeling of cluelessness.As far as shocking goes, this isn't shocking. In fact, some of the ideas seem a little contrived, but I guess everyone starts from somewhere."},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"\\"In Between the Sheets\\" was brilliantly written, as would be expected coming from McEwan- his style of writing is the closest anyone can get to Jane Austen- he's like \\"the\\" Jane Austen of our time. But after reading \\"Atonement\\" which was an unbelievably phenominal \\"couldn't put it down\\" read, I was quite dissapointed with \\"In Between the Sheets\\" because for being the brilliant writer that he is, these short stories weren't worthy of McEwan. There is a bizarre twist in each of the short stories in this book, and at the end of each story your left 'dumbfounded,' and you cant help but go back and re-read the last page so that you can try to understand what point McEwan is trying to make, but the attempt is useless because I still have yet to make sense of some of these stories. The most confusing was To and Fro- I don't think I'll ever understand that one. However, one of the points I did figure out McEwan was trying to make is that love, lust, passion, and sexuality are all very confusing things (even if it does involve an ape, a dwarf, or a mannequin, and not a real person) that can make a person act not like themselves and even resort to doing something completley crazy. So in short, I wouldn't recommend this book but I would most definitley recommend \\"Atonement\\":)"},{"Title":"In Between the Sheets","review":"Lo compr&eacute; con mucha ilusi&oacute;n en la versi&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol.

We have an original copy that my mom got from a library sale or something. She loved it, I loved it, which is no suprise because I am a sucker for sweet old novels, but the most ringing endorsement it that my impossible-to-please dad loved it. In fact, he was the one who made me read it.There really isn't a lot of substance to this book - it's mostly fluff. (There's some social commentary in the later parts of the book, when they're in Seattle, but I try to ignore it.) But it's grade-A, high-quality fluff we're talking about here. Claire Boltwood's transformation from a Brooklyn snob to a real woman is highly believable, and Milt Daggett is one of the sweetest, most wholesome men ever created. Set against the well-painted backdrop of the American West, the story shifts from amusing to heartwarming to bittersweet and back again flawlessly.Just a good, simple love-story, unique and well-written. I would recommend this book to anyone just looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Free Air","review":"Sinclair Lewis's FRESH AIR, published in 1919, is sheer, chuckling delight. It offers no great insights into psyches or interpersonal relations. Read it rather as a straightforward magazine serial pot boiler romance of frontier boy and car mechanic (Milt Daggett) pursuing a sentimental girl (Claire Boltwood) worth an impressive $5,000 around 1916. The girl, a high living Brooklynite, is driving her ailing workaholic father in a heavy Gomez-Dep roadster long day after weary day across northern plains and mountains towards a vacation with cousins in Seattle. She wonders whether she can ultimately avoid marrying Jeff Saxton, a notably older beau back in sophisticated New York.Milt complicates things by falling in love with Claire after pulling her car out of a Minnesota mud hole created by a German hick to extort money from stranded motorists. Milt almost instantly decides to drive in his modest Teal \\"tin beetle\\" or \\"bug\\" with or near Claire and her father all the way to Seattle. And so it goes, with Claire wondering if she can (or should) civilize the manly Milt up to the level of suave and prosperous Jeff or whether that is too, too patronizing. Should she, alternatively, simply sweep off to Alaska with Milt -- heeding the call of the wild? Were Jane and Tarzan in the back of Sinclair Lewis's mind? For Edgar Rice Burroughs had created them only seven years earlier in 1912. No, the story takes another twist. Read the book and discover what this novel is said to be \\"prelude and curtain raiser\\" to.FRESH AIR can also be read just for its sweaty heft as a part of midwestern and western America not long before the nation declared war on the Kaiser. On the drive through Minnesota, North Dakota, etc. to Washington state, roads are rarely paved. Gravel is luxury. Dust is daily. Mud is just around the bend. Tires are thin and frequently burst or are punctured. Steep slopes demand drivers with braking and gear shifting skills. And don't forget low spots covered by running water.In every town where the Boltwoods overnight, they routinely drive their Gomez-Dep (a make apparently invented by Sinclair Lewis) into a sure-to-be-there full service garage for the night. These and other cross country garages often display a sign \\"Free Air,\\" which must have been a reassuring come-on in the early days of cross-continental motoring.The author, just one year before his first masterpiece, MAIN STREET, convincingly presents his personally experienced North American driving world from an expert mechanic's point of view: an automobile-crazed country with its starters, carburetors, rumble seats, dubiously effective head lamps, oil leaks, hitchhikers, fleabag hotels, country stores, a haunted house and country people who speak German and at first seem gruff but then are seen by sophisticated Easterner Claire Boltwood to have hearts of gold. As does her new suitor, Milt Daggett. It is an all-American world where even auto mechanics are romantic and knightly.Boys and girls should read FRESH AIR a year or so before they tackle TOM SAWYER and HUCKLEBERRY FINN. One leads to the others.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Free Air","review":"One of my favorite books. I was lucky to get a copy (original edition) from the New York Public Library.

I found it entertaining, insightful, and hilarious. At times his wordcraft took my breath away. Loved it."},{"Title":"Free Air","review":"Having had great respect for the writings of Sinclair Lewis for quite some time, I was, once again, looking forward to reading another one of his works. In comparison to some of his classics ( Elmer Gantry, Main Street, etc..) this early work paled by comparison. This novel contains none of the character development nor allegorical insights that Mr. Lewis became so well versed at.As my title indicates it follows the age old sequence of two persons who meet, drift apart, come back together and live happily ever after. While the author's writing skills remained impeccable, there are an infinite number of dime store novels that follow this hum-drum story line. The only difference that Mr. Lewis was able to develop from this pattern was the city mouse/country mouse syndrome with both lovers trying to become what the other one was. Country mouse tried to become refined while city mouse tried to become a rugged individualist. While the ensuing motor trip across the country at the turn of the century added a degree of reading interest, it did not do so to save the Harlequin type novel from its mundane predictability.If you simply like to read in order to merely exercise your eye muscles or wish to delve no deeper into literature than on a fluff-level, this may be the book you are looking for."},{"Title":"Free Air","review":"The Author, Sinclair Lewis, represented his era as populated by gullible and naive protagonists and it was a refreshing look at what was expected of authors seventy and more years ago.

Set in a time period before the 1st World War, the story is about a young woman from a wealthy family driving from the East coast to the West coast.

Sinclair Lewis describes everything in thisstory so that you feel as if you've been with them along the way. Good read!"},{"Title":"Free Air","review":"I really enjoyed this book immensely and agree with the previous reviewer. It gives a descriptive account of the trials and tribulations of traveling westward in a car during the early 1900's.Reads as a social/class commentary, a Zane Gray western, with some romance added.Corny in some ways, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to other Sinclair Lewis fans."},{"Title":"Free Air","review":"It doesn't matter who wrote this nor how famous he is.

I love old pulp, especially when it's a wild journey, and this road trip book was a fun and exciting read. I went through a bunch of public domain kindle books just browsing, and I figured I would read a page or two of each to see what caught my attention. This book caught me on the first page.I'ts very light like others have mentioned, but it does get you thinking about society and lifestyles and how things haven't really changed all that much in almost 100 years. But it's not preachy or slanted either way.I found a lot of stuff in this book I could relate to, a lot of the feelings and emotions are ones we've all had, and the characters in the book are very relatable. There are some good plot twists and enough danger to keep you on your seat, but this is by no means a &#34;thriller&#34; nor does it try to be.I love the time period it's set in, and Lewis paints an excellent picture without focusing too much on the details. It's a nice step back into a different time but it's a story that could happen today.What I liked best about the book was the characters. So many interesting people displayed so well, and the protagonist Milt is salt of the earth, and as likeable as they come.Going to get the paperback edition of this book and read it again.

That chapter is written almost entirely in Claire's head/thoughts. When i read Lewis' Main Street i was amazed at how perceptive he was of women's thinking in 1920. This book was written in 1919 and again i am amazed. He must have had good relationships with his women family members or friends, and good dscussions to be able to understand their thinking.This road trip gives us good detail on what it would have been like to try to drive across the country, especially the west, in 1916, few roads and those that there were were bad.

Also, it seems sincere and realistic - not the hype you find in magazines: 15 hp from an exhaust! - yeah right. Ancas comes right out and tells you that with most of the new cars (Integra R/GSR) there isn't much you can do to gain power. Most of what you do will end up robbing low end torque.

What is exceptionally nice is that Mike includes road racing hondas (cars that just don't go in a straight line for a 1/4 mile) as well as the ultrahigh hp dragsters.

This book failed to answer that question. It touched on many areas of importance to the Honda fanatic but it neglected that one question which is on the back of everyone's mind as he/she walks into a performance shop, &quot;I want to go fast and hard, but is this going to mess up my ride.&quot; Now on the flip side, the chapters written about the history of Hondas and their handling were very good, they offered practical advice for suspension tricks as well as some interesting insights into Honda's evolution."},{"Title":"Honda and Acura Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I recently purchased and finished reading from cover to cover in one sitting, Mike Ancas' Honda &amp; Acura Performance Handbook.

The book is not a how-to book, but rather a very good introduction to the types of modifications that can be done, what will work, and what may be a waste of your money. I like that the author points out that a specific add-on to a specific system may not produce the desired results without upgrading other parts of the system which may now be a weak link in the chain.

He answers many common questions about performance tuning and talks about the pros and cons of each and leads the reader towards the right path.All in all, it's a great book to start out with and makes a good collection to the library of a Honda enthusiast."},{"Title":"Honda and Acura Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I just finished reading this book and the author did a great job.

I'm not saying that the information in the book is wrong or useless, but I think calling giving this book an all-encompassing title like Honda &amp; Acura Performance gives the false impression that late-model Honda enthusiasts like me (I own a '97 GS-R) will find useful information. They won't. Also, it becomes obvious that this guy is probably on the payroll of only a couple companies, because he uses their parts as examples over and over again.Bottom line: if you're a CRX owner who loves autocrossing for some reason and doesn't know much about the working internals of your car, buy this book.

Since there arent too many books at my local bookstore about these cars, I decided to give this book a try. Magazines are helpful but they dont always give you an unbiased opinion on the products they install and test. In this book, I did NOT noticed a bias to any one manufacturer or another. Instead the author gives information about the different types of products that work, and lets us decide. There are also theories and simple technical information that are easy to read and understand. I just finished the book, plus the three extra omitted MYSTERY chapters (available via the book's website at http://www.hondabook.com), and I felt compelled to write this review to let everyone know that I appreciate how well written the book is. So far I have learned so much more useful information in the past few days than I have in the past 7-8 months since I bought the car, read the various magazines, and searched the net. The book definitely helped me to look forward and think about what I want to do with my car before I go out and max out my credit card on parts that will be more detrimental than helpful in the long run.

He apparently worked as a stock broker most of his career.In a one-page intoduction, Hoskins laments the desert of White History amid a sea of multiculural propaganda for every other race under the sun, at a time when the term politically-correct (PC) had yet to be coined-- 1958. This was also before the civil rights movement. Commander George Lincoln Rockwell, U.S.N. (ret.) had a sign in front of his Arlington, Virginia home: \\"White man fight: Smash the Black revolution NOW!\\" It was another time and another place.Hoskins makes an articulate case for studying history from the perspective of one's own race without apology. He then goes on to give a thumbnail sketch of that history ending in a compelling case for Nordic, Anglo-Saxon preservation.Considering current Black history in Zimbabwe and South Africa and the current so called War on Terror chapter in Israeli-American foreign policy in the Middle East, and World Trade vis a vis China and the so called Pacific Rim, Our Nordic Race is both timely and revelant.Perhaps the most important book in this vein and our time is The Culture of Critique, by California State University professor, Kevin MacDonald, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race: A handbook for students of racial history, giving the facts needed to fight the alien creed of those who would destroy us","review":"_Our Nordic Race_ by Richard Kelly Hoskins, first published in 1958, claims to be one of the few books remaining that details the history of the white race as a whole. It is written from a straightforward, ethno-centric standpoint and makes no apology about it. Its audience is white southerners. According to _Our Nordic Race_ the Nordics came from the North, the areas of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. From there they spread out and conquered and brought civilization to all corners of the globe. Ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Sumerians, Babylonians, Hebrews, Phoenicians and Carthaginians were all originally Nordics, but these empires fell when the Nordic nobility began to be dependent on the importation and slave labor of colored races which led to racial mixing and cultural decline. The later empires of Portugal, Spain, Italy, Byzantium and Russia also fell victim to this predicament. Even the Oriental civilizations such as India, China, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia may have originally been founded by Nordics. India set up a caste system to seperate the ruling nobility from the lower-caste serfs. In China there were legends of light haired, grey-eyed visitors who may have been a tribe of Nordics that had traveled eastward accross Asia. Japananese, Korean and Southeast Asian civilizations were heavily influenced by China, which itself may have had a Nordic cultural base. The strangest section is the mention of the Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in South America, civilizations which sprang out of nowhere. The Indians maintained legends of bearded, light-skinned gods who originally ruled over them, but had long since disappeared. The Aztecs at first thought Spanish conquistador Cortez as one of these forgotten gods. _Our Nordic Race_ focuses on the danger posed by racial integration, which has either destroyed or stagnated all Nordic civilizations in the past. The analysis of Communism and Socialist theory pulls no punches and is straight to the point. Communism was the main vehicle (at least when this book was written) to destroy the Nordics and to empower the international conspirators, originally the Khazars who converted to the religion of the Pharisees in the seventh century. Hoskins shows the nonsense that the \\"one race, one class, one color\\" of Marxism is. The omni-potent, all-controlling Socialist state will become and end in itself, only benifiting the small oligarchy who hold the reins of power over the banks, the media and the institutions of society. _Our Nordic Race_ is an excellent, if paranoid, extreme, and outdated, look at the racial and economic problems the West faces, as well as the world view propounded by believers in the Aryan Myth as the origin of human civilization. If the eventual extinction of the white race is a future reality, as it appears to be in the next hundred or so years, it will more likely be through a declining birth rate and mass-third world immigration rather than the violent slaughter that Hoskins describes."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race: A handbook for students of racial history, giving the facts needed to fight the alien creed of those who would destroy us","review":"I am not an authority on the subject but I found this book to be interesting, readable, and relevant. I am grateful that the author took the time to research and write it. It will always be on my bookshelf as a reference."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race: A handbook for students of racial history, giving the facts needed to fight the alien creed of those who would destroy us","review":"This was a good, and short read. Hoskins touches on the subject of inter-racial mixing and cultural blending in this book, and he explains how inter-racial mixing was the downfall of various empires in history. He further goes on to talk about the great legacy of the Nordic race, and how our people of today lack any sense of respect for the heritage of our Nordic race.While a lot of what Hoskins stated in this book is true, stil, some of it is false, and can be misleading. From what I can gather of my historical studies on the Nordic race, they didn't begin in the Scandanavian countries, and proceed to other parts of the world. Rather, they came to the Scandanavian region through migrations from other parts of the world. Some might say this is a small digression on my part, but be that as it may.This book is also a bit out-dated. However, much of the basic subject matter is still present with us today. This is a good read for someone who is looking for a short, but informative study of the problems the Nordic race faces today. Some might find this book a bit racist, and others will not. However, it IS geared towards the Nordic race (as the title openly suggests), so keep that in mind when you read it."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race: A handbook for students of racial history, giving the facts needed to fight the alien creed of those who would destroy us","review":"_Our Nordic Race_ is the history of the world told from the perspective of the White Nordic Race. Unfortunately, the book seems to have a crass biologistic/Darwinistic understanding of race and seems to advocate a system of eugenics and birth control (man viewed as merely a breeding mechanism) as well as rules against miscegenation - things which various popes for example have condemned. This is problematic for the simple reason that man's genetic nature is far too complicated to fit into these simplistic categories, as well as the biologistic notion of \\"hybrid vigor\\". A more interesting perspective on race for example is that of the Italian aristocrat Julius Evola who seemed to view \\"Aryan\\" as a spiritual principle and argued against the notion of race advocated by \\"breeders\\". Also the book fails to take into account such things as for example the contribution of the Arabian culture in preserving Aristotle for the Europeans throughout the \\"Dark Ages\\". The book does however offer a far more realistic picture of racial struggle and race war than any liberal (politically correct) historian is likely to admit to. The fact is that race remains a problem in the world, that racial differences and genetic malformities do exist in man and that the achievements of the White Race are being undermined by the forces of subversion. While the threat from Soviet Russia in the book has largely been superseded, Communist China continues to remain a powerful threat to the continued growth of the American nation. In this sense, a real conflict of cultures can be seen between the Western European individualistic culture and the Chinese collectivistic one. I give this book four stars not because I agree with much of its content, but because it offers a novelty item which may be more honest on the issue of race than many liberal historians care to admit."},{"Title":"The History of Counting","review":"One of the biggest challenges I have had is finding in print books that are as good as some of the stand-by OOP books recommended on the best math reading lists. For example, Lancelot Hogben's The Wonderful World of Mathematics is highly recommended, but oop and also somewhat out of date.I got this book today and am delighted, I'll be using it for my classes this fall. It is almost a picture book, but dense - enough that I had to re-read parts of it to understand myself. Very highly illustrated so you can *see* what they are talking about, 41 pages, and the history covered is world wide, not just devoted to the Egyptians and Greeks. It is truly a comprehensive and universal history of counting brought down to kid level comprehension.The print is good sized and spaced well to make it more readable. I'd say it is read alone level for 3rd through 6th. With my own 6 year old I can paraphrase the text and use the great visuals to get the ideas across. There is one page that has a wonderful visual of \\"body counting\\" and the wide-spread use of these techniques all over the world actually makes this a good living geography book as well.For a parent that is very visual, you might like it yourself :o).

That's absolutely true. While studying for the MCAT, I used these books as my sole source of review material and found nothing lacking. I had friends who were taking Kaplan and Princeton Review prep courses, and I looked at the books they used: they all tell you to memorize way more info than you need. They're also a lot more boring than the Examkrackers books, because, face it: if you're going to spend three months poring over some review books, you might as well get ones with color pages, a really dorky cracker mascot, and at least some sense of personality behind the writing voice. The Examkrackers books won't ask you to waste valuable brain space on extraneous material, and the style of the books favors conceptual understanding over rote memorization (though of course the latter is used when appropriate, as with biological sciences).I would suggest that in addition to buying this package, you also get the Examkrackers \\"101 Passages in MCAT Verbal Reasoning\\". It's probably the only good book out there for practicing MCAT verbal questions and it's an absolute must. I was scoring 9's on the Verbal before I worked through it, and 12's by the end.I would say that if you can learn and memorize all the things that these Examkrackers review books tell you to, you are completely set in terms of knowledge. Everything else is just practice, and for that I suggest doing all the tests you can get your hands on. The AAMC publishes old MCATs which are DEFINITELY worth buying, despite the expense. For more practice I would also suggest Princeton Review's \\"Practice MCATs\\" and Kaplan's \\"MCAT Practice Tests\\" (each contains two complete tests) as well as Kaplan's \\"MCAT 45\\". Examkrackers also puts out a book titled \\"16 Mini-MCATs\\" which I found to be useful for additional practice. The only caveat I can add is that Princeton Review's practice tests are written to be harder than the actual MCAT -- they will ask you questions about stuff that is contained in their books but is NOT on the MCAT. Therefore, I wouldn't panic if you find that you don't do well on them. The Examkrackers and Kaplan tests ARE commensurate in difficulty to the MCAT so they are more useful for gauging your performance.I did not use any of the Examkrackers 1001 Questions series, because I understand that all of the questions in those books are stand-alone, which is unrepresentative of the real MCAT, on which almost all the questions are passage based. However, if you're having trouble learning the science, they might be a good option because stand-alone questions really test your knowledge base. Just keep in mind that success on the MCAT is based just as much on how well you can glean information from passages as it is on pure knowledge. And learning how to glean is something that only practice with actual MCATs (either real AAMC ones or test company-made ones) can give you.So basically, my point is that if you use this study package and practice the hell out of all the practice tests you can find, you should be fine. I never took a MCAT prep course (couldn't afford one) so all I did was shell out about $300 for books and tests, and I ended up with a nice 42R. (15P, 13V, 14B) It can be done. Examkrackers can help you do it. Go buy this study package now. ^_^"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Complete Study Package","review":"I used the EK set almost exclusively during my self-prep for the April 2004 MCAT.

Starting from Charcot's neurology and psychiatry, developed during the second half of XIX century, the medical theories about neurosis are examined in relation to their impact on Freud's early formulations. I had not realized, before reading this book how deep was Charcot's influence on young Freud and to what extent Freud tried to develop the theories of his master in order to increase their explanatory power. Unfortunately, the far Freud went on in his theory, and the more it became comprehensive, the less it was &quot;scientific&quot; and could be directly compared with empyrical evidence. In his fifties Freud had developed a powerful therapeutic instrument, whose scientific foundations were however unproven and most probably impossible to test; any further theoretical improvement went farther and farther away from contemporary medical science. Macmillan reconstructs the history of a marvelous failure and explains why the status of modern psychoanalysis is so uncertain. This book is exceedingly critical against the so called &quot;ermeneutic&quot; interpretation of psychoanalysis, that suggests psychoanalysis to be similar to the art of interpreting books and stories, but it is nevertheless a must for anyone interested in psychology."},{"Title":"Freud Evaluated: The Completed Arc","review":"If I had to review Malcolm Macmillan's Freud Evaluated in a single sentence, it would unfortunately have to be, \\"This book tries to do too much for one book.\\" Macmillan attempts to discredit Freud's theories, but the task of discrediting Freud comprehensively and thoroughly is simply too much for one book, even one of 762 pages. Freud wrote and thought far too much, and his ideas are far too complicated, for this to be a manageable task. Freud Evaluated is, nevertheless, essential reading for anyone interested in Freud or psychoanalysis. Macmillan's criticisms of Freud are to a large extent derivative of the enormous body of critical literature on psychoanalysis that has been accumulating for decades, but he works his way through that material so thoroughly that anyone who wants to see what criticisms have been made of Freud will have to read him. Macmillan's sources include numerous analytic writers (despite their reputation as slavish followers of their master, post-Freudian psychoanalysts were often highly critical of many of Freud's original theories). One of Macmillan's key sources in his critique of Freud's theory of infantile sexuality is Irving Bieber, a once extremely influential but now vilified figure better known for his theories about homosexuality.The quality of Macmillan's arguments (when he makes real arguments at all instead of uncritically citing existing literature critical of Freud, in effect assuming that the fact that someone criticized Freud by itself proves that Freud must have been mistaken) is extremely variable. He makes a good case against parts of Freud's theories, such as the death instinct and the dream theory, but a poor case against others. His section on infantile sexuality is somewhat confused: it seems to move back and forth between saying that perversions are genuinely sexual and saying that they aren't, without the inconsistency being resolved.I believe the uneven quality of Macmillan's arguments, which are less rigorous than their dry and often extremely technical nature would suggest and hardly represent the last word on Freud, is partly due to the overly-ambitious nature of his project. Had he written something more narrowly focused and limited in its ambitions, Macmillan would have had time to think the issues through more carefully and produced a better book; as it was, attempting the monumental task of evaluating the whole of Freud's work, he inevitably makes a mess of some things and thereby limits his overall achievement. Counter-arguments against many of Macmillian's criticisms of Freud certainly exist, but you won't read much about them in Freud Evaluated. Among the literature Macmillan ignores is Christopher Badcock's Oedipus in Evolution, which presents a case against the idea that the Oedipus complex is an evolutionary impossibility, something Macmillan thinks beyond question (here, as too often in this book, he is simply citing other people's work - Martin Daly and Margo Wilson's, in this case - and echoing its conclusions). Freud Evaluated may be the best purely negative critique of Freud in the scholarly literature, but it is rather one-sided and anyone wanting to understand the issues it addresses should take the trouble to read literature more favorable to psychoanalysis as well."},{"Title":"\\"Ah so!\\": Japanese for kids","review":"I found this rather dull and simplistic for 9-12 year olds."},{"Title":"Fearful symmetry: A study of William Blake","review":"One disadvantage of browsing online bookstores is that you can't simply skim the cover blurbs; sometimes you just have to settle for the opinions of strangers like me. So it may be helpful to read the quotes on the back cover of my copy of 'Fearful Symmetry.'&quot;To say it is a magnificent, extraordinary book is to praise it as it should be praised, but in doing so one gives little idea of the huge scope of the book and of its fiery understanding . Several great poets have written of Blake, but this book, I believe, is the first to show the full magnitude of Blake's mind, its vast creative thought.&quot; -- Edith Sitwell, 'The Spectator'&quot;According as we agree or disagree with Mr. Frye's contention we shall decide finally on the supremacy of his book. In following the structure of Blake's total vision and relating it to the thought of his age he has triumphantly carried out a task which, given the giant shape of the material, cannot help being immense. His cadences, by sheer explanatory devotion, approach the sonorities of Blake's own.&quot; -- 'Times Literary Supplement'&quot;Frye conducts his ambitious study with unflagging energy, great enthusiasm, and immense erudition.&quot; -- 'Poetry'&quot;An intelligent and beautifully written critical interpretation of the poetry and symbolic thought of William Blake...&quot; -- 'New Yorker'My opinion: Northrop Frye's literary criticism manages to shift the ground underfoot in the same rare way Blake's poetry does. Frye was the first to crack Blake's code, remove from him the labels of Mystic and Nutcase, and reveal him as a poet who systematically recreates the world. Frye taught Blake to Jesuits, Communist organizers, deans of women, and angry young poets. He was continually pleased to encounter doctors, housewives, clergymen, teachers, blue-collar workers, and shopkeepers, all with a great and deep appreciation of Blake.Frye's deep appreciation and admiration for Blake comes through on every page, six times over. I reread this book about every five years, each time coming away seeing the world upside down, inside out, and worth renovating."},{"Title":"Fearful symmetry: A study of William Blake","review":"I have a much clearer sense of Blake's writings now that I've read this book. I took a long time in finishing it, reading some major poems by W.B. at the same time. This is really an exciting book; it brings to life a whole universe - that lived in the poet's imagination. Blake is alive today (in the spirit of his artistic creations) I am convinced. William Blake had a great gift for describing aspects of real life in a way that was inspired by the Bible, and some other imaginative or visionary artists and poets; he was also highly opinionated. It's impressive how well Frye understood Blake's gift, and his personal life, which also makes a strand of this effort, which is a literary effort in it's own right. Anyone with an interest in Blake ought to read this book. It's a tool that allows one to approach Blake's creations of writing and visual artistry with an active (as well as open) mind."},{"Title":"Fearful symmetry: A study of William Blake","review":"Blake sets us in the middle of a rich mythological structure. This is the best book for explaining what that structure is and how Blake will come to an element and illuminate sometimes inconsistent characteristics of that element if viewed in a limited selection. And yet when Blake's work is examined as a whole an encompassing structure is revealed where each part has been carefully delineated and accurately described throughout. Since Blake's collected works are rather massive it is very helpful to have an overview of Blake's view of man when examining how any one particular image is dealt with in a poem. Else, one might think that Blake's portrayals are incongruent from poem to poem, while his vision is actually quite cohesive. Frye wrote another excellent essay on Blake, the title has something to do with the Fourfold Key. It shows the structural similarity between Blake, Marx and Freud."},{"Title":"Fearful symmetry: A study of William Blake","review":"Some time ago I reread Northrop Frye's Fearful Symmetry before having another read through of the poems of William Blake including the longer poems The Four Zoas, Milton and Jerusalem. Despite my appreciation of Frye's book I was struck by the disconnect between many of Frye's well-expressed and coherent ideas and the poems themselves. I noticed also that Frye barely quoted from any of the poems or analyzed any passage specifically. At that point I started to look around for other texts which offered a different viewpoint from Frye to see if my dissatisfaction was justified or not. The more I read the alternative views the more convinced I became that Frye's account was seriously deficient. I do not think he is entirely wrong or that there is nothing of value in his book. However, I strongly recommend that readers interested in Blake's poetry read alternative views. The ones I have found most useful and interesting include the following: The Four Zoas (Photographic Facsimile (Magno & Erdman), Narrative Unbound (Donald Ault), The Dialectic of Vision (Fred Dortort), Dark Figures in the Desired Country (Gerda Norvig), The Traveler in the Evening (Morton Paley), Rethinking Blake's Textuality (Molly Rothenberg),Blake's Critique of Transcendence (Peter Otto) and some of the articles in Blake's Sublime Allegory (Curran & Wittreich Eds.) I might note that after doing all this reading of the poems and about Blake I am convinced that the unpublished The Four Zoas is the central and most significant poem Blake wrote and that both Milton and Jerusalem suffer in comparison with it. The problem that Blake may have realized with the Four Zoas was that it could never be published in its authentic form due to the graphic (for the time) psychosexual content of the illustrations (the subtitle of the poem is The Torments of Love and Jealousy)."},{"Title":"Fearful symmetry: A study of William Blake","review":"If you give yourself fully to an imaginative reading of this book, and then of Blake's Collected Poems,the doors of your perception will be opened.

Through analogies, Miller relates his leadership concepts to sports teams, which will surely appeal to executives with annual box seats! All the current good ideas on serving customers, such as hiring customer-oriented employees, focusing internal processes on serving customers, constant systems redesign based on customer feedback, and long-term relationships with customers can be found in this program, read by the author. Although Miller's ideas are soundly rooted in the extensive literature in this genre, he offers little new information. Also, with the significant problems inherent in today's professional sports business, his attempt to relate complex team-based organizational success to successful athletic teams is outdated. Invest instead in the more substantial work from Ron Zemke (Working with Jerks, S. & S. Audio, 1989).-Dale Farris, Groves, Tex.BookList - Barbara JacobsAnother business book filled with sports metaphors? Yes and no, because Miller (helped by coauthor Brown) does have a story to tell. And when the subject is teamwork, the language of the playing fields is appropriate--though admittedly overused. In anecdotal fashion, he relates and demonstrates how working in teams solves all potential employer issues: customer service, creativity, quality, sales, problem solving, and employee loyalty. What's more, the advice proferred is specific and complete with samples--e.g., don't separate work from home; reward frequently; watch body language and rely on gut instincts when hiring; and involve employees in strategy as well as service. After this easy, non-high-falutin' read, those who didn't understand the power of working (and playing) together will grasp it; those managers who already practice teamwork just might find they've honed their skills."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This is an enjoyable book that I found hard to put down once I started reading it.

Only Brokaw already did it.

Semi-autobiographical, it has the feeling of a hurried effort whose real goal was to make money. While the adoration of his father is laudable, it was twisted into a self-serving enumeration of author's many virtues and how he acquired them.Maybe all autobiographies require a certain tolerance from the reader, but my supply was quickly exhausted. Russert throws in multiple vignettes per page - some related, some not - lumping platitude upon platitude, as if quantity were better than quality.Worse, it's full of errors that should have been caught by a half-decent editor. A glaring example: everyone knows the prayer before a meal (\\"Bless us oh Lord...\\"), but he gets it wrong, saying \\"...THROUGH thy bounty, through Christ our Lord...\\" instead of \\"...FROM thy bounty, through Christ our Lord...\\" Clangers like that plus his transparent motive reduce this book to the level of a B movie."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"BEING A BIG FAN OF TIM RUSSERT, ABOUT HIS AGE, & HAVING BEEN BORN IN NEW YORK, I PICKED UP THIS BOOK WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS.UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

Pretty standard stuff. But once in a while a book comes along that supersedes the silly.BIG RUSS &amp; ME, by Tim Russert, is one of these rare finds.Russert, the popular host of NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; wrote this tribute to his father, Tim Senior, a member of what has become known as &quot;the greatest generation.&quot; A hard-working, spiritual and devoted family man who served his country during World War II, the elder Russert represents the millions of fathers (and mothers) who sacrificed to make their children's lives better.The Russert family grew up in a blue-collar section of Buffalo, NY, where Tim Senior instilled in the author and his three sisters the qualities of discipline, respect, honesty and faith that, for whatever reason, are sometimes lacking from parents today.In the minds of younger readers, Russert might as well have written his book a hundred years ago. Imagine having to walk to school, including &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma'am&quot; when addressing adults, or having to do chores. It wasn't punishment --- it was expected and not open to discussion or bargaining.Writers of a certain age often recall a time and place in which television shows were broadcast in black and white, no one locked their doors, kids always had friends to play with and people watched out for one another. Compare that with today's omnipresent security alarms, motion detectors and play-dates.Russert writes fondly of his Jesuit education. Its extension of discipline helped him focus on excelling in college and law school. He worked hard to put himself through school, not just because his parents could ill-afford tuition and other expenses. As Big Russ said, you appreciate it more when you earn it yourself. The era in which he grew up was difficult: the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. had profound effects on his circle, as did the social unrest of the sixties. Through it all, however, he remained close to his father while many of his contemporaries rebelled against their parents' values.Russert is not a name-dropper. He was fortunate enough to know several people who were very influential to his maturation, and he mentions these relationships (his chapters on Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Pope John Paul II are especially warm) more in thankfulness than to inflate his own ego. His self-effacement (&quot;I have a face for radio&quot;) seems genuine, not put-on, which makes BIG RUSS &amp; ME even more enjoyable.The saying goes (approximately): &quot;When I was a teenager I thought my father didn't know anything. It's amazing how much smarter he became once I got older.&quot; This is definitely not Russert's credo. Indeed, he has always sought his dad's advice and opinions; even now, in his high-powered capacity as host of one of television's venerated staples, he is not satisfied until Big Russ gives his feedback. (Not to psychoanalyze, but one doesn't get the impression that Russert, Jr. is in dire need of Senior's approval.)Being &quot;men,&quot; it's not unusual that expressive feelings exchanged between fathers and sons are underplayed. This is one reason why BIG RUSS &amp; ME is so welcome. And the love and respect between the generations continues through the author's son, Luke.Relationships, especially for today's parents, seem much more difficult, thanks in no small part to the myriad distractions and competitions for their kids' attention that simply didn't exist fifty years ago. All vie for the child's attention and some can be very seductive, especially when the folks want him to do something that isn't cool, like get good grades or clean up his room.Russert's apotheosis is a wonderful gift to Big Russ, an expression of love and gratitude that makes all the hard work seem worthwhile. It's even better that the old timer is still around to enjoy the accolades the book will no doubt engender.So, what did you say you were doing for your dad this year?--- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I'm the author of &quot;Thinkertoys (A Handbook of Business Creativity)&quot; and &quot;Cracking Creativity (The Thinking Stratigies if Creative Genius).

Of which Russert says: &quot;Although Dad was perfectly happy to accept both my gift and my gratitude, he had no interest in stepping out of character or in becoming somebody he wasn't. Even in receiving a gift, Big Russ was teaching me a lesson.&quot;After grilling David Duke and taking some heat for nailing him pretty good on his debut as moderator of Meet the Press, Russert called Big Russ to get the following take: &quot;I'll tell you something: if you're going to make a mistake by being too tough, make it with a Nazi.&quot;Of Russert's obsession with the perennial losers, The Buffalo Bills, Big Russ coyly retorts: &quot;Bills fans will live forever.&quot; If you ask him why, he'll say, &quot;Because we won't die until we win the Super Bowl.&quot;&quot;That's my dad.

It is also a book about other influential people who had an impact on Tim Russert, both the boy and the man.Big Russ, as Tim calls his dad, fought in World War II, although he rarely talked about his days in the army. When he came home from the war, he raised his family in an Irish Catholic neighborhood in South Buffalo. Everyone knew one another and looked out for one another. Kids played on the street without fear, and front doors were left unlocked. Priests and teachers were figures of respect and reverence, and children were taught to look up to their elders.Big Russ worked two jobs, one with the sanitation department and the other as a delivery truck driver for the Buffalo Evening News. He took pride in providing for his family and he taught his children the value of a dollar. The Russert children learned the importance of honesty, self-discipline, and faith.With his humorous and anecdotal style, Tim Russert beautifully captures the wonderful memories of his youth, nostalgically looking back at the television programs he watched, the odd jobs he held, and the schools he attended. He gives special mention to a teacher named Sister Lucille, who taught Tim to love and appreciate English literature. She also gave Tim his first important job in journalism when he was in the seventh grade.After college, Russert went to law school and he began a love affair with politics. He describes his association with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Mario Cuomo, two statesmen whom he both admired and respected, and he traces his rewarding career as a broadcast journalist.\\"Big Russ and Me\\" is a book that will bring pleasure to readers of all ages. It is a touching and colorful journey into a more innocent past. It is also a beautiful and fascinating look at the threads that make up the fabric of a full and meaningful life."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Some of the Amazon reviewers remind me of the spiteful bile coming from a minority on The Left at the time of Ronald Reagan's death.

I really liked this book though, not only because I am familiar with the neighborhood and all the goings on of the Irish Catholic setting, but because of the life lessons it teaches about getting to where you want to be through hard work, and a little advice from dad."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"1. Why I give it 4 stars:I enjoyed it immensely as a father and a son; my own father was of the same generation as Big Russ. We need to read positive books about fathers, and Russert has the maturity, rare in my generation, to recognize the wonderful qualities of a father whom less mature people would probably remember as an emotionally distant workaholic who was never \\"there\\" for them. In that sense, Russert approaches his dad in a manner that has a refreshing lack of ego about it. The very idea that at least one reviewer thinks it somehow slights a mother to write a book in praise of one's father is an indication of how much fatherhood needs the kind of boost this book provides in this day and age.I also enjoyed it as a memoir of growing up in the 50's and 60's, even though I grew up far from Buffalo, because a lot of Russert's experiences rang a bell. I recommend the book highly as a Father's Day present.2. Why I did not give it 5 stars:The is more \\"me\\" and \\"Big Russ\\" in the latter half of the book, and the extent to which a person finds that interesting probably depends a lot on the extent to which he or she had the same kinds of experiences (my wife enjoyed the tales of growing up Catholic more than I did) or the extent to which they're just plain interested in Tim Russert. I found the book less interesting the further I read.The book also lacks depth. There is virtually no indication that Big Russ and Li'l Russ ever had an argument, or that the latter ever went through periods where he thought the former was outdated and idiotic. A book which concentrated more specifically on the father-son relationship and learning to understand that as a man grows older would have been better, and more beneficial, than one that is content to bathe itself in nostalgia and talk about the other mentors in Russert's life. And Russert seems very uncertain about the extent to which he wants to get into his relationship with his own son. Basically, the book is too rosy; more beauty in the father-son relationship would have been illuminated through exploring the rockier times we all have with our dads and sons.Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable read--recommended light reading for dads, sons, nostalgic boomers, and Tim Russert fans. I do not fit the latter category and still enjoyed the bulk of it."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert reads this touching tribute to his father with humor, understanding and love.&quot;The older I get,&quot; Russert says, &quot;the smarter my father seems to get.

Along the way he instilled in his offspring his basic beliefs in duty, responsibility, patriotism, and courage.Most of us know Tim Russert as a celebrated television newsman and moderator of Meet The Press.

It's also an unintended tribute to himself. After all, as a good, worthy son, he absorbed his father's valuable lessons of morality, life and living and displayed it in his own life. And the tributes never come across as boasting or bragging. He tells it all with a great sense of humor.I have recommended this book to dozens of friends and family members, young and old.

I can't believe how many Amazon &quot;reviewers&quot; are getting their facts wrong, or dragging politics, or other issues into this simple, straightforward ode to one's father.One reviewer says Tim does a disservice to mothers everywhere by writing a book about his father. If you didn't check out the title of the book clearly before purchasing it, maybe you should go do that now: &quot;Big Russ and Me: Father and Son--Lessons of Life.&quot; He mentions his mother reverently a few times in the text, but the book is mainly about his dad. Enough Said. I'm sure his mother knows how much he loves her. Maybe he'll write a book about her someday. But I don't see how he's disrespecting all mothers. That's ludicrous.Secondly, a few reviewers have remarked about Big Russ blowing his paycheck on booze every week. Obviously these readers didn't read carefully. Tim was writing about another man in town who would take his paycheck to the bar every payday and drink it away. Tim contrasts this man with his father, who would enjoy a few cold ones every now and then, but knew that providing for his family was much more important. Big Russ was not a drunk. Maybe you reviewers should go back and re-read that chapter.Another reviewer complains that Tim Russert's book is &quot;full of errors,&quot; and backs up this claim by saying he got one word wrong when remembering a prayer from his youth. This reviewer says a half-decent editor would've caught this. I'd like to enlighten this reader by letting him know that not all prayers are taught or recited exactly the same way. It depends on the school or church, I suppose. To call it an error is wrong. It's a variation. I'm sure some people think the way you recite it is wrong. Whether it's &quot;THROUGH thy bounty,&quot; or &quot;FROM thy bounty,&quot; it hardly makes much difference, does it? Means the same thing.I could go on, but for some readers there's no hope. It's a great book about a father's influence on his son's life. Read it. Pass it on."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Edit:Tim Russert died unexpectedly on Friday, June 13, 2008. He was beloved by many and respected by many. He was one of the few political reporters that I believe gave us both sides of the story. He always spoke with eloquence and intelligence, and when he spoke, we listened.\\"People do not die for us immediately, but remain bathed in a sort of aura of life which bears no relation to true immortality but through which they continue to occupy our thoughts in the same way as when they were alive. It is as though they were traveling abroad.\\" ~Marcel ProustWe all know Tim Russert as the moderator of \\"Meet the Press\\", and now we meet Tim Russert, son of Big Russ. Tim Russert tells the story of growing up in Buffalo, and how he grew to be the man he is today has much to do with the father he idolizes. His father is his hero. This is a story of love, family love, religious love, love of sports, love of people and love of life.Much of this book has to do with the lessons learned at the knee of Big Russ. Big Russ was a hard worker- he loved his family, a wife and four children. Big Russ learned his love of life in the Army. He was in World War II and was badly injured in a plane accident. Big Russ learned valuable lessons that day- he was saved from certain death by another soldier who threw caution to the wind to save his brother soldier. Big Russ is a reticent man who does not talk much about his experiences, as is common with WWII soldiers. It took Tim Russert many years to learn about his dad and about his experiences in the Army. Tim Russert once said the person he most wanted to interview was his own dad!Tim Russert had an idyllic childhood, but it was not an easy life. He worked hard at school and hard at home. He came from a family who loved him and taught him many lessons. The family was Catholic, and his entire education was completed at Jesuit's schools. Food was a big part of their life. Big Russ worked two jobs to give his family a home, clothing and food on the table. There is an entire chapter talking about the food of the Russert home and the food of Buffalo. The roast beef weck sandwich is one of the famous foods of Buffalo but it is the Buffalo chicken wings that are the best known.Tim Russert goes on to tell about his life, college, law school, working for Senator Moynihan and Governor Cuomo. He was well liked and as always a very hard worker. His work with these politicians was noted, and he was picked by NBC to work in the news division. He became the news Director of the Washington Bureau, and was later asked to be the moderator of \\"Meet the Press\\". He has made \\"Meet the Press' the most popular Sunday political show on television. He credits his success to Big Russ who told him to be himself, and to always tell the truth, and to ask questions the little guys would ask.Tim Russert met and married a reporter, Maureen Orth, in 1983, and in 1985 one of the most important days of his life occurred with the birth of his son, Luke. Luke is a much beloved son, and from the stories Tim Russert tells, we know that Luke must idolize his dad much as Tim does Big Russ.Tim Russert has made a success of his life. He attributes much of his success to his father. Tim Russert can best describe his father with this sentence taken from Gail Godwin's book\\"Father Melancholy's Daughter\\".\\"He lived his life by the grace of daily obligations.\\"This is a book to be read again and again. Full of stories of hope and goodness and love and life. It is a feel good book. A story of the life of one of our best political reporters. I believe that Tim Russert is one of the most respected man in America.Tim Russert told us that Bruce Springsteen was one of the people he most wanted to interview. He was able to make enough money selling Bruce Springsteen concert tickets to attend college. One of Springsteen's songs:got a song to sing, keep me out of the coldAnd I'll meet you further on up the road.Further on up the roadFurther on up the roadWhere the way dark and the night is coldOne sunny mornin' we'll rise I knowAnd I'll meet you further on up the road.http://youtube.com/watch?v=sY__dua_pEg&feature;=relatedHighly Recommended. prisrob 2004"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I bought this book a while ago, meaning to read it one-of-these-days. It broke my heart to pick it up today. The values that Tim's dad taught him are the values we lost---honesty...integrity...hard work. How alike his dad's generation was to my dad's. I cried as I read it. Journalism won't be the same without Tim Russert. Thank you, Big Russ, for raising such a fine person and thank you, Tim, for writing this book. I know you will be in Heaven having debates with the Angels! God bless you. You left this world a better place."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"First, those one star reviews tell nothing about the book, and are only intended as personal assaults on Tim Russert as an interviewer on Meet The Press. makes me wonder if they even picked the book up, never mind read it.That said, I found it to be a celebration of a man whose son is justifiably proud of him. Those of us whose fathers (and mothers) grew up in the depression and survived World War II understand and and admire that generation beyond words. Sometimes the writing is a little sappy, but who among us doesn't get sentimental about parents they loved and admired. Maybe I'm an easy sell because I see so much of my own father (he passed away in 1996), and maybe it is also because my son and I have a close relationship, and love and respect for each other unconditionally.If you weren't as fortunate as Tim Russert and his father it might be difficult to relate to these feelings, but there is more, much more than that here, and whether or not you like Tim Russert personally, you have to admire his willingness to put himself out there knowing that some people will use it as an opportunity to take a swipe based not on the book but a polititical agenda.How many of us get the chance to send such an amazing, loving tribute to our fathers, a public thank you for all he has done without ever expecting anything in return?Thank you Tim."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This is a heartwarming, uplifting book. Tim Russert's &quot;Big Russ &amp; Me&quot; encompasses both his own life story and the story of his father (&quot;Big Russ.&quot;) The senior Russert grew up in a working class family in South Buffalo, New York and went off to play his part in World War II as a member of the Army Air Force. Big Russ came home after the war, married, raised four children and worked two jobs for thirty years without complaint. In the way he's lived his life and the lessons he's taught his son, he's been an exemplar of the values Americans have treasured: honesty, hard work, loyalty, self-discipline.The author also spins a warmly entertaining chronicle of his youth, where the adults in his Irish-Catholic neighborhood served as an extended family; where the parochial schools he attended did as much to shape his character as build his intellect; and where, in the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy, his own passion for politics was first awakened. Russert paints a rich, loving portrait of his first boss, New York Senator Pat Moynihan; remembers some highlights of his briefer tenure on the staff of New York Governor Mario Cuomo; and paints a lively portrait of his years at NBC News, first as a behind-the-scenes executive, and since 1991, host of Meet the Press. Along the way, he married and became a father of a son, Luke.Russert is a natural-born storyteller. Recalling his feelings of inadequacy when he moved from Moynihan's Buffalo office to Washington, D.C. and found himself surrounded with Ivy League graduates, the senator warmly reassured him that he could learn what the others knew, but they would never have what he did. After all, the senator pointed out, none of them had ever worked on the back of a garbage truck--something that Big Russ did his entire working life and his son did during the summers of his college years.This is a very personal story about one father and one son, but it's also a universal saga of all fathers and sons. I highly recommend it.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This author died today, and this book is a tiny part of his legacy. His career as a political reporter overshadowed this glimpse into the man he was, which actually made him as good at his job as he was for many years. It could stand alone as worth reading, but is essential to understanding who we're mourning; a Good, Fine man his dad's surely proud of."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"The background story behind this book is learning from your elders. In this particular one, we are talking about Tim Russert and how he explains the way that his father's knowledge (something that most children never appreciate until after the fact) and experience shaped his life. We learn of Big Russ, as he refers to his father, and how he was raise in poverty, was a WWII vet with an admirable record and his ability to raise his four children and support his household while holding down two jobs for a good part of his life. That, in itself, shows the character of Big Russ.As is the dream of every parent, Russert's life is anything but representative of the suffering his father witnessed. A wealthy lawyer, Capital Hill insider and married to a celebrity journalist, Russert is the success story his father could brag about to any and everyone.The book provides a nostalgic walk through time as the author reflects on his own life as well as that of his country. By the time you finish the book, you can understand why Big Russ earns the biggest title that any father can ever dream of. That of being seen as a hero in his own son's eyes. No amount of money or honors can ever top such a title as that."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I was at an REM concert last night, and just called my voicemail for a tear filled message from my grandmother. She said, \\"Ken your favorite person passed away.\\" I am distraught. I know I am not alone in saying that Tim was a member of my family through proxy. How can we have an election without him around for semblance? He was a shining star in an often horrendously filled genre of saturation. Tim made politics fun, easy to understand (florida, florida, florida!!) and brought the world to our living rooms in a way that only Tim could have done. He had moxy!I read Big Russ and Me a few months ago. His passion for life and the love of journalism and his religion was gracious and real. He was a real person, who's directness and personality will surely be missed. He will be irreplaceable.If you haven't read TIm's book, buy it to know him better than you do. The business of running the government was so important to him, and his utter deep respect of people that run this country, was ever present in everything he had his hands on. The book is brilliant.I would have liked to have known him in real life, yes indeed, I would have liked that very much. I will miss my friend."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"If you lived through the 50's and 60's think it would been even more meaningful. It does tug at the heartstrings though. More than once I had to stop because of the tears. I wish I could have been as lucky to have the realtionship with my father. A quick, easy and lighthearted read."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"It seems that if you had a happy childhood filled with genuine love and respect among family members, and you write about it, you must be prepared for the inevitable nastiness of those who were not fortunate enough to have had that type of experience. That is what I find among these reviews. People who had unhappy childdhoods invariably have to trash those who did. Tim Russert has told a loving, heartwarming, funny, inspiring account of his childhood, that happens to mirror that of thousands of other baby boomers. It has nothing to do with politics, with the author's job, etc. This book should serve an example of what parents should be doing today; putting their kids and their kids needs first among all things. Also, the guy who described Tim's father as working 95 hours a week and spending half his paycheck on beer is dead wrong. Tim Russert specifically says that he is thank ful that his father WAS NOT one of those father who drank half his paycheck.It's a good book, easy to read and should serve as an example to all."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Just purchased a copy of Tim's book on Big Russ and lessons on life after spending much of this past weekend viewing his tributes on MSNBC. I'm purchasing this book to have as a memoir of how to live life and achieve the ultimate here on earth, which is a legacy. Not just any legacy, but one enriched with touching others both near and far. While Tim was the gold standard of journalists, he's the elite standard as a human being. My father had a similar untimely death at a similar age, and viewing Tim's personal story, relationships, and family bonds has made this a personal must read for me. Tim Russert made all of us feel that he was one of us, which is why the political news scene and that bond of trust and credibility will be so sorely missed. Tim, thanks for your boyish enthusiasm, every-man sensibility, and good old fashioned faith and adherence to living a life with values.Tim, thanks for laying this book down for all of us. Your legacy is secure."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I loved this book. I only wish it were longer because the stories were so good."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I watch Meet the Press, so when I found out Tim Russert was writing a book about his life, I decided I wanted to read it. I picked up this book this morning and read right through it, cover to cover. It is an okay book, and a very easy read written at the 8th grade level (I do not mean that as an insult, I think he was writing this book for a wide audience). It tells the story of Tim Russerts life and the lessons he learned. For example, it talks about his father holding down two jobs, and how he had accumulated over 200 unused sick days by the time he retired. Yet it goes over the top, suggesting that anyone who takes a day off has a bad work ethic. The book does have a few passages that made me chuckle, like one of Russert's bosses in the sanitation department who last name was Mr. Scalavzeviz (or something like that) which nobody could pronounce, so they all called him Mr. Sonuvabitch.I hesitantly recommend this book, and forwarn people that there is a preaching like quality to the book that might rub some the wrong way, even though I do not think Russert intended it that way. But all in all, it was a good read. If you watch Meet the Press, this book is a good opportunity to gain some insight about the moderator."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"What a great book.

What a great thing to read something that someone says such wonderful things about his father and their relationships. Big Russ was very loved and respected."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"While reading Big Russ and Me, Father and Son: Lessons of Life by Tim Russert, I felt that I was reading about my own childhood. While Russert claims that this book is largely about the values that his father taught him, I think that Big Russ and Me is more about growing up in the 1950s and 1960s. I feel that things were more quiet and simpler then--thus making this a universal story.Born in 1950, Tim Russert was the son of a World War II veteran and grew up in South Buffalo. Russert realized that \\"The older I get, the smarter my father seems to get. Hardly a day goes by when I don't remember or rely on something that Big Russ taught me.\\" The chapters in Big Russ include World War II, faith, food, politics, baseball, discipline, respect, work, the pope, high school, college and law school, fatherhood, the Buffalo Bills, Meet the Press, and the people who influenced Russert throughout his early years. Although I was born five years after Russert, I kept thinking about the similarities we had. My dad was a WWII veteran who rarely talked about his experiences. I suffered through the Baltimore Catechism and Vatican II. I also attended an elementary school without a cafeteria, so I had to walk home (a mile each way) for lunch. And I always made sure that both my parents signed my report card and that my dad attended every parent night at school.As a child of the 1960s and a teacher, I really appreciate some of Russert's observations. \\"We didn't have as much homework as kids do now, and I certainly don't recall having to construct dioramas or other projects that require adult intervention, a visit to a lumber yard, or a degree in mechanical engineering. This may sound hard to believe, but when my sisters and I were in school, homework was something that children did all by themselves.\\" I especially like his comments about achievement. \\"Doing well in school was expected, and was not seen as a special achievement. It was part of a broader understanding that if you worked hard and played by the rules, things would generally work out. Self-esteem wasn't something you started out with; it was a feeling that you earned through hard work.\\" Tell that to the many, spoiled children today who feel that just participating should earn them a trophy.While I thoroughly enjoyed Big Russ and Me, I had a sad feeling while reading this as Tim Russert died suddenly only 4 years after publishing this book. Russert's son, Luke, had just graduated from college and Tim won't be around to impart similar knowledge to his young son. But hopefully, Big Russ and Me will serve as Russert's legacy to Luke."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Russert is best known as the moderator of NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" from the early nineties until his sudden death from a heart attack in 2008. The genesis of the book is Russert's admiration for the life and values of his father (\\"Big Russ\\"), a veteran of the Second World War who raised a family in south Buffalo with barely a high school education and two jobs. Given its origins, I found it curious that the book is much more about Russert than his dad. Indeed, it is basically a sugar-coated autobiography dressed up as an homage to what Tom Brokaw (a close friend of Russert) dubbed \\"The Greatest Generation.\\" The formula is as follows: Russert encounters a challenge. He overcomes the challenge. He recalls something his father once told him that explains why he overcame the challenge. Repeat for 300+ pages. This formula would be more interesting if the challenges were not so mainstream: good grades, good job, happy marriage and healthy family. How do you succeed in school? Study hard. How do you keep a good job? Work hard. Life throws you a curve ball? Pray hard. This is not exactly groundbreaking advice and it is awkward to watch Russert, a very bright and engaging journalist, wear the \\"aw shucks\\" hat so well. While it is tempting to make fun of this book on a number of levels I would be dishonest if I claimed to not enjoy it. I liken it to watching episodes of The Wonder Years: a way to revisit interesting times in American history, and your own childhood, without any emotional or intellectual heavy lifting."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Anyone who grew up in the 50's era must read this book.

The book is filled with his humor, insight, humanity, and ethics."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I loved this book. It brings you back to much simpler times when children respected their parents and did not question authority. Big Russ reminded me so much of my own father, who passed away in 2006. My father always said, \\"What a country!\\". I wonder how many vets of that era used that expression and have many of their families thought they were the only ones who did!

This book makes it even harder to fathom and is a wonderful tribute to a great news man and his devotion to family is obvious."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Until Russert's recent death, I had ignored his book, under the rule that media superstars usually hire their staffs to do the research and most of the writing; and they then just edit these \\"told to\\" tracts, revealing just enough so that their agents can get them on the best sellers list. As a result, there are some really bad \\"told tos\\" circulating \\"out there.\\"Not so in Tim's case.He and Big Russ are the genuine articles: This book, an excellent and a quick read, is a true page from Gothic America. While reading this book all I could do was recall my relationship with my own father and then envy Tim's relationship with Big Russ. Most of us baby boomers had fathers who fit the \\"Big Russ mold:\\" Men who served in World War II as draftees into the army as part of America's \\"only upward mobility program.\\"They came home from the war with both rich experiences as well as with physical and psychological scars but wouldn't talk about either, unless prompted, and then usually only very late in their lives. All got married and raised a family, and did so out of the same kind of duty that had caused them to serve in the military. It was done automatically because it was what was expected of them.It is easy enough to forget that this silent call and response to duty: to family and country, before duty to self, is what made America a great country. Big Russ came home got married, and raised a family of four on a garbage man's salary. How many of us in today's social climate would be as genuinely proud of our fathers as Tim was of \\"Big Russ\\" if our fathers had been garbage men for thirty years?All one needs to know about Tim's character is that he proudly \\"pulled garbage can duty\\" along side his father during school breaks. To me, that is the book: That about says all that needs to be said about Tim, his father, and their relationship. It is a love story between father and son, that was passed down to the next generation.This is the hidden formula for how great men are made. Thanks Tim. Thanks Big Russ.Five stars"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"The Russert story is a vivid example of how 'family' is everything, and why financial wealth is much less important in the 'pursuit of happiness.'

While The Greatest Generation wrote about everyday people who made everyday sacrifices to build our post-War America, Big Russ and Me shares how one man of the next generation, Tim Russert, was brought up to become an effective human being by one of those post-War men of admirable character. The book is written in a humerous and warm, loving tone. Above all, it demonstrates a man's deep respect and gratitude for his father's parenthood. Yes, one can be a dad and a father at the same time.

Also, he seems to pretty much discount his Mother in this idylic childhood and her influence on him, which must have been great.

A father who worked two, sometimes three jobs, and made sure that his family was fed, and cared for.Tim's stories about his education in the Catholic schools, and his mischievous teenage years brought tears to my eyes, because I laughed so hard.His success has been well-earned, and very much deserved.Thanks for an inspiring story.

Also, I am not a fan of the Kennedys, so I found Russert's high admiration for JFK adn RFK misplaced, but that is his personal opinion. The biggest let down was that Russert BARELY mentioned his mother in the book. I realize that the book was about his father, and what he learned from him, but SURELY, his mother must have done something for him. Would it have killed him to deovote just one chapter to her efforts in raising him and his sisters. It is sad to find out that after 30 years together that the Russerts split up, but I got a sense that after 30 years of doing nothing but serving her husband and kids, Mrs. Russert realized she was not just an indentured servant feeding her husband's and, perhaps her son's, ego. Still a very worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Imagine going through your life and professional career leaning on your father's one-liners. Tim Russert describes his life and around every corner he calls his father. His father undoubtedly picks up the phone and throws out one of his famous one-liners. Russert uses that one-liner on TV the next day to boost his career. There are good thoughts in this book about teachings that every child should learn. I liked Russert's thoughts on teachers and how children have lost respect for them. Yet, I am sure that is what every generation has thought about their children compared to their own childhood. I wouldn't expect anything deep and provide from this book, unless you are looking for a couple of good one-liners."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Disappointed that I paid almost twice times the price of a book that is listed for $13.95"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I really had a hard time trying to finish this book about the perfect son and the perfect father and the perfect democrats and the perfect priests.I still don't know if this was ghost written for the catholic church or the liberal democrats as Tim wore both very prominently on his sleeve."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert's new book about his father and the lessons of life, Big Russ and Me, was an incredible disappointment. In reading this book, one is drawn to the current Walgreens Drugs commercial that features an ideallic life devoid of problems and inconveniences. That's not the way it was in South Buffalo (I'm sure), anymore than it was in New York, Chicago, Detroit or even Nashville neighborhoods.Face it. Tim wrote a Buffalo version of the television show \\"The Wonder Years.\\" At least the TV show made a pass at representing itself as fiction based on fact.Admittedly, Russert is a truly remarkable person and a quintessential American success story. His parents were not atypical of most nuclear Catholic families in America. Most reasonably successful people have very similar stories to tell.Until, that is, the \\"secret,\\" which off-handedly appeared toward the end of the book -- his parents separation.The cavalier attitude with which Author Russert treats this central fact in his household was reason enough to send the book back to the publisher with the inevitable angel stamp Nuns put on their charges' inadequate papers back then, \\"You can do better... I know you can.\\"One almost thinks there was a lot more going on in the Russert household than Tim was admitting. This is a huge fatal flaw in a nationally published book leading one to wonder whether too much of the book might be almost idealized romance from a man well into middle age longing for a simpler time.It would be nice if we knew more about the \\"inner workings\\" of these people,notably his mother and father. Why they are who they are -- what the core source of the values were and are. In short, Tim needs to be a good reporter and now just ask who, what, when, where and how, but also \\"why.\\"One of the \\"why\\" questions is the comparatively minimal and stereotypical role Mrs. Russert played in his life. She came off as a traditional housewife who cooked, cleaned and supported but who comparatively had little impact. Who was she? How did she formulate his thinking and who he is. It's amazing that she gets so little press in the book, especially given that she was with him in gross terms far more than his father was. She almost seems like a blue collar June Cleaver.Another disappointing fact was Tim' attitude toward some of the priests with whom he came in contact, specifically those who \\"might have been a bit different.\\" Given what's happened between priests and schoolboys, a four paragraph kiss-off of this subject is surprisingly light. Perhaps Mr. Russert could have shed some light on some of the more hidden secrets of the 1960s era Catholic church too, if he was so inclined.If Russert approached his Meet the Press job the way he approached this book -- he'd be the Larry King of Sunday morning television. One hopes someday Tim writes a sequel and tells us everything he did not tell us in this book about life in the 1950s and 1960s in South Buffalo."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert's book is a great tribute to his Dad and the ideals his Dad passed on to him. I admit I'm biased...son of a blue collar Irish Catholic, and the same age as Tim. If you wern't fortunate enough to have a Dad like Tim does...or I did...you might not appreciate all that's in this book. Thank God for Dads like Tim's and mine."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Present for my dad and my brothers. Great Russert job! Quality of the binding/trimming of pages was poor - had to separate many!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Let me just state that I have no axe to grind -- I like Tim Russert as a journalist, I generally agree with his politics, and I live in upstate New York -- so I was really looking forward to this book. I read it from cover to cover and was very disappointed at the pedestrian writing and lack of insight about world events and personal events. When Russert writes about earth-shaking world events, such as the assassinations of King and Kennedy, his pedestrian observations and inability to provide intelligent commentary leave one almost angry. And when he writes about personal events, he renders even potentially moving moments completely mundane. One isolated example: when his son tells Russert that, despite Russert's love for baseball, his son is more interested in NASCAR and golf, Russert expounds that our children are individuals and we can't expect them to be carbon copies of ourselves. The anecdote was so mundane that, rather than tears running down my cheeks as Russert possibly intended, I could barely bring myself to keep reading. Spare yourself and read something else instead."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Reading BIG RUSS & ME by Tim Russert reminded me of my childhood, in that the author grew up around the time that I did . . . he watched some of the same television shows, played some of the same games and had a dad who taught him some of the same lessons that I was fortunate enough to have learned.Russert, the marvelous host of MEET THE PRESS, has written a &quot;feel good&quot; memoir about what it was like to grow up in the 1950s . . . in reading it, I felt like the author was right infront of me--telling me about his childhood . . . and most importantly, about his hardworking father who worked two jobs without complaint for thirty years.It certainly wasn't an easy thing to do, but Big Russ never stopped to question his fate . . . he just did what he had to do, every day, never stopping to take a day off just because he was tired or may have felt the desire to do so.Consequently, Tim Russert learned to appreciate the values of self-discipline, of respect, of loyalty to friends, and you will too if you read this book . . . methinks it would also make a marvelous gift to give to your dad or somebody else's dad for no other reason than just because you were thinking of them.There were several memorable passages; among them:During normal times, the Queen Mary carried eleven hundred passengers, plus a sizable crew. When Dad's group made the crossing there were more than fourteen thousand men on board, which was not unusual during the war. Berths were everywhere--stacked six high in lounges, function rooms, and even in empty swimming pools. The men slept in shifts. They were fedtwice a day, also in shifts, and were given only a few minutes to eat. To ease congestion, all pedestrian traffic on board was one way: to move forward you walked on the starboard side; to move back you used the port side. All passengers had to wear life jackets in case they were attacked. There was no smoking, and even chewing gum was forbidden because it was hard to remove from the decks. The weather was rotten and many of the men were seasick. When I think about the crossing, I can't imagine how men of my own generation would have fared on board.I thought back to the time we had gone to the NASCAR race, and I realized that I was learning that same lesson all over again. Luke was my son, but that didn't mean he was Tim Russert, Junior, or an instrument for Tim Russert to relive his youth. Yes, he's my son, but no, he's not me. Moreover, he was not breaking away, casting me aside, or turning his back on all of our shared memories. He was following his heart, just as I had done in my youth. That was his job, and I, too, had a job to do. My job was to reconcile myself to his uniqueness and his independence, to embrace it and encourage it. I couldn't allow my love as a father to suffocate his individualism. To put it another way, I had to remember not to get between a boy and his dreams.I soon found out. Jerry Bruno walked over to a white courtesy telephone and told the operator, &quot;Would you please ask Robert Kennedy to meet his party at Gate 3?&quot; A moment later, we heard the announcement:&quot;Robert Kennedy, Mr. Robert Kennedy, please meet your party at Gate 3.&quot; Immediately, about half the people in the airport converged on Gate 3. Bruno then repeated his request, and the crowd grew. When Kennedy stepped off the plane, a couple of hundred people were there to greet him. I was impressed. So that's what an advance man did."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I knew Tim Russert in college and he was an absolute &quot;regular guy&quot; with no pretenses whatsoever.

Those who, as I did, grew up in Buffalo at the same time, recognize countless details. Russert grew up in blue-collar, Irish Catholic South Buffalo; went to Catholic schools including elite Canisius High School on a scholarship; and similarly worked his way through college and law school. Russert worked on the staffs of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and N.Y. Governor Mario Cuomo before finding his way to NBC. Not only has he not forgotten his roots, he credits the upbringing he had - personified in his father but really extending to both parents, the nuns and priests and whole adult world around him - with keeping him grounded and having given him the discipline and work ethic to succeed, as he has in hosting \\"Meet the Press\\" for more than 15 years. This book is full of great anecdotes - Russert has the Irish gift of gab - and a fine memoir of a city that has since fallen on tough times. And it's refreshing to have someone document the good done by old-fashioned child-rearing methods that too many people seek to discredit nowadays."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I have never met this man of honor.

He was always prepared, civil but most of all he was always fair. During this last Democratic primary, he was the only one who was unbiased in his presentations, questioning and reporting. A viewer was never aware of Tim's own personal opinions and so could thereby independently make his / her own informed decisions. And that is what reporting should be about.I did not know the man, but I feel as if I have lost a member of my own family. I will miss his guidance during the upcoming election and deeply mourn his passing."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I was interested in reading Big Russ and Me, because Tim Russert is one of the most respected journalists and one of the best political minds in the media. I wanted to learn more about this man who has been on television so much the last 2 decades. As the title states, this book is about the relationship and lessons a father teaches his son. Russert not only talks the relationship he has with his father He talks the relationship he has with his own son Luke and the passion of sports they both share.Tim Russert has so much respect and love for his father, and he explains clearly why in this book. Big Russ, or Tim Russert Sr. prepared and inspected parachuttes during World War 2. He later held down later down 2 jobs as a trash collector and a newspaper delivery truck driver and never missed a single day of work in his life. Tim Russert learned from his father the value of hard work and to take pride in whatever he did.Russert talks about the things he loves like baseball, food, cars. Russert is also proud of his strict Catholic upbringing, working in a church as a teenager, and attending Catholic schools throughout his life. He also talks and the other people who inspired him throughout his life like his 7th grade teacher Sister Lucille who made him editor of his school newspaper and gave him a love of writing and reading. Father Sturum was another teacher and influence who taught him discipline and accountability. Tim Russert worked as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's assistant in the mid 70s. Moynihan became his political and intellectual mentor. The late senator taught Russert how to respect true intelligence, ask good questions, and how to disagree agreeably. This is a skill Russert does so well as moderator of Meet the Press every week.Big Russ and Me is a very entertaining and heartwarming book about the lessons we learn from our fathers. It is also about how teachers and coworkers can play such an important part in our lives. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I was lucky enough to get an early copy of this book in galleys from the publisher before it came out -- and finished it in one day. Although I've never met Russert, it's not the type of book you'd expect from anyone who works in Washington. It's rich with great descriptions and moving, humble, simple life lessons that resonate long after you close the last page. I was taken far more with Russert's early life in Buffalo than with his later years in Washington, but that in no way diminishes the overall book. Lots of titles are over-hyped today, but that's not the case with this one. It's a beautiful love letter to the Dad, family, and community who raised him."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"A book that leaves you a little smarter, a little wiser and little better person for having read it.

To us Sundays will not be the same without Tim on Meet the Press. We too have lost something but also are reminded of how little time we have left to pull someone up and let them know they made a difference.

I hope she gets it back so I can read it."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This book is a love letter of sorts written to the author's dad \\"Big Russ\\". But it's more than that. It tells the story of Tim's childhood in the 50's which seems pretty darn ideal and gives a clear picture of what growing up during that time frame was all about. Men worked two jobs to bring home the bacon and wouldn't be caught dead living on welfare, they taught their kids responsibility and manners while a loving mom stayed home to cook and pretty up the house. Their kids didn't complain and whine because dad was working too much or they didn't have the latest new kicks. Our world has changed so much, some of it for the better, I could never stay home and cook bacon all day (though I wouldn't mind staying home and reading all day), but some of the changes I could do without. It was nice to spend some time in a world so very different from my own.As a youngster Tim seems to have been untouched by the ugliness that too many of us grow up with as wee children be it abusive parents, divorce, suicide, alcohol, poverty and has a nice thing to say about everyone. I wish I could be half as kind on any given day. There were some darker moments when he describes Big Russ's time in the military but he doesn't dwell on the darkness. Instead he uses those experiences to explain how Big Russ became the strong, loving, father figure that he later became. Tim was a good boy who seems to have grown up to be a very nice man.This book was very sweet and down to earth and I did enjoy listening to most of it. I can't say I exactly identified with any of it all that much having grown up in the 70's with a very different set of parents, and being a girl, but it was nice to read about a family who was always decent to their kids and taught them to work hard and take responsibility for their actions. Tim seems like a very lucky guy who lived an almost charmed life and was blessed to have met several influential and inspirational people in his life who nudged him in the right direction.I can't say this was a gripping read, and many of the later bits focusing on sports and politics just didn't interest me at all, but for the most part it was pleasant enough to district me from glaring at other drivers jabbering away on their cell phones."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I loved this book.

This boy was his father's pride and joy. Tim's father was his mentor and the son listened and followed his father's advice all through his life. Never be ashamed of coming from a working class background. Own up to your mistakes and be responsible, don't pass the buck. Don't be ashamed of working for a living. Big Russ had good sense and sneered at those very wealthy who were so full of themselves. But the family admired the Kennedy family, possibly because they were also Irish Catholic. But the Kennedy family is rich, rich, rich. Big Russ held his son up so he could shake John Kennedy's hand. Father and son bragged about this. Big Russ dropped out of high school so he could enlist and serve his country. After service he worked two jobs supporting his family, one was working for the garbage company, the other was working for a newspaper company. He loved baseball and brought his son to Cleveland to watch their favorite team the Yankees. Big Russ taught his son to love baseball also. Tim Russert had a wonderful childhood, not wealthy but well loved. He was too young at that time to know the difference between rich and poor.Russert was a product of Catholic schools, of Catholic upbringing. When he was in seventh grade, his teacher, Sister Lucille started a school newspaper and placed Tim as editor to channel his excessive energy plus his intelligence. He was told he should go to the Jesuit High School, known for its excellent education. But could he afford to go to this school? He won a half scholarship and worked to pay for this education. There were many wealthy students at this school; the teachers and the education were excellent and Tim tells of his admiration for these men. He was used to women teachers many of them nuns. This was a change.Then on to college and climbing the ladder of success. The second half of the book was not as interesting to me. It was taken up with name dropping and meeting up with the rich and famous. I have never watched Tim Russert on televison because I don't care for lawyers and politicians. I probably should take more interest and keep up with what is going on.Tim Russert's dad was proud of him. Tim offered to buy his father a car, he could afford the best. But Big Russ picked an American car, he didn't want a snooty car or one made in Germany. He had gone to war against the Germans.This book deals with only in America where a man from a blue collar background can become a millionaire."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Big Russ & Me is both a memoir and a tribute to Tim Russert's father. The recollections harken back to a time when life was less complicated than today and the family values of hard work and following the rules were more commonplace.The book is about BOTH Tim's father, an airmen who saw service as part of the greatest generation, and Tim, the journalist and how Big Russ influenced and shaped the son's life and career. It is written in simple and folksy terms and is even corny in parts but those who have lived through the War as well as those who grew up in the 50s and 60s will immediately relate to the stories.There is plenty here to cling to. If you are Irish-Catholic, went to Catholic school, were raised in a blue-collar neighborhood and if your kids succeeded beyond your wildest dreams, you can relate to the Russert's story. If you have a relative who served in the War, you'll find that part of the book both gripping and soul-searching. The full color glossy photos vividly help bring back the past .The book is not a literary masterpiece but it is written well enough from the heart to make one comfortable with enjoying it.John E.

I know he will think about all the life lessons that he will want to pass on to his son."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"In his career as journalist and host of NBC's Meet the Press, Tim Russert was known for being prepared. He asked the hard questions of his high-profile Sunday morning guests, and his astute coverage of U.S. political elections was legendary. Time Magazine named his as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. When Russert died unexpectedly in June 2008, the outpouring of tributes was overwhelming.Any person so well known and respected can be expected to write a book; people want to know all about the forces that shaped such a focused life, and we surely want to know all the secrets and details involving other players on the world stage. It's interesting that Tim Russert chose to write such a sentimental first book. There is nothing hard-hitting about this tender memoir. What books would he have given us, I wonder, if he'd lived out his expected life span?Despite the title, this book is definitely a memoir. Timothy Joseph \\"Big Russ\\" Russert features in many scenes, but he was certainly not the author of the environment in which young Tim grew up. If you were born in America in the middle of the 20th century, the simple family values expressed inBig Russ and Me : Father and Son: Lessons of Lifewill feel almost excruciatingly poignant. If you were raised in the Catholic church and schools of that era, the details of Russert's primary years at \\"parochial school\\" will strike a chord. You may not have gone to an elite Jesuit high school, but perhaps you worked hard to put yourself through university in that time of upheaval; maybe that was a huge milestone for your family, a good degree from a good college. There were challenges; the death of the Kent State students rocked universities badly, and during the Vietnam War the student draft deferment was a powerful incentive to stay in school even for those who saw the social injustice in it.If you are Irish American, you'll know exactly what Russert was feeling when John Kennedy was shot and killed. That painful time, John and Martin and then, unbelievably, Bobby ... these are some of the landmarks of Russert's youth, and if you are of that time, they're yours too.If you grew up in South Buffalo as Russert did, don't even think about missing this book.I'm not sure it's enough, from a man so steeped in American culture and politics. Russert goes on to tell of his work with Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Mario Cuomo, but the heart of \\"Big Russ and Me\\" is the American Dream as realized by baby boom families raising children in the 1950s and 60s. Those \\"Wonder Years\\" have a soft focus, and \\"Big Russ and Me\\" is a pleasant addition but gives us nothing new, asks no hard questions. It's a nice feel-good book and there's always room for that. Just know that's what you are getting, when you pick it up. Four stars.Linda Bulger, 2009"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This book was not meant to be a nuanced portrait, so you won't like it if that is what you are looking for. Russert's tale is simple and straightforward. He's and trying to remember a lot of the good things he learned over his too-short life. Being from Buffalo, having met him in 1991, and being a big fan of his Meet The Press--yes, I had a lot of personal interest in the story. There is a lot that is missing that could have gone into the book, but then again, I would not have read a 1,000 page opus. What I like best is how the book showcases Tim--his optimism, his work ethic, his faith and his lack of pretense. And for that, its worth reading even if you aren't from Western New York."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"The problem I have with this book is that Tim Russert appears to avoid substance. Specifically, he strays from really getting into a honest analysis of his own deficiencies as a reporter.For example, he clearly had little to do with providing insight into the ongoing problems of Iraq. In fact, in weeks before the prison scandal Russert was grilling Kerry on why he threw his ribbons away while at the same time the huge scandal was about to go public.The book fails on several levels and comes across as empty in depth. To me, if you want to really understand the media read Bob Woodward or Sy Hersh but avoid the Russert drivel.Tim Russert is a millionaire Washington insider who has little connection to the real world despite his thin efforts to say otherwise. His reporting is out of sinc with other better journalists and, as a result, his book is not worth reading.There are far better journalists to read about. Pursue their life stories."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"While Timothy likes Lexus and Mercedes, his dad likes Crown Victoria. Although Tim has inherited the great humility of his dad, he also inherited the desire to remain docile. For example, he failed to aggressively challenge the President and the vise President on the motives for going to war. He naively swallowed the propaganda of WMD, liberation and democratization or Iraq, and the protection of the Middle East oil resources. The suspicion that Mr. Bush has gone to war for hire, on behalf of the Kuwaitis and the Zion lobbies to get rid of Saddam, using the American military as a mercenary army, has skipped this wealthy Washington lawyer and TV moderator.The only beneficiary of the Iraq war is the Kuwaitis and the Israelis. The former still practices slavery until the present times. Kuwaitis import immigrants from Bangladesh, Philippine, and India, restrict their right to work or travel inside Kuwait and mistreat them with subhuman housing, feeding, and underpay. The latter, Israel, has built a racist state on land that does not belong to it, brought immigrants from allover the world and displaced the original inhabitants of Palestine. Thus, Iraq war was to benefit the practice of slavery in Kuwait and racism in Israel. Recall, that VP. Richard Cheney was a supporter of Apartheid in South Africa and that both, the president and the vise president have dodged the military service in Vietnam.The humility of Big Russ might also have weakened Tim's aggressive grilling inquisition regarding vital humane and political issues. For example, he never raised the issues of the roots of terrorism with key administration figures. The September 11's attack has targeted America as a second choice, the first being the Arabic and Islamic governments that oppress millions of hopeless peoples. These are supported by America, which stands in the way of democratization of the a billion Muslims. The latest, being the deal made with colonel Qaddaffy of Libya. Al-Qaeda was a transformation of the 1940th Islamic Brotherhood organization that was organized to resist the British occupation of Egypt and the corrupt royal family of King Farouk. That organization attempted to assassinate Naser in 1956 and was brutally dismantled after the failed attempt. They later assassinated Sadat and gained wide spread popularity among the poor, educated, and oppressed Muslims. They turned their hostility against America after 1967's war, when it became apparent that America is playing the same role of Great Britain, of divide and conquer.Tim Russert witnesses the circus in the Congress that investigates the systemic failure of September 11, in which the Congress and Senate seem to look for a scapegoat somewhere else, other than within. No single senator or congressman has protested making deals with dictators, tyrants, monarchs, or racists. The \\"axis of evil\\" propaganda was promoted by the Zionist lobby to fight Israel's war on her behalf. The complacency of the Congress with politically correct issues was a major cause for lingering discrimination against Blacks in America and South Africa. The same complacency is still in work, in ignoring the disillusion of millions of Muslims with the indifference of the Congress on the issues of democracy and equality outside the borders of USA."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"and insipid waste of trees and ink.

How about a guy who promotes his own son's radio sport's show on Meet The Press without telling his viewers that it's own son that he is promoting? How about a guy who is Dick Cheney's personal Mr. Potato Head, wears \\"Bush/Cheney for President\\" buttons on the underside of his suit lapels, and then flashes the buttons at Washington cocktail parties like he WAS the dancing girl in the pasties??? Well, you get the picture...and now this Republican mole in television's Dick-bird seat on Sunday mornings writes a quaint little book about how his propensity for foping his family and servicing the Administration is the greatest thing since his daddie!

There is very little mention of his siblings and even less about his mother. He also glosses over his parent's divorce somewhat breezily.One more bone to pick:Russert seems to think that South Buffalo has the only Irish Catholics in the city-he calls one local pol a rarity: a North Buffalo Irish Catholic-not rare at all,Tim, visit St Margarets,St. Rose or St. Mark's the next time you're home. Overall a great book-a love song to Buffalo-why do we all love it so much? Go Bills!!!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I really enjoyed Tim Russert's wonderful memoir. In all lot of ways I felt as though I was reading about someone I had grown up with. He does a tremendous job of capturing the mood of growing up Irish Catholic in the '50's and '60's. A VERY ENJOYABLE READ!!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert in this book has put together his memories of life growing up and how he looked up to his father. You can tell there is a deep love and respect for his dad. A son that made it to the big time with help from his dad showing how life really is. A dad that worked many jobs to feed his family while Tim grew up and took what he learned from his dad to make it where he is today. My hat goes off to Tim for writing what he feels and the deep love for his dad. A must read for a heart warming and great feeling that you will gain from reading the book. Author- The Day Of The Rose- Larry Hobson"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"For disclosure and perspective, allow me to say that I am eighteen months younger than Tim Russert. I spent the first eight years of my life living two miles southeast of his boyhood home, not far from Holy Cross cemetery; my parents' first apartment was about four blocks south of Russert's Woodside home. We all went to Mass at Fr, Baker's Our Lady of Victory Cathedral. I watched the Bills regularly at The Rockpile, before they were fodder for national jokes about repeated failures. For these reasons and more, I enjoyed the sentimental journey back to Buffalo at a time when it was thriving, industrial, and blossoming with children. I think that every proverb Big Russ offered his son I heard from my dad as well, sometimes with the exact same phrase. The weather, the politics, the advertisements, the local stories all ring true and memorable. Russert is a local hero to beleaguered Buffalo, for his national visibility and regular recall to his roots.But I have some misgivings. First, Russert calls himself a journalist which, to my mind, means that the woman who stands up at the Kiwanis meeting and asks her congressman pointed questions, or the fellow who attends the city council meeting and probes the council with skeptical queries, that they are journalists. Russert is a lawyer and a political aide and he used another old-time technique - networking - to find and take advantage of an opportunity. He's good and his South Buffalo roots and dad's advice make Russert unpretentious and likeable, but there is no reporting, no objectivity in being prepared for an interview of a famous person.Second, given the emphasis on character, values and religion, I was shocked when Russert has to explain that his parents split after thirty years of marriage. Actually, he does not explain it. Yes, the book is \\"Big Russ and me,\\" not \\"Mrs. Russ and me,\\" but his mother deserved better. At least Big Russ could extend some of his wisdom to explain it to Little Russ.Third, Russert spends his last chapter on the woes of the Buffalo Bills. A true blue Bills fan does not use their four straight Super Bowl (what an acheivement!) losses (okay, they're not perfect) to name drop national figures who bet on games with Russert. Russert mentions Cookie Gilchrist but real Bills fans remember Jack Kemp, Al Bemiller, Billy Shaw, Tom Sestak, Mike Stratton, Butch Byrd and all the working class heroes of the Bill's glory days, well before O.J. Simpson came upon the scene. This would have been a better chapter written about those heroic Bills and set in the early part of the book, not as a tail end thought.The stories offer some reasonably interesting insights into life in South Buffalo. The writing is like Big Russ: clear, direct, and not complex. Much of what Big Russ has to say is pretty standard for his generation. He seems to be hard working, straightforward and candid. He keeps Little Russ on the straight and narrow and reminds him of his roots. The purpose of the book is to provide some guidance for Little Russ' son. Luke, but the advice is mostly lukewarm.A final note: Wise Big Russ tells Tim that a man who lies about his military record will lie about anything. So who are the Russerts supporting for president this year?"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Book was back ordered, I just received and have not read the book and Ihave already sent this review once. Please do not ask me again.Thanks you, Betty"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Russert tell us he has a nice dad, but as a journalist, he tells us whatever the government wants us to hear. From 2001--2003, when Vice President Dick Cheney was avoiding television interviews, he granted Russert a series of exclusive interviews, in which he said that Iraq had nuclear capabilities and represented an imminent threat to the United States. In subsequent interviews with Russert, he told Americans that our troops would be met by Iraquis as liberators and that oil revenue would finance Iraq's reconstruction. Russert accepted these false assertions at face value and failed to challenge Cheney on the truth of these claims.Washington Insiders sell Russert as someone who rigorously cross examines his interviewers. But in Cheney's case, no cross examination took place.NBC and Russert have done an excellent job selling Russert and his book--too bad they did such a poor job in questioning the government's dishonest sale of the Iraqui war to the American people."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"A sprawling midlife crisis in the key of DULL, Russert's magnum crapus seems more like a product to flog the legend of RUSSERT across all NBC's other programs than an honest portrait of his father. His pathetic paen comes off as an attempt to get the reader to project these mythical superdad qualities onto Not-So-Little Russert - shameless selfpromotion of the sort typical in the circles Russert runs in. Rich corporate fatcats with Nantucket estates pretending to pass for blue collar salt of the earth tapes... the Dubya Method, in other words.Frighteningly empty cliches litter each page like dead cockroaches, anecdotes with no point attempt to tug at the heartstrings but end up aiming more for the stomach. A nauseating brew of egomania and false modesty can be a sickly mix indeed!I'm looking forward to him appearing on every NBC program yet again every time a new printing is issued - they have to do that, considering he probably buys thousands of copies to give out as Christmas presents.Here's to hoping he includes the receipt!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"In the past 3 weeks we've seen:1. Tim Russert throw out the game ball for the Orioles2. Tim's wife on NPR talking about what a humble man he is3. Tim - an interviewer for NBC - being interviewed by Katie Couric - another interviewer - on NBC.What is going on here?Of course we all know this is just part of the media circuit required to be run by someone trying to sell a book. But a book about what? How great your dad was? (and by association how great you must be for honoring him in such a public manner?) I guess we can all look forward to the next book where Tim talks about how great his son is and how much he loves the Bills.The fact of the matter is that Tim has made a very profitable career by being the nice guy everyone pretends to like so they can use him and his tv show. Proof? The day before Saddam Hussein's capture announcement, Tim was at a cocktail party with Donald Rumsfeld. Donald was very coy and confident and Tim smelled a story (or so he told us a few days later). But the real story here is this: Why is this 'journalist' sipping cocktails on a saturday night with the very people he should be objectively reporting on?Celebrity Journalist is an oxymoron, Tim. Tell your perfect family how great they are in private. Your insistence to insert yourself into the story makes you worse than those idiots at Fox."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Russert likes to start his promotional interviews for Big Russ And Me, by recalling how the first two people to read this book were his father and his son. They should have been the last. I purchased this novel for my dad as a father's day gift. If he wants it, he will have to retrieve it from the garbage can i threw it in. Big Russ is an idiot. There is no virtue in working 95 hours a week for minimum wage, and drinking yourself into a stooper with the families paycheck.

Tim Russert: &quot;Big Russ and Me: Father &amp; son...lessons on life&quot;. Hey Tim I have a book for you to read......&quot;Farenheit 451.....the temperature at which Big Russ and Me Burns&quot;"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert tells the story of an admirable man, Big Russ, his father, who grew up poor, survived a bomber crash in world war two and went on to support his wife and four children by working at two jobs for thirty years. Russerts life, however, bears absolutely no resemblance to that of his father. He is a lawyer and millionaire Washington D.C. beltway insider, married to a glamorous celebrity journalist, Maureen Orth. If Russert had limited himself to a discussion of the impact of character and values on his father's own life, the book could have held up as the story of a good man, Big Russ. Unfortunately, Russert wants the reader to think that as a result of his father's example and teachings, he himself is both a good journalist and a good man.Russert graduated from law school and before his political connections led him to NBC, he worked as a political aide. Those who watch &quot;Meet the Press&quot; know that although Russert asks&quot;tough questions&quot; of all his guests, he is quite selective in his application of follow-up questions. For example during the run-up to the war in Iraq, Vice President Richard Cheney told a complacent Russert that oil revenues would finance the war, Iraqis would greet Americans as liberators, and Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. After the unchallenged forums Russert has provided Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz over these last couple of years, Russert can hardly be called a good journalist."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert is a television personality who interviews politicians, lobbyists, political consultants, and pundits. Because he neither investigates nor researches, Russert is unable to contrast responses with independent information, so guests are free to make unsupported claims and groundless assertions. Many programs, including those hosted by O'Reilly, Matthews, Scarborough, and Hannity, follow the same format, but Meet the Press has the largest audience, probably because Russert's behavior is less antic than that of his competitors. The question that Russert's show and the others raise is why do their hosts call themselves journalists. Actually, they are nothing more than uninformed television personalities giving their guests the chance to broadcast political propaganda.The Bush Administration has always found Tim a congenial host and has expertly used Meet the Press these last three years to sell its tax and fiscal policies, its health and education programs as well as the war in Iraq. In any event, Russert is always behind the issues, with his nose in the air, waiting to sense which way the wind is blowing so as not to offendThe fact that Russert chose to write a story about his father is typical of his disingenousness. His father represents the old time values of sacrifice, hard work and respect for traditional virtues. There is nothing in Russert's work to suggest that he shares these values. Overall, the reader is left with the impression that Russert writes about his dad so he doesn't have to tell the truth about himself."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert's recent performance on Meet the Press, where he had the audacity to challenge the emotional outburst of Mr. Broussard in the wake of Katrina brings into question just what the \\"life lessons\\" were that his father taught him. Aside from its callousness, it reveals fundamental flaws in Tim Russert's character that if attributable to his upbringing, beg the question, what right does Tim Russert have to laud his father's influence in his book, Big Russ and Me?Mr. Russert's so called dogged journalistic pursuit of Mr. Broussard was founded in the findings of web blogs. Is that sound journalism? Was there anything to be gained by challenging the exact date and time of what was a tragic event? Is he such a shill for the white house that it is more important to desecrate the memory of someone's mother in order to protect the administration from blame?No, nothing justifies Mr. Russert abusing the position he holds in the media except the selfish pursuit of trying to burnish his own image and make a name for himself.Since that seems to be the rationale, than Big Russ has failed as a father and a parent, turning out a loathsome individual with little morality, honor or integrity. Why anyone would read a book that celebrates that sort of parenting is ludicrous.Mr. Russert, you should be ashamed for yourself and the memory of your father. Most of America is."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"...if 'Ryan from CT' had spelled stupor correctly it may have given more credence to his review of this book!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Ack!

As nostalgic as I would love to be, the Russert's good-old-days Horatio Alger saga is too saccharine to digest. By sugarcoating everything, he missed the opportunity to put his life into any context other than his father and Russert's catholic schooling. (It is very interesting that even a drinking while driving story becomes nostalgic - because apparently beer did not impair driving ability in the good old days.)In the second portion of the book, we are apparently supposed to be impressed with Russert's name dropping, and the humble way he tries to pretend that he is not name dropping.Tim Russert Cleary wrote this book for his father. In that respect, it is a thoughtful and touching gift. Unfortunately, it has no a literary, historical, or cultural value for the rest of us. Leave it as an honorable personal gesture to his father; but do not bother to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"The book \\"Big Russ & Me\\" was never received by my son.

I find one difference in how it is presented by Tim to the media and what it really is, though. This is not a negative criticism, it's more of an obeservation. In all of his interviews, I've come away with the impression that this book is about his dad and what his dad has done for him. However, I left the book thinking this was more of an autobiography of Tim Russert. It details how he grew up and how his teachers, his priests, his political colleagues, his NBC colleagues, and how his father influenced and shaped his life and brought him to the point he is now.Again, this is no complaint. I enjoyed the whole book and enjoyed hearing his life story. I also strongly recommend the book. I'm just saying I went into it thinking the whole book was about Big Russ, but it wasn't.Tim's story is a great story showing the American dream. Small town boy with no connections grows up with a father that teaches him lessons he uses to this day. His father wanted a better life for his boy and he (Tim) wants a better life for his son. It's the American dream and Tim, with the help of his father, lived it and is able to tell the story. This story gives hope, comfort, and joy to those that read it. You will laugh, cry, and leave the book wanting to be a better person. Hats off to Tim and Big Russ (and Luke as well) for a job, and a life, well done."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This is really an autobiography of Tim Russert. That is not necessarily a bad thing; it just seems like the hype for the book doesn't really make that clear.Although I thought it started off a bit slow, I enjoyed it more and more as I went along. Part of that was nostalgia. Russert takes us back to a more relaxed and kinder time in our history for most of the book.The author's father, Big Russ, is a typical middle class American from the WWII generation - hardworking, loyal, patriotic. He obviously had a big impact on his son's life, which is a very positive thing for the most part.Russert has generally struck me as a fairly balanced reporter, which is a real rarity among the major network news people. His book shows that he comes from the liberal perspective that is rare these days; he is a liberal without the 'blame America first' mindset.He has some wise comments on perspective. One of them is: \\"The older I get, the smarter my father seems to get.\\" He talks with admiration about his father's generation - the group who beat the Germans and Japanese in WWII: \\"They didn't talk about it, they just did it.\\"Another good observation was about current child rearing methods: \\"I believe that parents of my generation have often failed our kids. We are so eager to be understanding and sympathetic that we end up being too lenient, even as we further undermine the already diminished authority of teachers, coaches and principles.\\"One of his most revealing comments contrasted his political hero, Bobby Kennedy, with liberals of today: \\"But with Kennedy, unlike some of the liberals who followed him, the message was never about blaming America. He insisted that we were a great country, but that we could do better.\\"Russert reviews several life lessons that are good including sections on respect, faith, work, fatherhood, and discipline. Perhaps the best section was on loss (death).This may not be a great book, but it is a worthwhile one."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert has written a book to pay his father back for raising him the way he thinks he should have been raised. He prises his dad for taking care of him and his family working two jobs and on very little money. Big Russ gave his time to protect our country and at the same time protecting his family. It's a story that many of us can relate to with our own dads. Its a great read - Author- The Day Of The Rose"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. I loved how Russert interwove the antecdotes his father taught him throughout his life and made them relevant to the decisions and actions he has displayed through his youth and into adulthood. Russert understood growing up in Buffalo that his father was a hard-working man who might not have been able to spend a lot of time with him, but made the time they did spend together valuable. It was so typical of the times and Russert understood that and took that work ehtic with him into as a grown man.They have a very special relationship and it shows now in the relationship Russert has with his own son. I love the stories about Tim working for the Buffalo Sanitation department all the way up to his meetings with the Pope. I was sad when this book ended because I wanted to hear more of his wonderful stories between him and his father and some of his NBC stories."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I first heard of this book only a day before it's release last week, while Shawn Hannidy interviewed Tim Russert on his radio show. I consider myself a news hound and beleive Russert is the best at what he does. He reminds me of a ' junkyard dog' with that ' growl' look he has.After listening to the 5 CD's in two days while driving I found out alot about my own father and my life growing up in the fifties and sixties, or where the parents of those who did.Tim reads the Audio version with such feeling and emotion that you are transformed into his life, and since I was born and raised in a Jewish family and area,and married a Catholic goddess this book gave me invaluable insight to the stories she has recounted of her own family growing of in South Dakota. We both agree that among the fifty or so audio books we have listened to over the past year this makes our TOP FIVE list.This past week, as some of you know, while interviewing Colin Powell from IRAQ on MEET THE PRESS ' LIVE' an aide of the Sec't of State pushed the camera away from Powell when Tim asked him a 'delicate ' question'. Out came that junkyard dog look of Tim's and he said to The Secretary of the United Staes on LIVE NBC TV \\" Mr. Secretary this is quite inapprotriate\\". How many of the Mr. Softies like Larry King,Katie Couric, Matt Laurer,Diane Sayer,etc. would have handled that awkward situation like Tim. Like all the message's in his book state, Be prepared for anything.I would stongly recomend this book to anyone over forty. It probaly wouldn't be that interesting if you where not a ' baby boomer or a parent of one. That about 60% of us! Great writting,story telling and the value of friends and family Tim. I will continue to be a faithful Meet the Press viewer. Thanks for reminded how our parents build this country. As Brokaw wrote they really are ' The greatest generation' and as Yogi says \\"It over till it's over\\" You have many fans here in Philadelphia!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I was deeply saddened to hear of Tim's passing. He was a true gentleman and a family man. He loved his wife, son and family. He was one of a kind and his smile and dedication was infectious. Although we do not understand why one passes we need to trust that the Lord has our plan. His son just graduated from Boston college three weeks ago and we know how proud Tim was. He was with his family up until his enterance into the Almighty Kingdom of God as God Must have needed someone whom could provide great coverage honestly.I will miss your smile. I will pray for your wife, son, Father and all of your NBC friends who will truly miss you.I know you are with God as you wore Jesus' smile every day of your life.

His relationship with his father is enviable, and if the book seems a bit soft or too good to be true, it's a sign of Russert's genuine regular-guy persona. It's always great to read a memoir more concerned with the story than the literary leaps of the writing or the ego of the author. My other favorite family memoir is &quot;I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,&quot; by Bruce Stockler, a hilarious, heartwarming and surprisingly honest account of marriage, fertility, being a Dad, work, career and making new priorities."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"I agree with Randy Crews. This is an autobiography in lambs clothing. In all of Tim Russert's interviews during his June media blitz, he gave you the impression that this book is about his dad first and foremost and the impact he had on Tim.However, the real meat of this book is Tim's autobiography seasoned along the way with sage advice from his dad. I got the book as a gift on Father's Day from one of my daughters. I sat down and started to read it that night. It's an easy read- - a good story, once you adjust to the false impression that it will be mostly about the father.I was interested to learn how &quot;Little Russ&quot; (maybe that should be Medium-Large Russ) came from a working class family- where his father worked two jobs so he could provide for his children's future, which for Tim meant a law degree, the opportunity to work on the staff of a U.S. Senator and eventually land the post of host of Meet the Press. As he has grown and matured, Tim has treasured his father's advice. He still turns to him - to hear the voice of Middle America. In an attempt to prevent from being infected with Beltway myopia, Tim solicits input each Monday about that week's Meet the Press from his focus group of one- Dad!I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"until I read this book. I did enjoy the book, reading about his childhood and his father. I also found his Catholic upbringing very interesting to read about. He was very devout in his religion. I loved hearing about the Nuns and Priests that taught him.I wish that he would have written more about his mother and three sisters. They were barely mentioned in the book. I would like to know how he got along with his sisters, the kind of influence his mother was on him, etc., but none of that was talked about. When his parents were divorced it was mentioned but glossed over very quickly which I found odd.Toward the end of the book when the chapters turned to politics it was all about him, and only a mention here or there of his father. He had grown up and moved out by that point, so I'm sure his father wasn't as central a figure in his life as he had been, but still, this book was supposed to be about him and his father, not just himself.The book wasn't sequential at all, which I found very confusing. One minute he's telling a story from his childhood and the next he's going to college. It was hard to keep track of how old he was or what was going on because there was no timeline.Overall an okay book. Not gripping and not one that I had a hard time putting down."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This book is more of a Tim Russert autobiography than a story about his relationship with his father. Granted, there are anecdotes about his father, but they are more a side story than the main theme of the book. It is really the story of Tim Russert's life and a sentimental look at the relationships from father-to-son-to-son, covering three generations of Russerts. In light of Tim's untimely death, some of his observations throught the book are ironic.A good gift for a father to son or son to father.

What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! \\"Big Russ and Me\\" probably will appeal to all generations for all the reasons that Tim Russert intended it to, but Baby Boomers, i.e., Russert's generation, probably will enjoy the book even more on account of the memories it evokes, intentionally or not, of growing up in the '50s and early '60s. That's what hooked me, more than the story of the relationship between Russert and his father, although this too, which is the book's primary theme, is indeed interesting and Russert writes about it skillfully and engagingly. If you are a Baby Boomer, this book's for you. Even if you're not, it's still a good read."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Tim Russert shares many stories from his chilhood about his father, baseball, school, and important days in history like the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Of course, I especially loved his stories about baseball in Buffalo and growing up a Yankee fan. An unexpected bonus was learning new things about Yankee icon Yogi Berra. Reading this after his passing, I found it fascinating how many of his early lessons revolved around his mortality. Hearing Russert discuss his admiration for his son and the time they spent together makes the story even more powerful. Indeed we learn a lot from our fathers, and it seems we learn a lot when we become fathers too. I also anjoyed hearing about the lessons he learned from his three most influential teachers."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Just great and so down to earth. What ALL kids need to learn about interacting with dads and moms and vice-versa. GOD is huge in the books."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"We enjoyed this book very much. Listening to Tim Russert's voice made it feel like you were sharing stories with an old friend. His appreciation of his humble beginnings and up bringing are very evident. You can see why so many people connected with how he delivered the important world happenings and made it relevent to all. A great story of how simple a fathers love can be. Do not turn it off until you hear the epiloge, very tender, especially now."},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"Wonderful reminiscences of his childhood and relationship with his Father. The book took me back to my childhood and fun times in the empty lot with kids. Being out all day. Riding bikes. Mom making donuts for the neighborhood kids while we were busy building snow forts or christmas tree forts. What fun times!"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"A personal story of the relationship between a father and his son. This story personifies what a father/son relationship should be. The values of the father handed down to the son serve to bring that son into manhood and establish his outlook on life, his ethics and moreover his treatment of this fellow man. An excellent book and a must read for every father/son relationship.Robert Allen, Author:A \\"Guest\\" of the Confederacy The Civil War Letters and Diaries of Alonzo M. Keeler, Captain, Company B, Twenty-second Michigan Infantry"},{"Title":"Big Russ and Me","review":"This is a book that everyone should read! Makes you realize how important family is and what having moral values really mean. It also makes you think about what kind of person you want to be remembered as and especially what you would like to teach your children. I absolutely loved it. Wish we still lived in those days. The world has changed so much and I can't say it's for the best."},{"Title":"Book Report: Helping Aspiring Authors Help Themselves","review":"Book Report is a very useful guide that I turned to again and again while crafting my book proposal. I was impressed by the author's ability to not only cover the nuts and bolts of writing a proposal, but also to succinctly convey what makes a quality proposal. Particularly useful were the parenthetical tips the author inserted throughout samples in the appendix. With Mark Shaw's style and ability to anticipate writers' questions and omissions, I felt like I had a mentor by my side leading me through what had been a daunting process."},{"Title":"Book Report: Helping Aspiring Authors Help Themselves","review":"Book Report is a very useful guide that I turned to again and again while crafting my book proposal.

The ten points to help write a manuscript were also useful, however I already knew most of them. It's REAL strength was in outlining and detailing the process for writing, fine tuning and submitting a proposal, and tips on HOW to present it to agents. It isn't enough to write the next great American novel - if you can't get an agent to look at it on the strength of your outline and synopsis it's just going to gather dust on a shelf. That is the true worth of this book, it was more helpful to me in preparing and sending my proposal than any other publication or person before or since."},{"Title":"Book Report: Helping Aspiring Authors Help Themselves","review":"I've read most of the how-to books and magazines over the past 15 years, and this is the only one to inspire me to stop reading and start writing.The book lays out 10 basic rules for success, and helps new writers understand they are about to embark on an endeavor that's as much about the publishing business as it is creativity.Is it useful?
