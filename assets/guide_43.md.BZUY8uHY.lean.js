Regards Robbie White"},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Somehow I doubt that the generation of kids growing up today, whelped on Doom and Lara Croft, have the same romantic love of the French Foreign Legion that we did when we were kids. The concept of this fighting force made up of desperate men of all nations, given a new lease on life because they did not have to give their real name or background when they signed up, lent itself easily to fiction and to childhood fantasy. I don't remember all of the Foreign Legion movies we watched but Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950) and March or Die (1977) [bad movie, great tagline: &quot;In the French Foreign Legion, you march or you die!&quot;] spring to mind, and of course the greatest of them all was Beau Geste (1939). Directed by William Wellman and starring Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy and Susan Hayward, it was one of those movies you had to watch every time it was on. Happily, the original novel is nearly its equal.The three Geste brothers, orphaned early in life, are raised by an Aunt. Their raucous youths are filled with the literature of adventure and ritualized horseplay centered around these myths and legends. So when the family's prized Blue Water sapphire turns up missing, each of the young men confesses to being the thief in order to protect the others and one by one they head off to join the French Foreign Legion. As luck would have it, they meet up in the deserts of Africa where they fall under the command of the malevolent Sergeant Lejaune. Not content to merely be a martinet, Lejaune sets his sights on stealing the jewel, which rumor holds to be in their possession. Meanwhile, the unruly troops he commands are planning a mutiny and the marauding Tauregs pin this badly outnumbered and bitterly divided unit of Legionnaires at Fort Zinderneuf. The ensuing drama plays itself out as the French forces battle overwhelming odds. Ultimately, only a handful of men survive to discover the truth behind the Blue Water's disappearance.It just doesn't get any better than that central story. Wren combines a classic mystery and a desert adventure. The Gestes are living embodiments of the tales on which they were weaned--generous, noble, brave and loyal. My only real complaint is with the framing device which surrounds the story. The novel opens with a major who lead the relief column sent to Zinderneuf describing what he found there and concludes with an overlong d&eacute;nouement getting the story back to England and the jewel mystery. But these are minor quibbles when set against the truly thrilling story at the heart of the novel. Read the book, but be sure to see the movie.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I first saw the 1966 (starring Telly Savalas as the evil Sergeant Major) remake of Beau Geste in my early teens. It was not the best version of the story, with only 2 brothers in the story, and no mention of the stolen jewel, but it was action packed and the uniforms were awesome to a young teenage boy. Since then I have seen the 1939 (far superior) movie version, read the boooks and then read anything else I could get my hands on about the Legion in the early 20th century.This book is the epitome of grand adventure stories, rivalled only by two others: The Prisoner of Zenda and Kind Solomon's Mines. It's a book that appeals to your imagination and sense of adventure when you are young, and then you never outgrow it. I won't rehash the story here, but I suggest you get a copy, turn off all your modern, grown-up cycnicism and enjoy escapist literature at its very best."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"The book was written so brilliantly.

I first read the book in secondary school and it had a powerful and enduring effect upon me. I was so thrilled by the lofty ideals and values of loyalty, devotion, honour and duty displayed by the three Geste brothers, following the disappearance of the Blue Water sapphire.When the Blue Water disappeared, each of the three Geste brothers confessed to having stolen it so as to protect the others. They then all proceeded to go and join the French Foreign Legion. The adventure then unfolds in its gory and moving detail. This is where the author demonstrates his genius in weaving a brilliant and moving adventure story that has withstood the test of time and has been enjoyed by several generationsI have read the book several times over the years but still get moved by this romantic and adventure story. I am always intrigued by the concept of the French Foreign Legion which was comprised of people of all nations where one did not need to reveal their true identity.I highly recommend this exceptional book to anyone who loves adventure stories and those yearning to understand the values of honour, dignity, devotion, love, loyalty and bravery of yesteryear which are a rarity in these days of individual rights with no responsibilities."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I read this book as a freshman in high school and I was absolutely floored by it. My brother and I talked about it incessantly, and I went on to read its sequels, Beau Sabreur, and Beau Ideal. I very seldom read any book twice, but on July 1, 1961, I read Beau Geste again--I was then 6 years out of law school--and I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed it the first time."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Seems like every few years I sit down and read this book again. There is enough adventure to keep me interested in each re-reading and each time I pick up more little clues in &quot;the mystery&quot; that I missed in the last reading.The first time I read it (some years ago) I thought the characters were a little too stereotyped--the americans for example, spoke with too many expressions like &quot;you shore said a mouthful Bo.&quot; The British, too, are always correct and formal.Yet the story is so delightful that, on subsequent readings, one notices that the americans, with all their cowboy talk, are the ones who can be trusted and have the know-how to save the day.The British, for all their coolness, stick to their honour and their duty.The book assumes some recognition of French, as it includes lots of expressions and phrases in French without translation.Some like &quot;Monsieur l'Adjutant&quot; one can figure out. Some like &quot;medaille militaire&quot; take a second's thought. There are several others, though, sprinkled throughout the book that one has to infer from the context or look up. A great many are fairly clear from the context and really did not detract from the story.I had to hunt the used book stores to find my own copy, but I thought it was worth it!"},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I remember getting this book for Christmas as a child and thinking, \\"oh great another boring book my parents want me to read to instill a habit of reading\\". For whatever reason though, that night I decided to read the first chapter. Needless to say, I didn't put it down till I finished it. I still recall the chills in my spine when Lawrence tells of Beaujolais arrival the the fort.The book is written so wittily and with humor that even the dullest of parts are fascinating.This book inspired me to do my 10th grade term paper on the FFL which I still would like to join someday. I recommend the two 'sequels' also, though they definitely lack the thrill of Geste. If you like the writing style though, pick them up (if you can find them. I searched for a long time)."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"You have joined the French Foreign Legion and you are stationed at the most desolate outpost in civilization: Fort Zinderneuf, in the Sahara desert. The days are unbearably hot and the nights offer only a dreary, slight relief. The work is back-breaking and tediously repetitive, and several of your comrades have gone insane. Your leader, Sergeant-Major Lejaune, is a vicious, sadistic, disciplinary maniac. The men--dregs of society culled from every dark corner in Europe--have decided to mutiny, and they are planning it the following day. Lejaune, however, learns of this, and decides to move first. And if things couldn't get any worse, both parties have come to believe--rightly or wrongly--that your brother, stationed with you in the fort, is carrying an extraordinarily expensive jewel. They have made plans to see that during the confusion he takes a bullet to his brain, so that this jewel can be stolen.The sergeant strikes first, the sleepy men are disarmed, and he begins to move them out to the parade ground. At this point, the Arabs attack. A horde of them. Bloodthirsty, fanatical; they swarm down the sand dunes and begin to climb up the walls.How our hero gets himself into this mess, and how he extricates himself from it, is the subject of this very enjoyable adventure novel. The copy I just read, which I found in the library, was printed in 1926. It is still in print today. What else do you need to know?"},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"If you have a young man in your house who's not keen on reading, get him this book. That said, it's not a juvenile book. With one of the all-time great opening chapters, it draws you into a thrilling story of adventure and, above all, honor.A French force speeding to relieve an embattled fortress finds its occupants all dead at their posts and fort's the commanding officer murdered, yet somehow the outpost remains unconquered. From this beginning, PC Wren weaves the story of how these strange events transpired, and their connection to the theft of a priceless Indian Sapphire. At the center of the tale are the Geste brothers, three heroes from another time--brave, tough, intelligent, funny, bound by duty and honor--and they are still worthy of our admiration. There is no glorification of violence here, nor any adolescent fantasies about indestructibility. The Geste brothers understand danger, yet they also understand the virtue and occasional necessity of maintaining a stiff upper lip (or even laughing) in the face of death. They are utterly devoted to each other and to upholding their gentlemanly honor--indeed, honor is at the center of the story. PC Wren writes with great verve, humor and humanity (excepting a few then-acceptable racial stereotypes). I was genuinely sorry to see it end.A note on the Kindle Edition: I read the Thomas C. Breuer version, which as far as I can tell is the only version currently available for the Kindle. The formatting is excellent, with an active table of contents. Books like this--out of print in hard copy or unavailable in affordable editions--make the Kindle worthwhile. For $3.99 you'll be hard-pressed to find a good hard copy."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Beau Geste must rank very high with other all time great adventure novels. It has everything! Roamance, adventure,French foreign legionares, sadistic Sargeants, cut throat mutineers, arabs, escape on camels in Sahara, incedible frienships, brotherly love, sacrifices, and above all the Blue Water, the actual leitmotif. Blue water,a very rare saphire, belonged to Aunt Patricia,and is stolen from her mansion and the obvious culprit is one of the eight prersent when the lights went out and the jewel disappears. Among eight are the Geste brothers, Mike (Beau), Digby and the narrator, John. It is fascinating how Wren puts the jigsaw puzzle together, when two seperate versions of the same tale merge in the end. All good guys areEnglish/Americans, bad guys Italians, French or Germans.

It's a great, swash-buckling story with good characterization and witty dialog. It reminded me of Dumas's The Three Muskateers."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"P.C. Wren's novel, Beau Geste, is an exciting adventure tale about life in the French Foreign Legion. While the description of this life is often brutal and the men depicted are less than heroic, it does give a detailed and vivid picture of such life in this storied and misunderstood military group. A better title, however, might be \\"The Three Musketeers in the Heart of Darkness as the story centers around three heroic brothers who join the French Foreign Legion and have to deal not only with the hardships of such a life but also with an evil commander.The book begins with two men meeting after one of them has been through a strange experience. Major Henri de Beaujolais has just returned from heading a relief column to the French outpost at Zinderneuf in Sudan and he recounts his experiences to Mr. George Lawrence, a British civil service officer. When de Beaujolais arrived at the fort he found all the men to be dead, but propped up at their posts. Upon entering the fort he found the commander was also dead, but killed by a French sword through his heart and with a dead soldier beside him. In the commander's hand was a letter signed by Michael (Beau) Geste confessing that he had stolen the famous sapphire, Blue Water. Then before the dead can be properly buried it bursts into flames and is destroyed. De Beaujolais says that the whole affair is a mystery to him.The second section of the book tells the story from the beginning. A group of children grow up on the estate of the the well-to-do Sir Brandon under the benevolence of their Aunt Patricia (Lady Brandon. Michael, the oldest, is called Beau. The others include his twin brother Digby, their brother John, a year younger, cousin Augustus, and two girls Claudia and Isobel. Beau is the leader of the group and is admired by all--children and adults alike. The children grow into young adults in this warm and pleasant atmosphere. Then one night they ask their aunt if they can see the fabled sapphire \\"Blue Water,\\" worth some 30,000 pounds. But while they are admiring the gem the lights go out and when they come back on again the jewel is gone! No one will admit to taking it and finally Beau and then Digby and finally John go away to draw suspicion on themselves (and away from the others).All three young men show up in the same unit in the French Foreign Legion and endure basic training together. They make friends--and enemie--and the rumor spreads that they are jewel theives and are carrying a valuable diamond on their person. The story degenerates, in my view because the commander of the fort is depicted as a supremely evil person and a plot develops to kill him.Thus the story evloves from being about the grand adventures of the French Foreign Legion to one of intrigue and traitorous acts. But then the fort is besiged by a horde of Arabs and a bloody to the death fight ensues.Despite its flaws the book is great escapist literature and does provide some insights into life in this well known but little understood military group."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"This is an adventure story in the truest sense. The exotic regions of Africa occupied by France are brought in straightaway, though the first part of the tale doesn't seem as engaging as the rest. Slowly, a mystery is described involving a bizarre scene at a fort. The story flashes back to England where the cast of characters is introduced. A jewel theft is seen to be the catalyst for the move to Africa. Some portions at Brandon Abbas drag on slightly, but the Gestes eventually find themselves in the Foreign Legion. The culture of this group, as well as that of Africa, is fascinating. They seem to eat soup for every meal. Breakfast and dinner are distinguished with coffee at one and un demi-litre du vin at the other. More interesting fellows come into the story. There are two Americans who seem to have a drawl. Their manner of speaking is a little difficult to follow and almost comical, but I suppose it's forgivable. When the gentlemen find themselves on their first assignment, things begin to move faster. Treachery and loyalty become issues and then an assault gets everyone's attention. There are some tragedies, but the pace is enough to keep the reader moving along, anxious to see what transpires. The last part of the book covers several years. It is sad that not more is written of this period of wandering through the desert interacting with the different tribes. Much of the culture of desert dwellers is explored and is very enjoyable to read. One tribe has a community in a nearly impregnable fortress. Their only worry is when they are forced to travel into the desert to meet and trade with other tribes. Sacrifice and strength play large roles. The ending was fine, though I feel that Beau Ideal had a better twist. The mix of languages is appealing and the writing style flows fairly well. This is a great story with all the necessary ingredients."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Length:: 1:23 MinsI did a video review for this particular copy of Beau Geste (sold by Amazon itself I think) because I wanted to show how weird and unprofessional the font looked. Like someone who didn't have word processor skills tried to format the book and then printed it in their basement. I loved this book when I first read it and was excited to find a copy. I said I was going to keep it in the review just to have the story but I think I would almost rather not have it. Very disappointing. Sorry for the abrupt ending in the video."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I had seen many of the movies as a kid, so I thought I should get the rest of the story by reading the book. Well, I was delightfully surprised by the book. The book was much more mysterious and intriguing then the movies.I liked the way the plot developed but the brothers seemed to age a lot more or maybe just matured more as the book went on. When you first meet them in Beau Geste and his band everyone comes across as if they were teenagers but within a couple of days after the disapearance of the blue water when the brothers join the legion you find out that they are all in their early 20s. The time in the legion seems longer too like almost 4 years but at the end of the story it's about half as long as that.The one thing about the version of the book I was reading which was the one with the pictures from the 1926 film was that there were no maps. So what I did was as I followed the brothers I would go on mapquest and print a map of the area and trace their route. Then I would fold it and keep it at that point in the book. I like the fact that they kept many of the terms in the native tongue. I have word and there are these downloads free from Microsoft that you can download so that you can translate in to many different languages. Between making the maps and figuring out the translations it made the book much more adventurous for me.I did not know much about the history of Algeria and I did not realize that the French had fought with the Arabs in Northern Africa for many generations. The Arabs are pretty stereotyped but there is the fact that the brothers learn Arabic to keep their minds sharp and this helps them down the road. I did not realize that Arabic languages were spoken all along North Africa and that it is mostly dessert. I thought that was more of the Middle East.You will notice that all the bad guys seem to be of the same nationality either being French like Legume or Italian like Bondini as opposed to the good guys being the English and the Americans. I like the fact that the American's were Texas Rangers because I think that is how the rest of the world perceives us. Buddy and Duke might have been caricatures but they were always honest and true just like the English characters of John, Digby and Michael were proper and honorable.The best part of the book was after the Fort at Zindernuf because you really don't see that part in the movies and you see how John, Digby, Buddy and Duke try to help each other to get to the English city of Kano in Nigeria. I really wanted to know what happened to one of the Americans but I won't give that away.At the end of the book I thought that I had everything figured out and I would know what Michael's letter was going to say but I was pretty surprise and it made me enjoy the overall theme of the novel.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure novels about far away places."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Since first reading Beau Geste 20 years ago it has remained simultaneously the single most memorable and disappointing novel I have read. The plot is stunningly unforgettable, but the storytelling is clumsy and some characters, like the Americans, are so cliched they almost made me laugh."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"The story is ridiculous, but fun to read. The quality of Wren's writing varies, though. It starts out superbly and remains good through most of the book. However, there is a slightly drawn-out denouement which looked to me as though Wren had become tired of the book but didn't quite know when to stop writing. As a result, the last 50 or so pages are not told nearly as well as the main body of the book, which left me slightly disappointed at the end."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"In the 19th century adventure writers used to imbue their tales with the morality of the time. Made simple, people will come across good and evil in their lives, it's how you face it that defines who you are. Honor is an admirable quality, acting dishonorably is, well, dishonorable.... And it is worth struggling through adversity for a good cause. Acting with courage and strength, can yield great reward. GA Henty, H. Rider Haggard, P. C. Wren, C. S. Forester, Anthony Hope and Baroness Orczy crafted their careers on these very foundations with, thankfully, a lot of page turning action.About 25 years ago, I tore through BEAU GESTE, BEAU SABREUR, and BEAU IDEAL one after the other and had a great time reading them. Having recently become reacquainted with \`the swashbuckler' as an entertaining read, I thought I'd pick up a copy of Beau Geste and see if the excitement still held. I wasn't disappointed. What's not to like, really. Three noble English brothers battle a sadistic sergeant, fight violent desert tribes in North Africa, and unravel the mystery of a stolen jewel. Great stuff! Sure the story telling technique and the world view may come across as a little old fashioned to many a modern reader, but all I can say is there were a couple of very late nights where I was literally unable to put this book down.

A bit slow in the beginning, Wren's writting rewards persistence as the characters begin to grow on the reader. The novel really starts to pick up somewhere after page 100 when John leaves the whodonnit atmosphere of Brandan Abbas and johns the Legion after his brothers. The reader will find a how-to manual here in how to join the Legion and what to expect with training. No doubt this is auto-biographical in nature from Wren's own expereinces with the Legion. He paints a somewhat mixed picture of the kinds of people one must serve with and it seems that one is devoted more to the Ideal of the Legion as opposed to its rather harsh reality. Those who have seen 1939 movie will find most of the books plot is sustained. There are a few minor differences. In the book the evil sarjeant is named Lajeaune as opposed to Markov in the movie. I suppose the latter name sounds more evil! There are a couple of other subtle changes like this. Also, at the end of the book the movie does not show the extent that John and Digby wandered for years in the desert with their two American friends in Arab mufti. In the battle scenes at the fort the book has the Arabs charging on foot as opposed to charging the walls on horseback as is shown in the movie. The book describes the fort's walls as lower which would explain some rationale for this, but the movie just makes it look rather foolish. The book gets better as you go along, so keep at it and you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Only superficially a book about the French Foreign Legion, this 80+ year old book still holds interest today.

The concept of this fighting force made up of desperate men of all nations, given a new lease on life because they did not have to give their real name or background when they signed up, lent itself easily to fiction and to childhood fantasy. I don't remember all of the Foreign Legion movies we watched but Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950) and March or Die (1977) [bad movie, great tagline: &quot;In the French Foreign Legion, you march or you die!&quot;] spring to mind, and of course the greatest of them all was Beau Geste (1939). Directed by William Wellman and starring Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy and Susan Hayward, it was one of those movies you had to watch every time it was on. Happily, the original novel is nearly its equal.The three Geste brothers, orphaned early in life, are raised by an Aunt.

So when the family's prized Blue Water sapphire turns up missing, each of the young men confesses to being the thief in order to protect the others and one by one they head off to join the French Foreign Legion.

The ensuing drama plays itself out as the French forces battle overwhelming odds. Ultimately, only a handful of men survive to discover the truth behind the Blue Water's disappearance.It just doesn't get any better than that central story. Wren combines a classic mystery and a desert adventure. The Gestes are living embodiments of the tales on which they were weaned--generous, noble, brave and loyal. My only real complaint is with the framing device which surrounds the story. The novel opens with a major who lead the relief column sent to Zinderneuf describing what he found there and concludes with an overlong d&eacute;nouement getting the story back to England and the jewel mystery.

Some of the social attitudes of the character might seem old-fashioned to modern readers, but the tale told is still a great one.After you read the book, check out the film versions of 1926 and 1939 (the latter with Gary Cooper)."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I enjoyed every minute of this book! I started to get into Foreign Legion stuff a couple of months back and I wondered if there was a story about the Legion or something like it. I found Beau Geste and completely loved it all the way thru. Most books put me to sleep, but Beau Geste I could not put down."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I'm sure the story is good; most of the reviewers have endorsed it enthusiastically. I'll never know, however, at least as long as I own this particular printing of the book, because the font is unbelievably small. Arial 7 is a close approximation."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"You see a lot of literature these days about romantic love...Over the years not very much has been written about fraternal love -- the love of brothers!This is an outstanding story of adventure, honor and nobility.The theft of a family jewel has been committed and only 6 people could have done it!Three brothers, two young ladies and a cousin known as \\"Ghastly Gussie!\\"Ghastly Gussie is proven to be innocent. So who is guilty?All three brothers flee in an attempt to take the blame for a crime which he did not commit and they all end up joining the French Foreign Legion.Forget the three or four feeble attempts that were made to turn this into a movie -- READ THE BOOK!While Beau Geste is a classic in and of itself, one does not get the whole picture until they read the other two books in the trilogy:Beau SabreurandBeau IdealI am still reading and re-reading my copies which were published in the 1920s."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Beau Geste is such a delightful foray into the dramatic world of the French Foreign Legion without actually having to enlist! But the high adventure of the Sahara nearly plays third banana to the two big mysteries of the novel: who stole Aunt Patricia's priceless Indian sapphire, and how Fort Zinderneuf became transformed into a haunting Legionnaire sepulchre.Thus the joy of Beau Geste is not merely in accompanying the three English brothers from the parlor rooms of Brandon Abbas to the barracks rooms of Sidi-bel-Abbes and beyond, but in watching the solution to both mysteries unfold. The story is superb. The characters are immensely realistic.The brothers have a way of speaking very lightly and cavalierly about serious matters such as the theft of the Blue Water and the threat of mutiny at Fort Zinderneuf. Some readers may find the brotherly levity to be charming; however, I found this particular aspect of the novel to be excessive and a little irritating.As for the structure of the novel with Major Henri de Beaujolais telling the first part and John Geste telling the larger second part, it works quite well. Jolly and Geste have such distinctive narrative voices to the point where one wonders what Percival Christopher Wren himself truly \\"sounds\\" like. The change in narration is not jarring, and it in fact adds a great deal to the mystery. The pieces are put together quite masterfully toward the end.For a fictionalized account of historical European combat, Cornwell's Sharpe series is indisputably superior. To John Geste, enlistment is much more of a romantic lark prompted by the impulses of youth than an inclination to fight and master infantry tactics.Some readers may find the colonial attitudes of the European characters to be a bit outdated, but there are actually a lot of truths to be found. Wren observes that, in the desert, the Arab finds sand and sun. The white man finds sand, sun, and, if he stays too long, madness. The modern day Western involvement in the Middle East is maddening enough to prove that true."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I read BEAU GESTE as a young lad wet behind the ears. The only part of the story that stayed with me through all the subsequent years was the Fort Zinderneuf under-siege sequence, which is a marvelous tale in its own right. So I had forgotten what a fun and entertaining read P.C. Wren's novel is--a tale of the three Brothers Geste (Beau, Digby, John) and a missing sapphire (the \\"Blue Water\\"), set in the Sahara desert at remote Fort Zinderneuf, manned by the French Foreign Legion and under the command of the evil and cunning Adjutant, Lejaune. This is such a riveting read, not only for the story, but it's a time capsule of the 1920s, when it was first published. Accordingly it very much has its own vocabulary, borrowing extensively from French, and three young upper class Brits in those days exchanged dialogue in a jolly delightful way.Courage. Devotion. Mystery. Intrigue. Heartbreak. Action. BEAU GESTE contains all of these elements, and the story is weaved seamlessly from (primarily) John's point of view. But do be prepared: Again, because this was written in a different age, many of the words, jargon, and slogans are jarring, and very politically incorrect. One star off due to this absolutely revolting Munsey's edtion. The type setting is an eyesore and the margins literally go right into the binding. Very tricky to read. If you get the chance to obtain a different edition I very much recommend doing so; otherwise get ready for one grand adventure.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning"},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"Beau Geste is a thrilling adventure tale about the French Foreign Legion, which puts the reader in the middle of the desert, feeling the heat, wind and discomfiture. The author writes with authority about the conditions the legionnaires endured, including one long row of mattresses, not individual beds.Also, the book is a mystery, tantalizing the reader about what happened and why at Fort Zinderneuf. Additionally, the reader sees how the upper class English lived at that time.The book is a mirror into another time, a journey worth taking. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"If I had to come up with the two all time best adventure stories it would be Treasure Island and Beau Geste. I have read Beau Geste many times since I first read it in my childhood. What a magnificent mystery story involving the most exotic fighting force in history. Of course, after first reading it in my teens I immediately wanted to join the Legion. I got my wish, in a way, serving in a combat unit in the Israeli army in the early 50's. Although we didn't have to defend an isolated fort with dead soldiers, our life was similar to those of the Legioners 40 years earlier in the Sahara. Some say that wren, the author, was never a Legioner as he claimed. One detail, not mentioned, is this. When describing planning to escape to the desert, he never mentions water. This is ridiculous. You need to drink huge amounts of water in the desert. At one point he mentions one of the brothers, being exhausted, longing for a cup of coffee. But, who cares. Beau Geste is the fullfilment of every boy's dreams."},{"Title":"Beau Geste","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in military history, the French Foreign Legion, and adventure.

The roster appears to come directly from the National Archives compiled service records. Only 39 pages are dedicated to telling the history of the regiment.

I was looking for something at a bookstore to take on a trip with me, it was sitting there, 7.99, and I said what the heck. It looked good, it looked readable. When I started reading it, I couldn't believe that I hadn't heard of Sidney Sheldon before. This story follows multiple characters, all of which are nuns who are forced out of their convent. This a globetrotting story from a master storyteller for whom we should all feel sorry that has passed away.This book is a romance novel of top order. It's a brilliant action adventure that enraptures you in the story and even though you tell yourself that you're only going to read one more chapter, you're saying that ten chapters after the last time you've said it. It keeps you away, it keeps you at the edge of your seat, it keeps you entertained, laughing, crying, swooning, and more. This book is brilliant. It is top of the line fiction from a top of the line suspense storyteller.I heard it was turned into a TV mini-series at one point, God how I wish I could find it.I warn you, if you read this book, be prepared to want to read every other book that Sideny Sheldon had ever written, it's going to set you back some, but, it'll be worth it, trust me."},{"Title":"Sands of Time","review":"This author & this book are just too good. He's right up there with James A Michener as one of my all time favourite authors. Coming from Brisbane I've always hated Sydney but boy do I love Sidney LOL. This book has it all; action, romance, pacing & it's even informative."},{"Title":"Sands of Time","review":"The story is set on the backdrop of the Basque revolutionaries and four nuns who escape from a convent under attack. At first I didn't think I would be able to keep all the information in order as there were many variations of Spanish names and settings, however, it didn't take long to get completely absorbed in the story as Sheldon began to \\"spin the tale\\" based on true-life controversy. Sister Gracieala (introduced to the reality of a crude world through the many \\"uncles\\" brought home by her mother), Sister Lucia (Mafia princess), Sister Megan (forgotten orphan) and Sister Theresa (oldest of the four escaped nuns who had grown up in the shadow of a beautiful sister and although she had the voice of a song bird, she never could quite meet her family's high expectations). The Sisters are introduced to us and their stories are flashbacks in the book with each one defining the reasons for their commitment to the Cistercian convent in &Aacute;vila, Spain. As hero to the Basque people and an abomination to the Spanish government, Jamie Mir&oacute; meets up with the sisters when the convent is attacked by a ruthless Colonel Acoca and the Spanish army, out to teach a lesson to the people of the Catholic Church. Once Jamie and his men take the good Sisters under their wing, with his group of men and one woman, the story moves in many very interesting directions. So as not to give anything away, I will stop here and say \\"The Sands of Time\\" is another Sheldon work of art. In my opinion, not as good as \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" or \\"Master of the Game,\\" the book is definitely a very well written story with extremely unique, captivating and interesting characters."},{"Title":"Sands of Time","review":"It's unbelievable how Sidney Sheldon draws his characters, I could almost see them and hear them talking.

So that makes the year to be 1975 which is before the Berlin wall collapsed, and many other historic events mentioned in the book happened.

In the turbulent days of the seventies following Franco's death and the return to the throne of the Spanish royal house, bitter fighting still continued between the members of the Basque underground, ETA, and the Spanish army. Killings occurred on both sides with reprisals being swift and horrifying, especially the manner of execution by the Government...the garrotte, a brutal, slow and inhumane method of death. Under the command of Colonel Ramon Acoca, the Spanish army is searching for the leader of the resitance, Jaime Miro, and in his determination to capture Jaime, Acoca orders the search and desecration of a convent. Some nuns are killed, others raped and four of the nuns escape the slaughter under the protection of Jaime. The nuns are hoping to reach the sanctuary of another convent some distance away, with the exception of one of them, who is the daughter of an Italian Mafiosa, who has been hiding from the police in the convent, biding her time to escape to Switzerland. Romances flourish, traitors are exposed and lots happen on their trek through the hills of the Spanish countryside.

You suffer, laugh, run and have fun with the characters. It's the kind of book that Mr. Sheldon seem to have forgotten how to write. The adorable scenarios in Spain are only a little thing of the whole that the book shows.

It had everything, and his writing was so well done you would believe you were there. You can almost feel the emotion come off the page, with each turn. This is an astonishing book that did get the recognition it deserved."},{"Title":"Sands of Time","review":"Sidney Sheldon's potboiler dwells on a compelling subject matter: the turmoil of a nation embroiled in a bloody civil war. Set against the timeless and haunting landscape of Spain, Sheldon weaves intricate strands of Spanish history and politics into a tangled tapestry of adventure and romance. By depicting the enigmatic and rugged Spanish terrain with broad but deft strokes of colours, Spain comes across as a colourful juxtaposition of the past and present, a land of eternal passion and unceasing bloodshed. He is adept at capturing a historical ambience and the nuances of affinities between people thrown together by circumstances....The Sands of Time has a dramatic poignancy that demonstrates Sheldon's measured writing style, which through sheer imagination succeeds in creating a drama of political intrigue. There was no dearth of dramatic punctuation and the narrative was not bloated with extraneous dialogue; his dialogue is irrefragably excellent for the revelation of characters and his command of the idioms of ordinary speech permits him to achieve a fine naturalness.The Sands of Time deals with the tragedy of a land torn by strife, unfolded with an insight into the characters that people the vast Spanish landscape. It pricks and provokes...a people and their ideals, beliefs and freedom, and at the same time delves into the subtle territory of forbidden love. Much of the novel is a joy to read and it may linger in our minds long after other easily assimilated pulp of the same genre have passed beyond our memory. This is also Sheldon's last well-written novel; his more recent flaccid potboilers have somehow become a reviewer's nightmare."},{"Title":"Sands of Time","review":"This was a good reading experience.

It covers how computers work from gates to software. It does show it's age (magnetic drums, core, bubble memory?). Some topics are unusual (self reproducing cellular automata, distributed tessellated processing) but must have been seen as a future direction at the time it was written. It also covers some pretty ancient architecures, but that was one of the reasons I bought the book."},{"Title":"Computer architecture (Computer science series)","review":"This book is a quarter-century old, as of this writing, and the age shows. It dates from a time when, in discussing computer architecture, the authors felt it necessary to explain how a transistor works - a bipolar transistor, since this predates wide use of MOS. Then, with that knowledge in hand, the authors use Mead and Conway design rules to lay out small sample circuits. (BTW, I met Prof. Foster when I took an LSI course based onMead and Conway.) From there, the authors work their way up to descriptions of some of the common 24- and 48-bit processors of the day, bringing back my own memories of DEC's 36-bit machines. I don't mean to sound sarcastic - although marginally relevant to modern processors, this provides an interesting look back into computing history, as well as a bit of personal nostalgia.My real reason for hunting this book down is completely up to date, however. I need sample projects for my logic design class, things big enough to be meaningful but modest enough to assign to busy students. Foster's BLUE processor fits the bill beautifully. It has only sixteen instructions, three of which I can ignore. Foster sketches other hypothetical processors, too, but not in enough detail to code in an HDL.I can't recommend this book to any contemporary student of computer architecture - it's antiquated to the point of being obsolete. (My copy was discarded from a university library.) But, if you remember when magnetic bubbles and CCD serial memories were the next big things, it's an interesting walk down memory lane. And, as I said, old ideas often gain new life when technology changes enough. My students will see the BLUE processor, or something like it.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Manual of American English Pronunciation","review":"I go an used copy of this book in the year 1988 when I was an English teacher for TOEFL in Taipei. As I taught &quot;listening comprehension,&quot; which was the weakest area for Chinese students, I tried hard to finding as much relevant reference as possible. Unlike a lot of difficult/academic TESOL books, among the dozen reference books I got, Manual of American English Pronunciation proved to be the easiest to comprehend, most practical and most resourceful. This manual was organized in such a logical and easy-to-understand way that most English teachers and students alike would find it easy to absorb and put into daily use. As its title suggested, it should be used as a manual instead of a book.The best part that helped me most was &quot;Lesson 16, The Sandhi of Spoken English.&quot; In this chapter, the authors introduced the various forms of Sandhi-forms of English that were commonly seen, for example, reduction of unstressed function words, the disappearing of &quot;t&quot; and palatalization. I saw WOWs in most of my students' eyes when such knowledge was revealed to them. &quot;No wonder I simply couldn't understand spoken English, &quot; I guessed that was their feeling and I was glad to help them decode the mystery.I got on Amazon to see if there's an updated version I can buy.

I actually used the book as a self-study, and I found it tremendously helpful especially after the jargon-laden introductory books on phonetics baffled me to no ends. There is something very pleasing to the analytical mind: logical explanations, instead of reliance on learning through repetition, are given in places they are warranted.The authors decided not to adopt the full IPA transcription for the sounds, a choice which at times bothered me, as it is hard to switch between one system of transcription to another when using another book. Schwa (mid central rounded) and carat (open-mid back unrounded) are not distinguished, probably on a wise consideration that such distinctions are not phonemic and only unnecessarily complicating."},{"Title":"Manual of American English Pronunciation","review":"This book arrived in very good condition but I haven't been able to read it yet.

This study nourished my soul, my heart, and my intellect. It fostered understanding and a deeper relationship with Our Lord, while at the same time creating a sense of fellowship and community with the other ladies in the study.I recommend this book to individuals and parishes! Until the first time I began this Hearts Aflame Genesis study, I had participated primarily in interdenominational (mostly Protestant) Bible studies because so many of the Catholic Bible studies I had tried lacked substance and relied greatly on the \`What does this say to you?' approach. It is wonderful to find a substantive, and very Catholic Bible study. The blue-print to the purpose driven life,and the meaning of life is all there in Genesis. Ms. Somers, and Ms. Christmyer decode it in a way that is acessible, engaging and well-written.

Your encounter with the God of creation ushers in a reverential awe. You get a glimpse behind the veil of this God of Glory who is fathomless in his mercy and unconditional in His loveIn His creation of man we become acutely aware of the dignity of our personhood. That even though man was created from the dust of the earth we are God's work of art. This study propells in us the desire to be all the God has designed for us to be.Yes, we agonize over the fall of man but we are able through all that fog to see that God's Glory still prevails and the end result will be far better than the first.This Bible study is not only holy and hallowed, but entirely addictive!

This is another one, and a very entertaining one. The narrator is a law school dropout whose family is giving up hope that he will ever turn out to be more than a drummer in a C&amp;W band. The brother, in this case, is a deputy sheriff, whose own aspirations have been frustrated by circumstance and who deals with adversity and his own bottled-up rage by being fiercely self-reliant and intimidating -- not someone who should have easy access to firearms. From the moment he steps into the story, he is both a menacing and comic presence.Our hero blunders from one mischance to another, struggling to recover some self-esteem in a family where his litigator father smacks him across the face when the truth of his son's aborted law career becomes known. And his mother adds insult to injury with her undisguised scorn and disappointment. Only an older sister is able to provide some solace in this domestic storm. And there is welcome relief in the gigs he plays at local dance halls and bars with a hometown band, the Cloverleafs.Emmons gives us a wonderful comic vision into the &quot;angst&quot; of our young hero. I laughed out loud often at the unexpected turns of plot, the quirky turns of conversation between unlikely and off-center characters, the free-for-all fist fights that break out in bars, the cowboy machismo that spills unwelcomed from pickup trucks with gun racks. A particular pleasure is the insight into the psychology of playing sets of dance music for a beer-drinking bar crowd. The prose takes flight in these scenes.Although all does not end happily for everyone, the author pulls things together for our musician hero, providing him with a love interest, the beginnings of resolution with his parents, and a good lawyer to help him beat a felony rap. (You'll have to read the book.) I happily recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in music and musicians, domestic comic-drama, Montana (there are actually two Montanas in this book), and cowboy culture."},{"Title":"COWBOY ANGST-C","review":"Cited on its own cover as &quot;Reality Bites with a cowboy twist,&quot; that pretty much sums it up. In fact, it's probably a better read if you a) don't read that comment; or b)don't get the 'Reality Bites' reference. All the major events of the early 90s fad flick line up with the events of this short novel. Not that it's bad reading. It's well-written, though not strikingly so, and has that everyday-life feel that can catch the reader and keep you gliding through. Probably better reading if you can RELATE to the lead character, who's caught between what's expected of him in the real world, and his artistic leanings. A good thoughtful read for anyone in transition, or wishing they were. Some humor, though I didn't have the impression the lead character was as funny or smart as he seemed to think; that has to do with the writer RELATING to the character. I have half a mind some of the scenes (the slower ones?) are cut from Emmon's life."},{"Title":"COWBOY ANGST-C","review":"Being from Montana, Cowby Angst realy hit home.

If he was, he'd go out in a storm to get more wood for the fire and, while he was at it, run by the store and get another six-pack. Dennis is a young man in turmoil, too young to be having a mid-life crisis, but that's what it feels like all the same (without being pathetic, though - maybe he's just a forward-thinking sort of dude). Dennis is examining his values, his beliefs, his morals. Okay, his life. But in a deliberate and endearing way, one that draws you in and makes you feel like a confidante. Dennis may think he's stymied, bottomed out on a dead end road, but little by little he's putting his life in order. Just maybe not the order he had in mind."},{"Title":"COWBOY ANGST-C","review":"Forget the &quot;slacker&quot; and &quot;Gen-X&quot; labels, this book trascnends generations.

Those who like tales of the early discoveries in classical microbiology, told with excitement as in Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters, will find plenty to love in these albeit fictional chapters. While the story can really get you excited about science, it also shows that, no matter how well-intentioned and important one's work may be, there can be exorbitant costs associated with too much passion for it. Good lessons for anyone contemplating in a career in science, which can easily consume too much of one's life, in my opinion. Beyond this, I throroghly enjoyed the characters, humor and description of the places and times. This is a book that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Arrowsmith is a 1925 novel by Sinclair Lewis (with considerable contributions from Dr. Paul de Kruif); it won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize, but Lewis rejected the award because the thought it promoted pandering in writers. The book chronicles the life of Martin Arrowsmith, a young medical student who tries to make it both as a practicing doctor and as a research scientist.Arrowsmith is always readable but never particularly interesting. It is rather loosely plotted (although for Lewis it's rather tightly plotted). Martin Arrowsmith is a headstrong, bridge-burning, tantrum-throwing idealist, and Lewis generates most of the novel's tension and conflict by throwing the most obnoxious, contrary characters Lewis can think up at him, and letting nature take its course. Much has been made about Arrowsmith being a \\"heroic\\" character; this is obviously debatable based on how one defines \\"heroic\\". Lewis certainly makes him a hero of medical idealism; but at the same time Arrowsmith is never particularly sympathetic.The novel is one great commentary on the medical and scientific professions. In fact, any time Lewis shifts the narrative focus away from Arrowsmith to other characters (which seems to happen unnecessarily often), the reader gets nothing but commentary. How applicable are these comments today? Well, that's nearly impossible for anyone outside the medical field to say.Today, Arrowsmith is likely to have an extremely limited appeal: those interested in medicine should find it quite engaging, but few others will."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Sinclair Lewis's novels typically look at a facet of American life, circa 1920, via an &quot;biography&quot; of a fictional character. _Babbit_ examined the world of a boobish, hapless real-estate dealer. _Elmer Gantry_ showed us the lives of preachers and clergymen and charlatans._Arrowsmith_ is recognizably another entry in this series. It is partially set in the fictional midwestern state of Winnemac, and George Babbit makes a cameo appearance. This time around, we see the state of the medical profession, from the practice of a small-town doctor to high-end clinics and public health offices. But unlike George Babbit or the hilarious scoundrel Gantry, Martin Arrowsmith M.D. is someone with ideals. He's no saint; he occasionally neglects an understanding wife and &quot;blows&quot; many opportunities to advance his career by spending too much time in a lab, persuing basic research.But Martin eventually does succeed on his own terms, idealism intact, a rare victory for a Lewis character._Arrowsmith_ was definitely a slog compared to _Babbit_ or _Elmer Gantry_. There are plenty of satirical bits, but they are fewer and far between. Those interested in the nitty-gritty of medicine and scientific research before electronic gear, electron microscropes, and computers might forgive the relatively slow pace."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"As a current MD/PhD student, I was struck by how much the protagonist's experiences in medical education in the early 20th century mirrored mine in the beginning of the 21st century. In part, this underscores the large human component of medicine. Beneath the increasingly technological facade, the qualities of a good doctor and the struggles that medical education entails change little because human nature remains little changed throughout history. The book is well-written, if in sarcastic and satiric slang, that captures the inner conflicts of Dr. Arrowsmith. Although Lewis was known for satire, this book and at least its main character and his mentor Dr. Gottlieb are nuanced portrayals of archetypes. Lewis puts the characters in human circumstances such as when the reknowned scientist Gottlieb is rendered powerless next to a country doctor over the sickness of his wife because he has lost all his knowledge of clinical medicine. It is well-worth reading a fine piece of American literature and especially for anyone in medical school (especially when preparing for the Boards) who becomes too focused on their circumstance and what to add emotion and depth to the conviction that score of doctors before and after will trod the same path."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Arrowsmith is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and has an important place in American literature. A major twentieth century novel, it is essential for anyone interested in Lewis, and multiple differences from his other work make it worthwhile for others.The book has significant style and plot similarities to prior Lewis novels; for example, the small town/country doctor bit recalls Main Street, and the Zenith section recalls - and even briefly features the title character of - Babbitt. Lewis is known as a satirist, and those novels virtually epitomize the genre, but Arrowsmith is not satire. It has satirical elements and is sometimes humorous but is essentially a straight realist novel with a more or less straight-up hero. Thus, though Lewis' absolute realism mastery is as strong as ever, one might think Arrowsmith sounds pedestrian or dull. This is thankfully not so because the title hero was a new type - an exponent of scientific idealism. The novel initially seems to offer an interesting but inherently limited inside look at the early twentieth century medical profession and is indeed valuable here as far as it goes. We get a good idea of what things such as medical school, internships, country practice, public health, and urban practice were like. Medicine has of course changed much since Arrowsmith's 1925 publication, giving it notable historical value, but the depiction is still largely accurate, lending considerable insight into an important profession. Lewis' usual excellences are also on prominent display. We get a panoramic grand tour of post-World War I, pre-Great Depression America from mid-size and urban Midwestern towns to the rural West to Chicago, New York, and more. Anyone curious about the era will learn much about everything from speech to social etiquette to fashion. We even get a rare up-close glimpse of an exotic non-American setting; this section is noteworthy for its grim realism and tragedy, showing Lewis has more range than he usually gets credit for. Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.All told, this is a must for fans, but anyone curious about Lewis should know that this is not representative. Elmer Gantry, Main, and Babbitt are probably better introductions, and those who do not like Arrowsmith should try one of them. In the end, though, the novel is strong enough to stand on its own and is highly recommended for anyone interested in American literature.As for this edition, it has a fine Afterword by noted Lewis scholar Mark Schorer with background on Lewis, the novel, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; there is also a short bibliography. Several later editions are likely at least as good, but anyone who comes across this will get a quality version."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Lewis writes, in very basic prose, of a turn-of-the-century man and his love for science. We follow young Martin Arrowsmith through his schooling and then into the upper echelons of doctor's officies, hospitals and laboratories. He grapples with several women and gradually finds himself staring down the figurative barrel of an increasingly-ignorant and hypocritical society. Some things go well for Arrowsmith, some things don't, and it's all wrapped up with a climactic, surreal and satisfying conclusion. I'd say it's a Great American Novel if there ever was one, and certainly another testament to Lewis's mastery.And oddly enough, I found Arrowsmith's story to be every bit as compelling as the finest of the thriller and mystery genres. A cursory glance will more than likely yield skepticism, but give it a few pages and you'll more than likely be hooked. Despite its subject matter, the novel rarely demands familiarity with the world of science and medicine. Lewis's writing is simple, easy to follow along with, and never dry or rambling. Those who are tired of being force-fed Fitzgerald and Steinbeck and Salinger, but still want to sample some of the early 20th Century's greatest literature, should invest some time in Lewis's work. He's a criminally overlooked novelist who deserves a hell of a lot more attention than he gets these days."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Arrowsmith is the story of a young man who constantly tries to find himself and his place in the world.

When he takes a course in bacteriology he realizes the need for advancements in this science and his lifelong obsession for research is born.Needing a place to relax, he visits a city called Zenith and meets Madeline Fox who was working on her grad school courses and seemed to be searching for a husband. Eventually, they become engaged and she proceeds to attempt to change Martin's habits and mannerisms to the man she would like him to be.As he continues medical school, he's sent to Zenith Hospital where he meets a young nursing student, Leora Tozer. They become attracted to each other and have more in common than Martin and Madeline. They also become engaged and not knowing what to do, he introduces both women to each other and tells them he's engaged to both. Madeline's condescending attitude toward Leora and her comments about Leora's coming from a country place like North Dakota sways Martin to Leora.We follow Martin as he finished Medical school and moves to Leora's home town to set up family practice. It is interesting to see small town life in the western part of the country in the early nineteen hundreds. They have their own ideas about consuming alcohol, gambling, pharmacical drugs and medicine in general. Martin tries to fit in with the preconceived ideas of the farming community but eventually moves to the city where he will have more freedom.Martin tries a number of areas in his medical practice but his love is research and he takes a position in that area. During WWI, he joins the military and later is active doing research and helping with an epidemic of bubonic plague.The novel is well written but perhaps goes off the subject to moralize a bit too much. It does give a good description of the time and the medical profession."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"...hard by having read the book. Sinclair Lewis is a master craftsman of cumulative narratives. It becomes a matter of collating details and making a composite.The protagonist in this novel is a bit different from Lewis' other lead characters. Whereas Babbitt was always a sell out and phony, and while Carol Kennicott succumbs to a parochial mindset at the end of Main Street (whether or not she admits it), Martin's retirement to a cabin with friend Terry Wicket is an indicator of something rare and refreshing in a Lewis novel: A leading light who doesn't sacrifice integrity for reknown. There are any number of interesting minor characters to keep it interesting. Leora Tozer, Martin's first wife, is a poignant dim wit, and the story of Max Gottlieb's (Martin's college idol) hard-luck-to-sell-out story is a perfect and diverting trial for Martin, a man dedicated to pure research without sponsorship from some results-and-profit obsessed pharmaceutical company.This book is amazing, as are all Lewis novels I've encountered, in its intelligent depiction of unintelligent or, in some cases, misguided characters. It is something of a departure to find Lewis treating a character as an honorable, not a money-grubbing, human. This deserved its Pulitzer. And, considering Lewis' opprobrium for the greedy American mentality, it's not hard to see him refusing said prize."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Having never previously read any of Lewis' books, I enjoyed this story of Dr Arrowsmith's career and the tension between &quot;commercialism&quot; and &quot;research&quot; that plays out in his life. Although it reads easily, I still find myself (days after finishing the book) thinking about it, relating it to my own life. I think this classic story is relevant for any professional."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"This novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (for whatever reason) which the author refused to accept (maybe he agreed with some of the reviews). The author later won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930. The novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state, going to a fictional university, etc. I may get jumped on by some people for saying so, but personally I found the story dull and tedious (a good cure for insomnia). It does not compare with other prize winning novels which I have read that were written during the same era (Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth,\\" Booth Tarkington's \\"The Magnificent Ambersons,\\" etc.). I suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. If you have an interest in the author, I would suggest trying one of his other novels."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"It is incredible that Arrowsmith was published in 1925, the same year as The Great Gatsby, and yet won the the Pulitzer Prize (refused by Lewis for rather specious reasons, the only time, I believe, that a Pulitzer has been refused)over Gatsby. This is a testament to how times and tastes change. Today, Gatsby is acknowledged as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, fictional English novel of the 20th century while Arrowsmith is ignored and for good reason.I had been a fan of Lewis, having read Main Street, Babbitt and Elmer Gantry years ago. Those were good reads and effective period pieces of American life in the 1920's. Since then, though, I have read so much more of Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and so many other fine authors that, coming back to Lewis, makes it so disheartening by comparison. Sinclair Lewis seems now to me to be so pedestrian and overly obvious in his writing, at least in this book.Arrowsmith is too long and boring. My major problem, however, is with the character. Martin Arrowsmith is not a heroic character, as depicted by so many others, but rather a narrow, obsessed scientist who forgets all his human values along the way. I realize that Lewis was depicting the clash between science and idealism, corruption within the medical establishment, the rapidly evolving state of science at the time, etc. but if his aim was to express the heroic pursuit of science (at any cost?) through Martin Arrowsmith he couldn't have chosen a worse vehicle as a character. It is the cost in human terms that bothers me.Martin Arrowsmith commences as a naive, rustic bumpkin in medical school. Thereafter, he fails in his medical practice, fails as a public health officer and as a pathologist until he is finally brought to a research institute where he can be secluded in a laboratory. It appears that only in a lab, where he doesn't have to relate to humans, is where Arrowsmith can succeed and he does at the expense of everything else. What is the cost? Well, he has a near tryst with a underage girl along the way, in the end he completely ignores his long-suffering first wife (Leora)in his pursuit of experiment. Later, in essence he allows Leora to die on the Caribbean island where they are battling bubonic plague through neglect because he is under the charms of another woman (Joyce)whom he marries later. But the real kicker is that he actually consents to witholding vaccine to certain natives, at the risk of their lives, to validate scientific experimentation!Arrowsmith's slavish devotion to his German mentor, Gottlieb, is also sickening. Gottlieb's cold, impersonal devotion to science only would have made him a great Nazi doctor years later.In the end, Lewis seems to try to redeem his main character as he tries to get back to nature and follow pure research. But, at what cost? Only his abandonment of his second wife Joyce and their young son.If I thought that Lewis was trying to show scientific pursuit, among his other themes, in all its good and ugly aspects, with Arrowsmith at the exemplar, I would feel differently. It is his sympathetic treatment, in my opinion, of Arrowsmith the character and use as the vehicle to caricature and satirize the rest in the plot that bothers me. Arrowsmith, the unfeeling, irresponsible, inhuman and very unheroic automaton is not the proper vehicle for this purpose. At least in my book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Sinclair Lewis defines Martin Arrowsmith as \`a young man who was in no degree a hero, who regarded himself as a seeker of truth, yet who stumbled and slid back all his life and bogged in every obvious morass.' He is \`a snuffing beagle', who in his lifespan covered in this book never was in control of his destiny.This book touches all kind of important themes:- Commercialism and the religion of a scientist: \`Knowledge is the greatest thing in the medical world, but it's no good whatever if you can't sell it.'- Commercialism and profession: \`Explain to a patient, also his stricken and anxious family, the hard work and thought you are giving to his case, and so make him feel that the good you have done to him, is even greater than the fee you plan to charge.'- Public v. private health system: \`to get rid of avoidable diseases and produce a healthy population is killing commercialization, making money. Therefore doctors must become public health officers.'- Psycho-analysts as guess-scientists.- General human problems: \`the cruelty of nature kicking human beings by every gay device of moonlight and white limbs into heaving babies.- Influence of the Church on the irrationality of the masses. Its battle against free-thinking.- Personal problems: alcoholism, marriage.None of these themes is properly developed.The scientific basis of this book is very poor: fighting the plague with bacteriophages.Into the bargain, there is virtually no plot: the human relations with friends, colleagues, professors or women are more or less accidental. Also, after a far too long itinerary, the story ends abruptly.This book is a big disappointment and can only be recommended to Sinclair Lewis fans."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"I read this book as part of my participation in the high school extracurricular event Academic Decathlon. From this book, I was supposed to learn about the medical profession, the scientific research profession, the lives of scientists and doctors and how they fared in a rural, Midwestern America populated by bible-thumpers, illiterates, country hicks, and indigent farmers. What I got was the biography of a workaholic.Martin Arrowsmith, the protagonist of this book, is devoted to basic medical research, and is willing to sacrifice much in life to do it. These include money, fame, time with his loving wife, and time to himself to do things like exercise, go on a vacation, go out for a good meal, etc... In short, Mr. Arrowsmith is a workaholic, pure and simple. Just because his work is medical research instead of say selling cars does not excuse his undying love of work. In reading this book I saw the reflection of many people I know; single or divorced workaholics. Yes their jobs are important and yes they love their jobs, but they, like Arrowsmith, lack balance in their life. Overall, I found the book quite boring, and do not believe it should have won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"I have to say that i do love to read a variety of books, but Sinclair Lewis' novel Arrowsmith was absolutely horrible, and discouraged me from reading any other novels by Lewis. The novel was dull and boring. There was no excitement or suspense. There wasn't even a interesting plot. The novel also had an extreme amount of unnecessary characters,and it was too long which made the novel even more ridiculous. From most novels, you learn some values or something, but I didn't learn anything from Arrowsmith, except that sometimes a nap can be more interesting than reading a book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"The challenge to readers of Sinclair Lewis's 1925 masterpiece ARROWSMITH is that so much is known about the author that it is hard to focus on the novel.We have the Yale and University of Texas collections of the author's typescripts and notes, including Lewis's sketches of floor plans of the all important fictional McGurk Institute in New York. We know what first wife Gracie added, what massive collaborator Paul De Kruif contributed. We know how badly Sinclair Lewis wanted to prove to critics that he was not just a \\"knocker\\" of flawed characters and a negative satirst of an America full of Babbitts. We know how the researching, planning and writing of ARROWSMITH created and consolidated a method of doing fiction that Sinclair Lewis used over and over again. A method hammered out with Paul De Kruif.We think of parallels between the collaborators' nine week research jaunt by ship through the Caribbean and Graham Greene's turning his travels in Liberia and Mexico into books. We wonder why only in ARROWSMITH Sinclair Lewis created one heroic figure -- again, we notice, in collaboration with a Paul De Kruif whom Lewis taught to write and who taught Lewis about science and scientific role models.We think of the huge impact of Lewis and ARROWSMITH on the contemporary world, not just in the USA. No potboiler novel could have drawn John Ford to direct the 1931 movie ARROWSMITH. Ronald Coleman played Martin Arrowsmith, Helen Hayes was Leora Tozer and Myrna Loy played Arrowsmith's temptress during the plague on the sultry West Indian isle.In the novel Dr Martin Arrowsmith oscillates between medical careerism and self-sacrificial idealistic devotion to a cause: pure research. There is little room for women in his life, especially if they try to shape the hero up into being a competent tennis player and snappy dresser. In the end, Martin Arrowsmith can become Martin Arrowsmith only in a simply living, tiny male celibate community in the woods of Vermont. Shades of John Henry Newman at Littlemore!Try to read this book just for itself. Caveat: that is easier said than done.

I'm a big fan of satire and a satirical writer myself so I'm excited to dive into his whole collection."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"The Sinclair Lewis novel about the medical profession, Arrowsmith, was released on March 3, 1925 - but packs an impact today. The nickname of the title character, Sandy, is well-known by today's readers for the mayhem that it caused in the Northeastern seaboard of the United States just before Halloween, 2012. Most of the mayhem caused by Martin Arrowsmith is to himself.The title character objects to society's terms and standards of appropriateness, and constantly pushes the envelope. He proposed to two women at the same time, and then arranged a dinner for both women to meet each other. He defended a classmate, Clif Clawson, after he tossed a pancreas in the hat of a visiting dignitary to the college. He strayed from his wife by showing ardor toward the daughter of his boss. Yet, his personal faux pas were child's play to the career-limiting moves of his professional life.Sandy quit medical school in a move thought out as well as Michael Scott's resignation from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. When he established a small-town medical practice, Arrowsmith chewed out a local supplier of pharmaceuticals and was forced to purchase medical supplies from a less convenient location. As head of public medical institutions, Arrowsmith established dictates without considering their political ramifications - and then fought those ramifications even when it was inexpedient and sometimes, unnecessary.Martin Arrowsmith could have used a lesson from Benjamin Franklin, who worked hard but also publicized the fact that he did. Yet, Arrowsmith could never be like Franklin; in fact, Martin would have dismissed the Philadelphia statesman as a man of measured merriment.The character of Martin Arrowsmith is based, in part, on a French-Canadian microbiologist named Felix d'Herelle, and also, in part, on American microbiologist Paul de Kruif, who was not officially a co-author of the novel but contributed heavily to the ideas and characters involved. Yet Arrowsmith is more complex: he is a character who must choose his path in medicine. Martin is distracted from his calling as a scientist by being, at times, a physician, and a medical health official. He derisively refers to the 'men of measured merriment' yet also covets many of their trappings. Arrowsmith despises, at first, the scientist Terry Wickert, but also discovers that the scientist Wickert is the man that he wants to be.Max Gottlieb, who is somewhat of a mentor to Martin Arrowsmith, is based on two real-life characters from the medical world. One is the German-born American physiologist and biologist, Jacques Loeb, and another is Dr. Frederick G. Novy, synonymous with the Medical School at the University of Michigan. The McGurk Institute is modeled after the Rockefeller Institute, which is called The Rockefeller University today. These characters and places were influences to de Kruif, whose book, \`The Microbe Hunters,' is probably his most notable accomplishment. Unfortunately, Lewis and de Kruif had a falling out after Arrowsmith was published, with de Kruif believing he was a co-author of the book, while settling for a thank-you page and part of the novel's profits.No matter what your profession, Arrowsmith is a fine novel. His career-limiting moves are lessons to all professions, and his journey is something that all people have to consider in discovering their calling in life."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"This story rings true about someone living a life full of thought and desire to do good.

She didn't really have a personality, a character except being passive and almost non-existant.The book as a whole however, was a great experience.

Because this novel was written in 1925, it gives us a good view of what was then the current study and practice of medicine. It will seem dated because the development of the tools to fight infectious diseases (vaccines and antibiotics) was in its infancy, and the lack of these tools took a large toll on human life. Sinclair Lewis wrote an amazing book, both because of the compelling story and great use of language. Indeed, Sinclair won a Pulitzer Prize for this book, which he declined. Adding to the greatness of the story was the material provided by Paul de Kruif, a microbiologist who it is said contributed around a quarter of the story. This added a lot of then-contemporary medical science. I first came across de Kruif in The Microbe Hunters, another fabulous book (see my previous review of this). I strongly recommend Arrowsmith for anyone interested in the history of science or anyone who just wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"In ARROWSMITH, Sinclair Lewis tells the story of idealistic Martin Arrowsmith, born poor, who rises through hard work, a passionate dedication to \\"the truth\\", and two advantageous marriages to become one of the world's leading medical scientists. Writing in 1961, Lewis's main biographer Mark Schorer said that ARROWSMITH remained the most widely read of Lewis's novels, and that in its day of 1925 it was \\"another instant success.... (it) stilled those carping voices that had complained that in MAIN STREET and BABBITT Lewis... lacked 'spiritual gifts'.\\" Stung by these criticisms, and determined to write a \\"heroic\\" novel that would silence his critics and give him a shot at the big prizes (his calculations were spot on, as ARROWSMITH did win him a Pulitzer), Lewis concocted a thrilling plot which includes elopement, angry parents, tempting young women, professional intrigue, a bubonic plague epidemic, and an oddly modern finale in which adequately heroic Martin quits his post at a major research institute and retreats to a startup in the backwoods of Vermont.The sentimental seriousness with which Lewis chronicles Martin's career and marriage to one of the most unrealistically ideal wives in literature marks a sad departure from the sardonic wit with which Lewis observed George Babbitt go about his daily American life. When Babbitt meets his wife after an absence during which he's been trying hard to stray from the confines of marriage, \\"he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent.\\" How amusing and deadly that picture of Myrna's patient endurance of Babbitt's dreaded ardor compared to Martin's reaction when he's separated by the epidemic from his long-suffering and thus insufferable (to me, not Martin) wife Leora and tempted by lovely Joyce: \\"Did he really want Leora here, with Joyce... in the house? (Dear Leora, who was the source of life! Was she now... missing him, lying awake for him?) Suddenly he was out of bed, kneeling, praying to Leora.\\" Dear Leora, sticking to her usual policy of self-sacrifice for Martin's sake, conveniently dies, allowing Martin to marry the lovely and very rich Joyce with a clear conscience.ARROWSMITH marks not just a transition in Lewis's work from satire to heroic seriousness but is also the point at which Lewis turns away from seeing marriage from the female as well as the male point of view, and fixes his sympathies firmly with the men. Lewis is sympathetic enough towards Martin's first wife Leora, but how could he be otherwise, since she obliterates herself when her presence isn't required by Martin or the plot. She has the trick of napping \\"inoffensively\\" while Martin works, and remaining \\"unannoyingly silent.\\" But once Leora has been finally obliterated by bubonic plague, the silences of wives in Lewis's novels will invariably be annoying and their napping, offensive. This more limited patriarchal perspective, plus its deadly seriousness and mawkish sentimentality, are good enough reasons for ARROWSMITH to be almost completely forgotten today. Yet there are still reasons for reading it, chief among them the way Lewis, writing in 1925, manages to reveal so much about contemporary American life. Our obsession with the tricks and toys of science while we at the same time venerate a simpler more \\"natural\\" way of life. Our belief that intelligence and sporadic bursts of overwork will more than compensate for periods of drug-soaked dissolution and mediocrity (as they did in Lewis's own case). The tensions and power struggles in a marriage where the wife has money of her own. The vilification of socialism and organized labor by the comfortably middle-class. Reading even the most mediocre of Lewis's novels (which might be ARROWSMITH) lets us see how much of what we think of as modern about modern life has been part of American culture for at least four generations."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Sinclair Lewis is the bookend to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Both were born in Minnesota. Fitzgerald went to Princeton, Lewis to Yale. Both wrote their best books in the 1920s. Both drank, had women trouble, and turned bitter.But Fitzgerald is everyone's favorite author --- even the high school kids who are clueless about metaphors swoon over \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" You need an appreciation of satire to love Lewis; nobody does, and he goes unread.It's understandable. What would you rather read --- a romantic tale about a poor boy's rise and violent death on the glittering shores of Long Island (Gatsby) or a withering take on narrow-minded life in the midwest (Main Street)? Who's more interesting --- a criminal who went to Oxford (Jay Gatsby) or a blowhard whose ambition is total conformity to soul-deadening values (George Babbitt)?And yet. If you ask who describes America better, the more necessary writer is Sinclair Lewis. Main Street and Babbitt made his name, and most readers stop there. They shouldn't --- my wife, who once attended a one-room schoolhouse in Minnesota --- recently read \\"Main Street,\\" and found it a very close description of life in our chic Manhattan neighborhood. Dodsworth --- later made into a toweringly great movie --- is as fine a love story as Fitzgerald ever dreamed up, and a lot more realistic one, at that. It Can't Happen Here is a powerful political drama with a subject that's not as far-fetched as you might think: how fascism comes to America.And then there's Arrowsmith, which has an actual hero. Set in the midwest, it doesn't lack for satire; as Lewis depicts it, happiness in a small town seems to havbe the shelf life of about a year. And for a writer who won the Pulitzer Prize (and refused it), Lewis can write some dreadful dialogue. But the heroism thing --- that's compelling, and if you can move sprightly through the first half of the book, you'll find yourself getting excited and turning pages quickly for the right reason.The hero is Martin Arrowsmith. We meet him in 1897, in the midwest town of Elk Mills (\\"a dowdy red-brick village, smelling of apples\\"), where he is the 14-year-old helper of the local doctor. Martin is prone to hero worship --- he sees magic in the old man's love of puttering in a lab. That ignites a dream in Martin, and so, seven years later, he's in medical school. There he falls under the spell of bacteriology professor Max Gottlieb: \\"tall, lean, aloof\\" --- and a Jew.Gottlieb's love of science is pure; in an environment where many students and faculty think only of money, he alone seems to have ideals. Martin blossoms. But he's still a rube. He falls for a snooty graduate student in English and proposes marriage; later, he meets Leora, a nursing student, and proposes to her as well. His inept solution: to bring them together over lunch. Leora loves him more. They marry.Leora's family is important --- in their tiny town of Wheatsylvania, North Dakota. But don't call them cultured: They lived in a house \\"that has a large phonograph but no books.\\" Money talks, though. They bankroll Martin's first practice, and he settles into the life of a country doctor.The novel is about the impossibility of \\"settling\\" --- as Martin climbs the medical ladder, he can't ignore research, his first love. He has a knack for it, and, to his delight, he's invited to join Gottlieb at a prestigious New York research institute. And now the novel kicks into high gear --- the plague has broken out in the Caribbean, and the vaccine that Arrowsmith has been working on might just be the cure.Let me not spoil the thrill of these pages by revealing too much. Let's just say: success always comes at a price. And success doesn't always bring people what they most want. \\"Arrowsmith\\" is a book about the forces that fight to dominate us. As Lewis has it, that fight never ends.\\"Arrowsmith\\" is smart about the world of research, and drug companies, and the modest ambitions of many men and women in white coats. It is also about the love of knowledge and the desire to heal; it gets the blood pumping. My brother --- one of our best AIDS researchers --- tells me that \\"Arrowsmith\\" is the book that made him decide to study medicine. Long before page 450, I could see why."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Author Sinclair Lewis had some exposure to the medical profession early in his life through his father, who was a country doctor. Yet, even with some personal exposure, it's amazing how much of the idealism and cynicism, evident in modern physician practice, Lewis portrays in his 1926 pulitizer prize winning book, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;. Martin Arrowsmith, M.D. is a fictional idealist who is a human being before all else, but trying to bring science to the practice of Medicine. Actually, the story seems almost autobiographical due to the personal intensity and human fraility of the complex main character. As a registered nurse, reading Arrowsmith brings flashbacks of the past, like the cliches &quot;deja vu all over again&quot;, or worse, &quot;the more things change, the more they stay the same&quot;. Medicine for financial- profit, patient care challenges, personality conflicts, political shenanigans, professional competition, and overutilization of medical technology are some of the common problems Arrowsmith faces as he pursues a career in medicine after barely struggling through the politics of medical school in the mythical town of Wheatsylvania, Midwest, USA, in the early 20th century. This is not another novel about how physicians affect people's lives, but a masterpiece about the nuances of the medical profession as mysterious and suspect,of physicians who are heros and villans. Most surprising are the humerous vignettes sprinkled throughout the plot like bits and pieces of old Jack Benny radio show skits. When Martin Arrowsmith must decide if he is to fulfill his promise to marry Madeline Fox or betray her for his soul mate Leora Tozer, the genious writer Lewis creates such humor in the ensuing restaurant scene, that should be frought with melodrama, but, instead, is absolutely delightful reading. Similar humor engulfs the life portrayed of Arrowsmith's employer, Pickerbaugh, and his fleet of daughters named after flowers, like the saucy Orchid. Arrowsmith is simply a joy to read, especially for people who have a flair for some classic literature without getting too deep into concentrated philosophic thought. Simply put, Arrowsmith today, were he to practice in modern medicine, would probably be no better or worse off than he was in 1908 through circa 1920, when the novel takes place. Arrowsmith is a classic American novel and an entertaining story."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"This book won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. Lewis also won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is the story of Martin Arrowsmith, a medical researcher who, while attending a mid-western medical school, is influenced by an aged bacteriologist. Arrowsmith marries a nurse, who will encourage his career in research, and tries his hand at private practice. However, he fails in that endeavor. After a number of positions he joins a research institute in New York where he discovers a new microorganism but is &quot;scooped.&quot; He travels to the West Indies to try his &quot;bacteriophage&quot; on an epidemic. After his wife and colleague die, he starts administering the serum indiscriminately, destroying the results of his experiment. He returns to New York and marries a rich widow. However, social life interferes with his research and his search for truth. He quits the Institute and establishes a lab in Vermont with Terry Wickett, an uncouth but conscientious chemist. The model for Terry Wickett was Dr. John Howard Northrup (1891-1987), who will later win the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Apparently, the model for Martin Arrowsmith was provided by the microbiologist and writer Paul de Kruif, whose book &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; became very popular. The novel also contrasts the idealism of the research scientist, who unfortunately looses touch with those that care for him, and the apparent avarice of the medical profession."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"I'm giving Arrowsmith five stars because I read it many years ago and, like most of Sinclair Lewis's work, it is great.

I immediately clicked off Arrowsmith; I'll find the hard copy.

At the time I imagined that such was the nature of science in the early twentieth century; surely things had changed in the post-sputnik world of the Cold War America in which I lived. Once I went on to graduate school, however, I found a world very much like that portrayed by Sinclair Lewis! I continue to work as a scientist and researcher and continue to be amazed by the accuracy of this book! Happily, Arrowsmith provides a source of idealism as well as cynicism. Any young person who is considering a career in science or engineering research should read this book to prepare him or her for that which lies ahead."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Once again, Sinclair Lewis engulfed me. This is the fourth of his works that I have read (Elmer Gantry, Main Street and Babbit being the others) and although I didn't like Arrowsmith quite as much as those three, I still couldn't put it down.Unlike so many novelists, Lewis' endings are impossible to predict. They're not necessarily happy, or tragic, they're open-ended, which often mirrors real life. For Martin Arrowsmith, he ends up, in a sense, free and able to devote the rest of his life to research without any distractions. At the same time, he's lost his first wife and deserted his second and their son.Like the main characters of Lewis' other books, Elmer Gantry, Carol Kennicot and George Babbit, Martin Arrowsmith is not clearly a protagonist or an antagonist. The reader sympathizes with his frustrations, especially in dealing with his first wife's knee-jerk family. At the same time, I found myself rather angry with Martin's attitude now and then. Many of the other major characters: Max Gottleib (Arrowsmith's mentor), Almus Pickerbrauh, and Terry Wickett (Arrowsmith's friend and partner) evoke the same mixed reactions. Once again, I think this is an example of Lewis' realism, for in real life, there are few &quot;pure&quot; heroes; and even the noblest soul is tainted at times.Read this book to understand the personal frustrations and conflicts that infect everyone's soul; read it for a contrasted depiction of American life in small towns, mid-sized cities and large metropolis' in the earlier 20th century. But read it."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Read Arrowsmith early in life, and you'll want to become a doctor, marry a Leora, and read everything else Sinclair Lewis wrote. While not &quot;fashionable,&quot; Arrowsmith's search for truth and his relationship with Leora are far beyond any politically correct world view. The writing is incredible. When I first read it (a dozen or so times ago), I could not fathom how any writer could be so creative, so different, so perfect. Give it to your favorite teenager. You could change his or her life."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"A period piece of early twentieth century America, this book still remains a worthwhile read in spite of typed, flat, and cardboard caricatures of the players in the story. The sometimes didactic discussion of \`doing the right thing' is timeless and worth consideration by any generation of readers. The tension of what is right versus what is good in Arrowsmith's science and medical profession can be teased and tested beyond that parochial domain. Every reader's battle with that tension will find a thorough airing of important considerations for their own lives through Arrowsmith's saga."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Martin Arrowsmith is a man with a mission, a scientific truth-seeker, an idealist who perpetually returns to his pure research interests despite the material influences and social pressures of the world around him.Lewis's biographical novel portrays Arrowsmith, accompanied by his sympathetic wife, Leora, in a roundabout career from medical student to small-town doctor to public health administrator to bacteriology researcher. From boyhood to middle age, Arrowsmith walks a lonesome road, placing verifiable scientific knowledge and sincere craftsmanship above money, publicity, political power and social status (this is Lewis's affront to American \\"commercialism\\"). Ultimately, Arrowsmith is heroic in his remarkable perseverance and quest for truth, although some might label him a cold-hearted escapist for deserting his wealthy second wife, young child and promising New York City career in favor of a rustic laboratory and rugged backwoods existence on a fellow rebel researcher's Vermont farm.Modern readers will find Arrowsmith's devotion to his early 20th century \\"science as truth\\" dogma somewhat tiring, narrow and dated. Yet, in a broader sense, what is most important is that Arrowsmith consistently remains true to his core personal belief (which in his case just so happens to be scientific truth). His unwavering self-honesty is what makes Arrowsmith an eternally heroic figure.However powerful its message, the novel unfortunately reads like a patchwork of stages in our hero's career, somewhat artificially connected with the support of unconvincing reappearances of Arrowsmith's medical school classmates later in their careers (e.g., the sudden reappearance of the crazed, doctor-turned-missionary Reverend Ira Hinkley on Arrowsmith's trip to fight the plague in the West Indies, where incidentally Leora tragically dies). I conjecture that in reaching beyond the familiarity of his family's medical practice and venturing into the more rarified realm of scientific research, Lewis has stretched--as a chronicler commonly does but, I would say, a novelist should not--too far outside his own life experiences. The result is that this classic novel falls short of becoming a more emotionally engaging literary work with a truly believable flow of realistic life events."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"The central conflict of this novel--commercialism versus scientific idealism--reveals a different sort of author than we see in Babbitt and Elmer Gantry. In these earlier novels, Lewis neglects to offer a clear alternative to the unspiritual, conformist materialism of George Babbitt and Elmer Gantry.(O.K., Seneca Doane and Frank Shallard do represent an antidote of sorts. But Doane gets little attention in Babbitt and, considering his condition at the end of Elmer Gantry, Shallard's &quot;philosophy&quot; seems as futile as Gantry's.)In Arrowsmith, readers finally get a clear sense of one sort of life--and one sort of culture--that Lewis would prefer, namely, one dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge rather than material gain or intellectual homogeneity. In his pursuit of truth, Martin Arrowsmith faces many obstacles. He must overcome the accepted belief that one's duty in life is to make other people comfortable with themselves, no matter how shallow or simple-minded they might be. He must overcome the natural human desires for love, fame, money, respect, etc. Lewis's recognition of such conflicts makes Martin Arrowsmith's life more believable. But, at the same time, Arrowsmith's imperviousness to the usual effects of these conflicts--pessimism, greater self-awareness, less self-confidence, to name a few--seems suspiciously optimistic.I doubt many readers will recognize Leora Tozer as a legitimate female character, some critics to the contrary. No doubt she represents an ideal from the perspective of many men: she lives ONLY to care for and to please Martin Arrowsmith. But does anyone know such a woman?"},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Martin Arrowsmith is a semi-competent, ne'er-do-well whiner. I stopped rooting for him about a third of the way through the book. A \\"hero\\" can't shoot himself in the foot a dozen times and remain a hero. At least I've never seen anyone outside a Woody Allen movie pull it off.Martin isn't helped by Sinclair Lewis's habitual \\"telling,\\" rather than \\"showing,\\" and by his tin-ear for dialogue, which comes in two voices: Finishing School and School of Hard Knocks. Martin--one of the few college graduates in his medical school class--speaks in Hard-Knocks English, and a rather forced version at that. Compare the masterful dialogue of Twain's illiterate and semi-literate characters in Huck Finn, written forty years earlier. Compare also the clear, realistic dialogue of Lewis's contemporaries, Hemingway and Dos Passos.Finally, if the writing of Arrowsmith were a meal, Sinclair Lewis finished his dinner around the close of Chapter 35, when Martin returns from St. Hubert. After that, Lewis just played with his food.Arrowsmith is a much more ambitious work than The Great Gatsby, also published in 1925, or The Sun Also Rises, published a year later. But unlike Arrowsmith, these other novels still hold up well, as does Dos Passos's much-more-ambitious USA Trilogy. If Sinclair Lewis's star has fallen in the last fifty years, it's easy to see why, reading this book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"... the John Deere tractor of fiction, a paint-by-the-chapter-numbers novelist! Sinclair Lewis, America's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, did indeed write the same novel time after time. Babbitt the Man of Business, Gantry the Man of Religion, and Arrowsmith the Man of Science are identical triplets. Their life stories all begin as a child who feels exceptional in the drab materialist monotony of a provincial town, who thus foolishly overestimates his own abilities and his proximity to the center of Fate. They make their first escape toward a larger world, only to be hobbled by sexual vulnerability, by the \`natural enemy' of their ego-fulfillment, Woman. On they forge, nevertheless, through chapter after chapter of compromised achievements and mitigated failures, until it seems that the novel per se is merely a contraption for humbling the perennial American Young Man of Promise. No novelist has ever humilated his heroes as vindictively as Lewis, or portrayed every one of his characters with such grim contumely and condescension.But wait! Isn't that Young Man -- Gantry/Arrowsmith/Babbitt; Gantabbitsmith -- oddly familiar? Aren't all those vulgar small-minded philistines perfectly recognizable? Neighbors and kinfolk at some stage of your life? Isn't it lucky for my own self-esteem that Lewis never wrote a book called \\"Bruno\\", about the man of Music?Arrowsmith aspires to a kind of distinction, in science and medicine, that makes his struggles more estimable, and his eventual shortcomings more painful than those of Gantry, but the point of the novel is much the same: the mightiest tree can only grow in fertile soil, and the soil of American culture, as Lewis saw it in the 1920s, was sterile. One has to wonder whether Lewis's fervid denuciations of American pretensions weren't perhaps the qualities most admired in his writing by the judges of the Nobel committee.There are slashes of scalpel-sharp satire in Arrowsmith, though it's hardly a book that you'll roll on the floor laughing over. And it's remarkably pertinent, even after 80 years, to many of the debates over education today, especially at the university level. Every one of the little debacles that beset the life of Arrowsmith in the first decades of the 20th C is just as likely to beset the life of a bright, ambitious youth in America today. That's the weakness of Lewis as a novelist, that he is as episodic as a soap-opera, and almost as predictable. But his strength is that he relentlessly told Americans the truth about themselves, then and now.Unlike Gantry or Babbit, however, as Arrowsmith bumbles through his failures as a small town citizen-doctor and eventually reconnects with his 'counterpart', the immigrant Jewish bacteriologist Gottlieb, his fundamental integrity and decency always survives. Arrowsmith is not a tale of moral degeneration like Elmer Gantry. One can sincerely 'root' for Arrowsmith to come though with his 'self' intact. And then, the surprise: the last large episode of Arrowsmith is uncharacteristically gripping, a genuine adventure that I do not wish to spoil by disclosure, except to note that it takes place on a Caribbean island that sounds identical to Domenica, one of my own Blessed isles. But this is the part of the book that troubles me most; Lewis seems committed to a view of science and scientists as Promethean rebels, only true to themselves when they strive in uncompromising individualism to light some sacred fire. It's that 19th C \\"Hero\\", the exceptional man extolled by 'lofty thinkers' from Carlyle to Rand and beyond. The vision of science as a collaborative triumph of society and government - the vision I share - seems to have horrified Sinclair Lewis. The great scoffer at folly of American literature disappoints me here; he could measure the shallows but he couldn't sound the depths.Arrowsmith is a book that grows as you read it, but I wouldn't suggest this novel for a first approach to Sinclair Lewis. The iconoclastic Elmer Gantry, addressed to religious hypocrisy and opportunism, shoots its barbs of scorn at a bigger target, and tells an uglier truth. Arrowsmith is \\"a good read\\" but Elmer Gantry is salubrious bitter medicine.Did Sinclair Lewis deserve the vaunted Nobel Prize? Sentence by sentence, as a wordsmith, certainly not! But as a social commentator, as a portraitist of a culture with all its warts and pimples, certainly yes! And consider some of the other winners: Rudolf Eucken, Paul Heyse, Romain Rolland, Anatole France, Grazia Deledda, John Galsworthy, Pearl Buck, Frans Sillanp&auml;&auml;, Johannes Jensen, Mikhail Sholokov, Patrick White, William Golding, Claude Simon, Toni Morrison, Orhan Pamuk ...

The main themes of the book seem to be about the pursuit of money vs. the pursuit of science and about the character flaws of many research scientists and medical practitioners.What's good about the book is that the plot is pretty interesting. I kept wanting to know what would happen next and how it would all turn out. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't so great. I end up agreeing with another reviewer that after the part on St. Hubert's island (about 3/4 of the way through) the rest is pretty dull--at least in comparison.The main problem with the book is that the characters are one-dimensional, especially the female supporting characters. The main character, Martin, is too cold, heartless, and selfish to really get behind even though I don't think Lewis intended it. He marries two women during the course of the book. The first one, Leora, is a boring little dishrag. As for the second wife, I didn't see the point of introducing her so late in the book since she didn't really seem to motivate any purpose or action, other than Martin's continued heartlessness in leaving her and their son. However, since she was pretty much just a rich society type with no real personality or apparent goodness, I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy for her and the kid was like a non-entity so I didn't get too worked up about him either.

If, on the other hand, an author wanted to write a lasting novel of top quality, I believe that there is no other way than to develop one or several characters in as much depth as possible, to plumb their very souls (as they say in the classics !) Irving Stone-style fictionalized biographies are another way possible way to go-you can combine the two genres. What Sinclair Lewis created in ARROWSMITH is a piece of socialist realism that drags dreadfully, a book in which no character is open to us, a psychological void. The novel is more a sociology of the American medical profession in the first decades of the 20th century, a kind of uninspired expos&eacute; of medical colleges, country doctors, pharmaceutical firms, big city surgeons, and top-level research institutions---a social catalogue peopled with insipid characters that lack all the zany but convincing frenzy of Lewis' other books. We follow Martin Arrowsmith's career from small town to university to North Dakota hick town and on up. It's not an easy climb; it's not a Hollywood story, I'll grant you that. There is an exotic interlude on a plague-stricken West Indian island to liven up the far reaches of the novel, but nothing can really stir you much if you've hung on till then. The basic problem is, as I've already claimed, that the characters take second place to the process. Who can forget Babbitt or Elmer Gantry ? There are no such larger-than-life figures marching through ARROWSMITH. The protagonist's first wife is so thinly-drawn as to be almost invisible, like some cardboard cutout instead of a flesh and blood woman. She conveniently takes a back seat to her husband's career. The characters tend towards stereotype. A couple characters from other novels---George Babbitt and Chum Frick---have walk-on appearances, and there is a Prof. Schlemihl, (who, so satisfyingly, Lewis did not fail to mention, was quite a porker) but none of the main actors in ARROWSMITH will stick in your mind. Romantic interests are added from time to time, like salt to soup. I felt, as I read, that Lewis' real talent lay in caricature. When he wrote, tongue-in-cheek, about the \\"small town glories\\" of 1920s and \`30s America, and he let his imagination soar, he was unbeatable. When he reined himself in, trying to be \`serious' and \`natural', he lost touch with that special genius. Written in between four of his greatest novels---\\"Main Street\\" and \\"Babbitt\\" came before and \\"Elmer Gantry\\" and \\"Dodsworth\\" came after, I can only think that Lewis' imagination faltered when he wrote ARROWSMITH. It comes to an unsatisfying conclusion and is entirely forgettable."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"There's a lot of intelligent commentary in the reviews on this novel.

Lewis won the Pulitzer prize for it and later won a Nobel literature prize but he seems generally forgotten these days.Anyways I think this is his best book - a great insight into scientific research as well as a cracking story."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Arrowsmith is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and has an important place in American literature. A major twentieth century novel, it is essential for anyone interested in Lewis, and multiple differences from his other work make it worthwhile for others.The book has significant style and plot similarities to prior Lewis novels; for example, the small town/country doctor bit recalls Main Street, and the Zenith section recalls - and even briefly features the title character of - Babbitt. Lewis is known as a satirist, and those novels virtually epitomize the genre, but Arrowsmith is not satire. It has satirical elements and is sometimes humorous but is essentially a straight realist novel with a more or less straight-up hero. Thus, though Lewis' absolute realism mastery is as strong as ever, one might think Arrowsmith sounds pedestrian or dull. This is thankfully not so because the title hero was a new type - an exponent of scientific idealism. The novel initially seems to offer an interesting but inherently limited inside look at the early twentieth century medical profession and is indeed valuable here as far as it goes. We get a good idea of what things such as medical school, internships, country practice, public health, and urban practice were like. Medicine has of course changed much since Arrowsmith's 1925 publication, giving it notable historical value, but the depiction is still largely accurate, lending considerable insight into an important profession. Lewis' usual excellences are also on prominent display. We get a panoramic grand tour of post-World War I, pre-Great Depression America from mid-size and urban Midwestern towns to the rural West to Chicago, New York, and more. Anyone curious about the era will learn much about everything from speech to social etiquette to fashion. We even get a rare up-close glimpse of an exotic non-American setting; this section is noteworthy for its grim realism and tragedy, showing Lewis has more range than he usually gets credit for. Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.All told, this is a must for fans, but anyone curious about Lewis should know that this is not representative. Elmer Gantry, Main, and Babbitt are probably better introductions, and those who do not like Arrowsmith should try one of them. In the end, though, the novel is strong enough to stand on its own and is highly recommended for anyone interested in American literature."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Signet Classics)","review":"Intellectually driven people are as F.

But, after such people achieve such great goals, we learn they are more than just \\"different\\" but really extraordinary.Being a medical student, one would think Arrowsmith is extraordinary. But, we learn, his struggles in and out of school are quite reflective of an ordinary person with ordinary abilities. Being thrust out of towns in South Dakota and Iowa, he seems to be a wrong fit for even grossly normal society.But, catlike coincidences abound and he ends up stopping the plague in the West Indies, and has experiments successfully deliver answers to medical mysteries which no man had previously resolved. His unending intellectual appetite never subsides, and from his perseverance he can assert acclaim and even fortune.But, his quest is not for anything more than the hunger to kill for more intellectual achievement. Noble is the man who seeks to help other man. Not the man who seeks to pad his own pocket with pharmaceuticals or patents or other money-constituted ventures which many people did or would do in his position. Arrowsmith is a rare man in American capitalistic society.Even after marrying a multi-millionaire (after being a widower to a plain Jane girl from the Dakotas), he wants to be left out of society's primrose elite and seeks retreat to forested Vermont, with outhouses and laboratories which cannot be interrupted. He is the personification of the great man theory: a philosophical theory that aims to explain history by the impact of \`great men', or heroes: highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence and wisdom or Machiavellianism, used power in a way that had a decisive historical impact.It has been many years since reading a Sinclair Lewis novel - in fact this is the first time I did so voluntarily.BabbittandMain Streetwere required reading in junior or senior high.

In stark contrast to the repression of any such groups in communist or fascist nations.The book is useful in explaining a facet of US society that has perhaps been underappreciated. Many such groups contributed to and influenced foreign policies. There is also a fascinating look at the US labour movement, with its AFL and CIO .

At least theoretically.Working with this book was easy."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (Mcgraw-Hill's Core Books)","review":"This book was rather ponderous, with little attempt made to make it readable. That's not the worst of it, though; that's to be expected in a psych textbook. The worst of it is, there was an unforgivable amount of sloppy editing in this book; most of it was in the first half of the book, with only one or two errors slipping through after chapter 8, but that still leaves me thoroughly unimpressed, although the book IS less sloppy than the Adolescent Psych textbook by the same author.In general, the errors are of the typo or proofreading variety, not relevant to the subject matter, although the author does still have a tendency to confuse correlation with causation in spite of his clear disclaimers to the contrary.Some examples of the errors that I'm speaking of:1) At the end of chapter 2, on page 68, in the \\"reach your learning goals\\" section, under the \\"Developmental Issues\\" subheading, he speaks of the conflict between \\"nature and nature\\", rather than \\"nature and nurture\\".2) In chapter 3, on page 83, under the subheading \\"Children in divorced families\\", second paragraph, he speaks of \\"...a time when parents are often in conflict with other.\\" rather than \\"with EACH other\\".3) Still in chapter 3, on page 94, under the subheading of \\"Effective schools for young adolescents\\", he references a report by the Carnegie Foundation which he dates as being from 1989, and then later in the paragraph, goes on to say that \\"twenty five years later, experts are still finding...\\" Given that the copyright for this book is 2009, not 2014, that just doesn't add up.4) In the \\"Crack the Case\\" at the end of chapter 4 (page 145) question 6 asks us \\"What type of grouping is Mr. Adams most likely discussing?\\" That's awfully difficult to say, because NONE OF THE TEACHERS IN THE ANECDOTE WERE NAMED MR. ADAMS! (My suspicion is that in the first draft, there was a Mr. Adams, and in the final draft, that name was changed to add ethnic diversity to the group; perhaps \\"Mr. Adams\\" morphed into \\"Mr. Hassan\\". In any case, the change did not make it into the questions.5) In chapter 5, page 151, second paragraph from the bottom, he references \\"connectectness\\" when he clearly means \\"connectedness\\".6) Still in chapter 5, on page 155, in the \\"Through the Eyes of Teachers\\" interlude, we have the sentence \\"She visits students at home early in the school year in A EFFORT (emphasis mine) to connect with them...\\" Particularly ironic in an interlude dealing with attempts to improve literacy.7) Still in chapter 5, on page 160, under the heading \\"Bilingualism\\", we are told \\"The ability to speak two languages has a positive effect on children's cognitive development. Children fluent in two languages perform better than their single-language counterparts on tests of control of attention, concept formation, analytical reasoning, cognitive flexibility, and cognitive complexity.\\" Now, both of these statements MAY be correct, but the first does not necessarily follow from the second. If it is true that bilingual students perform better in all of these ways than single-language students, it MAY be because bilingualism \\"has a positive effect\\", but then again, it may simply be that students who are better at all of those things ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO learn a second language. Perhaps the cited study controls for that variable; Santrock says nothing to suggest this. This is a case of confusing correlation with causation, given the information in the text.8) In chapter 8, on page 271, second full paragraph, Santrock tells us that \\"...in one study, 10-year olds were approximately 1.8 times slower at processing information than young adults...\\" and later goes on to say that 12-year olds were \\"approximately 1.5 times slower...\\". The concept of (some number) of times slower is Mathematically meaningless. If we want to speak of someone taking twice as long to do something, we say that they are \\"half as fast\\". \\"Twice as slow\\" is not a valid concept. So we can say that they took 1.8 times as long to do something, but that does not make them \\"1.8 times slower\\". That's like saying that something is 180 percent cheaper, which would mean that they would pay you 80 percent of the original price to take it off their hands.9) In chapter 10, at the top of the page, we are told that \\"(Research concludes) that cooperation and postive interdependence needs to occur...\\" rather than \\"need to occur\\".Now, obviously, some of these errors are more important than others; still, the fact that there are so many indicates a sloppiness that I find troubling in a textbook. Most of the information here is worthwhile, but I can't rate something with so many careless errors higher than three stars."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (Mcgraw-Hill's Core Books)","review":"I was very satisfied with my purchase!

The C++ API part (the one I was interested in) is really short and the examples rather simple (you can read it all in few hours).The book is ok, but should be called \\"Very Basic Introduction to MEL and C++ API\\" and not \\"An extensive guide to MEL and C++ API\\" at all."},{"Title":"Complete Maya Programming","review":"I learned more from the first chapter of this book than from all of 'Maya Fundamentals' or 'Maya Character Animation'. If your a begginer planning on getting serious with Maya I'd recommend going through the 10 or so tutorials that come with Maya and THEN pick this book up (don't waste money on begginer's books). It elegantly expounds the real fundamentals of Maya - the fundamentals that you must know in order to really uderstand the program. Don't expect to be dazzled with the examples. This book will provide essential understanding of the most important principles of Maya - not tell you how to model or animate. After reading this small book you should be able to pick up any book that assumes technical knowledge and focuses on artistic methods of modeling, animation, texturing etc. to learn how to be a true Maya artist."},{"Title":"Complete Maya Programming","review":"Finally a decent documentation for Maya MEL/API programmers. Maya's own manuals are comparably lousy and the meager information available to newbies has to be verified and expanded during years of tedious trial and error programming. Most people simply follow in the footsteps of senior programmer colleagues who had to figure everything out for themselves and thus help propagate a culture of continuously reinforced bad code writing habits that do not make effective use of the full range of available tools. Especially the chapters on MEL and Expression writing are simple, clearly structured and easy to understand. The same can be said for the chapters on the Maya API, however, while the MEL and Expression sections do indeed warrant the use of the word Complete in the book's title the API section does not. I would have hoped for more information about some of the more exotic node types such as Shaders or Tool Contexts etc... This is where the Maya manuals fall short and where the book could have jumped in. However, with the book clarifying most fundamental aspects and structures of the API that missing information can be worked out by a skilled programmer. I'm glad I purchased this book and it will serve me well as a reference manual for both MEL and the API. Note to beginners: this book is not a fullblown tutorial but seems to be halfway between a tutorial and a reference manual. However, I've barely received my copy and I'm already considering it indispensible. My thanks to Mr. Gould!"},{"Title":"Complete Maya Programming","review":"Good book. The only book I know of that explains everything in a way that's easily understood, especially if you don't have any programming experience. This book isn't the only book you'd need to get proficient at programming, but it definately is the first one you should buy to get yourself started.Its a bit thick at points, so I recommend not sitting down to read a large chunk at once, cause it'll likely not stick with you that way. Take your time, and have your computer nearby so that you can type in his examples and see how they work. Kinda wish it came with a CD but he gives you a website to download his examples.In short, buy this book if MEL scripting intimidates you like it did me. It'll make the whole process less daunting, and you'll be scripting before you know it."},{"Title":"Complete Maya Programming","review":"If your just starting out with Maya, this book is essential reading. Chapter 2 (which describes how Maya actually works) is worth the price of the whole book. The only reason I think Maya is the best choice for an animation package is its scriptability and extensibility via MEL. If you paid hard earned money to buy Maya, you need MEL to get your moneys worth. This book has already paid for itself multiple times, and Im only half way through it."},{"Title":"Complete Maya Programming","review":"The documentation that comes with the Maya SDK is a great reference for individual parts of the API, but comes up short on covering the big picture of how and why everything fits together. This book fills that hole perfectly. Even though I've successfully written several Maya plugins by banging around with the examples and the API reference, in just a few hours with this book I gained a much deeper level of understanding about how Maya's internal framework is really constructed.If you're a professional programmer who's even thinking about working with Maya, buy and read this book before writing a single line of code. It will pay for itself in time saved."},{"Title":"Complete Maya Programming","review":"Hi..The content on Mel is very basic and does not relly cover much except the basic syntax.The API part is better and the explanation of the underlying architecture is awesome, somethin which is very essential when tryin the API.If you are looking only for Mel then Marks book seems slightly better. But if you want a complete Maya programming(Mel and API) book as the title suggests this is the one. But dont expect anything really advanced .This one is for the beginners and thank god finally there is a book that can get people started into the API. It does assume understanding of the c++ language but the programs are explained and literally spoonfed. David is a pioneer in the field of Maya development and he has so much wealth of information.

Le baron de Comeau, a fine memorialist who, being a royalist, was not a Ney's partisan, declares: \\"Ney &eacute;tait un des meilleurs g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de Napol&eacute;on, aussi bien en attaque qu'en d&eacute;fense; il enlevait bien les masses, il faisait bien les mouvements de flanc.... Son jugement prompt son execution vive le mettaient en relief. Un &eacute;tranger, qui aurait examin&eacute; la grande arm&eacute;e en mouvement sans connaitre l'Empereur, eut pu croire que Ney occupait le commandemment; seul, il parassait et agissait sans etre sous l'influence de Napol&eacute;on\\" Besides in this book Ney is made a scapegoat for many of the ills of the Waterloo campaign to allow Napoleon, as usual, to save face, while his blunders and final awful politics brought France to the disaster: in 1815 he was finished politically but did not want to admit it, so he risked too much in the fatal days at Waterloo. At St.Helena he blamed the dead Ney for the failure in Belgium, but everybody knows this is a base lie and open propaganda. Please, read Charras, Hamilton -Williams and Coppens on Waterloo! Bernard Coppens states: \\"L'image forg&eacute; par Napol&eacute;on d'un Ney qui aurait oubli&eacute; jusqu'au rudiments de son m&eacute;tier est bien efficace. Elle a envahi les imaginations et conditionne les lectures de la bataille en la faussant compl&eacute;tement\\".In conclusion, I find this book good for the pictures, but the text is nave and inaccurate. The author is one of the so-called \\"historiens vulgarisateurs\\" who unfortunately form the base of the knowledge of history, but are \\"loin de la verit&eacute; historique"},{"Title":"A Test of Faith","review":"Anne and Jared were elated with her pregnancy though both know of the danger to the diabetic woman. When she is about to give birth, something goes wrong and she is rushed into emergency surgery. Jared prayed to God and felt he was answered as his wife and their baby Faith survive the near death ordeal.Over the years, Anne and Jared raise Faith in a warm caring environs while also believing strongly in God. However, Faith begins to rebel as a teen feeling her mother's smothering her need for independence. Instead of God, Faith wants popularity and soon she and her mother are at odds as Anne feels bitterness that she risked her life to bring Faith into this world. However, as the years pass, Anne becomes weak and ill; Faith shows her love for her mom in many ways as she turns to God praying for a miracle while her mother insists that their reconciliation is the miracle.A TEST OF FAITH is a deep character study that focuses on the relationship between a mother and daughter and how both turn to and from God. The duo has somewhat lost the way when their relationship turned sour, but each learns that in God they can recover more than what they lost. Though Jared seems to be a minor player and the action is sparse, readers who reassure tales that take a strong look at believing in the Lord will appreciate this powerful family drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Test of Faith","review":"She's my favorite author!

The e-book does not contain any illustrations (the printed book has many). This book gives a lot of information about the early Christians, old churches, pagan temples and funeral sites.The author, Rololfo Lanciani (1845-1929), was an Italian archeologist and was a distinguished scholar. His most important work was the production of a topographical map of Ancient Rome. His book on pagan and Christian Rome is still readable; it is a book I can recommend for anyone who's interested in Roman, Italian or early-Christian history. It may also be good reading for anyone who is going to visit Rome, the book will give you some in-depth background information on some of the most important landmarks in the city.The contents of this book is:CHAPTER I: THE TRANSFORMATION OF ROME FROM A PAGAN INTO A CHRISTIANCITYCHAPTER II: PAGAN SHRINES AND TEMPLESCHAPTER III: CHRISTIAN CHURCHESCHAPTER IV: IMPERIAL TOMBSCHAPTER V: PAPAL TOMBSCHAPTER VI: PAGAN CEMETERIESCHAPTER VII: CHRISTIAN CEMETERIESLUDI SCULARES, INSCRIPTION EDITED BY MOMMSEN(There are footnotes at the end of each chapter.)As a sampler I will copy a few lines from the second chapter:[...]'Ancient guide-books of Rome, published in the middle of the fourthcentury, mention four hundred and twenty-four temples, threehundred and four shrines, eighty statues of gods, of precious metal,sixty-four of ivory, and three thousand seven hundred and eighty-fivemiscellaneous bronze statues.

They recover nicely after taking up their old interests.I can relate to the evils of the television as it often takes away my own time for hobbies. I thought it was great that the readers recovered more quickly than the other sailors.For a classroom extension, I would provide \\"mystery rocks\\" for students to write their own fantasy tale, explaining the secret, unknown powers of their rock over people.

This is what ends up happening to a captain in The Wretched Stone, written by Chris Van Allsburg. The story starts out with a smart crew that is on a boat and who are setting sail. When the crew hits land, they find a mystical stone. While watching the stone, the crew is fasinated with the stone a little too much. After watching the stone for some time, the crew turns into apes, and not at the oppertune time, because a storm is headed their way, forcing the smart captain into a tough situation.This is a very good fiction bood, especially with Chris Ban Allsbrug's excellent descriptions which almost match the pictures in the story. This is also a very imaginative book, especailly considering that it is a kid's book, which is always imaginative. I also thought this was just a good book. Of all of the Allsburg books I've read, this is the best.

The crew of the Rita Anne appears to be a well-functioning, competent and happy group of people until they encounter a strange island whose existence is as yet unrecorded. The captain and his crew explore the island and are baffled when they are unable to find any living creature or edible food despite the lush vegetation.They do however find a large, mysterious rock that they bring on board, not realizing the detrimental effect the rock will have on the crew. Will the captain and his crew suffer a horrible fate, or will they be saved? The mystery and fantastical element in this story makes for a riveting reading experience and will have older readers puzzling out the story.

This one serves as a great reminder and launching point for discussion, for children and adults alike, about the dangers of too much television.It's estimated that the average child watches about 4 hours of TV per day. That calculates out to 28 hours per week or 120 hours per month. Imagine what any one of us could accomplish in that amount of time! The sad truth is that for so many of us parents, the TV becomes a cheap and easy babysitter for our kids.The Wretched Stone is a great story with wonderful illustrations and a very important message."},{"Title":"The Wretched Stone","review":"Vivid artwork in an array of dramatic colors adds to the mystery and eerieness of this book. I take it that the &quot;wretched stone&quot; is a metaphor for television and its hypnotic effect. I am taking a course on children's literature and have been sampling picture books, and so far Van Allsburg wins the palm. The darkness of this tale may be disconcerting to some of the young set, but the last page with its bright red, white and yellow colors and its kicker wit dispels the gloom and sends us all to bed happier and the wiser."},{"Title":"The Wretched Stone","review":"Have you heard about the book The Wretched Stone?

I hope you will enjoy this book like I did.I thought that the colors were pale in the pictures. But, the theme is good. The theme is to not watch too much TV. The art work is like real people. I can tell that the author's words are very stiff. The story takes place mostly at sea in the boat.In The Wretched Stone it said, \\"Some play musical instruments and there are a few good strong storytellers among them.\\" Also, a good quote they said is, \\"I am playing the violin and reading to the crew.\\" I like the ending a lot. Also it is very funny that the crew turns into monkeys. The author's style is to make the kids see it in there minds.The crew and the captain are going through bad times. These entire things have a solution. The captain is the person who solves them. I enjoyed this book.I feel that the book is meant for higher grade levels. Mostly for forth and fifth graders.

Stone Barrington isn't the greatest character in crime fiction, but he certainly beats Will Lee."},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"Having an avowed addiction to the \\"bestseller wall\\" at the local audio book store, I haven't missed much of Stuart Woods' work. But I could have missed this one. I hate it when fiction writers begin to take themselves so seriously that they use their work to spout their own political and social beliefs, as if we the reader could care. It's o.k. to have some characters believing one way, and some another, that's just good characterization. But in this \\"Clintonesque Manifesto\\", all the bad guys are Republicans, or religious, or both, as if those traits alone are villainous. Don't get me wrong. I have no problem if all the bad guys are characterized as Republicans from the \\"right wing fringe\\", that's one thing. But if ABSOLUTELY ALL REPULICANS OR CONSERVATIVES, are characterized as right wing extremists who coddle hate groups, kill pro choicers, hate all ethnicities other than white Anglo-Saxon, and are card carrying members of Hillary Clinton's fantasy \\"Right Wing Conspiracy\\", then the book becomes less enjoyable, (unless of course you ARE Hillary Clinton), not to mention, more manipulative than a campaign speech.Continuing his exaggerated characterisations,Woods portrays all of the good guys, the smart guys, the likable guys, including the novel's hero, our old friend, Stone Barrington, as Democrats who hate the death penalty, love abortion, find all people of faith to exhibit hypocrisy and religiosity, (like the bad hair TV evangelists who really are that way) and then purport themselves to be \\"Moderates\\". Astonishingly, Woods portrays Stone Barrington as saying that he doesn't know what \\"family values\\" are, and pens one of that character's own family to believe that private Christian schools were created by racist Christians who didn't want their children to have to go to school with black children. Preposterous, manipulative garbage.The plot is weak and thin, having be done scores of times in bad TV movies and weekly dramas. The characters are nothing but engineered stereotypes conjured from a mist of bad research, self delusion and misrepresentation. Woods should go back and read his own prior works featuring Stone Barrington. He might realize he took a good character and superimposed him over a ridiculous one, in a haplessly contrived and much overdone storyline. Now that we know your politics Mr. Woods, go back to writing.....don't give up your day job by running for office through drivel like this."},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"Dopy story. Fiction at its extreme. I was planning on reading \\"all\\" of Woods books but his far left view and his contempt for Republican views are just too extreme.

Goodbye"},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"Beloved Georgia Senator Ben Carr is an icon on Capitol Hill who wants to serve one more term before using his considerable political clout to get his chief of staff Will Lee elected to take his place. But the plans go awry when the aging Senator suffers a debilitating stroke, making it impossible to speak, let alone campaign.Lee is eventually thrust into the limelight to face off with Democratic Governor Mack Dean for the party's nomination. The winner will face-off against the evil Reverend Calhoun, the Republican television evangelist for the Presidency. A problem arises, however, when Judge Boggs commits Lee to defend a high-profile murder case that involves a young white male, Larry Moody, standing trial for the rape and murder of a black female. The racially-charged trial threatens to have a disastrous effect on the campaign of the newcomer.Meanwhile, Stone Barrington pursues a group of white supremacists on a murder spree that targets local adult entertainment purveyors, while in the background, the mysterious Archon is pulling the strings that bring the scenarios together to an exciting finale. * * *My Two Cents WorthI have been a Woods fan for some time, but only recently picked up one of his earlier works of fiction, Grass Roots. I enjoyed the first half of the book, as it promised an entertaining and complex story-line, but by the time the trial was to start I grew weary of the persistent political diatribe that was blatantly slanted to the far left. If I want political commentary, it is available 24/7 on the boob tube. I do feel that in his more current works Woods has learned to tell the story and leave politics to the pundits.I did appreciate the way the three story lines merged, and the trial was well-done and surprising. Woods is a great storyteller, who has obviously honed his craft through the years to the point that most readers can probably forgive his ego. The pace was upbeat and suffered very few lapses in the action. I must admit, too, that I was amused by the statement on the back cover offered by The State (SC), claiming \\" Stuart Woods is a wonderful storyteller who could teach Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy a thing or two.\\"Doubt it."},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"I don't read a lot of political melodramas, and 'Grass Roots' reminded me why. I was intrigued by the cover blurb promising a mix of down-home courtroom drama, with dashes of campaign suspense, and maybe even some 'Agency' intrigue. The quote on the back cover that 'Woods...could teach Ludlum and Clancy a thing or too' was, unfortunately, inaccurate.Woods seems to have borrowed the most cliched aspects of both Clancy and John Grisham, along with political conspiracy thories that were 'plausibly implausible' even years before this novel was published, and which have no doubt inspired several more recent entries in the ever-expanding 'Da gummint is out ta GIT ya!' genre of suspense fiction.This book contains every stale genre-fiction cliche about political dynasties, idealistic candidates, genteel southerners, understanding love interests, fork-tongued televangelists, and murder-trial defendants who really screw things up for their attorneys, and boils it all down into a book that, at 600 pages, paradoxically manages to be both concise and long-winded(but made me wish some of the longer scenes were shorter, and vice versa!)At least he toned down the southern dialect, so that we didn't have to see too many of the 'traditional' dialectical phrases and misspellings..except, of course, those uttered by the 'traditional', old, black, housekeeper who knew his place. At least, even by 1989, the author saw no need to have an elderly white character use the word 'negro', just to show their age.Political novels set in specific eras, in the author's version of 'the real world', become terribly dated after a short time, although this seems to have done a good job of capturing the trend in the last 20-odd years, of candidates from 'lowly' backgrounds, with somewhat dubious character and qualifications, who manage to [...] their way to a series of elections to public office.The courtroom thriller side of the story, when not buried and neglected under 'our hero Will's campaign misadventures, is actually not that bad, and if Woods had left the politics out almost completely, and developed the case a lot more, he might have been on to something. I enjoyed the first few chapters, but as the cliches mounted, and the story became a series of interludes that the author miraculously remembered to actually connect to Will before he tied it all together(except for the stuff he conveniently saved for the sequel), I found myself skimming the more hackneyed scenes.I've since learned that this 'secret society' returned in Woods' next book in the series, but that one(and some of the subsequent entries) haven't done as well in this site's reviews. That's convinced me not to 'root' through any more of this series!"},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"I agree with what one reveiwer said - Stuart Woods is a slam-bang storyteller!

His opponent in the Democratic primary is the state's governor Mack Dean; if he wins that his most likely Republican foe is an extreme TV star fundamentalist.However, Will places his personal campaigning on hold when Judge Boggs asks him to serve as a public defender on a hate crimes homicide case in Meriwether County where he grew up and his ma still lives in Delano. The case is a racially charged murder that could impact his election chances as his client is a white male accused of killing a black female.Meanwhile a former cop hunts a vigilante group assassinating people involved in what they interpret as porn peddling gangland-style. This too impacts Will's chances of winning the election as the issues of soft on crime and pornography surface.Each of the three prime threads is gripping and easily could have served as fully developed novellas in differing sub-genres: political, legal and investigative. However, the fun in this tale is how Stuart Woods cleverly interweaves the three seemingly diverse subplots into a cohesive exciting thriller. This reprint of a 1989 tale holds up nicely two decades later.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"Absolutely Woods' best book. This was his first novel and I think it is his best.

While it is nowhere near as good as any Grisham novel, it is a fairly enjoyable read.We are unfortunately forced to learn too much about Woods' left-leaning politics however. His characterization about republicans and conservatives as described by the senatorial candidate Calhoun is grossly unfair. Depicting Calhoun (the republican candidate) as a KKK-sympathizing fundamentalist religious hypocrite borders on Michael Moore type propaganda. In the novel, Will Lee's campain speach before his rival's church congregation sounds like a replay of a Ted Kennedy tyrade. This story in this novel tends to follow that of the 1986 senate election of Wyche Fowler in Georgia - a career politician who served one term in the senate. The political climate is the same - democrats ruled the roost.Despite that this novel preceded the Grisham successes, Woods could learn from Grisham's lack of bias and overt political declarations. Grisham's political candidates are rarely identified with parties and his true political leanings are seldom revealed. With Woods, nothing is left to the imagination."},{"Title":"Grass Roots","review":"This is a book for Stuart Woods' lovers as well as someone looking for a book about todays politics.

He published everywhere and wrote on everything during a fifty-plus year career; urban planners know him best these days, but he was the New Yorker architecture critic for years and wrote on literature, culture, and politics for all the big magazines: MacCalls, Harper's, The New Republic, Seven Arts. Technics and Civilization (1934) wasn't his last book on technology; he returned to the subject again in The Pentagon of Power, two volumes, published around 1969. Technics and Civilization asks readers to consider intelligently how to better use technology to shape lives worth living, rather than to allow technology, or our use of it, to shape life unexaminedly. Mumford contributed so much to letters and to public life that we owe it to ourselves to read him, even if the limitations of his sometimes utopian ideas become too often apparent (remember, the Unabomber is a fan), because his ideas on social organizations are crack"},{"Title":"Technics and Civilization","review":"Lewis Mumford is widely regarded as a critic of architecture, but his true importance in intellectual history is as a critic of technology and the myth of progress that accompanies technology, making it seem as if every technological advance is a step forward in civilization. That the events from 1945 onward dispute this claim would seem evident, but themselves are brushed over in favor of the prevailing paradigm.Mumford was the first to take a critical look at technology and its accompanying mythos, and even though this book was later surpassed by his masterpiece, The Myth of the Machine, it is still worth reading for its approach to the tenor of its time (written during the Depression).You can safely ignore the last chapters when Mumford attempts to offer an alternative to the technological society. Like most critics, he is mercifully short on alternatives. (Considering what alternatives were given humanity over the centuries, you can understand why I said that.) Until we truly understand technology and the role it has taken in our lives, we will be no closer to a solution than Mumford was in the Thirties.For anyone who wishes to study the intellectual history of the West, this is an indispensible volume."},{"Title":"Technics and Civilization","review":"Readers should be aware that the 2010 University of Chicago Press edition of Technics and Civilization omits Mumford's 15 pages of photographs.

When people pay you money for hard copy books, you're supposed to provide something not easily available on the Internet, if only the assemblage of text and relevant images into a coherent whole.

He refutes the contention that mechanical progress began in Britain during the Industrial Revolution and argues that man had used machine instruments for at least the previous seven centuries.In Europe machines became a part of the whole fabric of cultural life. Mumford distinguishes the machine, a mechanism to modify the environment for human benefit, and \\" \`The machine,' ...a shorthand reference to the entire technological complex.\\"(12) Furthermore a tool and machine are distinguished by the skill and dexterity of the operator and, whereas \\"utensils, apparatus, and utilities\\" refer to chemical transformations (brewing, for example), machines \\"transform the environment by changing the shape and location of objects.\\"(11)Mumford identifies three overlapping and interdependent periods where machines and society interacted to define modern industrial culture. The eotechnic phase began in about the tenth century and was characterized by water and wood; the Paleotechnic phase emerged in the eighteenth century and was characterized by coal and iron; and third, or present Neotechnic phase, is characterized by electricity and alloys. Leading up to each of these periods, society experienced a period of cultural preparation and adaptation.Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the monastery was a refuge of order. Within the sanctity of its walls, the clock regulated routine and discipline. Thus, according to Mumford, \\"the clock, not the steam engine, is the key machine of the modern industrial age.\\"(14) Time and the adaptation of space in the middle ages changed people's perspectives toward mechanical improvement which was further stimulated by the potential of profits from emerging capitalism. Eotechnic life refined the senses after the religious asceticism of the preceding era.Mechanization between the tenth and seventeenth centuries is illuminating. Mumford illustrates this in the context of a civilization emerging within a mountain-and-river valley section. At the tops of mountain, outcroppings of ore led to quarrying and mining. The pick and the hammer were the earliest tools, augmented by machines in later stages. The forest stretching from the mountain top to the valley floor harbored \\"the hunter who stalks his game: his is possibly the oldest deliberate technical operation of mankind for in their origin the weapon [missile/hammerhead, knife, ax] and the tool are interchangeable.\\"(61) Heading down the valley the river stream served as a transportation route leading to the development of hollowed out wooden canoes. Upstream, pastures fostered spinning and weaving by herders. Downstream, the domain of the peasants, farmers cultivated the lowlands. Here man's tools remained mostly unchanged, but his \\"utensils and utilities are many: the irrigation ditch, the cellar...[etc.].\\"(63) Finally, when the stream empties into the ocean, fisherman learned to weave nets and baskets and, with boats, trade and communication become possible.Mining led to capitalism by requiring investment capital to fund expensive operations and spread the risk. In addition, to buy capital goods, a sound currency was necessary. Wood was the most important component of early technology. It propped up the mines, was used to make machines, and was a source of fuel. The woodman was a technical innovator; \\"the lathe...his decisive contribution to the development of machines.\\"(80)Warfare organized human effort and utilized machines in a cohesive manner. Firearms added to technics by the unprecedented need for iron, the development of a power cylinder (the barrel) and piston (the projectile), and the development of heavy fortifications. The ability to make standardized weapons, steel, and uniforms for the military encouraged a consumer market for civilians.In the paleotechnic phase the Industrial Revolution transformed the way men thought, the manner of production, and the way of life. These ideas are so profound that historians saw them as new, but Mumford shows how they were rooted in the past. What is most striking is that they occurred in England where the eotechnic phase had had the least impact and England, therefore, was susceptible to change. Whereas technical development in the earlier phase was not a complete breach with the past, \\"paleotechnical industry, on the other hand, arose out of the breakdown of European society and carried the process of disruption to the finish.\\"(153) The machine thrust society into an era of \\"barbarism.\\" This had as its basis the shift to coal as the new energy source, and iron as the medium of construction which gave us the steam engine. The cost of steam power was expensive and this encouraged concentration and monopoly, in contrast to water and wind power, which were free. Military demands for steel influenced the Darby process for cast iron and made it more affordable. Mumford says the paleotechnical period was characterized by warfare, environmental pollution, the degradation of the worker as a machine tender, diseases, and from a rising population. The net result was a lowered quality of life. Mumford sees the paleotechnic phase as a period of transition.(211)To Mumford, the neotechnic phase is more like the eotechnic phase, except in degree. Fifteenth century ideas have become reality, but class and national struggles persist. Since the neotechnic phase is ongoing, its full implication cannot be measured. It began with the Fourneyron's water-turbine which increased water power output nine fold, but electrical power characterizes the period. Electricity can be transported efficiently and used in many ways. In the Neotechnic phase, the use of the scientific method is widened to include the humanities. This awareness promots social order and clarity.\\"In the neotechnic phase, the main initiative comes, not from the ingenious inventor, but from the scientist who establishes the general law: the invention is the derivative product.\\"(217) Improvements in the internal combustion engine provide a new source of power which changes the social order. Rapid transportation is possible by the automobile and the airplane. Communication is further enhanced by the telegraph and the telephone. But, \\"whereas the growth and multiplication of machines was a definite characteristic of the paleotechnic period, [Mumford says] one may already say pretty confidently that the refinement, the diminution, and the partial elimination of the machine is characteristic of the emerging neotechnic economy.\\"(258)"},{"Title":"Technics and Civilization","review":"How in the world did Chicago decide that Mumford's images were a) not \\"practical\\" or \\"necessary\\" to include in this edition b) still important enough that they include the original captions and--I am not making this up--a list of hilariously unhelpful \\"keywords\\" with which we're supposed to search on the Internet for the images, or else \\"similar\\" ones?One can only assume Chicago, which regularly ruins manuscripts that should have more or better images in them than they do, just refused to pay the 500 bucks it would have taken to prep the b&w; images in photoshop and print them in the book.

Ugh."},{"Title":"Technics and Civilization","review":"Lewis Mumford's, Technics and Civilization, may be one of the most important and influential works concerning technological progress in Western Civilization and its cultural and environmental effects. The study covers a wide area of historical past stretching from the Roman Empire all the way to the present (1934). The importance of Mumford's study lies in the fact that it is not just another technophilic antiquarian study of technological improvement but rather it is an intelligent and highly critical look at the cultural development that gave rise to the machine and, from there, a critical study of how the \\"progress\\" of the machine affected the culture it was developing within. Mumford shows how the progression of the machine has affected nearly every aspect of human society including but not limited to sexuality, economy, ecology, warfare, occurrence of disease, and medicine.The terminology surrounding matters of technology is not firmly defined and usually becomes a question of post-structural analysis when the meanings of these words are debated by academics in various fields of study. One of the main areas of confusion has been over the meaning of the word \\"tool\\" and the meaning of the word \\"machine.\\" To quell confusion over the meaning of his own study, Mumford has given each word his own definition. According to Mumford: \\"[t]he tool lends it self to manipulation\\" while \\"[t]he machine lends it self to automatic action\\" (p.10). These definitions are important for understanding the meaning behind Mumford's study.Mumford traces the cultural origins of the first machine, the mechanical clock, to the influences of monasticism and the Catholic teachings. The Church teachings of the early millennium stressed an extreme denial of the body which was viewed as sinful and polluted with the profanities of the earthly realm. Mumford believed that this denial of the body led to the growth of hatred for the organic which in turn fostered a cultural admiration for the machine as something that was disassociated from a polluted organic nature. Thus, as the first true machine, the mechanical clock fostered one of the original disassociations - the disassociation of time from the rhythms of nature. Although the Church teachings were based on the subjective belief in a utopian afterlife, the extreme denial of organic and natural earthly pleasures advocated by the early church caused an objective view of the organic to develop. By the 16th century the new protestant religion and the growth of objectivism coincided with what Mumford labeled the \\"disassociation of the animate and the mechanical\\" (p.31). This disassociation opened the floodgates for the objective sciences which were developing a common cultural understanding of the organic as merely a conglomeration of dead material to be studied and manipulated. The growth of objectivism coupled with the new protestant teachings, specifically the abandonment of the prohibition of usury, enabled the development of the early stages of capitalist economics by allowing God's work to be viewed as the accumulation of personal wealth. Not surprisingly, it was to the machine that these possessed western men turned to increase the production of wealth.At this point in time, western civilization was in the first of three periods of technological development. Mumford labels these three stages based upon their method of energy production and organic material usage: the Eotechnic phase (based on water energy and wood), the Paleotechnic phase (based on coal energy and iron), and the Neotechnic phase (based on electricity and the alloys). Mumford explains that these stages overlap in many cases and should not be viewed as clean categories. Nevertheless, they do provide a useful framework for understanding the progression of the machine. The origins of capitalism occurred during the Eotechnic phase. Mumford finds the mine to be the central stimulant of Eotechnic technological progress. New mining technologies were created to extract increasing amounts of organic material to be converted into ever-increasing wealth for the emerging capitalist class. For Mumford, the Eotechnic phase cemented the alliance between capitalism and technology.Soon, deforestation for fuel to be used in iron manufacture became a major cause for the progression into the Paleotechnic phase and the usage of coal as a primary energy source. Mumford labeled this Paleotechnic phase \\"The New Barbarism\\" (p.153). Although it decreased the levels of deforestation, the burning of coal ushered in profound environmental damage to the air and water. Through the use of coal and the development of steam power, production of iron and other goods increased exponentially at the expense of the emergent proletariat class. Mumford argued that this period gave birth to the \\"unsustainable society\\" (p.157) where military interests and warfare grew together with increased production and the need for continuous, escalating consumption, all of which were only possible due to the technological progress of the Paleotechnic period. As an example of this alliance, Mumford explains how the American Steel Manufacturing group deliberately destroyed the possibility of an arms reduction agreement, at the international arms conference of 1927, in order to maintain their profit share in the arms trade. (p.165).The Neotechnic phase was ushered in with the spread of electricity as a power source at the beginning of the 19th century. The creation of electric power dramatically cleaned the air and water and the increased production enabled by the efficiency of electric power enabled another boom in the production of consumer items. However, the new phase also increased the power of those in control of technology, and Mumford shows how Neotechnic inventions such as the radio, photography, and the telephone were used by those in power to manipulate and manufacture consent in populations. Nevertheless, in the Neotechnic period, Mumford saw what he believed to be a possibility for the creation of a humane and compassionate society as well as a return to the organic.Mumford saw the Paleotechnic phase as one that enabled and rewarded the anti-social characteristics of human nature, thus it inevitably created a society of inequality, increasing pollution, anomie, and warfare. Although Mumford was very aware of the destructive and anti-social record of technological progress, he refused to argue for the abandonment of the machine. Mumford stated that \\"lacking a cooperative social intelligence and good-will, our most refined technics promises no more for societies improvement...\\"(p.215). In this he is placing all the blame for the anti-social and ecologically genocidal effects of the machine on the economic organization of society. The problem with this analysis is that it is not teleologically secure. Written during the early years of the rise of Communism in the former Russian Kingdom, Mumford held out hope that, through Communism, the power of the machine could be harnessed to provide for the general welfare of society and that his hope in the future of technics would be born out. However, history has shown that technology in service of Communism, while it may help to normalize consumption, still produces many of the same destructive effects that it produced under capitalism - specifically militarism and environmental destruction. The hard reality is that Capitalism was not the cause of technological anti-socialism. Capitalism is a function of the same anti-social impulse that gave rise to technology - the will towards domination. Given the history of mechanical progress, it becomes essential to view technology as inherently anti-social. Rather than looking towards alternative methods of using machines of power to fix our world, as Mumford did, we should be thinking of and developing methods with which we can create a future world where machines and domination are not only unnecessairy but are also non-existant."},{"Title":"Technics and Civilization","review":"This book is a historical interpretation of the effect of technology on society. Mumford traces the Industrial Revolution to its earliest roots, which he argues, go back to the invention of reliable timepieces in the Eleventh Century (whose invention was motivated, according to Mumford, by the need for recognizing prayer times in Catholic monasteries). Mumford also stresses the effects mining, the military, and the production of arms had on each other and on the development of technology, from earliest recorded history through modern times. Another recurrent theme is power, and how discoveries of new ways to harness power led to economic development. The final part of the book discusses the invention and assimilation of \\"the machine,\\" as a generic concept for an advanced technology item. The book is illustrated with several sections of black-and-white photographs and reproductions of artwork. End material includes a chronology of inventions, a lengthy annotated bibliography, and an index.In a discussion of the motivation behind invention, Mumford notes that \\"a good part of the mechanical elements in the day are attempts to counteract the effects of lengthening time and space distance. The refrigeration of eggs, for example, is an effort to space their distribution more uniformly than the hen herself is capable of doing...The accompanying pieces of mechanical apparatus do nothing to improve the product itself: refrigeration merely halts the process of decomposition.\\" Is this progress? Although he originally wrote this book back in the 1930s, well before our present energy crises, Mumford was adamant that renewable energy sources must supply the power of the future. He is an advocate for wind and water energy, and he dreams of a day when the power of the sun can be used to generate electricity. Mumford is also disturbed by rampant consumerism. He quotes a Hoover Committee report on a survey of Recent Economics that states \\"The survey has proved conclusively, what has long been held theoretically to be true, that wants are almost insatiable; that one want makes way for another. The conclusion is that economically we have a boundless field before us; that there are new wants which will make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied.\\" Interesting points such as these, which sound remarkably fresh today, can be found scattered amongst the text. Unfortunately, however, such gems are overshadowed by the sheer volume of text. This book would benefit greatly from an abridgment that would bring out the best, most important ideas by eliminating the wordy asides and statements of personal opinion."},{"Title":"Technics and Civilization","review":"From the beginning of time, technology has affected our lives.

They have done us all a great service by presenting the information in a respectful but scientifically critical manner.This book should be on every neurologist's shelf. It should also be on the shelf of all other physician practitioners that treat epilepsy. Drs. Devinsky, Schachter and Pacia have produced a work that is long overdue.Treating epilepsy can be frustrating since traditional medicine is not always successful in delivering the ideal result (no seizures and no side effects). Patients in desperation are looking for something that will work. Some patients may just want another option because of any one of a number of reasons including fear of potential long-term side effects of medications, or because they harbor a general mistrust of modern medicine for example.With the advent of the Internet, patients and their families are discovering that there are options available which their physicians have not told them about. Some of the options may have merit and some may not. Most patients do not have the medical sophistication to tell the difference. Many doctors do not have the time or the interest to find out. The problem is that when patients go to their physicians with their new-found knowledge, and they are met with total ignorance, indifference or worse yet, arrogance, the physicians immediately lose credibility with their patients.By reading and understanding this book that covers a broad range of \\"alternative and complementary therapies for epilepsy,\\" physicians will be able to better understand what their patients are talking about and will be able to speak with knowledge and credibility when these ideas are brought up by patients. Having this knowledge will also prompt physicians during the intake interviews to ask if any of these alternative approaches are being used. That information may help with drug dosages (some herbs or supplements can affect enzyme induction) and help to explain treatment failure.Medical practices that serve many well informed patients may see increasing numbers of people asking about these things. That type of patient is expecting more than just a prescription refill and a follow-up in 3-6 months. It could be that some physicians will suggest some of these ideas on their own if they seem right for a particular patient. Spending the extra time and effort may be hard to do because physicians are pushed harder and harder to do more and more in less time, and most practices don't have time during a visit to do more than just the basics. Just the same some people are expecting more.The chapters are generally concise and mostly well referenced and are organized in a very interesting fashion; an expert that champions a particular form of alternative or complementary therapy writes the chapter, and the editors in a very respectful fashion make comments on the ideas presented. They often point out how well the available scientific evidence may or may not support the assertions of the chapter authors. The editors' comments range from very encouraging to highly doubtful, especially when judged by the standard of the double-blind study.Chapter contents include: 1) Relation of Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Epilepsy to Western Medicine, 2) The standards for clinical trials to prove effectiveness of a therapy (the Double Blind trial), 3 Treating epilepsy with stress reduction, 4) The neurobehavioral approach, 5) Self control, eliminating triggers etc., 6) Neurofeedback, 7) Autogenic training, 8) Massage, 9) Aromatherapy and Hypnosis, 10) Meditation, 11) Exercise and Yoga, 12) Ayurveda, 13) Herbal therapy, 14) Phytotherapy (more herbal therapy), 15) Homeopathy, 16) Naturopathic Medicine, 17) Traditional Chinese Medicine, 18) Acupuncture, 19) Nutrition, 20) Fatty acids in the diet, 21) The Ketogenic diet, 22) Hormonal therapy, 23) Trancranial magnetic stimulation, 24) Hyperbaric oxygen, 25) Rebreathing to use CO2 to dilate cerebral vessels to increase cerebral oxygen delivery, 26) Chiropractic, 27) Osteopathic Approach, 28) Craniosacral Therapy, 29) Music Therapy, 30) Art Therapy, 31) Pet TherapyParticularly enlightening chapters are numbers12-22, where herbs, vitamins, food supplements and other nutritional approaches are described rather nicely. Two somewhat disturbing chapters for me are the ones on Naturopathic Medicine (16), and the Osteopathic approach in children (27). The part of the naturopathic medicine chapter that disturbs me the most is the philosophy that epilepsy is possibly a result of lifestyle, diet or habits of the individual and can be cured if the practitioner can find the correct cause and effect a change. Fully subscribing to such an approach could lead to spending big bucks on food supplements and other things that have no proven value or could actually complicate standard medical treatment. In spite of that problem, naturopaths have many fascinating ideas that are worthy of further investigation. The Osteopathic chapter is largely anecdotal. The references are quite dated as well. From modalities that purport to be scientifically oriented I expected better.The greatest value of the book for me is, understanding how others besides those in mainstream medicine think about epilepsy. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Epilepsy","review":"If you are diagnosed with Epilepsy, this IS the book to read, especially if you do not want to be on medication the rest of your life or if you do not want seizures (and who does?). There is a wealth of information in this book that has not been published before. Especially the work of Donna J. Andrews is worth considering, since she has a 80% successrate with lowering the amount of seizures in her patients. But there are others. Biofeedback is a great tool as well for some. A friend of mine got her seizures way down with this method. She had many a day, now she has none. I am so proud of her because she refused to be on meds from day one. It is invaluable to know you can do something about epilepsy by understanding and working with your triggers. There is a lesson here to be understood. You can improve the quality of your life.

While I am not against the use of conventional therapies, they do not always work, and I do not want to turn down use of \\"alternative\\" therapies simply because they have been labeled as such. Some of these things might not have the scientific backing to explain how or why they would work, but may very well work. (Conventional therapies are not always the best-- no leeches, please!) If it's something that poses little to no risk, it may be worth trying.My main concern is that this book needs to be updated. *Seven years is a long time in research*, and a lot might have happened since then: Catamenial epilepsy (the increased likelihood of seizures during parts of the menstrual cycle) is better understood now and is more accepted as a true correlation in the clinic, for example, and not just seen as the patients' imagination. The book, if updated, would be more useful. (And given the price, would be a better deal as well!) Please, please update!I would consider part II, the \\"Learning to Reduce Seizures\\" portion of the book, to be most interesting. The techniques being talked about here are things that are (generally) low-cost and low-risk. In particular I found the chapters on meditation and exercise (likely to be) most useful.

This combination proved so successful that, by the early 1930s, a conservative religious movement emerged with an aim to \\"clean up\\" Hollywood's excesses, led by the Catholic Church but supported by preachers, ministers, and spiritual spokesmen nationwide. The Catholic Church's League of Decency became the first cultural crusade against what was perceived as a threat to the national character. Wielding an authority of equal parts religion and politics, the League saw to it that movies were banned outright, content was snipped and clipped, and production scripts were combed over for hints of immorality. Classic novels were re-written for the screen to pass the scrutiny of the hastily-created, reactionary Hays Office. Is this a good thing? There was a backlash among Hollywood writers; Black's recounting of William Faulkner creating the story of \\"Sanctuary\\" in three weeks (\\"the most horrific tale\\" Faukner could imagine, Black writes, \\"a morbid tale of rape, murder, sexual impotence and perversion\\") certainly seems like an outright challenge to the Paramount studio writers and censors, and the rewritten, completed film (\\"The Story of Temple Drake\\") turns the story inside out for a relatively less-scandalous ending.Over the course of years, the Legion of Decency and the Hays Office's Production Code (which functioned as a presumptive industry watchdog) ensured that onscreen crime would not pay and immorality would be punished. Realism in Hollywood films got bleached out, but as the book makes clear the industry preferered to deal with religious moralists, and to police themselves with a nebulous code, rather than face government interference. In that regard America hasn't come very far, as the religious right's contemporary battles over entertainment and the morality of content in movies, TV, and the internet make clear. Recommended."},{"Title":"Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication)","review":"What enabled one viciously anti-semetic Catholic, Joe Breen, to control an entire industry? This delightful scholarly tome gives a partial answer: the industry wanted to have its product go to the largest possible audience, despite local and national boards of censors. By censoring themselves, they obtained a pugnacious Irish Catholic who could browbeat bishops, state legislators, and others. The only price was to meet this one person's private moral code: to make movies that would not offend 12 year old girls in convent schools. This history of the Production Code Authority, and how it was exercised is par excellence. What gave Breen his power was a confluence of Catholic bankers, vertical integration from studio through distributor to exhibitor, coupled with mandatory booking at the exhibition level. The weakness for the studios was Catholic threats of boycotts at the midwestern exhibitor level where the studios were weakest. This book should be coupled with the author's &quot;Catholic Crusade Against the Movies&quot; and the pictoral &quot;Sin in Soft Focus.&quot; An interesting footnote is the KKK response to the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency. Does the revival of Catholic horror of blasphemy, in the so-called Catholic League of the 1990s pose a similar threat? Probably not, since the Fr. Lord's Legion of Decency was focused on Jewish studio heads, and the Catholic League objects to Catholic movie makers and Catholic television writers. The PCA did more than condemn the use of angora sweaters in the finished movies, it forbade any movie that was social in comment or controversial in its politics. Somehow it even managed to offend William Randolph Hearst, a honor usually reserved to Orson Wells and &quot;Rosebud.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication)","review":"the item I received was in a very good condition, just like a new one."},{"Title":"Let's Eat: What Children Eat Around the World","review":"This book is great to use in any multi-cultural lesson and/or classroom.

The historical events of Napoleon's escape from Elba and the battles that ensued give this book the drama and flaver that I have come to love in the previous 22 books in this line. I could not put it down, and read it straight through. I have over the years intoduced over 15 of my friends to the Bolitho saga, and the only bad thing about this book is the death of Admiral Sir Richard, but with the presence of Adam Bolitho, I feel that this saga can continue with no loss of interest for all of us whom have come to love all of the people that have been intorduced and been brought alive in the past 23 books. I only hope that Lady Sommerval is not left out of any forthcoming books."},{"Title":"Sword of Honour","review":"I have greatly enjoyed Kent's Bolitho Novels, mainly because I had read Hornblower as well as the Aubrey/Maturin novels, and was infected with the love of the genre.I'll not compare Bolitho to those other worthies as he is not them nor they him, however I do think that Mr Kent should have killed off our more-than-maudlin Admiral in book 17 or 18.I found this book a nice way to spend my reading time for a day or so, but in truth, I can't recommend it as one of Kent's best."},{"Title":"Sword of Honour","review":"Alexander Kent (Douglas Reeman), a prolific writer, spends an entire novel in maudlin reminescence of a character's life to prepare us for that character's death. This last installment of Richard Bolitho's life deserved far better. Set around Napoleon's escape from Elba, the novel never really gives Sir Richard anything to do, except remember those he has known and act as though he is ready to die. The series, which already went about 8 books too long, is left to trickle off, instead of a spectacular finish and transition to Adam becoming the main character. I read all 23 of the set (though not the 24th, where Adam carries on) and I wish I'd stopped around 15 or so. Skip this one and continue on to Adam's first solo adventure."},{"Title":"Sword of Honour","review":"I could not believe the turn this series took in the last 4-5 books: Bolitho and Herrick at each other's throats, all the double entendre sex and romance, and then with this novel---killing off the fellow the whole series was built around! Not too smart to kill off your hero, Mr.Kent. The nephew is not a well fleshed-out character in any of the previous books and now the author wants to devote the remaining books to telling about his so-called adventures? Ridiculous! I wonder if all the romantic stuff sneaked in (it really does increase after book 15 or 16) after the author remarried a somewhat younger woman (see his website for author biography). Whatever the reason, Patrick O'Brian he ain't and none of these books are as well written as the Aubrey-Maturin series, no matter how many reviewers have claimed it so. O'Brian was in a league of his own. Kent is in the mediocre one with many others. I stopped reading the series when finished with this book, and am currently looking for a new one to inform and entertain."},{"Title":"Sword of Honour","review":"The war against Napoleon is over. Napoleon lost his battle and abdicated his throne and is now exiled to an island to be emprisoned. Dick Bolitho is recalled from Halifax to make room for a more senior admiral who is charged with bringing the war against the U.S. to an end; Adam Bolitho remains as Keen's Flag Captain, but Keen is more concerned with his romancing a new woman and ensuring his career to go out to sea any more; and Lady Somerville is awaiting her hero back in England.Sounds like a wrap up of a series, no?Well, it's not. There is still plenty of action in this story. While Dick Bolitho is sent back to England, it is only for a few weeks and then he is off again to command a squadron of frigates in the Mediteranan sea - chasing after pirates. This series has had to deal with many contortions lately to keep things goins and this book is no different - For instance, while Dick Bolitho (as a full Admiral no less!) is given command of a few frigates in Malta, a newly-hatched Commodore takes over Adam Bolitho's frigate squadron the active war zone of Halifax. Then, it is also hard to explain how come Read Admiral Keen is recalled from Halifax, and given the port admiral duties in Portsmouth AND promoted to a Vice Admiral without setting foot on a fighting ship again. And on, and on, and on.I think that even Mr. Reeman has reached the end of the rope on that convoluted storyline, so he decides to end the whole thing with Dick Bolitho. Before your outrageous howls about giving up the storyline, please note that the last four or five books in the series had a timeline of Richard Bolitho's life printed in them and they all stated that he dies in March 1815 in this book. So, even coming into it, we all knew that Richard Bolitho will get killed here. The question for me was, how? The answer to that waits until the very last page of the very last chapter as Bolitho manages to get involved in Napoleon's escape from Elba.There are plenty of sea tales in this book and actually it is much better than several of the previous volumes in the series. Since this book is an end of an era, it is not too surprising that many of the old characters make cameo appearances - like Herrick who appears for a page or two. In addition, Adam Bolitho starts taking on a more prominent role in this book. Which makes sense since he will carry the series from here on out, and we start seeing more of the Bolitho 'magic' being bequeathed to him. As usual, there is the pat circumstance of a superior officer who is really unworthy of command - and who gets killed during an engagement; very convenient.So, a mixed bag deserving of the three star rating I give this book."},{"Title":"Sword of Honour","review":"Great!

Bolitho finds himself posted to Malta, where he quickly takes on the task of eliminating piracy as a threat to Mediterranean shipping. Meanwhile, Bolitho's nephew and heir, Captain Adam Bolitho, puzzles over a new commodore to whom he must be flag captain. And Catherine, Lady Somervell, faces the cruelties of London society to a woman who lives openly with a man not her husband.It's hardly a spoiler to acknowledge what I knew when I bought this book, that it is the volume in the long series that recounts Richard Bolitho's death in action.

It was, rather, a very evenly paced novel in which many of the developments involved terrorism and the government's response to the terrorists' acts. It was very interesting to read about a piece of legislation that some of the characters supported. The legislation involved giving the police easier rules and access to search people and their homes. The obvious allusion to America's Patriot Act and the debate it has spawned is an excellent piece of the overall picture.This book focused on Thomas primarily, and his relationship with one of his true enemies.

Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be?

It's the Victorian era in London and in this story Thomas has been removed from the police in Bow Street to work in Special Branch. I love the characters, not only Thomas and Charlotte, his wife, but her aunt Lady Vespasia, the Pitt's servant girl Gracie, and Gracie's fiance Tellman who used to work with Pitt at Bow Street.In this story anarchists are bombing poor neighborhoods and no one can understand why. As Pitt responds to a bombing, he and his boss Narraway follow the bombers to Long Spoon Lane where a shoot-out ensues. Afterward, a body is found and identified as the son of a member of Parliament who just happens to be a friend of Lady Vespasia's. What was he doing with the anarchists? Was he a hostage? Surely he couldn't have been one of them.The investigation unearths police corruption in several stations including Bow Street which involves some high officials. Not knowing who to trust, except Tellman, Pitt sets out to get at the root of the problem and discovers very disturbing evidence. As usual, Lady Vespasia plays a vital role in the investigation.Along the way as you read Perry's books you learn about Victorian London. There are scenes with the wealthy and powerful and others with the poorest of the poor. Tellman takes Gracie to the theater and you see what appealed to the masses at the time. There are scenes along the Thames and others in the slums, then the scene shifts to a drawing room of a wealthy family. I love this kind of thing and Perry is an expert at putting the reader right into each setting.I dread the day I run out of Perry novels to read so I save them for just the right time.

Thomas Pitt of Special Branch is brought in to investigate the bombing and the murder. This starts a long path where Pitt's investigation reveals corruption in the police force and the government. He uncovers that the bombing and the murder were all about an attempt to pass a bill that would give the police more power.Although the mystery aspect of this was well done and much of the plot was compelling, the underlying reason behind all of this seemed really silly, making it hard for me to ever get into the story. The characters in the story made such a big deal about a bill that would allow police to carry firearms. My reaction as I was reading was what's the big deal? Of course, police officers should be able to carry firearms. Going up against armed criminals equipped with nightsticks would be ridiculous. The characters also raised a big stink about the police being allowed to question the servants of rich folk. God forbid, these ultra rich, high and mighty people would have their servants be allowed to answer questions about possible criminal wrong doing. The last time I checked anybody can be questioned if a commoner is suspected of a crime.

The trials and tribulations with the Inner Circle are becoming very repetative, and occasional splash of Victorian melodrama cheapens the integrity of the book.

She also paints a wonderful background of Victorian England in which the reader is treated to sights, sounds, and smells which bring that era alive."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Anne Perry takes us back to when anarchists scared the world as they idealistically sought to blow up civilization \\"to free people\\" from the laws that bind us. The parallels to bombings in London during \\"the troubles\\" in Northern Ireland and daily bombings in Moslem countries around the world are startling. You come away feeling like the hue and cry are there to serve selfish interests as much as idealistic ones.The book's plot takes many interesting twists and turns as Pitt continues to find himself as an outsider at Special Branch as well as in relations with his old colleagues at the Metropolitan Force and his various enemies such as Sir Charles Voisey and Inspector Wetron of Bow Street.Someone is blowing up London with dynamite. Can Pitt stop it in time?In the background, shadowy Parliamentary wrangling takes place to introduce laws that could be perverted to make the aristocrats vulnerable to blackmail.Charlotte's great aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, and Tellman have exciting roles in the story.Victor Narraway also becomes a slightly more interesting character as well.I thought this was the best of the recent Thomas and Charlotte Pitt stories and commend it to you."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Deeply resonant with just a hint of British about it, Michael Page's voice is perfectly suited to this Victorian thriller. Listeners may tend to think that history does indeed repeat itself as they find London at the mercy of terrorists and police corruption.When intrepid, intelligent Thomas Pitt is called to immediately report to Long Spoon Lane, he has no idea of the mayhem he'll find. Unknown parties, anarchists in all probability, have set off bombs that destroy modest homes and kill the innocent. Very quickly, almost in the opening segments, two of the bombers are caught, and one shot.As if this carnage weren't enough Pitt soon discovers that the police are more than corrupt, and the worst of that lot may be Inspector Wettron. Working all the angles, Wettron is attempting to push legislature that would give the police even more power.In order to destroy this cabal Pitt needs wit, wisdom, and all the help he can get. \\"Long Moon Street\\" is an intriguing listen for those who favor historical thrillers.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I usually love Anne Perry Books. I eat them up as she turns them out no matter which series is published, but I couldn't wait to finish this one. It just wasn't interesting. The usual historical data was prevelant, but the mystery itself left something to be desired. Kind of boring and I was glad to be finished so that I could move on to the next book."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"This was a great Pitt novel revisiting the intrigue of the Inner Circle.

I hope the Inner Circle continues appear in the Pitt novels. - All in all a great read with high recommendations."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"This was another one of those books which I couldn't put down- to use the cliche. But I admit that this latest Charlotte and Thomas Pitt mystery had me hooked.Like the other books in this series, the plot centers on the historical and political climate of 1893. The city of London, from the highest people in society, are brought to life here, and often, unexpectedly, rub shoulders (for instance, grand dame Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould eating in the kitchen at the Pitt house). What I found truly amazing was the way in which Perry, yet again, was able to make these interactions seem ordinary.The action of this story begins in Myrdle Street, where a row of houses is blown up. The police, including Special Branch and Thmas Pitt, follow a group of men to a house in Long Spoon Lane, where a shoot out commences- ending with one dead body and an injured constable. The dead man, the son of a figure in society, appears to have been deeply involved in an anarchy plot.However, as Perry constantly proves to her readers, nothing is ever as it seems, and soon it becomes apparent that the bomb was intended for a police officer who had been involved in some localized police corruption. Pitt investigates and finds that this corruption stretches to all levels of the police force- all the way up to Commander Wetron of the Bow Street Police Force, where Pitt worked for a time. Wetron is angling to make himself the most powerful man in England by passing several reform bills in parliament which will give police the right to search people's houses and questions their servants- with their permission. If this bill is passed, it will mean the end of personal freedom.Added into the mix is Charles Voisey, member of Parliament and former head of the Inner Circle, of which Wetron is rumored to currently be head. Unexpectedly, Voisey approaches Pitt to help him get rid of Wetron. \\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend,\\" Voisey repeats, and this statement is true of everything that happens in this excellent novel. Could Voisey be using Pitt, and then get rid of Pitt after they have vanquished Wetron?Charlotte Pitt, her sister Emily, Gracie, and Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould become involved once again in the policework- though they are constantly reminded that this is a case that is way too dangerous for them to be involved in. But the three women add wonderful perspective to the novel, and give us an excellent picture of the lives of women at varying positions in society. I thoroughly enhoyed this novel, as well as the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series, and can't wait for more from Anne Perry!"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"By the summer of 1893, the English have become concerned with the bombing activities of the Anarchists who set explosions recently in London and Paris. A tip has come into the Special Branch, whose mission is to stop terrorists, claiming a bomb is set to go off in East London. Special Branch Chief Victor Narraway and Agent Thomas Pitt rush to the area; they capture two of the bombers. A third, a parliament member's son, is killed.Pitt investigates the crime in an effort to learn who murdered the third prisoner. As he conducts an internal investigationt of the affairs of his office and the police as a whole, Pitt uncovers vast corruption with Bow Street Inspector Wetron of Bow Street seemingly as the untouchable chieftain protected by the highest levels of government. Meanwhile the media goes on a feeding frenzy demanding the arming of Bobbies and invoking patriotism insisting more power granted to law enforcement to intimidate suspected terrorists. Only a devil's deal with his enemy Sir Charles Voisey might stop Wetron from taking advantage of the public fervor, which seems to make this mastermind even more potent and deadly.Highly regarded for her terrific historical mysteries, Anne Perry may have written her most relevant late nineteenth century police procedural in LONG SPOON LANE. The story line is action-packed from the moment the two Special Branch cops race to Myrdle Street to prevent a bombing and never slows down as the hero learns how deep corruption and greed extend in the force. Charlotte, Pitt's wife, plays a lesser role than she did in SEVEN DIALS, but no one will mind as the parallels of 1893 England to modern America is uncanny.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Inspector Pitt returns for an exciting adventure in Victorian England. I won't rehash the plot others have covered. This story benefits from the strengthened relationship of Pitt with his two principal colleagues, Sergeant Tellman and Superintendent Narraway. Pitt and Tellman finally become a real team founded on mutual respect. And the rough edged Narraway softens a bit, avoiding the hackneyed nasty boss syndrome of so many police procedurals.The underlying theme of the conflict between domestic terrorism and homeland security excesses is credible, timely, and well handled here. It is also based on fact, as Anarchy was a major threat in late 19th Century Europe."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"This particular series of Anne Perry's is a long-running one and a very good one, and this particular book surpasses some of the later ones even though those were good as well. It is easy to see after reading this book why Ms. Perry is a master of her particular genre. Her books are faultless, and the suspense that she creates in her world is unrelenting. This book has enough espionage, anarchy, murder and bluffs and double bluffs to keep even the most jaded reader's interest. I cannot stress enough how good this series is, and Ms. Perry continues to get better and better. In this book we see Pitt partnered with one of his sworn enemies in order to stop full-scale police corruption. He knows all along the danger that he is in by playing this double hand, but the alternative is one that Pitt cannot let happen, so he teams up with Voisey, who he so neatly check-mated in the last book. Voisey is a very dangerous enemy to have, but Pitt adheres to the adage \\"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\\". Pitt is still working with Narraway in Special Branch, and this special group is trying to stop the deadly bombings that are occurring in London. At first glance it appears that known anarchists are responsible for these bombings, but as Narraway, Pitt and Tellman continue in their investigation, they uncover secrets and corruption that go deep into the highest echelons of the police service. But this anarachy plotline is only one of the plotlines or balls that Ms. Perry so expertly juggles. She tosses out a lot of plotlines as well as some red herrings, and then carefully brings them all in to a final, satisfactory conclusion at the end book. And she does this without dropping one ball."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"One early summer night in 1893, Victor Narraway, the head of Special Branch, awakens Thomas Pitt with an urgent message: There is a bomb threat from unknown anarchists. Racing to the scene, they find people being evacuated and explosions tearing buildings apart.Narraway and Pitt chase after fleeing suspects and end up in the tenements at Long Spoon Lane. Pitt, new to the Special Branch, feels clumsy. He finds himself in a huge gunfight and shooting at a fellow human for the very first time.Inside the building they find two live anarchists and one dead man, Lord Landsborough's only son, Magnus. It's obvious to Pitt that because of the dead man's position, the police couldn't have shot Magnus Landsborough. Did his fellow anarchists kill him? Or was it an escaping murderer who was neither a policeman nor an anarchist?When Pitt questions one of the imprisoned anarchists about the motive for the bombing, he exclaims --- with great passion and terror --- that it was in protest over the corrupt police force. His accusations of evil, vicious, greedy policemen encompass the region covered by Pitt's old station. Surely things have not gone so wrong in the year since he left? The anarchist's claim eats away at Pitt. The morality of the organization he has spent his adult life serving is at stake.While the anarchists accuse a policeman of shooting Landsborough, the police believe that a fellow anarchist was the murderer. Pitt puts himself in mortal danger in order to delve into this mystery as well as the distressing question of the corrupt police.Pitt, his wife Charlotte, and their aunt Vespasia are horrified when Lady Landsborough, the mother of the slain man, supports the move to arm policemen, allow them to question servants in secret, and permit them to search people and their homes without just cause. The proposed measures would make the police too powerful, Pitt and his family believe, and destroy the privacy of law-abiding citizens.Pitt's previous co-worker and friend, Samuel Tellman, steadfastly lays his job and life on the line to assist Pitt while Pitt's old despised enemy, Charles Voisey, appears to be his ally. However, Pitt knows that Voisey is untrustworthy and full of revenge toward Pitt. Is Voisey setting him up?There is much to love in LONG SPOON LANE. The characters are subtly many-layered. Fans of this series, with its amazingly well-drawn historical details, know the delight of time traveling back to Victorian England, while the question of police power against terrorist activity continues to be a timely theme. Unexpected plot points and well-crafted motivations enliven a plot that plods a bit at times, challenging readers as the characters engage in a few too many conversations that sometimes cover previously covered ground.Although I felt that more action would have balanced the slow parts of the story, I found LONG SPOON LANE to be an altogether intriguing and enjoyable mystery.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Anne Perry must have had some lofty goals when she began writing LONG SPOON LANE. This book deals with a Parliament thinking about giving its police force unparalleled powers to invade the privacy of its citizens, including interviewing servants without their masters' knowledge.A group of anarchists bomb a building and Thomas Pitt's Special Branch tracks them to Long Spoon Lane, where a gun battle ensues. One of the anarchists is killed in the process, apparently from inside the building. When another blast occurs, the Patriot Act of the 1890s seems to be a foregone conclusion.Thomas Pitt enlists the age of an old adversary, Sir Charles Voisey, to argue against the bill in Parliament. Voisey's enemy, Inspector Wetron of Bow Street, is the head of the Inner Circle, a group of corrupt policemen, politicians, and businessman who work together to achieve political power. Voisey was formerly the head of the Inner Circle and wants revenge against Wetron. Charlotte doesn't trust Voisey, but Pitt has no choice than to work with him.Charlotte's great Aunt Vespacia is also involved as the dead anarchist was the son of a former romantic interest, Lord Landsborough. She had helped to thwart Voisey in a precious episode.What hurts the book is the constant repetition. With Charlotte; Aunt Vespacia; Narraway, the head of Pitt's Special Brance; Voisey; and Pitt's old colleague from Bow Street Tellman involved, Perry is constantly having one character explain things to another character. The reader already knows and the pace is slowed considerably. Thomas Pitt also seems to have more lives than the proverbial cat; he avoids life-threatening situations with improbable regularity.It's been awhile since I've read one of the Thomas Pitt/Charlotte series, but Gracie, the Pitt's maid still lights up the stage whenever she appears. Tellman is courting her, so that gives Perry a reason to bring her on. She has a heavy Cockney accent, but she adds comic relief.LONG SPOON LANE is twenty-fourth in the series, getting a bit long in the tooth. Perhaps an episode with Gracie as the central character would add a bit of spice."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Having caught a second wind, Perry continues what she started in Seven Dials by taking familiar characters to new and exciting places (psychologically speaking.) She's really revitalized the series. However, I wonder if she's switched editors with this one, and for the worse. I noticed a large number of typos and either clunky or downright erroneous wordings that never existed in the previous Pitt novels. It was distracting enough for me to knock one star off my review."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I'm not sure how she does it, but Anne Perry always seems to be able to deliver a Thomas & Charlotte Pitt installment that's absorbing, riveting and simply brimming with historical detail and ambiance. Certainly very few can write so intelligently and capably and also imbue the characters they create (whether they are the chief protagonists or not) with so much depth, strengths and frailties so that it is not only easy for one to empathise with them, but they often feel almost lifelike. And the wonderful simplicity with which the often intricate plot always comes together! Need I gush on?In \\"Long Spoon Alley\\" Pitt once again finds himself coming up against the Inner Circle (a secret organisation that thirsts for complete and absolute power). When his work with the Special Branch brings him face to face with police corruption. And even though he's no longer part of the Metropolitan Police Force, the charge of corruption to the institution still cuts him to the quick. So that in spite of the danger to him and his family, Pitt is determined to bring down these corrupt policemen -- never mind that they're part of the Inner Circle! Fortunately for Pitt he has the able help of his one time assistant, Sergeant Tellman and his superior at the Special Branch to rely on -- and of course the unofficial assistance of wife, Charlotte and Lady Vespasia. It's the ultimate battle between good and evil, and Pitt is determined to win...It's been a while since I've read an \\"unputdownable\\" and \\"Long Spoon Alley\\" definitely was one. From the very first page, when the bomb goes off through the succeeding chapters where Pitt realises that he's battling powerful and ruthless men with an agenda to the very last page where Pitt prevails almost against all odds, you could feel the tension and the suspense. I'll readily admit that I was totally impressed with the manner in which Anne Perry was able to maintain the tension and suspense without once losing ground. Surely that must be one of the trademarks of an excellent storyteller. I was also impressed with the fact that \\"Long Spoon Alley\\" dealt with some of the same issues that we're coming face to face with today: the loss of privacy and the call for increased powers to law enforcement, and thought that the author dealt with these issues in an intelligent and sensitive manner. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can recommend it as a completely riveting and terrifically suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"The first comment that I must make on this book is that one of the lines on the back cover by \\"Booklist\\" review, is the most spot on that I've ever seen. It says \\" Like reading Thackeray edited by Elmore Leonard\\" and that statement is exactly right...wish I'd thought of it! In Victorian London, former Superintendent Thomas Pitt has now been seconded to the Special Branch, to deal with the growing threat of anarchy. It's a sideways move for him as he has run foul of the corrupt Inspector Wetron of Bow Street. For the most part, the anarchists are well meaning but misguided young men who are convinced that all authority is corrupt, especially that of the police. They are encouraged in these beliefs by unscrupulous officials who are seeking to feather their own nests and to follow their own agendas by urging these poor, deluded young men to acts of violence and public terror. Pitt and his old adversary, Sir Charles Voisey, call a temporary truce to get to the centre of the ring of corrupt police, who are financing their terrorist attacks. The story bears a frightening similarity to todays' state of alarm (not with any polce connection), and is a grippeing and absorbing read."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I've been annoyed for some time -- for the past dozen volumes in this generally first-rate series set in London of the 1880s and \`90s -- that the author had served her readers so poorly by inventing the Inner Circle, a secret society trying to take control of Great Britain. The conspiracy became a deus ex machina upon which Perry could blame anything, which removed the necessity of proper plot construction, and Pitt stopped being a cop and became a secret agent, a sort of ur-Bond, in the employ of Special Branch. Sir Charles Voisey, the head of the Inner Circle, especially, was presented as the personification of melodramatic evil -- Snidely Whiplash with a nice house, servants, and a carriage. Pitt (and his boss, Narraway) orchestrated Voisey's fall from power, in any case, and in this somewhat wild-eyed volume, Voisey's rival, Superintendent Wetron, spins his own conspiracy: A group of anarchists (read \\"terrorists\\") are accused (justly) of blowing up houses and (unjustly) callously killing civilians. Wetron's motive is to ensure passage of an Act of Parliament giving the police greatly increased firepower, as well as enormous stop-and-search powers and the authority to enter private homes and ask any questions they like. \\"Snatched from the headlines,\\" as they say. (I imagine Perry is no fan of the present U.S. neocon administration.) The immediate result is to push Pitt and Voisey into a grudging and very suspicious partnership in order to defeat the bill, each for his own reasons. That part of the story is quite well done in its depiction of the very opposite characters of the two men -- and Perry makes up for the unbelievability of much of the rest of the plot by rather decisively killing off the entire Inner Circle conspiracy at the end. Ya-hoo!"},{"Title":"Brocks Biology of Microorganisms","review":"This is hands down the best general microbiology textbook on the market. Below, I'll explain why. (And I will also defend the book against some of the more ridiculous comments):1) Let's be honest. Some students who read textbooks aren't too bright or motivated. So you should completely ignore ANYBODY who says the book was worthless. He/She was probably frustrated with the class they were in, and blamed the prof, their TA, the book, and life in general for getting a bad grade or having a bad time. Common sense tells us that a book that has gone through 11 editions is way above average. Most textbooks don't make it past the 1st or 2nd ed.2) This book is not meant to delve into excruciating detail. While the book does contatin a LOT of detail on some topics, most aren't that detailed. The reason is because it's an introductory text. If you want more information, then buy a book that focuses on that one area. So, criticisms that say the book was \\"too general\\" are silly.3) The book does a great job of overviewing every possible topic under the sun related to microbiology. The book covers basic cell biology, foundations of microbiology, molecular biology, diversity, metabolism, immunology, pathogenesis, disease, and even a little biotechnology.4) It's true that the book could be organized a little better. In particular, it's frustrating to have to flip back and forth between chapters on metabolic diversity and prokaryotic diversity. However, I can't really suggest a better way to do it.5) As an undergrad, I used this book in two different courses, and enjoyed it both times. As a grad student, I still find myself referring back to it on occasion.In summary, if you're looking for a good introductory text to microbiology, you're not going to find anything better than this."},{"Title":"Brocks Biology of Microorganisms","review":"This book works just as well as the 12th edition.

Brock fails on all counts.For example, are methanogens Archaea, Bacteria or Eukarya, or are they some combination of the above? Brock assures us that many are \\"prokaryotes.\\"The methanogens are discussed in three widely-separated chapters. In the first we learn that their substrates include hydrogen and formate. In the second we learn that their substrates are carbon dioxide, methanol and acetate. In the third we learn that they are a major source of atmospheric methane, except of course in termite hindguts, where acetogenesis is much more important.Nowhere is there a clear distinction of energy sources, electron acceptors and carbon sources in microbial metabolism. Nowhere are the environmental factors which determine microbial ecology (redox potentials, nutrient sources) even mentioned. Nowhere is methane even mentioned as a greenhouse gas.Nowhere is there a clear distinction among electron transport mechanisms in the Archaea, the Bacteria and the Eukarya. The most fundamental discoveries in modern biology are buried beneath a mass of interesting but largely irrelevant facts which appear to be inherited, piecemeal, from the first ten editions of this archaic and truly worthless textbook.But let's give the authors and publisher of this $140.00 internet-enabled-copyright-2006 textbook their due.

I was curious when I saw the book at Amazon, and I bought it.This is an outstanding book, and it easy for me to see why it is a Pulitzer Prize winner. The book is as much about the Roosevelt administration and related national and international history as it is about Messrs. Roosevelt & Hopkins. One of the interesting things about this book is that it was written in 1947;I reminded myself of that throughout my reading. For the most part it is written in the first person by Robert Sherwood, a gifted author who worked with Hopkins while in the Roosevelt administration. I gave a lot of credibility to the book because of the author's proximity to Hopkins and Rooseveltas well as the short time span between the actual events and the publishing of the book.The book is well written by a man that had substantial prior experience in writing show business type material. In a number of instances the author puts himself on the scene of events, but by no means limits the book to his experiences with Roosevelt & Hopkins. There is considerable detail...sometimes when I read a review that makes that claim I suspect that I will encounter much minutiae with boredom to follow. Not the case here; there are many interesting explanitions, facts, discussions, etc. I found myself continuously engaged as some of the most compelling history of the U.S. unfolded at the hands of the author."},{"Title":"Roosevelt and Hopkins - An Intimate History (Revised Edition)","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school in 1952. For several years I had been captivated by politics and political biography, reading everything I could get my hands on. Sherwood's ROOSEVELT AND HOPKINS was the best. In the more than half century since, my passion for political writing and biography has continued unabated, and on many occasions I have recommended this book to others. Since 1991 I have traveled to Russia dozens of times and frequently recommend this book to English speaking Russian academics and politicians there. Every person to whom I have recommended it, here or in Russia, has seen fit to tell me how much they appreciated the book and the recommendation. Recently I began to wonder though. Was the book really as good as I recalled it from my first and only reading over 58 years ago? So I re-read it. It stood the test of time and of memory. It was even better than I recalled.

But Sherwood's biography of Hopkins reveals an equally obvious intent to write a complete and accurate history. The result does credible homage to the man that steered the New Deal through relief efforts, war logistics & diplomacy--and to his biographer.Besides commemorating Harry Hopkins, the book covers FDR and his Presidency. But it does so by interspersing material from Hopkins's personal papers between long quotations from secret communications (which would be embargoed for five decades nowadays) and the author's own experience of principle players & events. The result is a bit long & more tedious than the source from which the technique was borrowed, Churchill's history of WWII. Still, his insider's look at the Roosevelt White House provides insight that is available nowhere else. There are errors, inevitable in a work this comprehensive; Sherwood took responsibility by correcting & documenting them in the second edition, except for one. He has Roosevelt leaving Boston's Back Bay to give a speech at the Boston Arena, which is in the Back Bay. But such errors are niggling. This is an indispensible work for anyone who wants to know what Roosevelt, Hopkins, Churchill, De Gaulle & Stalin did and said--and how they interacted. It makes Stalin's post-war policy clear: \\"Never again,\\" and Stalin was going to make sure of it, by any means necessary. It also explicitly points out the weakness of the U. S.

It certainly is, but as such it leaves something to be desired, being neither an astute historical document nor much of a biography of Hopkins, and overstuffed at that.However, that said it is still a very valuable book. Sherwood, who was one of Roosevelt's speechwriters, chose to use Hopkins' wartime notes as the basis for his narrative, fleshing it out with his, Sherwood's, own recollections of the Roosevelt Administration. It's not the best-written book, not a balanced history nor a thorough biography -- but as a historical resource, Hopkin's notes are priceless, and it also has significant value as a memoir of the Roosevelt White House.

It is by far better than the Roll book. First of all, Sherwood is an incredibly good writer, and since he was there for many of the events, he can offer his viewpoint and opinions. Also, when he discusses Hopkin's life before 1940,he ties formative events to their later impacts. Finally, because HH was also a good writer, it is enjoyable and fascinating to read almost complete reports that HH wrote.Not only did Sherwood have access to all of HH's papers, but he also interviewed numerous people involved in the events and gives us their first-hand accounts. It reads like a novel and is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Roosevelt and Hopkins - An Intimate History (Revised Edition)","review":"Selon la revue Foreign Affairs, Roosevelt and Hopkins: An Intimate story est un des meilleurs livres sur la diplomatie am&eacute;ricaine, publi&eacute; il y a plus de 50 ans. En effet, ce livre est un incontournable pour tous ceux qui sont int&eacute;ress&eacute;s &agrave; la Deuxi&egrave;me Guerre mondiale et aux trois grands, Roosevelt, Churchill et Staline. Et c'est dans l'ombre du Pr&eacute;sident Roosevelt que se distingue un personnage d\`exception : Harry Hopkins. Ami intime et confident de Roosevelt, cet homme, apr&egrave;s avoir &eacute;t&eacute; un des grands architectes du New Deal, a r&eacute;ussi discr&egrave;tement pendant toute la guerre &agrave; &eacute;tablir et &agrave; maintenir l'alliance entre les trois grands alli&eacute;s, un v&eacute;ritable tour de force. Hopkins connaissait, comprenait et aimait Roosevelt et lui &eacute;tait enti&egrave;rement d&eacute;vou&eacute;. Il r&eacute;sidait &agrave; la Maison - Blanche et faisait partie de la famille. Homme d'action, il savait actualiser les pens&eacute;es du Pr&eacute;sident rapidement. Premier &eacute;missaire am&eacute;ricain aupr&egrave;s de Churchill et de Staline, Hopkins gagna et conserva leur confiance par sa sinc&eacute;rit&eacute; et l'&eacute;nonc&eacute; direct de sa pens&eacute;e; Churchill le surnomma amicalement Lord Root of the matter .L'auteur de ce livre, Robert E. Sherwood, &eacute;crivain reconnu pour ses pi&egrave;ces de th&eacute;tre et ses sc&eacute;narios de film (trois prix Pulitzer et un Oscar) se joignit d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but de la guerre &agrave; l'&eacute;quipe de r&eacute;daction des discours de Roosevelt sous la direction de son ami Hopkins. Il nous permet d'entrer dans la Maison Blanche et de vivre des moments imp&eacute;rissables par son style vivant et imag&eacute;. Sherwood a eu l'avantage d'tre le premier &agrave; avoir acc&egrave;s aux archives de Hopkins imm&eacute;diatement apr&egrave;s sa mort en 1946 et de pouvoir interviewer &agrave; chaud les principaux acteurs. Paru en 1948, son livre donnait une premi&egrave;re appr&eacute;ciation de l'activit&eacute; intense qui r&eacute;gnait autour de ceux qui d&eacute;cidaient de la vie de millions de personnes. &Eacute;crit &agrave; la premi&egrave;re personne, ce livre tient &agrave; la fois de la narration, de la biographie, de l'histoire et de la collection de documents, car on y trouve verbatim de larges extraits des comptes rendus de Hopkins au sujet des grandes conf&eacute;rences (Placentia Bay, Casablanca, Qu&eacute;bec,T&eacute;h&eacute;ran, Yalta), de ses rencontres avec les autorit&eacute;s civiles et militaires &eacute;minentes, des extraits de sa correspondence ou des discours du Pr&eacute;sident. Le compte rendu de sa derni&egrave;re rencontre avec Staline et Molotov &agrave; la demande expr&egrave;s de Truman suite &agrave; l'&eacute;chec de la conf&eacute;rence de San Francisco (1945) demeure m&eacute;morable.

NOT IN THIS CASE. This is the lovely exception, signature dishes from a great restaurant that are replicable by competent home cooks. And, these are clever, inventive dishes that make the most out of their combination of ingredients. Underneath it all is the soul of farmstead cooking overlaid with imagination and professionalism. The best chef cookbook I've seen in a long time."},{"Title":"Not Afraid of Flavor: Recipes from Magnolia Grill","review":"I got this book because Magnolia Grill is a favorite restaurant. It's a gorgeous book with incredible photographs, but after seeing the authors of the Food Network the other night I am inspired to get it dirty in the kitchen. The recipes they cooked on the air were not terribly complicated and they looked yummy. I particularly like the Barkers' advice to break the rules and adapt the recipes to your own tastes and to what fresh ingredients are available."},{"Title":"Not Afraid of Flavor: Recipes from Magnolia Grill","review":"I'm a recent transplant from New York and have been spoiled rotten by its hundreds of cutting-edge restaurants and innovative chefs. But I have to tell you, the Barkers and Magnolia Grill are right up there. As a rule, I find chef cookbooks beyond the capabilities of the average-- or even the advanced-- home cook. NOT AFRAID OF FLAVOR is the exception. Not only are its recipes inviting, they're approachable. Moreover the story of the Barkers and their Durham, NC restaurant is warm and appealing. Thanks to the Barkers (not to mention several other local chefs they've mentored), this red-clay country is no gastromic wasteland. Even my New York City friends are impressed. I've given NOT AFRAID OF FLAVOR to half a dozen of them and they're as impressed by the cookbook as they are by the cooking they sampled at Magnolia Grill.

But while Naomi Novik has now produced six novels about Napoleonic warfare with dragons:His Majesty's Dragon,Throne of Jade,Black Powder War,Empire of Ivory,Victory of Eagles, andTongues of Serpents, Mike Resnick has yet to produce the promised follow up to American Revolutionary warfare with dragons:Dragon America.Of the twoDragon Americais the more realistic, if it is proper to use that word in connection with novels about dragons, because in it the dragon is just another animal, albeit an animal with many militarily useful abilities, something like about as intelligent as a dog or a horse. Unfortunately this greater realism substantially reduces the \\"fun\\", and dragon fanciers in particular, used to the intellectual equals dragons are portrayed as in most dragon rider fiction, are likely to be disappointed, maybe even appalled at what is done to what is just another animal in this universe.The novel begins cleverly with a Historical Note about the controversy aroused when \\"a science fiction writer named Robert A. Heinlein wrote a rigorously extrapolated novel entitled 'Mammal America'\\" speculating upon how history might have turned out if European settlers in North America had \\"found themselves surrounded by the same mammalian ecology that existed throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa\\". The result was books and more books, documentaries, and \\"more than one fistfight\\" among \\"otherwise sedate scholars\\".For reasons not entirely made clear (the lack of French intervention?) the American Revolution is going much more badly for the Americans in this universe, badly enough that Daniel Boone has been sent by George Washington to try and recruit some Indian allies. Unfortunately, the number of braves they are willing to spare would not be enough to alter the war's outcome. However, the Shawnee chief's eldest son suggests an alternative: seeking out the great and terrible dragons of legend that they've all heard stories about in the far west, so this they do. Meanwhile General Washington is experimenting with making military use of the much smaller and weaker local dragons, including even of imaginary dragons.Resnick has offered some truly fascinating ideas about what a realistic Dragon Ecology, with dragons filling most of the ecological niches filled by mammals in our universe, would look like and how they could be made use of by man for military or other purposes. Unfortunately in the process he has considerably reduced their military usefulness in comparison with \\"normal\\" dragon rider fiction, to the point that the scheme by which dragon heavyweights are finally brought to bear would make Rube Goldberg blanch and be almost impossible to duplicate. The focus on half a dozen main characters, many of them historical figures, in four essentially separate narratives hinders reader identification. You will be more intrigued by the concept than swept away by the story. The final paragraph reads:\\"This was the first time that the dragons of America played a major role in history. It would be far from the last.\\"Actually, given their limitations and the difficulties involved, I'm thinking it WOULD be the last, which might explain the lack of a sequel.Note: if you find yourself intrigued by the idea of Napoleonic or American Revolutionary warfare with dragons, how about American Civil War naval action...with magic?Land of Mist and Snow"},{"Title":"Dragon America (v. 2)","review":"It's a decent read, with Resnick's usual bantering conversations between interesting characters, in this case including historical people. There are some glaring editorial/plot errors. For example, earlier in the book Tall Mountain is clearly described as too large to ride a Blue Nimble, so he has to ride a Landwagon instead; yet later in the book there he is riding a Blue Nimble. And there are a couple of inconsistencies in the military side of things as well. These are things that a good editor would have caught--I'm not familiar with this publisher (Phobos Impact). So these were distractions that made me stop in the middle of the story and say \\"Wait a minute\\" and flip back to reread what came before. But aside from that, the story itself was well done, the concept interesting, and overall an enjoyable read from one of my favorite authors, albeit more on the light side."},{"Title":"Dragon America (v. 2)","review":"George Washington sends Daniel Boone to the Ohio wilderness where the frontiersman is to seek his adopted father Chief Blackfish to enlist the Shawnee to the American cause against the British. However, Blackfish is irate with his \\"son\\" for escorting settlers onto Shawnee lands; in fact Daniel is banned from the tribal lands. Still the brave frontiersman feels he must make the effort and accompanied by only his minuscule dragon Banshee ventures onto Shawnee territory.When Daniel arrives at Blackfish's camp, he finds British colonial loyalist Simon Ginty advising the chief. Daniel requests a thousand warriors, but a reluctant Blackfish offers a couple of hundred. Instead his son Gray Eagle provides Daniel with a counter suggestion that they head further west to the land of the giant dragons and tame these potential weapons of mass destruction to use against Cornwallis' army. Boone agrees and the two men accompanied by escaped Indian slave Pompey journey to the land of the giant dragons.The structure of the wonderful alternate history DRAGON AMERICA is actually four interrelated novellas that flow brilliantly together to enable the audience to feel events including believing mythical creatures are genuine. The above paragraphs only relate the beginning of the book of Daniel, but are followed by fabulous entries starring George Washington, Pompey's book and Ephram Eakins (working on training a different dragon breed). Mike Resnick shows why he is one of the best fantasists writing today as he adds dragons to the Revolutionary War and makes his book seem like a thrilling historical fiction as much as a fantasy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dragon America (v. 2)","review":"This is a great read, especially for fans of Naomi Novik's Temeraire series. Having Daniel Boone and George Washington in the book made for interesting reading at times. The book is hilarious at times, but is shorter than the books I usually read.Unfortunately, the great fire-breathing dragons Daniel Boone uses at the end to help stop the British are more reminicent of Godzilla smashing through Tokyo, than anything from Dungeons and Dragons. All in all, it's a good book, but it could have been fleshed out more."},{"Title":"Dragon America (v. 2)","review":"I haven't finished reading yet, but I have found myself very distracted by already mentioned plot errors. I don't normally let these kinds of things bother me, when Jean-Luc goes home everyone speaks with an British Accent because making English the official language helped to eliminate regional dialects. I enjoy letting myself get lost in a story. But these errors are noticeable and distracting. After the aforementioned errors, Resnick drops a pun that ignores the fact that the characters should be speaking Shawnee.I find Resnik's writing style a little juvenile as well."},{"Title":"Dragon America (v. 2)","review":"\\"[This is an] incredibly interesting story-and alternate world-that Resnick has constructed...[the] first novel of a promising new series [with] an engaging and personable style.\\"- Romantic Times On Dragon America\\"Dragon America is a fun, light read, ideal for reading by the pool whileenjoying those last few weekends of summer weather.\\"- SFREVU on Dragon America\\"[Daniel Boone] never had to face dragons....until this came along.\\"The American Revolution is not going well.

For example, it states that the Lewis and Clark Expedition discovered a water passage to the Pacific.

Strike. She has been a soloist for Benny Hinn. Strike.However, I have been trying lately to appreciate those with something to say who have personal experience but who do not have formal education in the area on which they write. In that spirit of magnanimity, I read FAST YOUR WAY TO BETTER HEALTH. So I will discuss briefly what may be seen by many as a flaky, fringe, unnecessary activity.Fasting was certainly done habitually throughout history, and for many spiritual reasons: for repentance, for prayer, for deeper communion with God. Jesus certainly took it for granted that his disciples fasted:\\"And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\\"-Matthew 6:16-18It's a \\"whenever,\\" not an \\"if\\". Fasting also gets plenty of play in Acts and the Pauline epistles. Additionally, many great figures in the church wrote expounding the merits of fasting: Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, etc.Bueno-Aguer fixates on Mark 9:29, and it becomes her central verse for the spiritual power of fasting: \\"[Jesus] said to them, 'This kind (of demon) can come out only through prayer {and fasting}.'\\" The \\"and fasting\\" here is one of those lovely bits that is in some ancient manuscripts, but not all of them, and not in the predominant ones. I am in no way suggesting that this is not valid as scripture, because there is an abundance of corroboration elsewhere, but as a scholar I am beholden to point it out.It is interesting to me that fasting is utterly neglected in the modern church. When are fasts done? When are fasts discussed? The 30 Hour Famine is the only thing that leaps to mind, and that's such a short time it hardly captures the spirit. A good place to start, perhaps, but we need to move well beyond that.I myself have found fasting (I refer to my own experiences: at least 72 hours on water only) to be beneficial. It is helpful for self-mastery, for strengthening the will and increasing self-discipline. It also helps to put one in mind of those on earth who deal with hunger regularly, and not by choice.Most interesting in this book is a claim I had not previously heard: that fasting can alleviate and even cure colds, as well as chronic, incurable, and even terminal diseases. Logically, it makes sense: the body spends a great deal of energy on almost constant digestion. When the digestive system is temporarily shut down, the body uses this energy for healing and to rid itself of accumulated toxins. Bueno-Aguer experienced this. Additionally, the book contains a large number of testimonials. This book does not have the scientific evidence to support these claims, but I am certainly open to these ideas.FAST YOUR WAY TO HEALTH does a pretty fair job of debunking people's lame excuses not to fast. It also contains ways to go about fasting, suggestions for how to do it, and how to come off it and what one should ideally eat afterward.In conclusion, Americans are absolute gluttons. The first time I really realized that was when I went to India. The second time was the first time I did a three-day fast. We eat too much, too often, and we eat absolute garbage. And we do not fast because we are mentally weak.I have had enough of mental weakness. I am sick of it.For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law--indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh-- for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, 'Abba! Father!' it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ--if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.-Romans 8:5-17Christians, I think, need to rediscover fasting for a lot of reasons. To me, fasting is like the Levitical dietary law, which science has revealed is nutritionally quite strong. Is it not logical for God to ordain an activity that is both spiritually and physically beneficial?RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Fast Your Way To Health","review":"This book has some useful information on fasting and natural hygiene, but I found it extremely difficult to read through the book to get to it.

Gone are the days of \\"working\\" at pleasuring one another or having to control the pleasure level so ejaculation doesn't occur. Since my husband starting doing the Key Sound it is easier for me to stop focusing on a completion point and enjoy the pleasure. By doing so I am able to prolong my orgasms so they are a slower build with stronger intensity. They last longer and the pleasure of the previous oragasm builts onto the next orgasm, taking the effort out of our lovemaking. Orgasms now have a wave pleasure build versus the sharp peak and valley oragasms I experienced without the Key Sound. By doing this method we are able to enjoy one another as long as we want! - and that can be for 1/2 an hour or a few hours, either way it is always fulfilling.My husband starting practicing the Key Sound first and introduced it to our lovemaking. Even though some might think making a Key Sound during lovemaking is a little unconventional, I find it is a great enhancement to the moans that are already being made. The Key Sound has enabled us to create a common pleasure place where \\"reaching\\" for an orgasm no longer exists. Instead we are actively building on one another's pleasure which makes us feel we have a more intimate understanding of one another. As an added bonus, that intimacy flows through every other aspect of our relationship greatly enhancing our communication with one another.Not only am I amazed with the audio seminar, I am also impressed with the level of support and information Jack Johnston offers through his web site. Jack and the community of people that are helping one another is unlike any other. The support, honesty and help with each person's personal journey is something to be admired. Along with learning this great simple method through the audio seminar we also were able to get additional free help through the website.I HIGHLY recommend Jack Johnston's seminar to everyone! It is truly a gem that can help people in so many different ways - from pure plesure to becoming more intimate. My hats off to Jack and his incredible method!"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"This will be a short review, since there are plenty of good comments here about the method itself.However, a lot of the reviews here are saying things like, \\"I tried Tao and Tantra and x and y and none of it worked, but this did...\\" etc. I just wanted to tell people who _do_ actually like those other Taoist and Tantric approaches that you'll still get something out of this one. Personally I practice Tao and Karezza-style sacred sex with techniques from books like:The Tao of Sexology: the Book of Infinite WisdomEnergy-Karezza: How To Make Every Wife Sexually Wild About Her Husband: Fascinating And Powerful Sex For Marital Fidelity And BlissTaoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy... etc. And I'm very happy with it, from the spiritual point of view and from the energetic and sexual point of view. However I still enjoyed learning Johnston's way and using it together with those others. It all works harmoniously absolutely fine, and the different ways seem to me to support one another really well.Anyone who knows these practices will be aware that the bliss and beauty can reach indescribable heights. I do seriously wonder why more people aren't involved in this. I wish the whole world could experience it. And if you practice any form of meditation, energy work, etc., it is such a boon -- your power and self-acceptance goes through the roof, and kundalini is only a short step away when you are ready, with the right method. This is real human living.One more comment. If you read this book:Energy Work: The Secret of Healing and Spiritual Development... which is more general (not only addressing sex), you will find more stuff which is compatible as well, and it will help you move towards using the Johnston method without vocalizations if that interests you.I wish you bliss and joy!"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"I discovered Jack's work about 18 months ago whilst going through a low period in my sex life. It is no exaggeration that Jack's work has caused me to totally re-map what I thought the male experience of sex and sensuality was about.In this seminar, Jack introduces a new approach to investigating sexual response in terms of excitement and arousal. The seminar describes a series of simple techniques to allow you to 'tune in' to your own responses and through practice, foster a deeper experience of sexual arousal to the point that the conventional 'conditioned' routes of sexual response give way to something deeper; far deeper. Not only a richer experience, but vastly more satisfying. It moves far beyond a 'technique' based approach to 'better orgasms' - it describes the opening to a pathway of great self-discovery.I have found this seminar and the resources that Jack maintains online to support his work have helped me to regain and far surpass my expectations and hopes in my sex life.If you are thinking of investing time and energy into enriching your approach to sex and sexuality, I do not think I could recommend this resource more highly.Best wishes"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"I was discussing with an ex of being able to enjoy sex for extended periods of time(you can guess why she is an ex). We talked about classes one could take, a few book titles and the next thing we know this MMO tittle came up. Her former boyfriend had taken the seminar, and she remembers how good their sex had improved. For the money of a dinner date, I thought it may be worth trying. The free weekly forum, where this author and his monitors answer questions you may have to successfully learn the protocol, and improve or intensify your experience.I started my orgasmic experiences after two weeks. I am told by the author that I was quick/early. I strongly recommend setting your pace and not rushing or expecting the orgasms.(remember being anxious with your partner, and the sex ending soon) Instead, learning to be...less. Follow his CD and do take advantage of his free forum. If you here the CD once or twice and be in the forum once or twice, don't get frustrated. Your body might need more preparation than others. Like in all things, persistence pays. And, for God's sake don't be a drop out and blame it on the Professor or the college! It's like for the money of a dinner date(albeit inexpensive) you get a semester long class, without the pressure of the finals. Although, if you need all the GEDs the Author(through his forum) could have the patience:)I was able to find that our(male) bodies are capable of multiple orgasms. That we are able to separate our orgasms from ejaculation. That we may have more than one orgasm during a sex session with our lover/spouse. A key sound is introduced to trigger the body memory to realize our body's orgasmic capability. It's use helps us intensify the levels of orgasms. It's up to us, how soft or loud we'd want to express the key sound. The key sound may or may not be used or needed, during sex with your partner or doing solo sex. While most sex/tantra teachings include some form of breath work, the key sound he found through iterative process and his observance of natural phenomena, does that more easily.You should be able to look forward learning a life long skill that brings healthy outlook towards your partner or give you confidence with your new one.

He had always wondered, somewhat wistfully, about women's potential to enjoy multiple orgasms or orgasms that seemed so much deeper and longer than males. After browsing Amazon I came across Jack Johnston's seminar which seemed to offer just what he was hoping for but without years of meditation and uncomfortable squeeze techniques. Too good to be true? Intrigued I got the cd but thought I'd check it out before passing it on to my husband.I listened with an open mind and no real expectations but my goodness - I had NO IDEA how much this seminar was about to change both our lives!!!! For starters I had never realised before that orgasm and ejaculation are two separate things in a man. Wow - why was this vital piece of infomation never written about in all the women's magazines I'd read? Its because FEW people, men as well as women understand the distinction. Just gaining this one simple fact was empowering. Ejaculation effectively signals the end of any male orgasm.Johnston has discovered a unique way of using a sound, which he calls the Key Sound to bypass the ejaculation response. The Key Sound ENHANCES your sexual arousal triggering a non-ejaculatory orgasm that does not result in loss of energy.AND IT WORKS FOR WOMEN TOO!!! It seemed such a simple technique that I tried it and almost instantly discovered that using the Key Sound triggered gorgeous pleasure waves that were sweeter and more refreshing than my regular feelings. Not that there's anything wrong with those but now I had an extended orgasm repetoir!Encouraged I gave the cd to my husband. Within a few days he had significantly increased his levels of sexual and physical sensitivity. It did take him a few weeks to fully achieve the results that he desired but the fun and freedom that we have both gained through this method have enhanced every area of our lives. Our communication in all areas flourishes. I can believe that we can both enjoy a full and satisfying sexual life together into our old age and that's some way off yet!The cost of purchase doesn't just get you the seminar cd. At no extra cost you have access to Johnston's online website which provides invaluable information and an extremely interesting forum for discussion on all aspects of the technique. We've both found this to be enormously supportive and useful during the learning process. You can even get FREE online coaching!! Very good value I'd say. Johnston comes across as very genuine and sincere in his desire to help others.I would certainly recommend this to others - and I have!!!"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"Jack Johnson's MMO audio cd really expands oneself beyond the physical sexual pleasure.

Reason: I bought this cd from amazon 2 years ago. I listened for about 30 minutes. The key sound was too weird and I thought the author was some looney guy (sorry Jack). Then I rechecked all reviews and found that all good reviewers had only one review that for this cd. It helped plant further doubts about this multiple orgasm technique and I threw the cd away.Yesterday while going through my old cds I came across the MMO cd again. For the heck of it, I listed to it completely. Yesterday evening I lay on my bed and applied the key sound technique. On every sexual energy spike or when I was breathing heavily, I would grasp that moment, do a belly breath and use the key sound. Then on I used the key sound after every 4 - 5 breaths. 30 minutes later my entire body was tingling intensely for about 10 - 20 minutes. It was a very pleasurable feeling. I immediately wrote to Jack and asked him about questions I had. Jack replied immediately and this morning I tried the key sound technique with my girlfriend. Sure enough in about 20 - 25 minutes of using the key sound, I had not ejaculated and instead the intense tingling sensation intensified, but this time I kept going on and sure enough I arrived at the orgasmic point - only this time it was internal. The shocking thing was the orgasmic emotional point (the point of physical ejaculation) lasted not for the traditional/usual 1 millisecond but continued for minutes. The beautiful millisecond which men crave for, which happed at the point of ejaculation actually stayed for 10 - 15 minutes. A state of the highest emotional bliss I have ever experienced.After a year of trying pc muscle the barbara keesling way or the Mantek Chia way, I had reached nowhere. once or twice I had a slight experience of tingling when I had used the mantek chia's teachings of moving the sexual energy through the microcosmic orbit, but it is beyond an average person's power to control the pc muscle so as not to ejaculate.Jack Johnston key sound though sounds weird is but the one easy way to multiple orgasms. Just to clarify - Multiple orgasms are not physical ejaculations but whole body orgasms happening in succession.Two years ago I thought this key sound was so foolish. Since last evening I've realized it was just me who was for not having given this new technique a chance.In this age of tantra and other things, there is no reason why you and your partner should feel odd about trying this new technique. I am simply blown away by how simple the path to MMO has been made by this key sound technique."},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"Although the exercise that the author introduces does seem to \\"enhance\\" my sexual experience and although there is evidently a scientific basis for the ability of someone to separate orgasm from ejaculation/erection, I myself never experienced an orgasm by exclusively using this \\"breathing\\" technique---much less any \\"multiple\\" orgasms using this approach.I tried to apply the technique for about a month, and the only positive experience that I personally had was a slight \\"elongation\\" of the actual orgasmic feeling/period at the time of physical ejaculation (which is not a bad thing, of course): but I feel as though the product/author had promised more than that.If, like me, you'd never been introduced to the concept of tantric breathing (ie, using controlled breathing to impact the sexual experience), then this book may have some value for you (as it did for me---hence 2 stars and not just one).The concept is a fairly simple one (could probably be explained in 1 paragraph---not a 6-part audio \\"course\\"): if you're still interested, you might be better off reading about it at any number of online sites without having to spend money on this \\"course\\"."},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"What does this seminar offer is a natural way to bypass orgasm, and this is a whole new approach to MMO, since all books available in the market so far (including The Multi Orgasmic Man) teach you how to become multi-orgasmic by actually forcing your PC muscle not to contract, hence having dry orgasm.However, with this new method presented in the seminar, I simply learned how to skip ejaculating and focus on enjoying orgasm which lasts way longer and feels all over your body, rather than squeezing, trying to block ejaculating, that is if you're lucky to do it on time.This thing does work, and the results are simply amazing, this new discovery has simply redefined sexuality for me, I never felt so much intense orgasms all over my body, your whole body becomes one organ.Highly recommened!!"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"I purchased Jack's audio seminar three years ago and I've been on a wonderful journey of unfolding pleasures ever since. Even though I'd been recovering from an old spine injury, and suffered from chronic pain at the time, I was still able to have my first multi-orgasmic experience within three weeks of practice! Since then, I've been opening up to more and more pleasures that I never knew I was capable of. As promised, I'm able to have all the multiple orgasms I want without ANY use of ejaculation control or PC muscle squeezes, etc. Jack was right, there's NO sense of a, \\"Point of No Return,\\" whatsoever!I had studied Tantra and other methods in the past and always found them to be overly complicated and difficult to master. What Jack calls the Key Sound Multiple Orgasm Trigger or KSMO was the simple, direct approach I had been searching for. I still have yet to find anything out there like it. It was surprisingly easy to learn, but after three years of practice, I'm amazed at how much I am still discovering in my practice.I had always imagined multiple orgasms would be just like having multiple ejaculations. But the sensations I get from KSMO are so much more joyful and intense than what I had expected, and even more intense than any other I'd ever experienced before in my life! The orgasmic pleasure seems to wash over my entire body in wave after wave for several minutes at a time. I am able to remain in this state for long period of time without effort or \\"holding back.\\" Sometimes I even feel these wonderful rushes of pure joy pouring out of my heart. It's as if I'm bursting with love. At Jack's website, they call these feelings \\"Heartgasms,\\" and that's just what they feel like! It's as if my heart is having an emotional orgasm. I wish I knew how to describe this feeling in words. But it's unlike anything I've ever felt before.For me, the best thing about KSMO is how it allows me to totally relax and let go in the midst of incredible pleasure and arousal. It's just an amazing feeling to experience orgasm after orgasm without having to maintain control of my body. I can enjoy all the pleasure I want without worrying about \\"the point of no return,\\" or squeezing the right muscle at the right time.This way, I am able to be fully present with my wife when we make love. Instead of taking turns pleasuring each other and then finishing with a \\"Big Bang,\\" we share our orgasms together and ride these waves of pleasure over and over again until we feel completely satisfied. Finding satisfaction together in this way has spilled over into so many other areas of our marriage. We feel more in sync as a couple and more able to express our love for each other. I could just go on and on about all the ways KSMO has improved our lives.Whether you're a man or a woman, young or old, single or in a relationship, if you are looking for a simple way to have multiple orgasms and enjoy sex more, I highly recommend this CD! You may just find that not only does it help you learn to feel more pleasure, but also able to be more open with yourself and others."},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"I tried everything, PC squeeze techniques, Taoist meditation, Tantra, brinksmanship, NLP swish techniques, ESO etc.. &amp; thought I would never be satisfied until I found Jack Johnston's audio seminar.This has absolutely nothing to do with any of the above methods.I have no idea why it works but who cares - it's wonderful.Granted it took me a few days practice before I felt anything new and a few more weeks before I was really impressed - if I hadn't listened carefully though &amp; stuck at it man would I have missed out!I have to say in addition that when I did feel stuck in the early stages I ventured to email Jack Johnston himself &amp; I was amazed when he personally replied in great detail showing me exactly where I was missing the point &amp; guiding me towards his online forum at his website.

Although I had some surprising and encouraging success in my first few days of KS practice I had no illusions that I'd arrived at the full potential of the experience because from all accounts considerable investment in training one's body might be required to fully develop the skill. This has turned out to be true for me. But progress has been sustained and each day still brings forth new and surprising events.I can now start a session at practically any time and easily and quickly get into a sequence of orgasms of a level of intensity which far exceeds anything that I've experienced before in a long life of sexual experimentation and adventuring. Additionally, the orgasms' peaks are interspersed by involuntary surges of what Jack calls \\"echoes\\" which render, for me, feelings of ecstatic and unearthly bodily sensations many of which leave me utterly stupefied for a minute or two. The great thing is because ejaculation does not occur there is little expediture of physical energy involved and it is possible for me to effortlessly sustain a session for as long as time permits. The other day I finished an extreme three-hour session feeling as fresh as a daisy and ready to pick up where I left off, at any time.Jack's CD is well presented and easy to follow. But, as he points out, don't assume that that this skill can be achieved without dedicated practice. However, that was no problem for me because the fun and excitement started from day two and is still getting better each day.It's hard for me to believe what an unexpected and incredible enhancement the KSMMO has brought to my life. For $30! - It's a giveaway! The CD is now in a picture frame on the wall.Regarding Jack's Key Sound, I never encountered any need to \\"roar\\" it out loud and I don't think that Jack says that it's necessary to do so. In fact, in my early days of practice I would use a quiet breathy version of the sound which was entirely adequate for me. Currently I seem to have progressed beyond the the Key Sound and rarely need to use it. Criticism of the KS protocol as an essentially noisy operation seems to me to be entirely misguided. Like conventional intercourse, you can make it as quiet or as screamingly noisy as you feel inclined to do.Mog"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"I ordered Jack Johnston's seminar from Amazon.com a couple of months ago and I am already having amazing and life changing results!This training will take you thru the gate to \\"dry orgasms\\" with no ejaculation!(just the orgasm!)

This new method really works and has brought back the spark in our marriage.I am a 48 year old male entering mid life and I was looking for information about getting older and the fact that my intimate relations with my wife just have not been what it used to be.I was looking for something that may help not only myself cope with the stresses of mid life but anything to enhance both of our lives in the area of intimate relations. Since my wife just recently went through major surgery, i.e. a hysterectomy.Finding Jack Johnston's audio seminar on Male Multiple Orgasm Step by Step has been one of the best things that could of ever happend in our marriage. It has brought us close again after some very trying times.Even though the title of the seminar is (Male Multiple Orgasm Step by Step) my wife and I find that this method works equally for both of us.The audio sminar is very detailed and easy to follow. There is also a link within the seminar to Jack Johnston's web site where you will receive (free one on one coaching).I can say that we were a bit unsure at first if this method would work but to our surprise it works very well. It took us only about three weeks to begin receiving the good feelings of orgasmic bless that the seminar promises.You would never belive that just by using a soft low tone key sound would trigger waves of orgasmic pleasure that are described in the audio seminar but I can confirm that this method of achieving multiple orgasms (works) not only for me but also my wife.Rating this method I would have to give it five ***** stars and an, O MY GOD!"},{"Title":"Male Multiple Orgasm: Step-by-Step (4th Edition UPDATED for WOMEN-2007)","review":"I would like to say that Jack's program is written for both men and women as it has to do with arousal, not gender. I have practiced the Keysound and have noticed tremendous effects in my own intensity of Bliss. This program uses techniques for men without ejaculation control of any form. Everything else I have seen on Amazon.com, has been about Ejaculation control, which I believe reduces the openness of the intensity. Jack's discovery makes ejaculation control obsolete!"},{"Title":"Girls in the Grass","review":"Now that I've read Melanie Rae Thon's GIRLS IN THE GRASS, I know what's possible from truly great short stories--and there's no reason to settle for anything less.I first read one of Thon's stories, &quot;Iona Moon,&quot; in a small literary magazine a few years ago. Used to short fiction that lacked engaging plots, complex characters, and that left me ultimately dissatisfied, I was startled by Thon's sustained, narrative energy, bold characters, and lyrical prose. But there was something else that, at the time, I couldn't quite identify--now that I've read her collection, I realize that Thon is a writer with a moral vision out of which she creates characters of great vitality and vulnerability who struggle with questions of faith, guilt, power, desire, redemption, love. For me, this kind of depth and craft makes reading short fiction incredibly rewarding.A few examples--There are three best girlfriends in Thon's title story, &quot;Girls in the Grass,&quot; teasing with the pleasures and confusions of sexual desire and friendship. There's the twelve-year-old girl in the chilling story &quot;Punishment,&quot; who is haunted throughout her lifetime by her complicity in the hanging of a slave in 1858 on her family's plantation. There's the young girl in &quot;Repentence,&quot; whose resentment of her senile grandmother leads her to discover her own wickedness and desire. There's the aging male professor in &quot;Small Crimes&quot; whose clumsy seduction of a promising, younger woman poet opens up her painful, revealing past.Each story is in itself fully realized, but each gains meaning and power from its arrangement in the collection.Beautifully crafted and large in their scope and emotional complexity, Thon's stories offer readers a powerful, transforming experience."},{"Title":"Girls in the Grass","review":"The majority of stories that make up this collection by one of Granta Magazine's &quot;Top 20 American Novelists Under 40&quot; are weak and more than a little doe-eyed in comparison to the gritty, moving tale that appeared in the Granta issue. The tales that do work best all seem to feature a recurring figure at their center, the title character of Thon's later novel, Iona Moon. Given the time that a novel's length allows, Thon can transform the quaint into the unrecoverably beautiful, develop a pang into an ache, but most of these pieces don't seem to quite stand by themselves. After all of this less than complimentary talk on my part, let me say that, given the strength of the Granta piece, I definitely plan to check out her soon-to-be-released collection, &quot;First, Body&quot;"},{"Title":"Becoming Felix","review":"I liked this book.

(The rest of the practitioners follow a well-worn formula as interesting as a Danielle Steele soap.) Now along comes this book, Death of an Angel. Is it really true crime? Hey! It's about a notorious crime, but one in which the judge overruled the jury and let the perps off. What it's really about, and why everyone's talking about it, is that it gets into police work and under the carpet of the DA's office in a way that even \\"Law & Order\\" doesn't do.OK, the formulaic Date, Time, Place at the beginning of each chapter and episode seems like a cop-out -- pardon the expression -- but in this cop-heavy report full of all sorts of twists and turns it turns out to be a pleasant guide to events.This is a thoughtful read, so unusual in any crime book. In fact, I quickly forgot about the crime in following the fast-paced action of police procedural. The all-too-human reactions to this hideous event come through, but not garishly.\\"Death of an Angel\\" has so manyn things going for it I wouldn't be surprised if it found a dozen different audiences.

Let me first explain that the book was a gift and I only read it out of desperation on a long plane flight. First off, the sheer length can only be a testament to the apparent vanity of the author applauding his own cleverness, as he rambles on incessantly through pages of incorrect grammar, spelling errors, and contrived story line. Although this is \\"true crime\\" and the plot is based in fact, the book manages to lose any of the real life suspense or drama of the case and turns it into a narrative more predictable and less interesting than those concocted in a 6th grade creative writing class. Even the title reeks from maudlin undertones!

Diane Whipple was killed by two dogs.She could have died in an auto accident, a house fire or a planecrash. Not to mention mugging, serial killers, sharks, cougars, etc. The difference is that Diane Whipple *knew* that these dogslived next door. The tragedy is, IMO, that she was too nice. Frankly she should have:1) Raised hell the first time she had problems with these dogs. Police, animal control, landlord.2) If she couldn&#8217;t get satisfaction, and quickly, *she* should have moved out. It&#8217;s not fair, it&#8217;s not right, but it would have gotten her out of the way of the dogs and their idiot owners.3) She should have armed herself. That&#8217;s not PC, but if you&#8217;re going in harms way you need to take precautions. And she, through no fault of her own, was placed in harms way.The dog owners? Frankly they were too stupid to own a pet rock, let alone two powerful, dominant dogs.The law, prosecution tricks, gay rights, etc are interesting butperipheral to the heart of the matter. A woman in a potentiallydangerous situation seemed not to recognize the danger norbe able to deal with it in a realistic way. The owner of twovery large, powerful dogs apparently had the combined IQ&#8217;sof a brain damaged newt to not recognize the real danger theirdogs presented to neighbors and do something about it.A mildly interesting book, but it misses the point.worth a $1.00 at the bargain bin."},{"Title":"Crude Dreams: A Personal History of Oil and Politics in Alaska","review":"&quot;Crude Dreams&quot; is a great read.

The best character is \\"Digger\\". He's a treacherous double-dealing guy who manipulates everything without telling anyone what he's doing. There are some hilarious scenes in this book, like when the \\"sanguivor\\" is mistakenly taken to a morgue, and when a different \\"sanguivor\\" surfs across the desert on the trunk of a Rolls Royce.

If you, too, had a soft spot for these guys as a kid and just want to reminisce, this happy little book is worth your while. Author Steve Cox, the king of quickie books about those goofy old sitcoms, does his usual thorough job- at the time, all the cast members were still alive and the show was still in frequent reruns. I especially liked reading about things like the Herman Munster costume and makeup (it took two hours for Gwynne to be fitted!), the Munster Koach and Drag-ula cars (two more Kustom Kar Kreations from George Barris), and other Munster trivia. I also had no idea there was a \\"Munsters Today\\" remake; to these eyes, I'm sure Lee Ann Meriwether made a very nice Lily (she was a great Catwoman in the \\"Batman\\" movie from the '60s). I liked this book- it's, to my knowledge, the only one about the Munsters- but I sure wouldn't spend sixty bucks for it unless I was a hopeless Munster maniac.

I purchased the \\"First Family of Fright\\" book in 1989 and have enjoyed it ever since. The book is in an easy to read format, with page margins of 7/8\\". The photographs are of good quality and interesting, including the unused makeup with larger ears for Butch Patrick, some publicity shots and many behind the scenes photos. The book also provides interesting details about the Munster house exterior and how it was built in the mid-1940's with its neighbors on the Universal back lot being the Norman Bates and the Cleaver family residences. It also details Grampa's dragster, the difficulties with Herman's costume, the brief pilot episode \\"My Fair Munster\\" as well as the Munster movies. Now that I have the Munsters first season on DVD, I am referring to this book all the time. One note: there is at least one inaccuracy in the episode guide.

It is a very good and understandable book. Not over anyone's head. It clearly chronicals the past (up to 1997 of course) and gives safe, conservative direction on potentials for missions and programs that were in the pipe at the time of publication.Today is March 2011. Guess what? The book is completely valid because of the clear and simple and straight forward description of the NPOESS (originaly having the pronounceable acronym NOPESS) program directed by President Clinton in 1994 and forced into its management mess by VP Al Gore's \\"cost saving\\" National Performance Review.Just two weeks ago, Feb 2011, Space News reported on the release of the Aerospace Corp postmorem that detailed why this troubled program turned out to be the full failure that it was (it was forced closed in early 2010 following massive cost overruns and delays from the Air Force and NOAA).Page 220 of this book not only describes the program from its starting day eyes, it also very carefully states that it has the potential to end up more expensive than planned.. and says why... and that is what we see happened with our 2011 view.Page 42 foreshadows NOPESS/NPOESS with a short and sweet analysis of a very very similar expensive lesson: Landsat 7. A lesson that apparently we did not learn from.Yes, in 2011 this is still a book worth reading. These programs take a long time to plan, build and succeed or fail and those mentioned in this edition from 1997 are still in the windows and budgets of many current players.I'd buy it used though.. a beat up hard cover is just as valuable as a collectors-cost \\"new\\" one."},{"Title":"Heiress","review":"This is a story of betrayal, love and acceptance.

Thanks for sending the book in good condition as agreed and in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Heiress","review":"I read Heiress by Janet Dailey and I was moved. It kept me interested throughout the whole time. What was most interesting was the setting which is Houston, TX and I am very familiar with that setting. It's about these two girls that share the same father and one is illegitimate. Abbie Lawson is the legitimate one and she lives with her mother Babs. Rachel her half sister, was born on the same day as Abbie even though they had different mothers they were like Twins. Rachel has come to town to attend her father's funeral. There she finds out about the history of her father and his other family. Abbie is rich aristocrat who learns to be tame and down to earth while Rachel becomes self absorbed and in turn they switch places. Both of them fall in love with different men. They pursue their interest in horses which leads them to a devastating end."},{"Title":"Heiress","review":"This book was about two half-sisters with lots of rivalry and distain for one another along with their individual love of horses. One sister had her dad in the home while she was growing up and the other was his \\"love child\\" with a past mistress who grew up in a different state and saw her dad only occasionally. When the dad unexpectedly passes away, the sisters are brought together due to these circumstances and lots of drama, twists, turns, ensue. I gave the book only three stars because the author went overboard on the subject of horses. Towards the end, I thought \\"if I hear where Arabian horses originated and how they should be bred one more time.....\\" !!! The rivalry and all-encompassing hatred between the sisters also tended to be much to long and drawn out."},{"Title":"Heiress","review":"This book is great. I found it impossible to put down.

Rachel was extremely under developed and there didn't seem to be a whole lot of reason for her coldness towards everyone, including her husband. Seriously, the affairs in the novel were laughable and difficult to believe. Rachel really seemed to love Lane, and then Dailey literally stopped developing their story and only showed us how cold Rachel was. Very disappointing that she did that. There was no development between Rachel and Abbie until the very end. If I hadn't been so irritated with Rachel dying, I might have found that touching. If Dailey had focused the story fully on Abbie and her drama with Mac's, Hix, Ben, and being bankrupt the book would have been a thousand times better. Rachel's story line was an irritating distraction. Honestly, I read it only to find out Mac's reaction to Eden and find out Abbie's ending. The way Abbie broke it off with her husband was trite. Dailey's writing style is enjoyable, it's the focus and development that needs some work.

After the first few chapters, I traded the soiled, crusty copy for the more recent ereads publisher version. My first thoughts are confusion. This story is so remarkable that I can't quite understand why so few copies are in circulation. Heiress is categorized as a romance, but its so much more than that. It is a spectacular story written in a unique backdrop that offers readers an opportunity both to learn and to change their ways. One reviewer once commented that Les Miserables can teach us to want to be better people. I believe this book accomplishes the same. Its the story of two siblings who let jealousy, pride, and hatred turn into cancers that can and often destroy them. Its a lesson in itself on how pride can cause a person to knowingly sabotage him/herself in attempts to hurt others. Its also a lesson on how such negative emotions can cause a person to lose any sense of authentic perception. The plot is spectacular as well, considering that it digresses from and adds a lot more to the typical romance. There were no moments of predictability. It reads more like both a wonderful soap opera and a great piece of literature. This is the type of story you'll carry with you, and its a recommend keep for any bookshelf.SPOILER ALERTMy only disappointment in this story is that both daughters of Dean knew that Dean's love affair hurt everyone involved, yet both daughters are parties to the same actions in their own marriages. Neither one of them avoid achieving the same transgression for simple purposes that they won't let history repeat itself. With that said, maybe Dailey included such actions to show that love can win in the end While other reviewers are upset that the sisters' relationship ended as it did, I believe Dailey wrote the most appropriate ending in terms of what can be reasonable. Closure was set, and relief was brought to the siblings. No relationship as rivalrous as theirs was could truly make a 180 turn toward sincere amicability."},{"Title":"Heiress","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The passion between Abby and Mac is fantastic. I have never experienced it reading any other book. I read the book and the same day I finished it I bought it off ebay.

Polly and bishop have both been through the time gate before and have returned safely to the present. What happens when Zachary crosses over with them could end up in a tragedy. The three of them enter the past, but this time once they're there the threshold closes behind them, leaving them in the past while two tribes are fighting over the best land (The People of the Wind and The People Across the Lake). Polly and the bishop know a few of the members of the People of the Wind from their previous visits that have been filled with even more exciting adventures.

It might because it is heavily involved with druids who use their powers to travel through time gates. Polly O'Keefe is caught in the time gate so that she can easily go from her time to 3000 years ago and back again. There are some advantages to this, however: She is able to learn the ancient language of the area and communicate back then, and her grandparents get a dog that comes into their time and decides to stay as a protector and friend. On the downside, the ancient druids are seriously considering sacrificing Polly to their gods to end a drought! This all leads up to a scene with her, the local bishop, a friend called Zachary Gray, the dog, and a snake all trying to survive 3000 years before their present! This is a wonderful book, but the druids might bring some doubt to the minds of others. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a combination of realistic fiction, fantasy, and science fiction."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Polly O'Keefe, daughter of Meg Murry and Calvin O'Keefe from L'Engle's beloved A Wrinkle In Time, moves in with her maternal grandparents when the schools on remote Benne Seed Island prove inadequate for her abilities and interests. The two elderly but still active scientists supply the challenges Polly needs with their unique brand of home schooling, and their oldest grandchild savors the peace and undivided attention after a childhood spent as the oldest in a brood of seven. The calm of rural New England in autumn doesn't last, though. The Murry house sits on a spot that 3,000 years ago was considered sacred by those who lived in their valley then, and a retired Episcopal bishop who's their nearest neighbor has inadvertently opened a time gate to that era.Zachary Grey, the self-absorbed young man who appears in several earlier L'Engle books (particularly the Austin series), shares Polly and Bishop Colubra's ability to pass through the gate and to see ancient folk who make the reverse trip. When the gate closes with that unlikely trio on its other side, Polly soon finds herself revered as a goddess - and at risk, made far more deadly by Zachary's cowardly actions, of being sacrificed by tribal leaders desperate to bring their drought-stricken people rain.Of all the later L'Engle time novels, this one came closest to spinning the same magic spell for me that the first book did. It has the same wonder and excitement, but with a slightly harder edge that comes from having a slightly older and more experienced heroine. Or, perhaps, from being written for a different generation of young readers? Anyway, this not-so-young reader (I first read A Wrinkle In Time 40 years ago, at age 11) couldn't put An Acceptable Time down without finishing it. Superb, and - also like the first book - guaranteed to make you think!"},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Sheer drudgery. That's the best way to summarize the fifth in L'Engle's Time quintet. Occasionally I've found some of her work to have a slow start, so I gave it 30 pages, then 50, 150...200...surely it's got to get good sometime now... Hmmm. Though it finally began to pick up toward the end of the novel, it wasn't nearly good enough to warrant the 250-odd pages it took to get that far, much less when it's followed up with a lack luster ending. So why did I bother to finish it? I'm stubborn. If I've wasted that much of my time already, I'm darn well going to finish it! Add to that my hoping in vain that it would have some redeeming qualities...somewhere...it has to, right? After all, it was written by L'engle!As a bit of a science geek, I often enjoy the tidbits L'Engle drops in as well as how she then stretches them to the fantastic. Where was that writing in this novel? And what happened to the great character development of her other works? I found myself truly annoyed with the characters in this novel, rather than caring anything about what might happen to them. Maybe I'm mistaken, but weren't the Murry's much more interesting and open to exploring different ideas in the earlier novels? Here, they're portrayed as boring, closed-minded individuals who rail against that exploration. The bishop character is wearisome; though I appreciate her attempt to show the bishop's openness to other religious beliefs, the entire novel still comes off as very preachy rather than relying on displays of human compassion and creatively written examples of utter faith. Finally, there's the regurgitation of the same plot from some of her earlier Wrinkle books, but unfortunately without any new twists and turns to really grab and hold a reader.Honestly, this strikes me as a novel which was published simply due to its author's previous success along with the supposed connection between the characters in this novel and previous novels in the quintet. Had this been her first, it would certainly not have won any acclaim and who knows, may not have easily found a willing publisher.Why not 1 star? Because, sadly, I've read worse. But for true fans of L'Engle's first three books in this quintet, just be forewarned! Moves incredibly slowly and simply lacks imagination and excitement which fill her other work. However, if you're having trouble getting to sleep, pick it up! Guaranteed to knock you out...in 30 pages or less."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"I thought that the essential plot of the book was wonderful. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the scientific &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot;. Being thirteen and not particularly interested in the space/time continuum, I usually got a head-ache during those parts. It was very sad when she had to leave Tav. I wish Madeline L'Engle had written more books about Polly."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This is the last book in Madeleine L'Engle's \\"Time\\" quintet and is the moving story of the daughter of Meg Murry from \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" who is visiting her grandparents, the famous Murry scientists of the earlier books in this series. Polly O'Keefe meets three strangers on her grandparents' land and slowly comes to realize they are from an earlier time (3000 years in the past) and that their \\"circle\\" of time is overlapping the present. Polly is drawn inexorably into the politics and religion of the earlier era, where the People of the Wind (who we have seen before in this series) are in a drought season and are pitted against their neighbors for food. Some of the people of the wind welcome Polly as a friend, others want to sacrifice her to the earth mother to bring rain...and the people across the lake have their own agenda, which comes out as the story progresses.This story starts off extremely slowly, I would say too slow by modern standards, and it takes close to two hundred pages for the action to really start. There is a lot of character development, more than is necessary to introduce the characters and get the story rolling. I would have condensed the beginning by 50%, if I were writing this story today. Once the action gets going it's pretty page-turning, and Polly grows as a person throughout the story. Her friend Zachary is a pain in the butt and not a very sympathetic character despite the fact that he is dying of a heart condition, and I was rooting for him to croak all through the book. He is simply too selfish to be a likable character, and one wondered what Polly saw in him to begin with. The bishop is a sympathetic character who, as it turns out, has kicked off all the troubles to begin with and sticks with Polly to try to straighten out the messes he's made. In this book we see the elder Murrys as we haven't before, as an aging couple with first names whose love for each other is strong and true.There is a certain sorrow that attends this book, as you realize the Murrys are coming to the end of their time and that their adventures are almost over. The torch has been passed to the younger generation, who will handle L'Engle's fantastic challenges in their own ways. I finished this book wanting more: more of Meg Murry, more of her parents, more of Calvin O'Keefe, more time spent with these characters. In the other books she has written L'Engle gives us more, and I am grateful for all I can get..."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"An Acceptable Time is the final book in Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet, but if you happen to pick up this book first, you can dive into it with little problem. The idea of a Quintet, in this case, is more a marketing device than anything else. Each story stands alone. Yes, the five books have related characters, but so do other L'Engle novels that are not considered part of the Quintet (you can consult the family tree at the back of the book to see the interrelationships). But with that caveat stated, An Acceptable Time is a decent conclusion to the Quintet.The main character in this novel is Polly O'Keefe, the daughter of Meg Murry and Calvin O'Keefe from previous books, making her the first and only character of the her generation to appear in one of the Quintet stories (though other O'Keefe children appear in other non-Quintet books). Polly is staying with her genius grandparents in New England to get a better education, and as typically happens around the Murry household, strange things happen. In this case, a time portal of sort opens up between the present and a time 3,000 years earlier. And as Polly soon finds out, she is not the first person of her time to go through this portal.The first person is actually the retired bishop, Nason Colubra, who has used this portal to interact with the local Indian tribe who calls themselves the People of the Wind. The People have met strangers in the past, in particular two druids who came from far away to join them. The People have prospered of late, unlike another local tribe which is carrying out raids to deal with their poverty. To end a drought, Polly is targeted for human sacrifice, which gives her good reason to stay out of the past. Unfortunately, Polly's dangerously self-centered (and very ill) friend Zachary brings her beyond the portal, which this time shuts behind her, leaving her possibly trapped in the past.As is typically the case, L'Engle creates fast-moving, thought-provoking material which doesn't get preachy or condescending. Though aimed at a young adult audience, it can be enjoyed by older people, not unlike the Harry Potter books. In fact, if you are looking for new material (or actually not-so-new material) to read now that the Potter series is concluded, the Time Quintet book may be satisfying. They're completely different from Harry Potter, but they are good in their own way."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This book is really good. Anyone who can't stand R.L.

You can always meet new freinds no matter what happens to you, almost always anyway.Read this book!!

The description was tiresome and slow and the characters didn't add to any of the already boring set-up. I have not read any of the previous books (with absolutely NO intention) so i'm not very familiar with any of the characters.Just the book as a whole was just so.....slow. It got so annoying. The back of the book says Polly gets stuck in past, as if that's the first thing to happen. It takes 3/4th's of the book for this to occur. The ending with her best friend made no sense. This was my first fantasy book and it's a wonder i didn't stop reading books right there. Don't waste your time on this sorry excuse for a decent fantasy novel."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"First off, let me start by saying that I enjoyed L'Engle's work (Austin and Wrinkle series) tremendously when I was younger.This series, and Acceptable Time in particular, however, was beyond disappointing - it was genuinely offensive.&lt;A few \`spoilers' follow - although I use that term very loosely, as it implies that the book might otherwise be an entertaining experience, if not for my comments.>In it, MLE makes religious faith - the characters' and, indirectly, her own - the central issue. The \`scientists' of the clan (her parents and one of their friends, I think - I don't know where my copy went since I finished it a few years ago and I have no desire to look for it) are openly pitied because they are so tied to \`little' things like knowledge, information, and the amazing scientific breakthroughs they are responsible for, that their faith is weak.It gets worse when it comes to the Zachary character. Zachary is an atheist/agnostic, so MLE portrays him as hugely, wildly, ludicrously, over-the-top pathetic, amoral, weak, self-absorbed, and constantly in need of saving from himself. Completely unable to really do the right thing, ever, even when he means well. Because that's what non-religious people are like, you know.The real kicker, though, comes from a character Polly encounters when she goes thousands of years back in time. The people of that time, naturally, have strong streaks of superstition and ignorance. The specifics are hazy in my memory, but eventually many of them become convinced that one of their gods is angry at them and wants Polly sacrificed as appeasement, so that their hardships will end. There is one fierce young male leader that is at the forefront of that group and instrumental in nearly having her murdered. Eventually, she escapes and/or convinces that faction not to kill her. And what does Polly feel towards the man who tried so hard to bring about her death? Hate? Terror? Forgiveness, with understanding pity towards his crazy, bloodthirsty superstitions? Don't be silly - she's madly in love with him! Why? If you have to ask, you haven't been paying any attention - FAITH. Even though his beliefs are ridiculously misguided, violent and destructive, and nearly lead to Polly's death, his beliefs are genuine and strong and he acts on those beliefs - and that's all that really matters. Far better to be a deranged lunatic with wrong-headed, dangerous, backwards, blood-spilling religious beliefs than to have none at all, MLE clearly asserts in her contrasts of Zachary and the \`Warrior Guy'. (One has to presume then, that Ms. L'Engle is also a big supporter of fanatic religious suicide bombers...)I'm shocked that almost no one mentioned religious aspects and zero people I saw mentioned what I consider L'Engle's obvious central thesis. Maybe virtually everyone is consuming it on a superficial level and completely unaware of the deeper subtext. If that's how you read, then it's a mediocre tale in the general style of her other fantasy works (I don't know if her other novels have the same undertone and I missed them as a child - and I really am afraid to go back and find out). But if you are able to genuinely understand an author's intent (and having read my analysis, you can hardly miss it, in this case), then I recommend this book only if you are also part of the smug, exclusionary, holier-than-thou crowd that thinks [...] like Left Behind is great literature, too."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Somehow L'Engle seems to have forgotten her own characters between her last foray into the Time Series and this novel. The metaphors are less subtle, the characters are more black-and-white and the plot feels like it was already played out in her earlier, better novels.What bothered me the most was how the O'Keefe parents, now grandparents, are so much more closed-minded than in any previous story. They show nothing but disbelief and disapproval at Polly's time traveling adventures, which simply doesn't make sense. Mr. O'Keefe has had his own space-bending adventure and should definately believe in Polly's experience. And both he and his wife have never been anything but supportive of their children's adventures. Their treatment of Polly just doesn't make sense. The same goes for their good friend Dr. Louise, who has been mentioned in other novels (particularly as the namesake of the big, black snake in the orchard).It seems that L'Engle wanted to explore the debate between faith and science in this story, generally an interesting pursuit. But it seems counterintuitive for her, since she seems to have spent much of her career exploring the idea that science and religion are not mutually exclusive. Seriously, is this even the same person who wrote \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\"?Another, less serious, complaint is that Polly seems much less mature and more virginal and childlike than she did in \\"A House Like a Lotus,\\" which was annoying."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"My friend Kristen let me borrow her copy of an acceptable time because I'm a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engel and I missed this book some how.The story starts off by us meeting Polly, the daughter of Meg and Clavin O'Keefe. If you remember from the previous books, Meg is the oldest of four children(Meg, the twins Dennys and Sandy, and Charles Wallace) and she has already been in four books(aka the time quartet). This story is about Polly, the first born from the O'Keefes. Polly discovers a time warp in which she travels back 3,000 years before when what we'd consider Indians lived. Also in the story is Zachary. If you've read other L'Engel books you'll remember him from A Ring of Endless Light. In this book, he's sort of Polly's boyfriend but he's got a really bad heart. Also in the story are Polly's grandparents, Dr. Louise, and Louise's brother who happens to be a Bishop. The Bishop, Polly, and Zachary all end up going back to the time when Annie and Karayls lived and what happens, well you'll have to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This is an awesome book!

The story is very interesting. I have read books with Druids in them before but never in America and never with Native Americans. I read on the review that the person said &quot; for L'engle fans only&quot; and I get the feeling that he thought the story lines didn't mesh. WELL BOO-HOO FOR HIM! Maybe if he had done some research on Druidism he'd know that the story lines (or maybe the mythology) go hand-in-hand together.The Druids were like high priests to the Celts (an old pagan religion). They worshiped a goddess called the Mother or Mother Earth, and had human sacrifices to her every harvest (Halloween). They wore white robes and carried staffs with mistletoe draped on them. (They were keen observers of nature. They noticed how mistletoe is such a cunning parasite) And by the way I noticed nothing to do with Christ unless you count the old Father.Read this book!

Torn between a love she finds through the gate and her family, Poly must choose.I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys an unusual story. I woke up in the middle of the night and decided to read myself to sleep and once I picked up this book I didn't get any sleep. It is one of L'Engles most interesting books I've ever read. Whether you have read some of her books in the past or not I think this is one you should read."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"For the fifth book in the Wrinkle of Time Series, An Acceptable Time was a huge disappointment. I actually considered not finishing it and was relieved when I did. The story uses several of the same plot techniques from the previous books; however, the characters seem to have no reference of the events of previous books. The story was boring and held little action for the amount of words used.The main character is Polly O'Keefe, daughter of Margaret Murry. She spends the summer at the Murry's and goes through a time portal to 3,000 years earlier. As the story develops and she has conversations with the Drs. Murry, they act like they have never had any of their adventures or that the twins never went back to Noah's time. They are uncharacteristically scared for Polly and attempt to keep her from the adventure.When she travels backwards, along with a friend Zachary and a retired Bishop, she is taken for a goddess. The religious references that follow, including from the Bishop, seem to be almost entirely pagan rather than Christian. The Druid spirituality/religion seems to be exalted in this book as the pure essence of a creature-creator relationship. Mother Earth is referenced as a reality and the theme of human sacrifice is present throughout the story as a method for appeasing Mother Earth.It is a strange sort of story, even without the time travel. Unfortunately, there is not enough story or character development. It seems like anything interesting had already been done in previous books. I hate to say it but this is one that I could have lived without, despite my interest in the prior books of the series."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This is my all absolute favorite L'Engle book so far, and I've read about 20 of her books. The writing, amazing, the fantasy, very real. For anyone who loved the Time Quartet (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and Many Waters), this goes back to the old Murray home and brings in familiar characters and memories. It felt like a family reunion of sorts, a coming home, because A Wrinkle in Time was my first L'Engle book, as I'm sure it is many others. It's about time travel, but she makes it so real. For me, it was much more \\"real\\" even than it was in Wrinkle, more like A Swiftly Tilting Planet. It has a more mature feel to it as well. Very VERY good book. I definetly would recommend it very strongly to anyone."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Brandishing their spears and howling incoherent imprecations, the band of savages stormed into the peaceful village, scattering its inhabitants like leaves.... No, this is not a scene from the book. It describes the jaded reviewers descending upon this marvelous book from their yellowed ivory towers, people who can no longer respond to the warmth of love this story brings to us. I was misled to expect something less than profound, but Madeline comes through like almost never before. (If you can love even Zachary, you don't need me to convince you. If you can't, I'll never make you understand.)Yes, I'm a L'Engle fan, because I believe the world desperately needs her clear firm and simple message: You have to care. You even have to care about pitiful people like Zachary, and care about your enemies too. That's the only way you'll stop having enemies.A lot of what is wrong with America is DIVISION. It's something we need to think about, and Madeline surely helps.This book moved and delighted me like no other has done for a long time....."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"The last of the Polly series is a return to the Wrinkle in Time tradition. For a period of time, the Chronos and Kairos series seemed indistinguishable - Vicky Austin and Polly O'Keefe blended.In fact, with Vicki's psychic senses surrounding Adam Eddington while working with dolphins and later traveling to Antartica - Vicki seemed less the ordinary teenager to Polly's more worldly adventures.The tradition returns with Polly catching a ride on a time \\"line\\" bringing her Grandparents and Dr. Louise in on the adventure. Apparently, this is far more than Meg, Calvin, Charles Wallace, Dennys and Sandy have done with their previous adventures.The long-time L'Engle fan wishes the whole Murry-O'Keefe family could get together and \\"catch-up\\" on the collective experience in tesseract travel. Granddad could have had a jump on the \\"theory of everything\\" if these folks would just talk instead of protecting each other from the unbelievable.I love this book, not just for the great story - but for the integrative factors tying it to the earlier generation. We understand Louise the Larger's role in Many Waters as well as the influence of angelic forces. Mother/Meg is explained as an intellectual and spiritual blend. Charles Wallace exists. The stone wall, the star watching rock and the underground river have revealed meaning in the Wrinkle books. Theories of spacetime (Granddad) and cellular energy (Grand) and holistic approach to medicine (Dr. Louise) are realized despite the rational arguments these three scientist represent. Dr. Louise's brother Bishop Nase Colubra helps tie together the philosophy of science and spirituality that underlie the entire L'Engle canon. And finally, Zachary discovers what the reader already knows - he is not the way he is because he does not believe; it is because of what he does worship as a narcissist and materialist.

Mr Murray has &quot;tesseracted&quot; all over the place into different dimensions in A Wrinkle In Time, and yet he has a hard time believing that Polly went back 3000 years."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Once again, Madeleine L'Engle manages to take us through a fantastic, yet believable world. In this novel, Polly, Meg's daughter, is spending time with her grandparents in New England, when she is suddenly transported through time to the village of a 3000-year-old culture. Polly learns to live with these people and the difficulties they are experiencing, all the while trying to figure out how to get home to her own time.This novel weaves interesting bits of ancient history into the story, and by doing so, makes the story feel real. While reading this book, I almost felt as if I were one of the characters, experiencing the story through their eyes. L'Engle makes Polly believable as an intelligent and sympathetic character."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Polly O'Keefe is the daughter of Meg Murry and Calvin O'Keefe from Madeline L'Engle's famous Time Quartet. In this book she follows the family tradition of traveling back very far in time. Except this time it's 3,000 years before our time, to a time where druids and Native Americans populated the United States and life was much different from it is now.Polly O'Keefe is looking foreword for a nice quiet visit to her grandparents house and it starts out like that. She spends her time talking with her genius grandparents and reconnecting with her old friend Zachary. Then strange things begin to happen. It all starts when she starts seeing people dressed in strange clothes. It continues further when she is magically transported back 3,000 years in time. Polly is shocked and doesn't know what to do. When she travels back to the present she discovers from her friend, who also happens to be a bishop, who these people really are and what she's involved in, a tesseract. Polly knows she must not contact these people from the past ever again if she wishes to live, unfortunately they have other ideas and the next time she travels back in time she won't be so lucky.I haven't read a book by Madeline L'Engle since I first read the Time Quartet in 5th and 6th grade but I'm glad I picked up this one. Polly's travels back and forth through time are absolutely fascinating. The \\"People of the Wind\\" (the culture of Native Americans she encounters) is a fascinating race, one with it's strengths and flaws that is very different from people today, but just the same in some ways. I found out part way through the book that this is in fact part of a series. Unfortunately for me it's also the last book in the series. Although I usually hate to get into series like this I would actually recommend this series to people who have and have not read any Madeline L'Engle books. It's one of those kinds of books that you can read with or without really knowing the characters in the first place. I would recommend this series to anyone that's looking for something beyond stereotypical fantasy fiction. I look foreword to reading more tales of Polly O'Keefe."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"After finishing this book for the first time, I cried and put it back in the shelf.

Not just the sadness, the BETRAYAL. It almost made me cry again. One thing I did notice is that Zachary changed a lot since he was with Vicky. In A Ring of Endless Light, he wanted to die. In this book, he was afraid of it. Very good book, but beware: It's a tear-jerker."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"HI I'm Carrie from California and I'm 12.

In &quot;A House Like a Lotus&quot;, Polly had a personality, but in this book she acts like a wishy-washy version of her mother. As Thomas Wolfe says about never being able to go home again is the case in this book. Having Louise the Larger in the book seemed useless. Dr. Colubra was herself, but Mr. and Mrs. Murry seem odd, off-beat to their former loving parent characters. The house is too different. Nase is almost an obnoxious version of Canon Tallis. Zachary Gray played the same role as in &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;. You'd think that after what he experienced he would develop a bit and quit the poor-me-'cuz -i-have -a heart-condition -and-i'm-a-little-rich-boy act. But no, he acts that way again. Also, druids are not explained and a big deal is made about Ogam. My final gripe about this book is that this is the third time Madeleine used the &quot;Early Unknown Europeans and Natives Getting Along&quot; scenario. She used it with the Welsh and Quaztino Indians in &quot;Dragons in the Water&quot;, and Welsh and New England Indians in &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;. It gets old. Snore.

And what a terrific addition to the series this is! This is certainly one of the more outstanding entries in the series! Unlike some of the earlier novels, it is not hampered by speculative theology or attempts at Biblical science fiction, but is very much plot driven. It features an exciting and generally plausible plot where the idea of time travel is central, carrying the suspense until the last pages. The heroine is Polly O'Keefe, daughter of Meg and Calvin. Polly is spending the summer with her grandparents, Meg's scientist parents. Using her familiar twelve-chapter formula, L'Engle describes Polly's adventures as she enters a time gate and goes back 3000 years together with her friend Zachary and her grandparents' friend Bishop Colubra.But as Polly's grandparents remark: \\"Wandering about in time doesn't strike me as particularly safe.\\" Back in time Polly finds both friends and enemies. Here she befriends Anaral, Karralys and Tav, part of the People of the Wind, who are in the grip of a tribal struggle with the People Across The Lake. As she crosses the threshhold of time on several occasions and moves through the circles of time, Polly herself becomes intimately involved in this struggle, because her blood is being sought as the necessary sacrifice in order to bring rain. Can Polly work peace between these two warring peoples? Can she bring rain and avoid sacrifice? And what role will the enigmatic Zachary play in the events that follow? These questions and more result in a spine-chingling tale of suspense and excitement.In the process, L'Engle weaves a tale with important implications about a very real spiritual struggle: \\"The bright angels and the dark angels are fighting, and the earth is caught in the battle.\\" Even the title itself is derived from Psalm 69:13. Perhaps more than in the other books, L'Engle affirms the validity of a Christian worldview and the importance of Jesus Christ: \\"I am not turning to the old gods. No, the God I have tried to serve all my life is still good enough for me. Christ didn't just appear as Jesus of Nazareth two thousand years ago don't forget. Christ is, will be, and certainly was ... just as much as now.\\" Despite the assertion of the the abiding validity of Christianity, L'Engle's apparent acceptance of primitive Celtic religion is still somewhat troubling. The religion of the People of the Wind in serving \\"Earth Mother\\", \\"The One\\", \\"The Presence\\", \\"The Maker of the Universe\\" is not presented as erroneous paganism, but as a valid and simplistic shadowy form of the true religion. What particularly made me uncomfortable was the apparent legitimization of various terms and practices in this primitive religion, by the incorporation of occultic elements such as All Hallow's Eve (Samhain). As in some of the other books, there is a strange and persistent emphasis on the patterns and lines in nature, where \\"The stars will guide you. Trust them.\\" Polly herself also has no clear perception about the afterlife. In my view, these elements detracted somewhat from the Christian element of the novel and a consistently Christian worldview.Of the many important themes running through the novel, two especially struck me. Firstly, the notion of human sacrifice has obvious allusions to Christ's sacrifice. L'Engle makes this connection explicit, pointing out that the sacrificial death of Jesus was a voluntary act of love \\"I don't think that God demanded that Jesus shed blood unwillingly. With anguish, yes, but with love.\\" The parallels with the human sacrifice demanded by the People Across the Lake are not fully worked out, but perhaps they are best understood as a contrast. They demand that \\"the sacrifice must be unblemished\\" in order to provide healing and rain, but ultimately the sacrifice that saves is not one that is demanded, but given freely in love. Polly's willingness to return to her captors to attempt to save Zachary typifies such selfless sacrifice. Unfortunately this important theme is not sufficiently worked out to be entirely successful. The bishop's words \\"It is never expedient that one man should die for the sake of the country\\" added to the confusion, because they seem to conflict with what John 11:50 says. Rather than focus on the gospel, L'Engle seems to focus more on the need for us to break down the barriers of division by showing selfless and sacrificial love to others.Secondly, Zachary needs physical healing and hope because of his heart condition, and is terrified of dying. His physical condition becomes an important metaphor for his need for spiritual renewal from selfishness. \\"Can you say that only his physical heart was healed?\\" In working out this important image, L'Engle makes some important observations about the significance of the heart as the source of spiritual growth: \\"The rites themselves cannot give life. Indeed, they can be hollow and meaningless. The heart of the people is what gives them life or death.\\"These and other important spiritual themes, as well as a gripping plot, make this novel easily one of the best and most enjoyable reads in the series. There is a great deal of fantasy here, but what is cloaked in the garb of fantasy are eternal truths, and a great story to boot. It's a modern fairly tale that speaks to adults as much as it does to children, perhaps even more. So when you have some acceptable time, make sure you read it!"},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"As a fan of L'Engle I was looking forward to an Acceptable Time. All the other Murry books had been fun and interesting and I thought that an Acceptable Time would be up to their quality. Unfortuanatly it's not. At times it is interesting but overall the book as quite boring at times and fails to draw the reader in like the others have. The characters are good but seem less human than some of L'Engle's other books and are not as endearing. An Acceptable Time is worth reading if you are a fan of the Murry books but nothing more."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Polly, a teen aged girl, goes to her grandparent's house for a while to learn about space and time travel.

They do not hurt her, and after a couple of minutes, she is warped back to her original time. A girl from 3000 years ago came to polly's time and had been doing for quite a while. Polly finds herselfstuck in an odd situation and finds she plays an important role in time.This book is pretty good, but it is not fast moving and sometimes boring. The book has extremely excellent descriptive properties. The book is based on the Murry and O'keefe families so if you have read other books by L'engle it adds a little spice to the book. it is very interesting and really makes you think, I mean, 3000 years?

In &quot;A House Like a Lotus&quot;, Polly had a personality, but in this book she acts like a wishy-washy version of her mother. As Thomas Wolfe says about never being able to go home again is the case in this book. Having Louise the Larger in the book seemed useless. Dr. Colubra was herself, but Mr. and Mrs. Murry seem odd, off-beat to their former loving parent characters. The house is too different. Nase is almost an obnoxious version of Canon Tallis. Zachary Gray played the same role as in &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;. You'd think that after what he experienced he would develop a bit and quit the poor-me-'cuz -i-have -a heart-condition -and-i'm-a-little-rich-boy act. But no, he acts that way again. Also, druids are not explained and a big deal is made about Ogam. My final gripe about this book is that this is the third time Madeleine used the &quot;Early Unknown Europeans and Natives Getting Along&quot; scenario. She used it with the Welsh and Quaztino Indians in &quot;Dragons in the Water&quot;, and Welsh and New England Indians in &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;. It gets old. Snore.

The fourth book,Many Waters, I read more recently, and it was good, if not with the same spark as the earlier ones. The fifth book, unfortunately, doesn't stand up.An Acceptable Time is about Polly, a teenager staying with her grandparents. For reasons that are hinted at but never really explained, a gate opens to a time 3,000 years before, where Polly and her neighbour the bishop interact with the natives (who are led by a wise European).It's a pleasant enough read in some ways, but much of it seems haphazard. The plot seems more of a sketch than a final product, full of inconsistencies and lucky coincidences. The science is decorative but vague and not very logical. Religion obtrudes more awkwardly than in the previous books. Characters are black or white, and fairly flat. At the same time, the tone is light and fun, and some of the animal characters are nice companions.All in all, a disappointing book. Fans of L'Engle and her various interconnected series will no doubt want to read this. For others, I advise stopping afterA Swiftly Tilting Planet."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"The Murry children are all grown and left home. In fact, Meg and Calvin married and this book stars their oldest daughter Polly. Polly is staying with her grandparents when she stumbles through a time gate that takes her back 3000 years. She encounters the People of the Wind--the same Indian Tribe her uncle Charles Wallace encountered in A Swiftly Tilting Planet (I am disappointed that L'Engle did not address this connection. Perhaps because the previous encounter was done by kything).Though this story was much better than Many Waters and more in the style of the other Time books, it still left me feeling let down and wondering if 300+ pages was really worth that ending."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Poly is a very interesting character but this book is the first one about her that really makes me think of her as a Murray. Zachary is a fool but it is always interesting to see how he appears in so many stores.

In the book series' that I have read where I feel as if I have grown up alongside the main characters, the author does not usually devote an entire book about the original main characters' kids (if they have any) after the main characters have grown up and I, as a reader, would sometimes like to know how the main characters kids turn out. I feel like that is exactly what L'Engle did in \\"An Acceptable Time.\\" Now that I have read the book, I know that Polly is almost exactly like her mother and has the brains of both her parents and her grandparents. I think that that is the thing I liked most about this book. The thing I liked the least as a thirteen-year-old is that, as I was reading the first four books they taught me a thing or two about science, but when I read \\"An Acceptable Time\\", I could hardly understand any of the science and mathematical terms and stuff. The only stuff I could really grasp was the time thresholds and I only understood that because it was made up! I would have waited a few years to read the whole series if they were all that difficult to read, but it was only that book that was hard for me to grasp."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages!! It is one in a series of 5 books and they are all amazing!!!"},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"The thing that first pricked my interest to read this book was a negative review about it written, I think, in a library journal. We all know that writers in library journals have axes to grind since a good review guarantees that most libraries will stock the book. Look at the [books] in libraries these days (and pity kids looking for something to read) and you'll see my point. The fact that some knucklehead didn't like this book wouldn't normally have swayed me, but like many detractors she went too far, and described it in order to slam it. Just her description of the story, which she found \\"far-fetched,\\" convinced me of two things: she had no imagination, and this sounded like a great book. No, I'm not being fair to the reviewer, who perhaps simply had no taste for L'Engle's brand of fantasy, but man, did she make me want to read this book.Like many L'Engle books this one starts slow. Not put-the-book down slow but unpretentious, unassuming, making no attempt to hide the narration. No plunging into the plot, nothing blowing up, not at all Hollywood. Almost too obvious to keep reading. Almost. Almost too simple and kid-level. Almost. But a couple pages in and I couldn't put it down. An Acceptable Time ranks as one of my all-time great reading experiences, hot on the heels of L'Engle's amazing, awe-inspiring Many Waters. The sad thing is that Many Waters features as the fourth book of the Time Quartet, but no one knows that An Acceptable Time is the fifth. Take hope oh forlorn reader--you who have finished Many Waters and long for more L'Engle--another reading experience of great power and wonder yet awaits you."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This was the first book by Madeleine L'Engle that I ever read and I fell in love with her writing and her characters. I was ecstatic to find out that she had written more books about the same characters and I now own nearly every work of fiction she's ever written.I love this book so much because I discovered it at that time of life when you bumble through adolescence and you aren't really sure who you are and where you're going yet. You also aren't exactly sure anymore where you stand with people. Reading this story of Polly helped me to realise the same thing she does through the course of the novel: Friendship works both ways. Friends will always try their best to help each other and support each other. Friends do not sacrifice one another for personal gain. Friends love each other because of who they are. True friendship is forever and can cross time and space."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"After carrying off \\"A House Like a Lotus\\" so gracefully in the first person just a few years before, it is a bit of a comedown to see Polly O'Keefe relegated to third-person narrative viewpoint in \\"An Acceptable Time\\". This woman who matured so vividly in a book that was unique to the Murry-O'Keefe family series of novels is handed a more standard Time Quartet plotline of time travel, somewhat akin to Sandy and Dennys' trip to the time of Noah's Ark in \\"Many Waters\\". As a result, Polly feels less alive and less real, although she is unquestionably the same mature young woman we see at the end of \\"A House Like a Lotus\\".This novel, at least, puts Polly one up on her mother by giving her a tessering adventure during the bloom of adulthood -- something that I missed with Meg. Although Polly's character doesn't get as good of a treatment in \\"An Acceptable Time\\", the character of Zachary Gray (seen in \\"A House Like a Lotus\\" and two Austin Family series novels) sees major development. In \\"A House Like a Lotus\\", he was relegated to the status of temptor and comforter to Polly, bemoaning his riches, his poor relationship with his parents, and his weak heart. The uneasy chemistry between him and Polly remains, but here, his health takes a turn for the worse, and Zachary is forced to face up to his mortality. By the end of the story, this man who once hated life is bitterly ashamed at what his fear of death leads him to do.The story is typical L'Engle: well written, and deeper than one would expect given its target readership. While it is good, little makes stand out among the stronger stories of the Murry-O'Keefe series of novels, like \\"A Wind in the Door\\", \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet\\" and \\"A House Like a Lotus\\".In a way, it is good to have Polly lead this story, as opposed to Meg or some other character, for it ties the O'Keefe family series of novels closer to The Time Quartet. Previously, they had remained separate in style, with the second generation receiving more action-oriented, less fantastical storylines than the first. I always thought that Polly was missing out in not having the same type of fantastical adventures that marked her mother's teenage years. It also suggests to me that now that Polly has dabbled in Meg's universe, it is time for Meg to shine in Polly's type of story.At last word, Madeleine L'Engle was working on an adult novel staring Meg Murry-O'Keefe at fifty, tentatively entitled \\"The Eye Begins to See\\". Now that Polly has had her tesser, I would be very happy to see Meg carry off in the first person a story about complex human relationships."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"Madeleine Langle is Classic, and so are her books. I am a fan of hers, my first being A Wrinkle in Time. This book was strikingly wonderful with interesting facts of science, and history. Not only does this open up your imagination, but you learn from it too. This story has a lot to do with time lapses and going back 5,000 years ago to a tribe a peaceful living people called The People of The Wind. On an accident of walking around, Polly gets mixed in an issue concerning two times, sacrifice, love, and the change of history, possibly. It's a mind boggler and a wonderful book to read. I really recommend people to give it a try. Try everything once within reason!"},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"An Acceptable Time is another book in the L'Engle cannon that explores truths of reality through fantasy. At times, in fact, it carries with the book a firy truth that seems more actual than reality. Polly, the red-headed heroine, is at her most interesting if not her most believable. She is, admittedly, probably too much of the traditional hero: skilled in the right areas, good, and afflicted with an interesting situation, but these character traits only improve the book. The &quot;interesting situation&quot; is Polly's being stuck in a link between two time circles, so that she can walk freely between Time at her grandparents' home (the Murry scientists!) and Time in the same place hundreds and hundreds of years before. The Native Americans who have always lived in the place and the Druids who have been there more recently make all of the characters unique and historical and at the same time, appropriately fantastic. The highlight of the drama, of course, is that the Time Gate is closing, and Polly's stuck on the wrong side, and even worse, she's taken for a goddess on the side she's on. This is bad only because the goddess is deemed perfect for a sacrifice... The true treasure of this story is not just its plot, which definitely kept me reading, rapt, from beginning to end. Nor was the treasure its characters, which include Canon Tallis, a unique religious friend of the Murry's, two Druids with equal power but opposing philosophies, and Zachary, the weak but interesting friend of Polly's. The true treasure of An Acceptable Time lies in the heavy examination of philosophical questions that underlies the plots. The examination of &quot;leigh lines&quot; to explain the somewhat random connections between people and places and things throughout the real world, the mingling of Christian and ancient religious thought, and the astounding ideas of time, however fantastic, all create a fire behind the story that draws the reader not only to read once, but once again."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This is a very good, exciting fantasy, although it tends to jump about. The plot develops TOO slowly. The story is very interesting, though, and very exciting. Mrs. L'Engles fantasy terms, like \\"time circles\\" aren't as convincing as tesseracts (A WRINKLE IN TIME) or farandolae (A WIND IN THE DOOR). By which I mean just sounds weird, instead of almost feeling like fact during the course of the story as in her other books. It is exciting, though, and combines a lot of fantasy, family life, teen issues, friendship issues, and, interestingly enough, archaeology. When you go back 3000, you'll be transformed.Highly reccomended, although first-time L'Engle readers may be turned off.

Yes, this is a time-travel tale, but more than that, it is a story about the kinds of sacrifice love is willing to make. Nobody gets beat over the head with the lesson here, but it will stick with you. Heads up: parts of this will be pretty heavy going for younger/more sensitive juvenile readers as blood sacrifice is discussed pretty frankly (though not at all graphically) here."},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"I've read this book three times: twice when I was twelve (six years ago) and once in the past year.

As her uncle Charles Wallace discovered, it is up to her to figure out why she keeps entering a different time-- and how she is supposed to affect it.To this day, at odd moments, I picture Louise slithering around purposefully, saving lives and scaring madmen.

Kate is a microbiologist and a Nobel Prize laureate, and Alex is an astrophysicist studying the space/time continuum. Polly has come to live with them to study for a few months. However, life at the Murry residence isn't quite what Polly expected it to be. Far from being quiet and relaxing, strange things begin to happen, with no believable reason behind them.With an earthquake and a brilliant flash of lightning, everything Polly has felt was certain in life, and has even taken for granted, is changed. A time gate has opened on the Murry property and three people are caught up in the tesseract's sphere of influence: Bishop Colubra, Polly, and her acquaintance Zachary. Leaving the area of its influence could well mean death for them all. The time gate leads to a period roughly three thousand years in the past. A time when people still believed in human sacrifice in order to appease the gods and bring about their desires. A time when nothing could be certain, not even the safety of love.Bishop Colubra has found three ogam stones and believes the site of the Murrys' indoor pool was once sacred ground. His avid interest in ogam enables him to be able to speak and understand the language of the people on the other side of the time gate, and Polly is a quick study with languages. Neither had thought they would actually encounter Druids on the other side of the gate. The Druids, however, have no more control over the time gate than Polly or her companions. And their friendship may not be enough to keep Polly from becoming the next Samhain sacrifice.Madeleine L'Engle builds the suspense up extremely well. And not everything is quite what you'd expect from the clues she expertly drops along the way. Although this book is written for children, it too is a wonderful adventure from start to finish, and complex enough to keep an adult mind occupied and guessing at the outcome. I certainly had problems putting it down for any length of time, and even when I did manage to, I was thinking about it almost constantly.Review Originally Posted at www.linearreflections.com"},{"Title":"AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.","review":"This book is interesting.

What I love about all of her books is that the stories she tells are accessable to all ages, and so is the depth of content. I find a different story every time I re-read one of her books. An Acceptable Time is no exception. Some have said that the plot is unrealistic. In response to this, I must say that none of her stories are meant in any way to be strictly realistic. They are modern fairy stories, filled with characters that the reader can identify with.

Chapters quote passages of scripture and then discuss their nuance at length, offering historical, theological, spiritual, and even metaphorical interpretations of Mary, her relationship with God, and her role as Mother of the Savior. Now in a newly expanded edition, Mary: Shadow of Grace is as much an uplifting expression of worship as it is a methodical and scholarly study. \\"Theologically, the term 'virgin' is connected to the long history of Israel, which is characterized as the woman, wife, beloved of Yahweh, who is more often unfaithful, wanton, worshiping other gods and sacrificing to other powers and forces. But Mary is a virgin. She is faithful, not like Israel with its long litany of infidelities. Mary is not just an individual Jew, but the woman of the Jewish people; she receives the promise for a virgin people, with a pure, single-minded heart.\\"Willis M. BuhleReviewer"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Ben Fong Torres' love and admiration for the early days of Top 40 radio shows through in this book. He has crafted a wonderful history of how Top 40 began, features on numerous radio personalities (among them Tom Donahue, B Mitch Reed, Robert W Morgan, The Real Don Steele, Alan Freed, Dick Biondi, the list goes on and on). And the CD included with the book featuring airchecks of some of these amazing personalities is wild. Hearing DJ's like Gary Owens, B Mitch Reed, Casey Kasem or Tom Donahue in their early days is a hoot.If the book has a West Coast slant on personalities, perhaps that's only because Torres grew up in the Bay Area. However, he does not give short shrift to anyone. He also goes into great detail about the people who helped create this format: Chuck Blore of \\"Color Radio\\" fame, Bill Drake and Ron Jacobs of \\"Boss Radio\\" fame, Gordon McLendon and Tod Storz, among others. It's ironic in a way that Torres' claim to fame came later as first a journalist for Rolling Stone and as a DJ on KSAN in San Francisco (one of those \\"underground\\" FM stations that loved to poke fun at the Top 40 stations).The book traces the beginnings, development, and \\"growing pains\\" of this format. How at one time it was hip, then became \\"square\\" when the underground FM stations hit the airwaves, and how it now seems to have emerged again. And funny how the underground stations developed as a kind of \\"antidote\\" to very restrictive Top 40 formats, just as the Top 40 stations developed as something different to the standard fare of that time.Amazing stories abound in this book, and being an ex DJ myself I could relate to them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I agree with another reviewer that this book is must reading for any past or present DJ, or any student of the media."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"As an alumnus of a McLendon station, KELP, El Paso, Ben's book brought back the memories of decades past.

Also, it's great fun!"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"A great look back at the roots of contemporary radio. Well written and very authentic. Fun reading for anyone who loved 50's and 60's radio. Unlike alot of radio books that whine about commerciality or become absorbed in technical data, this book never travels far from the magic of Top 40. I think Ben Fong-Torres under stated a few stations, but that's a characteristic of Top 40.....whatever YOU listened to was the best."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"A great start on the history of Top 40 Radio, but gives surprising short shrift to WABC New York, and other East Coast/Mid West stations. It's understandable with Fong-Torres' Bay Area roots. But don't get me wrtong, if you love radio, you'll LOVE this book; it's wonderful!Rob Hummel 98 KSLQ St. Louis ALUMNI 1976-78"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Just finished this book. Having grown up in LA in the sixties this book took me back to all those great radio days! There is LOTS of great stuff in here! Ben did an excellent job of talking to all the shakers and movers of the golden days of radio. I found it hard to put it down and a great inspiration to create fun radio again for the new century! When I find a book that's this great I can't wait to tell everyone I know! Thanks, Ben. It's awesome!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Ben Fong-Torres has written a solid book on the history of Top 40 Radio in &quot;The Hits Just Keep On Coming.&quot; It was an enjoyable read to this long-time student of contemporary radio. Alas, at times the book focuses more on the stars of the business, giving it almost a People magazine feel. But that doesn't spoil the story here.In fact, perhaps because the title promises so much, I was surprised to find the book a bit on the thin side. At some 272 pages, I was left was the feeling of having gotten a small taste of a wonderful dessert. You too, may find yourself wanting more of Fong-Torres' solid writing and in particular, his analysis of the rise, fall and resurrection of this sound that a generation grew up with.There are a few nits to pick: more than just publicity pictures of faces would have been nice and towards the end of the book there are a few errors in details (A K in call letters for a NYC station, when it should be a W) but all in all to use the jargon of the business it covers, this book is definitely a &quot;Hitbound.&quot;Who knows? If this one's a hit, maybe Ben Fong-Torres has more material for a volume 2!"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Chances are, if you grew up in the '60s and '70s you spent alot of time listening to the radio. In every major city across the USA and in most towns with any sort of population, Top 40 radio was bringing us the best that Rock N Roll had to offer. Fong-Torres' book provides a deep, rich insight into not only who those magic momement makers were...but how the radio industry as a whole came to Top 40 dominated. This book is rich in historical detail, without boring the reader. Just scanning the through index at the back of the book is enough to bring back a flood of a thousand moments spent tuned in to your favorite transistor or table radio. The Hits Keep On Coming is easily one of the best contemporary books written about modern radio and the people who made listening so magical. It's well written, filled with tremendously interesting sidebar material and comes complete with a year-by-year listing of top hits through the decades. If there were one thing I wish the book had more of...it would be more photographs of the music makers (djs) and their radio studios. Perhaps this is a possibility for a &quot;new and expanded edition in the future). If you're a radio fan, American history buff, Rock N Roll collector, this is one book you should definately make sure you own. Opening up the pages of &quot;The Hits Keep On Coming&quot; should instantly bring back to your mind a million memories and the hits that were the soundtrack of our lives."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Ok, so I'm the party pooper here, but I'm not enjoying this book (still reading). What bother me about it is it's tunnel-vision focus on DJs (names, dates, station IDs etc.) while zilch on the music (how tunes were selected, politics, label preferences, payola, etc.). I'm personally curious why Top 40 has changed from period to period and how decisions were made behind the scenes out of hearing range of the listening audience. Telling us things like &quot;Bill Balance, who had been at KFWB for three years when Blore blasted in to install the Top 40 format in late 1957&quot; doesn't even pretend to discuss the kind of details I'm interested in. The publishers would have been more truthful if they'd named the book something like &quot;The People Who Played the Hits.&quot; Also disappointing to me because I've read many Fong-Torres articles over the years that I've thoroughly enjoyed. If I change my mind as I read on, I'll revise or append this review."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"As a young boy I would sit in my mom's car and listen to wonderful radio stations like WLS, WNOE, and 50,000 watt KOMA. I was fortunate enough to have a 15 year long career in radio including KOMA. My shift allowed me to be heard in 22 states and 3 countries. Ben Fong-Torres recaptures the magic and excitement of AM radio and Boss Jocks of the sixties. Anyone who loved radio before it became sterile and humorless will love reliving those crazy days when d.j.s were more important than the music.My only regret is that his focus seems to be on east and west coast radio stations and misses some of the fun that was on the air in the mid-west. A good trip down memory lane and a look behind the scenes for those who never had the honor of being behind a microphone."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Ben Fong-Torres has done radio nuts a huge favor! Not only does he help trace the advent of one of the most powerful, compelling and creative radio formats ever devised. He also provides the reader with a journey into a universe containing a million memories. What I particularly enjoyed about the book was not only did it help me learn more about Top 40 Radio in general, I also got to learn more about the radio legends I've grown up listening to. If you ever spent an afternoon or evening listening to your favorite Rock N Roll Top 40 Radio station, Fong-Torres book, The Hits Keep On Coming is a book you'll definately want to own and read again and again."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Splendid display of TRUE interviewing by this author as he his one of the best from ROLLING STONE....This book explains the MEANING of Top-40 Radio at its best and should re read by every broadcaster in the country!!"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"This was a throughly enjoyable book.

That's just what this book is about: Rock 'n Roll DJ's. Not bad, but for me it was strictly pick & choose, as I only cared about those that I used to listen to."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Ben Fong-Torres is a legendary rock journalist. His book is particularly interesting for the extensive coverage of pop Disc jockeys. It brought back fond memories of the greats like Dick Biondi. The book doesn't answer the question if he got fired from WLS in Chicago for telling a dirty joke (What is the difference between snowboys and snowgirls--snowballs). Actually, that story is an urban legend. My main complaint is that the appendix with the pop number ones list is rife with annoying typos. A few examples: Tommy Rose, not Tommy Roe. Nelson instead of Nilson? The number of weeks at number one is omitted for many of the songs that were at number one at the end of a year. Incredibly sloppy and disappointing."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"Ben Fong-Torres does a very credible job of research compiling the details on the personalities and events that came together to create the radio phenomenon known as Top 40"},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"An account of U.S. pop radio's heyday from the 1950s to the 1980s, \\"The Hits Just Keep On Coming\\" winds up being as personality-fueled as the medium it chronicles - to a fault.For author Ben Fong-Torres, the story of Top 40 radio is best explained with capsule biographies of its most successful disc jockeys, folks like Cousin Brucie, Wolfman Jack, Murray the K, the Real Don Steele, and Casey Kasem, exemplars of the funny one-liner, of reading ad copy like they really believed it, and the art of \\"hitting the post\\", which meant a spoken intro that stopped just as the vocals on the record you were spinning kicked in.But of course it wasn't just the jocks that made Top 40 radio. It was the music they played. Top 40 was an amalgam of musical styles, from classic pop of the Sinatra ilk to country to soul to novelty records to disco to rock of various stripes. Here \\"Hits\\" falls short. It tells you more about the people spinning the records than the records they were spinning.\\"The greatest DJ is the one who can live within the formula,\\" he quotes Buffalo, NY jock Dick Biondi, also known as The Screamer, \\"and make it sound not only happy and interesting, but as if he is producing and pulling the music all by himself.\\"Fong-Torres gets a lot of good quotes from his interviews, not only from Biondi but Dick Clark, Howard Clark, Russ Syracuse, Bill Ballance, etc. If I had grown up on the West Coast in the 1960s instead of the East Coast in the 1970s, I would have been in hog heaven. \\"Cousin\\" Brucie Morrow does appear, the former WABC jock who reveals himself still holding a ridiculous grudge against Wolfman Jack well after the latter's death.At the core of Fong-Torres book is the tension between two rival styles of Top 40 radio, that of Chuck Blore's \\"color radio\\" of the late 1950s and early 1960s, where personality was king, and Bill Drake's \\"boss radio\\" format which dominated by the mid-1960s, which put the emphasis on pushing music and radio station call letters. Obviously the jocks for the most part speak more highly of the Blore approach, but Fong-Torres admirably gives both sides their due. The best chapter features a comparison of how an hour of radio time was broken down under both formats.The chapters feel very loosely organized, however. It seems like Fong-Torres couldn't decide whether he wanted a coffee-table book or a more scholarly history, so it ends up being written somewhere in the middle, with sidebars that don't always seem to connect to the chapters. The chronology goes back and forth, with Alan Freed rubbing shoulders with Gary Owens. Fong-Torres \\"rockist\\" leanings as a Rolling Stone editor come out a lot, too; he has a hard time concealing his contempt for \\"middle-of-the-road\\" music even when that was a median strip for the Top 40 format from its beginning to its end.Ultimately, I missed reading more about the music, how it affected what the DJs were about, and how it changed with the times. Published in 1998, the book also holds out hope that Top 40 radio could make a comeback, which has not turned out to be the case. In that way \\"Hits\\" is as much a casualty of the times as its subject.One cool bonus feature is a compact disc with airchecks of 16 Top 40 jocks, including Freed ripping the movie \\"Blackboard Jungle\\" for negatively portraying teenagers, Bobby Ocean explaining in the 1970s that Don Henley, Glenn Frey, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr have formed a new band called \\"The Beagles\\", and Gary Owens holding you in his \\"strong Crowell-Collier hairy-like arms\\" for a goodbye kiss.The best and worst thing to say about this book is it left me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"More like an encyclodia I could not really follow it inspite of my long term interest in radio."},{"Title":"The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio","review":"I bought this for my wife.

Reluctantly, Nick knows that it is time to truly bury the pastand return to his home town.Kate Moran believes that she has finally attained everything she wantsout of life. She runs a local nursery and is engaged to marry Nick'sdependable brother Gareth. Gareth is the ideal person as far as Kate isconcerned because, unlike her wandering dad, he wants to stay in one placeand raise a family. Everything seems perfect until Nick arrives. Neitherwant to hurt Gareth, but both are strongly attracted to each other. Nomatter the outcome, someone will be hurt though no one truly deserves thepain.Through several intriguing sub-plots, Dallas Schulze pumps oxygen intowhat could have been a trite story line, falling in love with your fiancee'ssibling. The characters making up the triangle are all believable and nice,causing some difficulty for readers because it is easier to hate the guy wholoses the girl. With no villains to deserve what they get, the story itselfseems truer to life and a bit different than readers normally find with thisplot device.

Nothing really bad about it, just kinda boring especially with a plot line about a heroine who is about to marry a guy only to find out that she and his brother shared a one night 5 years earlier. That should have had all kinds of angsty possibilities. But I struggled to finish."},{"Title":"Home To Eden","review":"I think that there were too many plot lines going through this book to make it a really great one: a one-night stand, the attraction to her fiance's brother, the supernatural plot line, the tension with her father & the reason behind it, her friend/boss's hidden attraction to one of the main characters, the reason behind the hero's reluctance to return home & the reason there's tension between him and his family. The author attempted to wrap up the loose edges of all the plot lines with her epilogue but I felt like a lot of it fell through the cracks. There was no mention to her fiance about the one night stand with his brother 5 years ago, the attraction of her friend/boss would have made a greater secondary story, and I feel that the main character didn't resolve anything with her father. Overall, worth reading once but not one for the keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Home To Eden","review":"This was a pretty good book from Dallas Schulze.

In fact, as a late purveyor of the pulp western's twilight era, I prefer him to Elmore Leonard, H.A. DeRosso, et al.

L'Amour, on the other hand, was a believer! -- and BOY, could he knock off a tale!Also worth noting is the story &quot;The Gift of Cochise,&quot; expanded by James Edward Grant into the screenplay for John Wayne's movie HONDO. (L'Amour is now believed to have actually novelized this photoplay-- See Weinberg's LOUIS L'AMOUR COMPANION.) I believe the original story is far better than HONDO-- book or movie! L'Amour's original is more logical and realistic, and the love story works better with the dead husband as a good guy toward whom Ches (later Hondo) Lane feels a driving responsiblity.

This story was made into the screenplay for the John Wayne film HONDO by James E. Grant. It is now widely believed that L'Amour's book HONDO is actually an adaptation of this screenplay and not an original novel. (See discussion in Robert Weinberg's LOUIS L'AMOUR COMPANION.)For the record, I prefer L'Amour's original to HONDO, both book and movie. Louis' original story is more accurate historically and works better on nearly every level. One significant change in Grant's treatment involves the character of Ed Lowe, the female protagonist's murdered husband. In the original, the Ches (Hondo) Lane character is motivated entirely by a sense of duty toward Ed, and the events of the story revolve entirely around this motivation. I believe Grant deliberately made this change in order to deconstuct Lane's typical L'Amour-hero integrity and create a moral ambiguity in the love story. (He seems to have been fond of moral ambiguities in all his John Wayne scripts.)Read the story and see what you think. It is one of L'amour's best moments as a writer."},{"Title":"War Party (Thorndike Western II)","review":"My Dad loves Louis L'Amour, any and all books of his are great to him.

I tried the Breakast Muffin recipe. It was okay. Nothing special. If you don't own any gluten-free cookbooks already, this one may be good for you. Two things really bothered me. First the bread machine recipes never stated the size loaf you were making. I assume 2lb, but that's important info to leave out. Second, I felt that some recipes were included just to fill pages.

I was busy enough chasing my twins and entertaining my 6 year old daughter at the time. Not only did my 6 year old prefer the gluten free breads listed in this book over regular store bought bread, but I have had company (not gluten intolerant) tell me the bread was excellent and asked for more! Just last week my sister was here from out of town and I had to ask her to save it for my boys! I specifically like the rice tapioca bread, breakfast muffins, and the chicken with dijon sauce. Another thing I am thankful for is the recipe for gluten free play dough. My kids were able to go to preschool and play with play dough!

So far I have tried only 2 recipes, because we are living in Old Mother Hubboard's house until payday/grocery day!

I made Blueberry Breakfast Muffins. My husband stole one 10 mins after they were pulled from the oven and he liked it. The next morning, I found it a bit too dry and wish I had added more liquid like my instincts told me when I was mixing them up. But I am having some baking issues as I adjust to living in a higher altitude area now added to experimenting in GF baking. I wouldn't blame the book just yet. I also made the recipe for Carrot Cake and used the handy conversion chart to bake it up as cupcakes instead. They came out great! So sweet and moist, no need for a frosting.Some recipes are simple (yes, baked potato) and they do go on to be more advanced, such as making your own pasta.

Moria Stephens, Persephone The Ladybug is a charming anthropomorphic picture book about a young ladybug - pictured as a girl with ladybug antennae and a red-and-black spotted dress - who is traumatized when her tulip home is taken to a proper tea shop; in the process, Persephone is separated from her beloved mother. Her trials and conflict with a wicked rat gang and her struggle to return home form the heart of this inviting tale.

Starting with a lucid explanation of pagan anti-Semitism in the Greco-Roman world, Cohn-Sherbok takes us through centuries of violence and antipathy that culminated in the Holocaust of the mid Twentieth Century. He also concludes with brief chapters on post-Holocaust anti-Semitism, and on the possibilities for Jewish-Christian reconciliation. The latter, especially, provides a crucial \\"uplift\\" for the reader.This is a very readable text. It is NOT clogged with dense lists of demographic information or by obscure theological discussions. It provides, rather, a general overview of the demographic issues which contributed to Christian violence against Jews through the ages; as well as a digestable level of insight into the theological issues that contributed to and justified this violence.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the cultural causes of the Holocaust, the reasons for the existence of the state of Israel, or the theological differences between Judaism and Christianity. I use this book as my core text in the college course, \\"Jesus and Judaism,\\" that I teach.Along these lines, I would also recommend \\"Liberating the Gospels\\" by John Shelby Spong and \\"Why the Jews?\\" by Prager and Telushkin."},{"Title":"The Crucified Jew: Twenty Centuries of Christian Anti-Semitism","review":"Sherbok has written many books on Judaism. The Crucified Jew is written with emotion and bias, but not scholarship. It surpises me that it was published in its present form. The author cites references and quotes throughout the book but uses no footnotes or endnotes so nothing can be verified or reviewed. He exhibits a poor understanding of Christianity and the Bible. For example he says that according to the Church Fathers the Jews have been an apostate people. Yet, it is not the Church Fathers who determined that, the entire Old Testament (God himself) testifies to their apostasy. Sherbok views the New Testament as anti-Judaism and never considers the fact that criticism of the Jewish leaders may have been valid. He accuses the Christians of calling Jews demons when it was the Jewish leaders who first called Jesus himself a demon (something never mentioned in the book). He says elements of the New Testament were added later for \\"polemic\\" purposes, implying they are not true. However, he offers no support for this charge.Sherbok advocates \\"Open Judaism\\" (See the book \\"Future of Judaism\\") in which Jews do not have to believe in God, or anything, to be Jewish. This explains his distrust of Scripture because the Word of God does not have to believed, either. This book has some good information, facts, etc. But it is very opinionated and devoid of scholarly support. Accusations are made as if they are truth when in fact they are his interpretation and opinion. Unfortunately the author does not convey this to the reader."},{"Title":"The Lord's House: A Guide to Creation Careful Management of Church Facilities","review":"Even though this is a text which is designed for helping churches to become better earth stewards, I bought it because its section on gardening was so helpful, especially the section on alternative lawns. It provided an insightful formula for introducing native plants into the lawn to minimize watering and care while maintaining freshness and connection to one's own area. And it worked!My husband and I applied the forms which were designed to save on electrical bills, and while touted for churches, worked well on our home.I recommend this book. We have consulted it frequently in seeking ways to reduce our energy consumption."},{"Title":"Visual Thinking: Tools for Mapping Your Ideas","review":"I am quite disappointed by this new book & with the two authors, whose past work I am most familiar with. Having read (& reviewed with gusto!) the principal author's two earlier pieces of work i.e. Mapping InnerSpace, I find this book to be somewhat of a letdown.It is natural that I would compare this book with \`Mapping InnerSpace.' Much of the material in the new book has apparently been rehashed from the earlier work. The only new stuff I can find is the \`symbolary' of easy-to-draw iconographs, which is now been re-organized from A to Z, & a handful of new \`Mindscaping' application templates in the last chapter. That's it.Surprisingly, the authors even continue to make use of the same Foreword, which goes back to the late 80's & which appeared in the first book.I get this funny feeling that the new book has been based on perfunctory desk research & no attempt has been exerted to conduct some real field research to cover new developments or advancements. Worst of all, & sad to say, the material is still restricted to the authors' own limited field of work.Based on my own exploration, the field of visual thinking has obviously made tremendous progress in the last few years, in both the educational & business arenas. A quick search & browse across the net will give readers a good appreciation of what has happened/is happening out there.I actually expect the authors to provide a quick round-up (or snapshot) of developments & happenings with regard to new & exciting visual thinking applications across the educational as well as business realms. There have been abundant application variations as well as radical enhancements in the field of visual thinking for business professionals. I am well aware that field research is no easy task in the light of many proprietary methods, but with a little ingenuity & persistent legwork, it would have been rewarding for both authors to go the extra mile. The new book, taking into consideration the prevailing developments outside their own sphere, would have been great for all the readers, especially the professionals.For examples, the creative work of heavy weights in the field of visual thinking as applied to business & industry, like Jim Channon (large system imagineering with Advanced Visual Language), David Sibbet (graphical visualisation of organisational change with template-based methodology) & Matt Taylor (creative augmentation, with artful integration of visual space technologies, collaborative environments, & knowledge-intensive work processes), to name a few, have not been captured &/or exemplified. Not even in the Resources page. I am also very intrigued as to why the innovative work of Christine Allen Ewy (Teaching with Visual Frameworks) & Elizabeth H Wig (Map It Out: Visual Tools for Thinking, Organizing & Communicating) is not even captured in the Resources. There are many others.In today's technology-savvy world, there is no mention of using technology to augment one's visual thinking approach. The Mind-manager software quickly comes to mind. Xplanations is another innovative one. There are many others, too.In these respects, the book does not stand up to its title, Visual Thinking: Tools for Mapping Your Ideas.For the beginner, particularly a teacher or a parent or a student, who is currently looking for plain visual thinking approaches, this book still stands as great work. I would attribute this to the wonderful symbolary.To sum up my review, I reluctantly rate this book a 3 in the light of my foregoing comments, although it deserves a 5 in terms of useful & practical learning for the beginner in the field of visual thinking."},{"Title":"Visual Thinking: Tools for Mapping Your Ideas","review":"\\"I was brought up believing that \\"I cant draw\\" and I was hesitant to get this book, but I am so glad that I did!

I stayed up half the night and read through my classes the next day to finish Nathan's Run, one of the best novels I've read in years. I can't wait for the movie and Gilstrap's next book. (May I suggest a SEQUEL?!) A stunning combo of The Client and Sleepers, I loved every page. Thanks so much, Mr. Gilstrap!!"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"NATHAN'S RUN, the remarkable sleeper by novice John Gilstrap, landed on the publishing world like a hydrogen bomb in the night, illuminating the reading public as to just how dreary so-called thrillers are these days.The &quot;Fugitive&quot; motif, while always a tricky and risky one, is one in which Gilstrap excels (his next novel, AT ALL COSTS, Warner, June '98, also employs characters on the run) and for which he's naturally suited. A former youth counselor, Gilstrap's often rapier-like observations are used to the max in the telling of this story of a young man bewildered at a mad world in which adults have control but perhaps shouldn't.Endless comparisons have been made to THE CLIENT, but Gilstrap obviously has a far greater command of language, plot, and characterization than John Grisham. Any comparisons to the latter could only honor the former Mississippi lawyer. NATHAN'S RUN will be a motion picture produced by Warner Bros., with the screenplay written by Mr. Gilstrap himself. It is sure to be a movie that will put John Grisham on the run."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"How can it get any better? The good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined and they both want Nathan for different reasons. The good guys think he is a murderer and the bad guys want what all bad guys want - money. There are some great characters in this book and I would love to see Mr. Gilstrap bring them back in future books"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Rarely does one find a book in the thriller category that banishes time and forecloses thoughts of other duties or tasks. Nathan's Run falls into this area.The characters are finely formed, realistically intriguing and carefully thought out. Nathan's travails and those who influence his actions are sure to please. This novel is a page turner which will preoccupy you."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"First off I want to say that John Gilstrap has some of the best characterization I have read in awhile. Nathan's Run takes place over a two-day span of time. Mr. Gilstrap does not waste any of this time on fluff. The author uses his pages wisely to develop realist characters and plot. The villains are especially nasty and the heroes are flawed but very likable, good solid heroes. Mr. Gilstrap does a great job in weaving these characters into a very believable and real plot. There are only two things that I'm sad about, one that I didn't read this book sooner and that it ended. I really wanted it to continue for a few more chapters, but the book is called \\"Nathan's Run\\". So if you are looking for a good chase book with good characterization and plot, you won't go wrong with \\"Nathan's Run\\". This is a wonderful book; I look forward to reading more of John Gilstrap."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Ah, where to begin? How about the terrible prose? Or the flimsy (and usually incredibly stupid) characters? Just open the book to any page and you'll find something wrong with it.Can others (especially other writers) actually think this book was worthy of publication, and that the author can be numbered among today's skilled suspense writers? If so, I'll stick with &quot;literary&quot; fiction, where I know at least the writing will be good. Here one gem from the book that says it all:&quot;...a torrent of blood pumping from the gaping wound, like crimson water from a vampire's drinking fountain.&quot;Yeah, that's great writing--if you're Dave Barry. The characters and their motivations are so simplistic they'll need to be beefed up for the movie adaptation. Then there are the other niggling things, like misusing the word &quot;officious&quot; at least 3 times, or excessive use of exclamation marks, or inane dialogue that should have been lopped off by the editor, or just stating the obvious.Please do yourself a favor--don't read this book.

So I immediately started looking for the author's early works. I ordered Nathan's Run not knowing what to expect from review -- a book about a 12 year old kid? Hmmm, okay I'll give it a try. It drew me in from the first page and wound up finishing the book in two days. Absolutely loved it. A different story than most of the suspense/mystery book.

Held my interest from the first chapter.I recommend it for lovers of crime themed novels."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"They can't catch him; he's Nathan Bailey: car thief, juvenile delinquent, twelve-year-old boy. Accused of murdering a supervisor, now young Nathan is a desperate fugitive on the run. As an orphan, he is alone in the world and must depend alone on his wits, honesty, and desire to never return to the misery of the Detention Center. By breaking into houses and stealing cars, Nathan constantly puts the reader in suspense, as the police frantically search for him. He desperately calls up a nation-wide radio station to get the truth out, and is eventually nicknamed \\"The World's Favorite Criminal,\\" due to his manners and habit to do laundry in the homes he breaks into. In this thriller, Nathan must continue his run, and that half the nation, along with the reader can't help but root for him all the way. The mystery of the murder combined with the nonstop pace provides a complex, yet exciting plot, and a challenge to put down the book. The real-life dialogue makes this a fun read, and characters that are easy to relate to. As loveable Nathan runs from the police, angry citizens, and a hit man, the reader tries to piece together the puzzle of the crime. Although not a conventional fugitive story, any lover of suspense and thrillers would enjoy this book. However, because of the adult language and gory, violent details, it is recommended for more mature readers. Confusing at times with the constant change in point of view, Nathan's Run is a roller coaster, as it is impossible to predict what will happen next. Nathan wins our hearts from the beginning, and we cheer him on, as he runs and runs from society, while we run with him."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Suspend your disbelief and get ready for a most intense ride.It's got so much going for it.

He's innocent, he's small and defenseless and the whole world seems to want him dead. You can't but hope he'll outsmart everybody. But let's be honest: Gilstrap took the cheap way out. The book might be a page-turner, but he acomplishes it on the expense of his main character, Nathan. There is nothing real about the character. Nathan is the result of a simple question: How can I make a character that everybody likes and roots for immediately? So Gilstrap may win our sympathy, but he sells out the story. There's nothing behind it. It is what the title suggests - it is Nathans run, and nothing more.

Some parts were implausible but with literary license, that's what fiction is all about. The only part that left me hanging was the end. It just stopped. Seems to me that one more chapter explaining the trust fund, who finally ended up with Nathan and slowly easing out the characters or killing them off would have been more logical.

I read the whole thing in one day because I just couldn't put it down. It's a great plot and you can't wait to see what happens in the next chapter.

Everything went downhill from there, he stole his uncle's car to try to escape him and ended up in a Juvenile Prison. Things went from bad to worse, he was beaten and abused, until he finally escaped in a bloody scene. With good luck and a little know how, and talking to a morning radio personality Nathan is able to evade the cops for a while.

The book is similar to 'The Fugutive'(wrongly accused man on the run), except in this case the runaway is a falsely accused 12 year old boy on the run from the police and, seemingly, the whole world.It is a fun read, but requires a bit of supension of belief when Nathan knows a bit more than most 12 year olds would. But then again, he'd already been through a lot more than most 12 year olds so maybe it wasn't too far off.This is not deep, life-changing reading, but it is entertaining and you find yourself engrossed in his flight for life. I'll be looking for more Gilstrap novels in the future."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Found a used copy of this book in a charity shop in Inverness, Scotland. Needed an &quot;airplane read&quot; and this looked interesting. What a pleasant surprise! Exciting plot, true-to-life dialogue, and a 12-year-old protagonist who isn't too good to be believable. Despite the age of the main character, the language and situations make this a book NOT intended for children. However, adults who enjoy murder thrillers won't be disappointed. Excellent book, especially for a debut novel. I will definitely look up this author's other works."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"This book is exhausting. I felt like it was a marathon as I sped through the pages on the edge of my seat. What made this story so interesting was a 12 year old boy running from a massive manhunt. I really enjoyed this one. I felt like I was running too."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"this is one of the best books that i have ever read. it is the perfect book for those who like high action suspense and thrillers! gilstrap's writing is encompassing and in depth. very articulate descriptive book. once you start nathan's run, it is hard to put it down until you finish. hard to write a review that does this book justice, it is REALLY GOOD! a must read"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Nathan's Run, by John Gilstrap, is a true story about a 12 year old boy named Nathan Baily. Nathan had out smarted the police because he was able to kill a supervisor in the Juvenile Detention Center, escaped, and was still not captured until a few days later. Even then, his unbeliveable luck helpped him. After he escaped, the police were not the only ones looking for him, even a head gang memeber. Eventhough this story at the beggining is really confusing becasue so many different things are happening, it all ties in at the end. The way Gilstrap leaves you hanging, just makes you want to read to the very end. If your planning on reading this book to make you sleep; think again."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I'm going to start by saying I hate reading dumb books, and I drop the dumb ones within the first two chapters[hey, I'm 15 and impatient]. Anyway, this book was one of the few books that kept me turning the pages. It was fun to read with a strong plot and &quot;real&quot; characters. I picked up a good message from it and I liked all the characters; even that freak hit man in some twisted way. I'd recommend anyone to read this book. I just wish there was more of it...but all good things have to come to an end I suppose."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Nathan's Run is a very good thriller about a 12-year old boy who escapes from a youth detention center after killing a guard in self-defense. (Or was it self-defense???) In an ordinary thriller, the author would follow a formula that the reader would probably be able to easily figure out. That doesn't happen here. Gilstrap gives us just enough information to keep us turning the pages to find out what happens to Nathan next. All is not as it seems in Nathan's life. Anxious to tell someone his story, Nathan telephones a national radio talk show. Improbable? Maybe. Maybe not. But it is suspenseful and riveting.Nathan's Run may not be for everyone. There's lots of violence and profanity, but there's also quite a lot that Gilstrap has to say about our society and where we're headed. Also Nathan is one of the most unforgettable characters in adult fiction. A good read, but not a great ending, thus earning four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"An excellent book from a first time writer. The blurb on the back compared the writer to John Grisham which is a bit unfair as I found Nathan's Run more enjoyable than the other JG's efforts.The book is fast paced and you can relate to the characters. The story is well thought out and structured. The writing style is undemanding as it should be for a book of this type.Definately one of the best action books I have read. It would actually translate into an excellent movie."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Gilstrap happens to be one of my favorite authors, and Nathan's Run was a great story. The plot of a young 12 year old boy who murders a Juvinille Detention Supervisor and becomes a fugitive of the law is gripping and thrilling. Gilstarp does a have a problem getting off a subject though. If you want a great book in the same genre, by the same author try At All Costs (Read my review on it). Overall this was a great book, if you have the time to read it."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Nathan Bailey had the life we wish nobody had to endure. Orphaned, raised by an uncle plagued by personal demons, committed to a kiddie jail (primarily on the testimony of said uncle), and became a fugitive from the law all before reaching his teens. It's easy to sympathize with Nathan as Mr. Gilstrap included many small details so unique to adolescence. The way Nathan is portrayed to think and act are very much in character for a young man, albeit a VERY contientious one. Most of the other characters were not given the same descriptive attention, unfortunately. They're servicible and believable, but somewhat flat.While reading Nathan's Run, I couldn't help but think policemen were given a bad rap in this book. I doubt that Mr. Gilstrap has a vendetta against cops, but they are (with two exceptions) made to look incompetent, manipulative, career-driven, and cruel. There is one particularly tense scene in which Nathan, smaller than normal for his pre-teen age, is brutalized by three policemen at once. I understand that some may be necessary to advance a plot following a fugitive, but this stereotyping felt like the stuff of 100 Bad Cop movies.Since this is a suspenseful tale with a young man at its center, I also believe Mr. Gilstrap alienated what might have been a massive audience, young adults, with generous portions of gratuitous profanity. It was, in my opinion, largely unneccessary to have nearly every character have an extensive 4-letter vocabulary.Still, Nathan's story is absorbing and tense to the last page. Emotions crescendoed to such a peak in the final scene that if I weren't riding a city bus with my goatee'd &quot;big-guy&quot; image to uphold, I might have cried. Honestly.My recommendation would be this: it's good, but not destined to be one of the &quot;greats&quot;. Pick it up if you're in the mood for a fast-paced thriller."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"It's not great literature, the story requires a bit of a suspension of reality (but most thrillers do), and Nathan is a bit too precious. BUT...the breathless action is virtually non-stop and the suspense is wonderful. This is an excellent thriller!"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Reading Nathan's Run is a little like watching episodes in those old-time serials, where each ended with the hero in some absolutely inescapable predicament. Impatiently we awaited next week's chapter. If this novel were a weekly serial, we would see Nathan's head in the cross hairs of the sniper's gun sight, then see a closeup of the gunman's finger squeezing off a shot as the scene and the chapter end . How could he possibly get out of this one? So it is in this novel, where Nathan runs from one perilous predicament to another.The superintendent (read warden) of the Juvenile Detention Center (read prison) learns that Nathan has killed a child care supervisor (read guard). Nathan killed in self-defense, but during his run to safety several other people are murdered, and all clues point to Nathan as the killer. We know better, of course, but the cops chasing Nathan do not, and the book becomes one long chase scene. Adding to the suspense is a third killer, a hit man with a contract on Nathan. Who put out the contract, and why someone wants Nathan dead, we are not told until Page331 of this 338 page novel, though sophisticated mystery fans will guess correctly ong before that.Beneath the exciting storyline author John Gilstrap makes some telling points about our system of justice, about barbaric and sadistic prison guards,about brutality and man's inhumanity to man. He also attempts to tweak the conscience of our mass media, especially talk radio, who coldly and deliberately manipulate public opinion to serve their own materialistic ends. (&quot; Rick, I want the calls about three to one approving our point of view.&quot;)Nathan wins our hearts from the beginning. We are almost glad when one of the pursuing cops is shot by another pursuing pseudo-cop. We look forward to the next Gilstrap work."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"12 year old Nathan Bailey, subject of a nationwide manhunt,is on the run from the police and a hit man. He has no oneto turn to but an outspoken radio talk show host.This novel is a chronology of Nathans run. Subcharacters andsub plots are developed, but the main character remainsNathan Bailey, whose moral character and strength eventuallylead to a successful conclusion.Rate it PG-13 for a bit of strong language and some violence,I would recommend this book for teenagers and adults lookingfor a pleasant thriller. I look forward to Mr. Gilstrapsfuture efforts."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I loved the character Nathan. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have liked an epilogue at the end of the story telling what ultimately happens to Nathan. Other than that I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"This is one of those books that totally engrosses you and leaves you feeling completely manipulated when you are done. I have to confess that I couldn't put it down and finished it off on one commute to and from work, but when I was done, with a slight wetness in my eyes, I was totally annoyed. The characters are either SOOOO good or SOOOO bad. The protagonist is wrongly imprisoned and when on the lam, changes the sheets of houses he breaks into and hides in. The hit man is a total scum bag and takes delight in breaking fingers and crushing delicate body parts. All the same, it was a good read. A perfect book for a sunny day on a white sand beach in the Yucatan."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Love books with suspense and this held my attention from the beginning. I could not put this book down. I stayed up until 2AM reading and would highly recommend it for those who enjoy action and suspense."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"First, the titular \\"A solid piece of fiction,\\" part of my NATHAN'S RUN review: it is a quite solidly written novel. It's fast-paced, crisply written, and with an engaging, suspenseful plot that should motivate any fan of this genre to finish it in one sitting.The \\"BUT,\\" side of this review (pun intended) lies mostly with the fact that the acid-free paper used for NATHAN'S RUN will age much more gracefully than the words printed upon it. This is because the book was written in a very lean, sort of PLEASE-make-me-a-movie style that doesn't so much capture 1997 for posterity as much as it requires the reader to know all about the nuances and attitudes of 1997 America. When writing this, Gilstrap seems to have been unwilling to resist offering social commentaries specific to the popular culture of that year, while simultaneously being unable to slow the high speed at which this twisting and turning kind of thriller is required to proceed. The result is a book that will gradually lose more and more of its appeal as time moves further away from 1997. It's kind of like that old episode of ALL IN THE FAMILY that isn't nearly as entertaining as you remembered it being, back in 1972. Whereas, 50 years on, that old episode of I LOVE LUCY will still leave you in stitches.A tangential question to conclude this review: what gives with the many five-star \\"A Customer\\" reviews, posted here, which were obviously written by Gilstrap himself? It's a bit pathetic to read the same comments, written in essentially the same voice, changed up by Gilstrap in the most painfully obvious ways. (Such as using all lowercase letters, or a few misspelled words.) Gilstrap even identifies himself as a 15-year-old in one of his creepier, obviously fake Amazon reviews. It's a shame that he felt obliged to game the system here in this way."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Nathan's Run , is the best book i have ever had in my hands. The book touched me in ways i can not describe. I have never read a book, like this one. I felt as if I really knew Nathan, I could not put it down. Only one word for the book and that is OUTSTANDING!"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I waited for this book to come out for several months. I was disappointed in it, thinking it was going to be a great thriller. I found it to be predictable and a little dull."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"A 4th grade kid talking to a 12 years old kid about the 'NIGHTLINE', an adult program after 11:PM? The running of the 12 years old involved 2 stolen cars, 2 break-ins, 1 inexplanatory hitman and his questionable employer, 1 remote detective, 1 radio show hostess, several dead cops and an ending without a result. The way the 12 years old talked was no different from those adults in this book. I've tried very hard to figure out what's going on in this book, but simply could not get a clear picture. All I could remember after finished it was that the 12-year adult did two laundries during his break-ins and left gentleman's notes. The scenario is so hollow and unplausible, and the blabblings were zigzagging to nowhere. I regretted to waste couple of nights to figure it out but failed"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I couldn't get past Gilstrap's shallow characterizations. All he seemed to use to describe anybody were four-letter words. I wonder how large his vocabulary really is. I think I'll go find the Readers Digest version, the F- word omitted, and the plot condensed. That ought to be a nice afternoon read, then instead of leaving it on the park bench, maybe I'd pass it along to a friend."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"My sixth grader came home with this book. It was found in his school library with a Reading Level of 6.7. He told me the book contained a lot of inappropriate words. I immediately looked at the book and in 10 minutes found a huge array of offensive, sexually explicit, and morally offensive words. There was no warning of the mature nature of this book on the cover or the reviews inside. THIS IS NO CHILDREN'S BOOK. I have currently asked the middle school to review the book and send it on to an audience where it would not influence such young children. Not my kid, not my school, NO WAY! (By the way, he did not finish the book.)"},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I sincerely hope this first book is also the last one by this author. A 12-year old car thief, burglar, and (?) murderer (?) is its \\"hero\\". The author gave away his leftist leanings when he stated in the blurb that this is a book about \\"the war our society wages against its children\\".So, don't jail them, provide them with the means to kill; whether it is with a Glock for drive-by shootings or a shank into a drunk's gut, never mind. After all, it is society that is at fault, never the non-existing parenting, or the teachers who are afraid to go to school because they will be blamed for their charges' rotten behavior, the teachers who get killed and raped by these misbegotten poor little sweethearts. Yech.... stay away from this garbage and keep your money."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I only bought this book as I had nothing to read and was going on a long journey. Ever since reading it (in record speed I might add) I have been waiting in anticipation for a second book by Gilstrap. An excellent read."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"NATHAN'S RUN, the remarkable sleeper by novice John Gilstrap, landed on the publishing world like a hydrogen bomb in the night, illuminating the reading public as to just how dreary so-called thrillers are these days.The &quot;Fugitive&quot; motif, while always a tricky and risky one, is one in which Gilstrap excels (his next novel, AT ALL COSTS, Warner, June '98, also employs characters on the run) and for which he's naturally suited. A former youth counselor, Gilstrap's often rapier-like observations are used to the max in the telling of this story of a young man bewildered at a mad world in which adults have control but perhaps shouldn't.Endless comparisons have been made to THE CLIENT, but Gilstrap obviously has a far greater command of language, plot, and characterization than John Grisham. Any comparisons to the latter could only honor the former Mississippi lawyer. NATHAN'S RUN will be a motion picture produced by Warner Bros., with the screenplay written by Mr. Gilstrap himself. It is sure to be a movie that will put John Grisham on the run."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"I just happened to read this book by the pure luck that my grandmother found this book in some bookstore.

I could of used a more satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"NATHAN'S RUN.","review":"Gilstrap has created a real polished work for a debut novel; excellent character development and thrilling pace.

I handed it to him as we began our 35 min trip by car. He leafed slowly through the pages and for the next 20 mins. we discussed each image.The author chose to color the images which makes it easier to identify each object relative to the text. And makes it fun to look at. However, one or two actual grayscale photos with arrows would have been nice. I kept wanting to explain to him that the carpet beetle wasn't really day-glo colors, etc. Hopefully, the next book out in hardcover will show a few real images.

I strongly encourage anyone looking for a devotional Bible study or a way to spend time in God's Word to get this book. In the first few chapters Kay Arthur gives you some foundational teaching about the law, sin, and grace. This is not your usual devotional. Kay has you going directly to the Word for yourself so that you can discover truth for yourself. I found myself wondering why no one in church taught about the grace of God. I thank the Lord for showing me His grace in providing this study. Now I know I was living by Law and as result I was living beneath my inheritance--under the curse of the Law. Walking in God's grace means that I am totally dependent upon the Father for everything. Discover truth for yourself and get this book. If possible start a bible study with some friends and family using this study. But remember to do it all standing firm in the grace of God. Be blessed."},{"Title":"Lord, I Need Grace To Make It","review":"This book is a good daily study to help you understand the Grace of God. To learn how to live in the Grace of God.

Kays book has guided me into a deeper understanding that through Jesus we are not only saved from the condemnation of sin but we are saved from the POWER OF SIN NOW."},{"Title":"Lord, I Need Grace To Make It","review":"I have taken and taught several Kay Arthur studies. She has a wonderful way of helping you learn what God has to say to His people by teaching you how to find it out for yourself. \\"Lord I Need Grace To Make It\\" is a perfect Bible study for both new believers and those that have believed for many years.

Brennan, Jr: Freedom First","review":"I must begin this review by admitting my biases. No, I am not related to David Gallen. Roger Goldman, however, did teach me constitutional law at St. Louis University during Justice Brennan's service on the Supreme Court.Justice Brennan was one of the longest serving justices on the Supreme Court, serving from his appointment by President Eisenhower in 1956 until his retirement in 1990. A member of the New Jersey Supreme Court before his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, Brennan became one of the court's consistently liberal justices during his 34 year tenure.This book is in no way a biography of William J. Brennan, Jr., although some biographical details do work themselves into the narrative. This book is an exposition of the judicial legacy of this very important justice of the twentieth century.This book is organized into three sections. The first section contains tributes to Brennan from others who have known him, primarily his former clerks. Section II contains a summary of the judicial positions which Brennan championed in his opinions. Section III contains a collection of Brennan's most important opinions.This book is a worthwhile read, whether you are a fan of Justice Brennan or whether you see him as an activist justice run amuck. His fans will revel in his judicial literature. Strict constructionists will find justification for criticism of his kind in the pages of this book. All will notice his shift from an intellectual mainstay of the liberal Warren Court, to a sometime dissenter and sometime majority builder on the Burger Court to his role as a frequent dissenter on the Rehnquist Court, who still packed the punch necessary to bring an occasional majority to his thinking. When he failed to persuade the majority he left his dissents for liberals who he knew would follow later.Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"High Graders","review":"Mike Shevlin rides into Rafter Crossing, and starts poking around to learn the truth of Eli Patterson's death. Patterson was Shevlin's surrogate father, and he was a peaceful man that didn't believe in violence. Shevlin knows that things don't add up when he hears that Eli was killed fair and square in a gunfight. Shevlin also discovers that dishonest local mine managers are stealing high-grade ore from the out-of-state owners. One of these offsite owners is Laine Tennison, who asks Shevlin for help. Most of the town, including Shevlin's old friend, is in on the scheme. There is also a war between cattlemen and the miners over land preservation.This is a second string Louis L'Amour Western novel. The familiar hallmarks that distinguish his best writing are absent. The typical emphasis on the freedom of the big sky country is lacking, and the lure of distant trails is missing. The story gets downright claustrophobic inside the mines. The story is told in the third person form. L'Amour's best work (e.g., the Sacketts series) is told in the first person narrative form. This allows the reader to really get inside the head of the main character. There is some action and suspense, but the plot rather plods along. Dedicated Louis L'Amour fans may be pleased, but other readers should know this is a lesser effort by the Master of the West."},{"Title":"High Graders","review":"\\"The town of Rafter Crossing wasn't just any town.

Georg Feuerstein's unique contribution in this book is to apply the recently developed methods of psychohistory to an explanation of Yoga, seeing it as part of the growth of Indian civilization rather than as an isolated phenomenon. This method leads him to discern in Yoga two markedly distinct tendencies, those reflected in the Vedas and the early Upanishads, and those in later Hinduism and Buddhism. He explains the eight-fold part of classical Yoga, and then goes on to focus on the Bhagavad-Gita, Mahayana Buddhism, Tantrism, and Hathayoga. In the course of this journey he shows how Yoga not only played a decisive role in the development of cultural life in India, but how it was in fact the essential dynamo in the evolution of the Indian mind. Finally, he addresses himself to the crucial question of how Yoga can be applied in contemporary life. -- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"This tremendous lover","review":"I wondered if any modern writer had ever penned a handbook for pursuing a life with Christ in the Catholic Church, until I found this book.

The story opens as a group of grand masters hope to stop an ancient prophecy about a baby being born who, upon its 17th birthday, will unleash a beast who has been imprisoned for 1,000 years. The beast will cover the world in blood and fear, raising a mountain of corpses and turning the seas red with blood. The attempt to kill the baby fails. Now forward ahead 17 years to a village where a young man named Bakhong just wants to check out the girls walking about in the village square.. When his voyeurism is interrupted, not to mention his lunch, he turns on the band of village bullies with a martial arts style they've never seen, and dispatches the ruffians in short order. The fight took him to the rooftops where the young man found something even better to look at...a beautiful girl showering. Once again he's interrupted in comical fashion by three masters of the Volcano School. They are flabbergasted that Bakhong is paying more attention to the girl, than to their attacks. The action plays out in a hysterical, Jackie Chan style way as the three masters prove themselves no match for his eclectic style. But soon Bakhong discovers he picked the wrong window to be a peeping Tom as it turns out the girl is Danshula, daughter of the Grandmaster of the Moo Young Sook dojo. What does all this have to do with the ancient prophecy of the prologue? Well, you won't find out in the first volume, so stick around for the next.\\"Heaven above Heaven\\" is filled with slapstick humor, grand martial arts fights and ominous ancient prophesies. We are given only hints of what these ancient prophesies entail before we quickly move onto being introduced to Bakhong and Danshula. The art by Joong-Won Jeon was the real highlight for me. With lush, detailed linework, shading, and use of zip-a-tone, Jeon's art was somewhat reminiscent of the 1970's and 80's work of Barry Windsor Smith and Tim Conrad, two of my all-time favorites. There was a magnificent use of perspective that made the fight scenes almost leap off the page as if they were in 3D. The Manga style seems to be one of not revealing too much too soon to keep the reader salivating for more. Heaven above heaven certainly succeeds in doing this. I also enjoyed the way the opening, very dark and foreboding segment was offset by the humor and action in the rest of the book. Very strong first chapter!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Eagle And The Raven Part 1 Of 3","review":"I have read most of Pauline Gedge.

It is a tossed-togather quickie \\"written\\" by the staff of the New York Post. In typical Post sensationalistic style, it covers the history of the cult and the mass suicide. As such it records useful information, but I'm amazed that no full length scholarly work has yet appeared on the Heaven' Gate episode.Interestingly, I was in graduate school in Eugene, OR in 1975 when \\"Bo\\" and \\"Peep\\", the future Heaven's Gate leaders, came through town. I recall seeing ads for their presentation but, for lack of time, didn't go. Wish I had as I have a strong interest in why people believe in the type of pseudoscientific and paranormal crap Bo and Peep used to later lead dozens to their deaths.But back to the book. It was clearly a rush job and abounds in errors and inconsistencies. On page 11 Hollywood is described as a place where stars \\"grinded\\" out films. GRINDED? The last time I checked, ther past tense of the verb \\"to grind\\" was \\"ground\\". On page 124 a \\"local\\" radio station in the area is described as receiving calls from \\"around the country\\". Still, what can one expect from New York Post writers? This is probably the best they could do.In summary, this book does provide the basic details of the events of the Heaven's Gate cult suicide, and for that it has some value."},{"Title":"Heaven's Gate: Cult Suicide in San Diego","review":"This was hard book to read as I had a friend that was a member.

Consider first his \\"everyday\\" definition of cheating: \\"a surreptitious violation of standards of individualized responses to tests or other exercises.\\" Next, take a gander at how he describes group-work: \\"a generic term covering a multiplicity of techniques in which two or more students are assigned to a task that involves collaboration and self-initiated language.\\" This type of jargon might impress some, but it's not everyday English and it defeats the chief purpose of language: to communicate! Additionally, it overturns Mr. Brown's assertion in another part of the book: \\"do not overwhelm students with linguistic terminology.\\" Perhaps if Mr. Brown were to practice what he preaches, we might take him more seriously.I teach TESL in Toronto, Canada, and I have no choice: I must use this book with my classes.

As a male reader, I was able to gain insights into both sides of the conflicts presented in the story and I found the foibles of all the characters to be funny, engaging and at times, poignant and revealing. So many of the characters fears and self-doubts are common to us all whether we've been in that exact situation or not.

It is a fabulous, quick-paced story with a decidedly less-than-perfect heroine that any woman can relate to. Kate is the friend you sometimes want to grab by the shoulders and shake, but also the one you love to death, and there's nothing you'd like more than to see her happy. Everyone has had that one bad relationship or breakup that still hangs over us, and to see Kate turn hers into a successful novel is the come-uppance we all dream of.What I love about Kate is that she is so unpredictable. On one page she does exactly what you know she should do, and on the next you want to yell at her, \\"Girl, what are you thinking?\\" But deep down, way down, you know exactly what she's thinking, and you can't help but understand. One example is when she is at a book signing on a college campus, filled with young women, and they all start asking her questions about specific details pertaining to the stunts her (thinly veiled) main character pulled on the lousy ex-boyfriend. Kate suddenly realizes that the women are not just interested in her writing, they're looking for revenge ideas. Her reaction? \\"...a devilish little grin came to the corner of her mouth. I'm gonna sell a lot of books on this tour, she thought.\\" Now that's my kind of girl.Of course, there is a love story, with a man as imperfect and unpredictable and lovable as Kate herself. He sure gives her a run for her money in this one. And you wince but can't take your eyes off the page as Kate gets a taste of her own medicine when she, for the first time, is caught being the Other Woman.

Moyer [with an edition of Ralph Lever and William Fulke, 'The Most Noble, Auncient, and Learned Playe (1563)] \\"is at times as much about the history and significance of the teaching of Boethius's ARITHMETIC as it is about the game itself.\\" (p. 13)Indeed, the book appeared to be mis-titled as the author seemed to digress away from Rithmomachia and onto Medieval and Renaissance European reaction to Boethian mathematics via the Philosopher's Game.Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (d. 524 A.D.) whose two major texts, the ARITHMETIC (a loose translation of writings by the second century scholar Nicomachus of Gerosa); and the DE MUSICA (which was heavily based on the \\"Pythagoreo-Platonic concept of numerical ratios of the musical scale\\"); were the main text sources for the Quadrivium, the curriculum of monastic schools, cathedral schools, and somewhat in the newly formed universities (studia generalia). It is Dr. Moyer's contention that \\"rithmomachia had arisen with the promotion of the quadrivium in 11th century-education, so the game's disappearance helps mark the end of this long era of European learning and culture\\". (p. 123)Yet a few problems of consistency arose within THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME which impaired her thesis; as Dr. Moyer stated in her proem that \\"Rithmomachia was played as long as Boethius's ARITHMETIC was taught; the game and the curriculum disappeared together\\" (p. 13) which contrasted sharply with her observation of Renaissance Italy where \\"Boethius's ARITHMETIC did not hold there the place it had held traditionally in northern Europe ... Boethian influence remained as only one aspect among many of mathematics and related studies.\\" (p. 123)The Renaissance Italians, first exposed to Rithmomachia in Florence \\"in the social gatherings at the Racellai gardens\\" (p. 115), were entirely ignorant of Boethian proportions and his text, the ARITHMETIC; and felt \\"the key to correct proportion is Pythagora's system of musical harmony.\\" (Wittkower, 'Architectural Principles' p. 33). Rithmomachia was played in Italy (and England) as the 'Pythagora's Game', and Francesco Barrozi (c. 1560), modified the rules by Boissiere by totally eliminating Boethian proportion to expedite the beginner to the game. Obviously, in contrast to the author's assertion that the game was played as long as the ARITHMETIC was taught, it is apparent that Rithmomachia was sometimes played in total ignorance of the ARITHMETIC, or independently of Boethian mathematics, and well beyond the life of the Quadrivium curricula.Depending heavily on a secondary source, Arno Borst, to claim that Rithmomachia, the 'battle of numbers' was invented c. 1030 in a German monastic school by a monk named Asilo, who \\"made use of Gerbert's SCHOLION on Boethius's ARITHMETIC in comprising his rithmomachia\\" (p. 20), Dr. Moyer made no effort to document another possible inventor, Herman Contractus, simply understating his contribution. With Dr. Moyer's emphasis of the interest also taken in chess, she took no consideration of the indigenous games of Northern Europe and their possible influence on Rithmomachia. For example, the Viking game 'Halatafl' (fox & geese) dating back to before 400 A.D. and played until the 17th century, where the geese are to capture the fox by surrounding him on all sides so it cannot move, is 'a fortiori' reminiscent of 'Ambuscade' found in the Philosopher's Game!Therefore the book THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME is not a definitive work, and contained a number of non-sequiturs, unreferenced claims, foot-noted digressions, 'cum hoc' fallacies, a resort to determinism, and internal inconsistencies. Despite the large number of useful sources, the author would have made her work more rigorous if she included in her bibliograhy translated copies of her secondary sources along with William Fulke's manual.A work which should be read in conjunction with Professor Ann Moyer is: ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES IN THE AGE OF HUMANISM (1962, 1971) by Rudolf Wittkower, where in chapter four is found a scholarly in-depth treatise of Renaissance Italy's dependence on Plato's 'Timaeus'; Pythagorean number theory; and Plato's musical scales, for the practical application of Renaissance architectural ratio and proportion, without Boethius's ARITHMETIC; while, unintentionally, providing clear and precise explanations of the ratio formulas and proportions found in the rules of Rithmomachia.This good work: THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME by Dr. Ann Moyer, is useful to anyone studying the historical influence which the Boethian text, ARITHMETIC, had on a Quadrivium education; but (at $65.00 and 205 pages) might disappoint the serious player of Rithmomachia."},{"Title":"The Marvelous Microwave","review":"Home cooking for today demands as much speed, simplicity, and good taste as we demand from a great tasting restaurant. \\"The Marvelous Microwave\\" is a tool that helps provide the self-confidence to the busy home cook of today.

The narrator is Claire Raphael, and she's a successful business owner who earns about five times more than her husband does. It never bothered her that she made more money than her husband did. She loved him unconditionally.Unfortunately, because she was so absorbed in her job and her children, she failed to see that Dennis was starting to resent her success. After she returns from a trip to visit her ailing mother, she finds that he has filed for divorce and has taken custody of the kids and kicked her out of the house. She has no where to go, except to her best friend and business partner, Brody. Unfortunately, one of the things Dennis has accused her of is infidelity and he claims she has been sleeping with Brody, which is not true at all. Claire has no idea how to fight back, since Dennis is telling all sorts of lies about her and the judge has taken his side.I have to say this is one of my favorite books by Delinsky so far. The plot was well-developed, making it a fast read with so much going on - Claire's issue with her own family (sibling rivalry and a mother that has only seen Claire as the good daughter), Claire's need to be with her children, and finally the demise of her marriage. The reader will watch as Claire goes through the legal motions to get her life back, and with the help of a lawyer who actually cares (as opposed to the judge who seems to think all women belong barefoot and pregnant), Claire fights for what belongs to her. Some may see this as a somewhat soap-opera-ish type of novel, but I found myself wanting to read this in one sitting and wishing Claire could find a way to fight back against her husband."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"I love this book because the writing is excellent but the story is one of the most compelling I've ever read. Delinsky made me care about the characters, to the point where I wanted to cry, laugh and scream at times.

I think this is the best Delinsky book I've read thus far."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"Bravo for Barbara Delinsky. A Woman's Place captures the real-life trauma one woman faces when her world falls apart. This book is smart, thoughtfu, realistic and, for me, portrayed each character with balance and tolerance. I was struck particularly by the main character's strength and how she was able to negotiate and survive one of the most difficult experiences a woman can face. As a reader, I felt her horror and her confusion; this is the sign of a well-crafted and successful book. I heartily recommend A Woman's Place and look forward to Barbara's next book"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"The premise is not terribly original, but Delinsky does a good job with it, weaving a realistic tale of a woman who finds herself turned out of her own home without her children. It was the realism of the plot that captured and held my attention. Definitely not an action-packed plot...this roller coaster is an emotional one. This is a book about the punches life can throw, about learning to examine one's own frailties, about growth and maturity. All in all, a pretty satisfying read."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"The book begins with a glossy 8x10 picture of life. Claire has her family, her children, her marriage and her career and, theneverything falls apart. She is booted out of her home, her husband wants a divorce and she looses custody of her children who were her life.Barbara Delinsky identifies each character in such a way a reader cannot but feel like he/she really knows each person. I had feelings for each character and felt sorry, happy,angry and even love for each of the characters at one time or another during the story.In the end, each character finds his or her strengths and understandings of the situation they were in and become emotionally healthy again. Scars are left in everyone's life but pain does not stop life from going on.I highly recommend the book for anyone who likes love stories, stories about life's struggles and triumps or books about surviving life's tragic surprises."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"This was a great book. I couldn't put it down from the moment I began reading. It made me angry in the beginning and happy at the end. It showed the growth of all the characters, including the children.

Pick this one up if you like a page turner!"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"I thought that A WOMAN'S PLACE was very well written and timely. One of Delinsky's few books that did not have a &quot;happy&quot; ending in the sense of all's well that ends well. Its ending of compromise reflects the compromises that most of us have to make today. Things don't always work out the way we want them to and we don't always do things as well as we would like. The book made me think about the changing roles of women within the family dynamic. The setting, especially the introduction of the lighthouse, was excellent and the story was riveting. The smallest details picked up the nuances of everyday family life and the book was very realistic as well as being a great story"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"Yes, A Woman's Place is a departure from previous Barbara Delinsky books, but Claire Raphael is reacting the way women would in the REAL world when confronted with a divorce and custody battle as well as a takeover bid for her business.Barbara Delinsky has Claire react the way any normal woman would who was involved in a nasty custody battle - first with shock, dismay, and then finally with gusto.Only poor fiction would have the heroine become an &quot;aggressive bitch&quot; immediately, going after the husband without confronting their feelings.Barbara Delinsky does a great job in having us commiserate with Claire, in feeling her pain, and in rooting her on towards achieving some well-deserved happiness at the end.&lt;BR"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"I picked up three BD novels from the library and have read them in a space of 1.5 weeks...a tribute to her writing. Yet, try as I might I simply dont find her characters fully developed or believable. Dennis, Claires' husband is a total ogre..but somewhere towards the end there is a subltle shift in depiction. We see shades of sensitivity in him (ending up in joint custody) and feel frustrated as to why we didnt get a better insight into his feelings about why the marriage failed. we get some hints in passing when Claire admits that she may have been too controlling but I wish this theme had been expolored more. This has been my main complaint about her books so far: she TRIES to appear balanced without giving the reader enough material to judge themselves. I understand this is woman's fiction but she always has her male characters less than fully developed...it wouldnt matter if they (like Dennis) werent so central to the book.And for some reason that baffles me, I simply dont identify or fully sympathesize with any of her heroines, even though the author throws every possible misery at her in this book....it could be because of the missing pieces that I mentioned above.I think I am giving up on her novels for now."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"This was the first Delinsky book I'd ever read, but I thought it was absolutely wonderful.

She raised her two children (Johnny and Kikit) while helping her husband Dennis with his career. At the same time, Claire has been successful in converting a hobby into a national franchise business, Wickerwise. When she returns from visiting her dying mother in Ohio, Claire is shocked to be served with divorce papers claiming that her business has forced her to abandon her family. Dennis demands alimony, custody of the children, and child support.As Claire and Dennis face each other across a courtroom, they both obtain comfort in the arms of other people. Claire turns to her business partner, sensitive Brody Parth. Dennis turns to his attorney for solace. The hearings are before Judge Selwey, who knows the proper place for a woman. As the separated spouses spar with each other, the obvious victims appear to be their children. Claire knows that she must think of their welfare first, but will that cost her their love and her dignity?A WOMAN'S PLACE is an interesting analysis of gender reversal in the legal system. Claire is the breadwinner struggling to keep some legal rights in raising her children. Barbara Delinsky writes a very fascinating tale that will remind readers of KRAMER vs. Kramer.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"This novel is about the trials and tribulations of a woman who is being divorced by her ex-husband.Central character Claire Raphael seems pretty passive and simply stands by while her husband takes custody of her kids and takes her to the cleaners because she has her own business and earns more money than the ex-husband.There needed to be more conflict and drama. Maybe, Claire could have kidnapped the children or taken revenge on her ex, for the sake of plot suspense and momentum. Instead, poor Claire waits for the legal system to dole out what little she does end up with.Also, Claire has to deal with her aging and dying mother, Connie. Why do characters in Barbara Delinsky books call their mothers by their first names always?Coming off the surreal and mystical \\"Three Wishes\\" by Barbara Delinsky, \\"A Woman's Place\\" was a let-down, due to the central character's (In \\"Woman's Place\\") inability to take action, no matter what it was, regarding her sad situation.The book just plods along while central character, Claire waits for her situation to change. This novel comes closest to repetitive Danielle Steel novels, since much of \\"A Woman's Place\\" is taken up by Claire doing nothing but endlessly and incessantly complaining about her lot in life instead of pro-actively doing something about it."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"What a great book to help empower any women going through divorce.

Her world falls apart when her husband files for divorce, tries to milk her for all she has and take custody of the kids too. See how strong woman picks herself up and conquers all. Usual stuff.

It keeps your attention. I could walk a long time on the treadmill while getting absorbed in this book"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"Overall, I felt this was a reasonable read although the characters were somewhat stereotyped. There is the ogre husband, the superwoman wife being ripped off every which way, the laconic, laid back male business partner. I thought that the husband was so skillful in looking after the children when he apparently had had little to do with them previously, was unbelievable and to be honest, the heroine was so super efficient that she left me exhausted. She is amazed that her marriage is ended even though the husband had tried to break up with her a couple of times beforehand. That she is handed a court order to vacate the house when she comes home from a trip to see her dying mother, is just a wee bit understandable! If this is what it takes to get her attention, then the husband must have been desperate. However, we soon discover that he has been planning his coup for months and there is a femme in the background. Throw in a child with a particularly violent allergy and that's the mix!An okay read :)"},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"Delinsky portrays divorce with accurate detail. The discussions, the turmoil, the different stories and the unfairness of what is accepted in court is amazing. These guardians are horrors, resentful and since they are just people, they have biases, likes and dislikes that have nothing to do with the children. Excellent portrayal of the judicial system and its slow ugly treatment of women in divorce. Excellent read."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"If you have never read Barbara Delinsky and love women issues and stories then you are missing out.In \\"A Woman's Place\\", the heroines Claire Raphael returns home from a successful business trip and is served divorce papers by her apparently estranged husband. Claire had no idea that her marriage was on the skids. He also gained custody of their children claiming protection from her erratic and unstable behavior.In the process, Claire discovers all the awful pitfalls of her marriage and the illusions she lived under to keep things going.With sensitivity, clarity and amazing story telling Delinsky brings out the best and the worst of her heroine with honesty and integrity. A peak at our judicial system also which could frustrate some. An excellent read for any woman but especially for the ones who need to know that justice prevails.Loved this book. It is a wonderful read. Own it."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"As another reviewer has stated, this is a successful business woman's worst nightmare -- a husband who secretly plots to divorce you, to take your children and your business, and who execute all this while you are miles across the country with your own mother who is dying. Throw in a conflicted relationship with a younger sister and your single male boss to add to the stress level.The story is told from the point of view of the business woman -- Claire Raphael. Delinsky does a superb job of making the reader understand (and at times drown in) the angst of that Claire feels as she suffers one defeat after another, and she sees less and less of her children.The most unrealistic part of the book is that the conniving, scheming, soon-to-be ex-husband is actually a great father, and handles laundry, child care, and meals without a nanny. HA HA HA. True fiction.The book is, at times, hard to bear -- the idea of a court making a preemptory ruling taking your own children from you without hearing your side -- all based on lies -- is hard to contemplate.Overall, a pretty good read, but not a feel good book."},{"Title":"A Woman's Place","review":"If you want a relaxing read, DON'T choose this book. Although it has a compelling storyline, it made me so uptight that I could read only small sections at a time. A very caring and smart business woman is totally 'raked over the coals' by her indifferent (and jealous) husband who suddenly changes character in front of her very eyes. Or was she too focused on other things to notice subtle changes in his attitude? Heads up all wives---if your hubby mentions several different times that he wants a seperation---sit up and take notice!! Don't sweep it under the rug. You just might prevent the nightmare scenario that developed in this story. This is only the second book by Delinsky that I've had the opportunity to read.

This is a delightful children's Christmas picture book which illustrates the true meaning of the Christmas Spirit. It is Christmas Eve and young Henry Chance is rushing home from the Christmas Eve service when he discovers the school bully, Buck O'Grady, who is celebrating Christmas Eve all alone. Henry sees a longing and loneliness in Buck's eyes and invites him home to his family's Christmas dinner. Buck experiences a hearty welcome, a wonderful meal and family fun and great relationships. While Henry's family is exchanging Christmas presents, Henry observes a forlorn expression on Buck's face and his heart goes out to Buck. Buck's expression was not one of envy but rather a deep hunger for a home like Henry's where love and laughter flowed and where a loving father and mother watched over the family. Buck didn't have any of this in his stoop. When Henry saw Buck's expreesion, he knew what he must do. You will want to read this book to find out how Henry applied what he learned at the Christmas Eve service that night. This book is a gem that reflects the true meaning of the Christmas Spirit. \\"The Christmas Pea Coat\\" can be read in 15 minutes but, oh, the message of the book is more powerful than a 400 page novel."},{"Title":"Raising Susan: A Man, a Woman, and a Golden Eagle","review":"Bill Burns has done an exemplary job of capturing the interaction between Susan, a golden eagle with a five foot wing span, four inch claws and a brutal beak and Cecil and Adele Hyndman. Their challenging and intimate relationship with Susan took place over a twenty-five year period. The meticulous notes that Cecil kept of Susan the eagle and some three hundred other birds he cared for in Feartherland provide us with insight and understanding of birds not recorded elsewhere. It was Cecils dream to be recognized not as an untrained ameteur bird lover but rather as an authority on birds and their capacity to interact in amazing ways with humans.Burns has enabled Cecil to do this in relating what he learned about the golden eagle who shared such a major part of his life. If you love eagles this story will surprize and amaze you. Burns has written a very fine book."},{"Title":"Raising Susan: A Man, a Woman, and a Golden Eagle","review":"This book surprised me. I am not inclined to read books about humans relating to birds or animals. Once I began to read Raising Susan, however, I became increasingly captived. It told an amazing story in a seamlessly detailed and dramatic way. With a man, a woman, and a golden eagle as its protagonists, the story is really a strange love story, filled with obstacles, breakthroughs, heartbreak, joy, and even violence, as the eagle attacks the man who seeks to be close to her. Read it and believe it."},{"Title":"Raising Susan: A Man, a Woman, and a Golden Eagle","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable nature stories I have ever read; full of drama and even physical conflict as Susan, the abused golden eagle the Hyndmans brought to their avian santcuary, attacked Cecil Hyndman. Not once, but three times, almost blinding him in the most serious attack. Yet Susan showed she had a less fercious side, bonding so closely with Adele she was able to stroke and kiss the large eagle with an almost 8-foot wingspan. Susan responded with physical proof of her deep attachment to Adele by laying 17 eggs in captivity, some directly into Adele's hands -- the only female eagle to do so in captivity. The Hyndmans raised other large birds of prey at Featherland, including a female great horned owl that also laid 14 eggs. The Hyndmans were also famous for teaching many birds considered untrainable to speak. They were referred to as modern-day &quot;Dr. Dolittles&quot; -- an apt description. This book tells the intertwined and convoluted story of what must surely be one of the oddest love stories ever -- between a man, a woman and a golden eagle."},{"Title":"Women and Globalization","review":"The book is accessible to non-academic readers and perfect for college courses in ethnic studies, women's studies, cultural studies, political science, and others. Its primary goal is to expose and analyze globalization's exploitation of poor women, mostly in labor and migration; a secondary goal is to expose and analyze most academics' misunderstandings of this exploitation, a misunderstanding that, according to the closing argument by editor Aguilar, practically re-colonizes the already exploited. Exploitation on all continents and several island nations is covered. But the tone is not desperate and resigned. Rather, the writers here advocate a committed and informed urgency. One contributor argues that \\"international solidarity is necessary\\" in the work of ending the exploitation of impoverished women, but she insists that her \\"global vision\\" is realizable."},{"Title":"Women and Globalization","review":"The collection of articles in Women and Globalization is important for activists, scholars, and concerned human beings looking to understand how corporate globalization relies on the exploited labor of women (from around the world) to generate profits. The diverse writings discuss the concrete conditions of women who are working in such places as Mexico, the Philippines, and South Africa. Furthermore, the writings congeal to provide a clear, explanatory, and absolutely critical analysis of a global economic system that is seeping with contradictions. I highly recommend this book! It is an important read with a great balance of case study material and theory."},{"Title":"Women and Globalization","review":"This book offers an unfiltered analysis and critique of the effects of globalization, past and present, on nations in the developing world. The contributors of the book account for the neoliberal policies implemented by international financial institutions and governments, and how those policies deeply affect peoples' labor and migratory patterns. Additionally, \\"Women and Globalization\\" pays particular attention to culture, society, race, economics, the environment, and politics and how they are all interrelated within the circumstances of women's lives, as women are the majority of the world's laborers."},{"Title":"Women and Globalization","review":"I knew Delia Aguilar at the University of Connecticut and found her to be fearless in her analysis of women and society --it is always worthwhile reading what she has to say."},{"Title":"Women and Globalization","review":"Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the effects of globalization on women. Delia Aguilar and Anne Lacsamana's book is essentially a compilation of articles written by various people concerned with exposing the horrendous conditions women face due to globalization's neoliberal policies. The essays explore a wide range of issues affecting Third World women, including the effects of structural adjustment programs, the conditions in sweatshops, sex trafficking, etc. While some of the articles can be a bit lengthy and dry, the book contains a wealth of invaluable information--this is a must read for anyone who doubts the negative effects of globalization!"},{"Title":"Intermountain Flora Vol. 4: The Asteridae Except the Asteraceae","review":"The seven volumes of the Intermountain Flora (the final one will be published in the next few years) are the finest works ever on the flora of the West.

There is no heroics, no hero braving enemy fire and single handedly thwarting the oppositions plans. This book is about the real truth. About soldiers in despair, fearing their lives everytime they go out. It is about how wars change people. Wars are about danger and death, and not about medals and awards. For every single person receiving a bravery award, countless unknown soldiers have laid down their lives. A lovely book. Read it and be transported into the battlefield. On guard!"},{"Title":"Declarations of War","review":"Len Deighton (LD)'s late debut and worldwide success with 'The Ipcress File' in 1962 inspired him to write some 40 more books. Most of them dealt with espionage, incl. three trilogies with the same protagonist/hero, and some on French cooking. A number of highly-acclaimed books of LD have focussed on WW II: 'Bomber' describes the terrifying risks accepted by hastily-trained flight crews primed to disable wartime-Germany; 'Winter' is a warm, convincing German family history from 1899 to 1945; 'SS/GB' is a plausible account of what life would have been like in the UK if Hitler Germany had won the Battle of Britain, and the resistance it would have provoked.Comparing LD with John Le Carre (JLC) and Ian Fleming (IF), creator of James Bond, all highly-successful British spy writers in the 1960's and 70s, would require many pages. They are very different writers, but all three played intelligence roles in real life. Leaving aside IF, LD is a compulsive and fast writer, turning every idea into a chapter or a story. His early heroes are often nameless and versions of himself, writing in the I-form, turning readers into helpless creatures galloping after the hero to keep up with the twists and turns of the plot. The plots of LD's early novels appear more improvised and more infused with irony and flippancy than JLC's. His early preoccupation with promising forms of technology and the impact of WW II more than compensate for these weaknesses, if they are weaknesses.In contrast, all of JLC's novels appear carefully plotted, and show little interest in the technological advances made in earlier years and decades. Also, his attitudes towards the British ruling stratum are different from LD's. Whilst LD's heroes are flippant about authority and the upper class, JLC's often sad, past-their-prime protagonists are either part of, or married into this cast. JLC is British, LD is mid-Atlantic as regards foreign allegiance and sympathies.Collections of short stories are hard to review in a few hundred words. 'Declarations of War' is a collection of 13 stories, outburst of LD's desire and urge, during his most creative years, to provide the reader with more material to make informed judgments on warfare and espionage."},{"Title":"Scots Thesaurus","review":"This Scots Thesaurus is divided into 15 different sections which makes locating the words a lot easier when you are really busy.1.

I first read it quite a few years ago, and felt it touch truths that I didn't dare go near previously. Thank you, Ms. Sarton, for sharing your world, for daring to articulate what really goes on in the mind. Everyone should give it a shot, and maybe another because its different each time I read her words. Sometimes I'm receptive, sometimes not; after all, we are all reading through our own lens."},{"Title":"Journal of a Solitude","review":"Written over a period of twelve months, May Sarton's Journal Of A Solitude (1973) is a meditation on life, living alone, romantic love, and the creative process.Composed in diary form, the book was produced while Sarton was living alone in a small village in rural New Hampshire. By 1973, Sarton was fifty-eight years of age and an established novelist and poet who had known and corresponded with such literary luminaries as Virginia Woolf and Hilda Doolittle.Journal Of A Solitude is a warm, touching, very human book, which, after its successful publication, became the cornerstone upon which Sarton's uneasy reputation has settled. But Journal Of A Solitude also reveals Sarton to have been something of an odd duck modestly dressed in the clothing, mores, and mannerisms of a gentile Belgian lady.Sadly, what Sarton seems determined not to come to terms with is that she was a tepid, literal - minded poet as well as a less than first- rate literary novelist; this is important, because the lack of critical attention her work received (\\"What I have not had is the respect due what is now a considerable opus\\") is a constant theme of the book and source of tension. As a result, \\"ornery\\" Sarton shifts continuously between states of creative over appraisal and damning self recrimination. Sarton's quoted poems clearly reveal a lack of lyrical skill and an absence of any visionary power whatsoever. Though she states, \\"Whatever peace I know rests in the natural world,\\" Journal Of A Solitude also reveals a tender-hearted animal lover and enthusiastic gardener who nonetheless appears to lack a higher sense of nature as a symbol, sign, or metaphor for the transcendent forces evident in human reality.Badly advised by friend and poet Louise Bogan to \\"keep the Hell\\" out of her work, Sarton, accepting Bogan's suggestion, struggles daily with a devastating, irrational temper, depression serious enough to drive her to suicidal states, loneliness, and, at only fifty-eight, a sense of herself as \\"old, dull, and useless.\\" Sarton, who appears to have surprisingly little self-knowledge for a person of her maturity, is haunted by reoccurring image of \\"plants, bulbs, in the cellar, trying to grow without light, putting out white shoots that will inevitably wither,\\" but doesn't consciously relate this image directly to herself or her difficult present. When a close friend visits for several days, Sarton is incensed when the woman makes an offhand comment about the faded state of a vase of flowers (though as the photographs included reveal, flower arranging was not among Sarton's talents). Clearly, some or most of Sarton's \\"hell\\" should have gone into and fueled her creative work, as it does in the case of most artists. Is appears that there were many things in her life that Sarton simply didn't want to confront or acknowledge.Sarton makes contradictory statements about God and her religious beliefs, commenting first that writing poetry is her method of communicating with God, but later states, \\"I am not a believer.\\" Though she frequently writes at length about the emancipation of women and the need for the abolition of gender roles, she also makes generalized statements like \\"nurturing is women's work,\\" and believes that \\"blacks\\" have the \\"grace and instinct and intuitive understanding\\" necessary for the nursing profession. Today, Sarton's expression \\"we have so much to learn from them (\\"blacks\\")\\" sounds like well-intended but unconsciously smug pandering.Sarton was not an intellectual, but the limited perspective cumulatively elaborated in her novels and poetry found a ready audience in \\"nice\\" like-minded women for whom more challenging authors like Muriel Spark, Isak Dinesen, Virginia Woolf, Jean Rhys, Katherine Anne Porter, or Jane Bowles apparently represented an arduous uphill climb. What the book does illustrate is the danger of making an unquestioning habit of \\"impeccable\\" WASP manners and politeness over a lifetime. Sarton, her close friends, and colleagues all appear to exist in a brittle world where truthful communication and direct, honest criticism are to be strenuously avoided in the name of continued social niceties.Sadly, the success of Journal Of A Solitude had an ultimately negative effect on Sarton's career, as she began producing journal volume after journal volume (Recovering, At Seventy, After The Stroke, Endgame: A Journal Of The Seventy-ninth Year, etc.), of which only The House By The Sea, which immediately followed the present volume, had the same freshness, integrity, and lack of self - consciousness. Sarton was soon to become a cottage industry for her publishers, turning out further volumes of banal poetry--\\"Moose In The Morning\\"--and, like Edith Sitwell in old age, simply publishing too much without due editorial consideration.Journal Of A Solitude does reflect a genuine, shadow-casting human presence as well as a state of being which many people, especially the creative, the introverted, and those moving uncertainly towards later life may respond to fully. Sarton's moments of anxiety, despair, and doubt, as well as her stoicism, fortitude, and courage, are sincerely expressed, touching, and inspiring. Sarton accurately perceived herself to be country-loving, intelligent, and serenity-seeking individual who put a high premium on the simpler aspects of life. But for an author who had over twenty books published by 1973 and who was on a first-name basis with some of literature's most notoriously critical figures, Sarton was a surprisingly unsophisticated person. As a result, it is the fallible human being, and not the creative writer, who shines most brightly in Journal Of A Solitude."},{"Title":"Journal of a Solitude","review":"The first of Sarton's Jornals, this one introduces the readers to the players -- both human and animal -- that make return appearances in her subsequent journals. In these pages, Sarton provides us with a view of one who looks closely at the everyday. She examines larger themes as well creating a journal that speaks plainly of the seasons and the cycles of life."},{"Title":"Journal of a Solitude","review":"reading this book was like meditation for me.

I was alone in a new neighborhood with few family and friends around me and felt completely estranged from my former life as a professional woman working in New York city. May Sarton's story - shared in such a real and heartfelt way - has always stayed with me. Where are the May Sarton's in today's world?

As a fellow lesbian and poet, I would like to commend May Sarton's journal both for its discretion and lack of temerity. To think that she wrote her most meaningful work several decades ago, yet one can so easily relate to it today! Her universality speaks for itself - I am sure that very few women will be unable to resist responding to her revelations, whatever their standpoint on sexuality. I just wish so very much that I could have had the privilege of corresponding with her."},{"Title":"Journal of a Solitude","review":"I've read most of Sarton's journals and this is by far the best.

The eleven chapters cover such topics as being the hostess with the mostess, pampering yourself, working with contractors, storage solutions, decorating, and ways to clean your home. Also offered is detailed advice on camping and picnics, finding treasures at flea markets, tasty after dinner treats, and choosing the perfect present for practically anyone or any occasion you could think of. There are even a few pages on how to hire and deal with your \\"staff\\"...okey dokey.....Also included: Tips on how to not only make house guests feel at home but pampered. Dealing with sneaky clothes devouring moths. Organizing everyday items with flair. The best ways to communicate with contractors. Suggestions on choosing color, lighting, cushions, second hand linens, and home scents. Imaginative ideas for using various containers, ironing, throwing a memorable party, and wrapping presents.The author Rita Konig is a British columnist who aims her domestic advise at young British professionals like herself, but most of her suggestions would translate well for the American equivalent. If you are a renter who is not a social butterfly and/or detests the outdoors, much of the content in this book will be useless to you.

The writer admits to never having had enough money to get a kitchen with drawers, I guess that's because she advises you to go out and buy something, preferably a spa product, every time you feel fat. So, fat is the same as sad/down/frustrated, and the one meaningful thing to lift your spirits is getting a new nail polish or face mask. Also, domestic staff is always female, no doubt about that, and should speak the same language you do. I am going to go and hit my head against the wall now.If your only aspiration in life is to spend all your time dusting and wiping down open shelves filled with your fat-frustration-bought face masks and hair treatments (yes, the author recommends open shelves for all your face masks, because they look pretty, and when you're down, you should wipe the shelves, because it calms you down), this book might be right for you!"},{"Title":"Sky determines","review":"Keep in mind now that I have not read the book, I am only noting what I heard that hooked me enough to put it on my wish list.I was reading &quot;Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen&quot;, impressions of Texas by Larry McMurtry. Larry McMurtry was talking about the western sky. He said that while driving from Virginia back home to Texas he would notice, after crossing the Mississippi, a lifting of his spirits due to the widening view of the sky. He felt closed in by the limited view of the sky in the wooded areas of the east. He quoted another author who expressed the same feeling, and he then specifically recommended this book for addressing this feeling.At the same time that Larry McMurtry was talking about the sky he was talking about the arid land of west Texas, and how difficult it was to establish life there. He recommended this book, written in the 1940,s, as a good study on the accomodations living creatures must make to aridity.That's enough for me."},{"Title":"The conduct of the Chaco War","review":"If you only have one book on the Chaco Conflict, then get this book! This is a must read for anyone interested in the Chaco Dispute pre-war, the Chaco War, & the post-war Peace Conference.Today there are 3 general books on the conflict in English. Zook, 1960; Farcau, 1996; and English, 2007. Zook's is by far the best. Zook does a much better job with maps, with sources, and covering the periods before the war broke out in June 1932 and after the armistice in June 1935. And Zook's prose is mostly highly readable. But having said that, Farcau's is the most enjoyable to read as he does a far better job bringing the horrors of the soldiers' daily lives in plain view, has some wonderful anecdotes, did some extensive interviewing of participants, and covers the Bolivian political and military machinations with a detailed eye. Farcau is let down by having only a single 1 page map and an obvious Bolivian sourcing bias, nor does he adequately cover the periods before or after the war. English's work is just too amateurish and mundane to recommend against Zook or Farcau, though it is filled with great photographs. But English's is cheaper. The single best work covering the before and after war periods is Rout, 1970 (The Politics of the Chaco Peace Conference). So get Zook for the initial global perspective, Farcau for life on the front lines and in the generals' tents, and Rout for the diplomatic details of the entire history of the overall conflict. I'd recommend reading them in that order.The maps alone are worth Zook's book. But carefully study the maps BEFORE reading the book. They are somewhat oddly placed and sometimes a map much earlier or later in the book can help in a particular chapter. Four maps deserve special mention: Zone of Initial [opposing force] Concentrations, p. 87; Main Theatre of Operations, 1932-1933, p. 95; Strongest Campaign, April-May 1934, p. 181; and Bolivian Retreat after El Carmen, December 1934, p. 211. Every book on the Chaco War would be so lucky to have these four outstanding maps that really help the reader.This 1960 book is a \\"sequel\\" to Zook's work \\"The Evolution of the Chaco Dispute\\", 1959 (which may be his PhD dissertation). I have been unable to locate a copy of this work, but I assume Zook has incorporated much of its ideas, if not also, its content into this book.Zook \\"broke\\" the fact that the final border drawn was NOT the result of any outside arbital conference, but had been secretly agreed to by both sides in July 1938.The only major failing is the rush Zook makes of the last 6 months of the war. This is actually a most varied period with significant activity all along the Western Front and in the Northern Front, but Zook only dedicates a mere 17 pages to the war in all of 1935 (pgs. 228-244). Zook should've spent more time on this vital period. So the end feels rushed and incomplete, even though most of the raw facts are told. He just doesn't provide the level of detail as he did for 1932 war events (pgs. 69-128), 1933 war events (pgs. 128-174), or 1934 war events (pgs. 174-227). Sadly, Farcau makes the same horrible mistake, if not worse!Zook has some quirks in his writing style. Instead of saying \\"Paraguayan\\", he usually writes \\"Quarani\\" and he often calls the Bolivians \\"Andeans\\" or those on the \\"Altiplano\\". Also, his extensive and valuable chapter endnotes are tied to a numerical citation per paragraph, at the end of the paragraph. So sometimes there are multiple citations in the endnote but there is no way for the reader to link up the specific citation with any specific sentence in the paragraph! All one knows is that in the lengthy paragraph read the author refered to a plethora of specific sources. (See Rout's book for the preferred way to do specific text citations in footnotes or endnotes.)While Zook is an Air Force Captain and Asst. Professor of History at the USAF Academy, he really does expend much effort on the air war. He provides little in the way of equipment or how the respective planes were actually utilized. He mainly just opines that Bolivia failed to use its superior airpower to interdict Paraguayan supply lines and depots, and that Paraguay lacked the forces necessary to do more than reconnaissance.The extensive Bibliography is still most valuable to anyone reading Farcau's or English's more recent works. The Bibliographic Essay is very valuable in helping readers find more credible sources from the various partisans over the years.My copy came with the original errata sheet which shows 3 errors. But the last map, the one showing the final border delination, is incorrect. It wrongly shows Paraguay receiving the Petropolis Cessation in the far northeast, which Bolivia kept.We can only hope that someday this wonderful book is republished! And updatesd by someone? For example, Bolivia and Paraguay didn't finalize their border until 2009 and the military border marking commission was still at work in 1970 (when Rout published).Here are the contents:- 1-page Publisher's Note- 1-pg map of the pre-war diplomatic/treaty proposals to settle the Chaco border, 1879-1907- 3-pg Preface, by Paraguayan diplomat/scholar Pablo Ynsfran (edited Estigarribia's Memoirs), which starts on p. 9- 4-pg Forward by Bolivian scholar Charles Arnade- 1-pg Acknowledgments (by author)- 2-pg Table of Contents- 1-pg Maps [A List of] [there are 12, 11 in the primary text]- 2-pg Introduction (by author)- Primary text, pages 25-258, with 11 maps in 9 chapters (see below).- 2-pg Bibliographic Essay- 9-pg Bibliography- 8-pg Index (ending on p. 280)There are no photographs or line drawings.Here are the 9 chapters of the primary text:1.

For a more comprehensive biography pick up &quot;Rudy&quot; by Wayne Barrett."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"I picked this book up to read on a flight from Providence to Phoenix. I never put it down and read the whole book by arrival. It is an incredibly readable book. As far as I understand it was oringinally published before sept 11th so most of the book is unbiased by the great acts the mayor performed on that day and afterword. This being siad the author is great at detailing the intricacies of New York politics. A worthwhile read for anyone who didnt experience the Guliani era first hand(in NY). As another reviewer siad it does lack detail and certainly is in no way a biography of the man. The book is a political biography the starts in 1988 and ends in 2001."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"Giuliani is an interesting subject on any account, whether you personally like him or not. Kirtzman's account is very detailed and shows extensive research - but, and this is a big &quot;BUT&quot;, he struggles in producing a book that you do not want to put down.He bombards the reader from the outset with names that may not be familiar to non-New York journalists or the ordinary reader, and he finds it difficult to set the scene for the next &quot;act&quot; in Giuliani's attempts to gain and/or maintain power over NY City.Kirtzman may be a good writer of 500 - 1,000 word articles, but a whole book has clearly been a fight that he did not win.Still, because of the subject matter, a book that should be read, even though it is hard work."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"This is not a traditional biography, which was what I expected when I picked up the book. If you wish to know about Rudy's life before 1989, his first marriage, childhood, days as U.S. attorney, this is not the right book for you. The first 100 pages or so this book are a bit slow--too much campaign stuff and not enough on governing. However, the narrative picks up quickly over the last 200 pages. We learn about Rudy's mistakes and triumphs--of which there are many. You learn a ton about Rudy's controversial policies. The personal scandals are discussed, but not in a malicious way. We never learn about the details of his mysterious marriage to Donna Hanover--or anything much about Hanover. So, yes, things are left out. However, Al Sharpton is a fascinating character here. You learn about Rudy's day on Sept. 11, when the author was actually running around the city with the Mayor. The narrative ends in 2001. I would have loved to hear more about Bloomberg, but who can change the publication date now? It isn't perfect, but Rudy remains one of the fascinating--and successful--Mayors of our time."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"If you're from New York City and you track city politics, then you're certainly familiar with Andrew Kirtzman. Kirtzman, who is a political reporter for New York 1 News, demonstrates an impressive grasp of both urban politics and personal drama with his first book, &quot;Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City.&quot; The book commences with Giuliani's unsuccessful race for mayor in 1989 and concludes with his stunning decision to withdraw from the U.S. Senate race just months ago. In that ten-year span, Kirtzman takes us through a roller-coaster ride of New York history. On November 7, 1989 New Yorkers elected David Dinkins as its 106th mayor over Rudy Giuliani. Two days later the Berlin Wall fell. Half a world a way, East Germans were awakening to the failure and misery of socialism. New Yorkers, it seemed, still didn't get it. The Dinkins era confirmed what most New Yorkers already feared: the City was an unmanageable wasteland. Tax-and-spend budgets. Racial demagoguery. Criminals ruling the streets. Mass incivility. In 1993, however, after four years of misrule, the City had a chance to reverse its mistake. The mayoral election pitted Dinkins and Giuliani against each other once again. This time, the former federal prosecutor triumphed. On that same day, New Jersey voters sent tax-and-spend Governor Jim Florio packing as well. Quietly, Northeast voters were heralding the Republican Revolution of 1994. The late 1990s would see the whole nation turn its back on liberalism. Rudy Giuliani was the first and most able practitioner of this New Politics. His first city budget combined spending cuts with tax cuts. For the first time in recent memory, New York would spend less money the next year than it did the previous year. The message to the business community was equally clear: Stay! We want you here and we'll create an environment where you can thrive. Giuliani challenged the bureaucracies and their union chiefs and rolled past them. He broke up the Mob and tightened the requirements for welfare. Most importantly, he teamed with Police Chief Bill Bratton in a new, tougher approach to crime-fighting. The results after just four years were staggering: crime in the city had been cut in half, hundreds of thousands of people had moved from the welfare rolls to the private sector, school test scores went up, annual budget surpluses became surpluses. In 1997, New York voters overwhelming re-elected &quot;Hizzonor.&quot; Since then, however, Rudy hasn't led such a charmed life. The city's &quot;quality of life&quot; statistics are still incredibly impressive. But his reputation has been tarnished by both his broken marriage and some police misconduct cases. The 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo and the later killing of Patrick Dorismond were highly unfortunate but they were also accidents. Giuliani's critics conveniently forget that under Rudy, police murder has fallen in half from the &quot;compassionate&quot; days of the Dinkins administration. When the ball dropped in Times Square on New Years Day 2000, New York was once again the capital of the world. The man who deserves most of the credit is Rudy Giuliani. No question about it. He may not win a personality contest. But he doesn't have to. He is simply the most successful mayor in New York City history and one of the most impressive politicians in the nation today. What must disturb New York residents is: Who will replace Rudy? He is required by law to step down as mayor in 2001. Will New Yorkers elect a man, who in his rush to show &quot;compassion,&quot; dismantle Rudy Giuliani's legacy? Will the crime laws be relaxed? Will the welfare requirements be eased? Will the unions return to their glory? The answer, sadly, is &quot;Most likely.&quot; Rudy Giuliani is an awesome mayor but every great leader must groom a successor who will ensure his legacy. In this one crucial category, Giuliani has proved to be mortal. But make no mistake: The Big Apple is Back -- thanks to Rudy Giuliani."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"This book was a major disappointment. Am I supposed to be impressed with the story that a black deputy mayor was twice stopped by cops and harassed? That's way old news, Mr. Kirtzman. If you're going to buy one of the Giuliani bios, don't waste your $$ on this one. Frankly, I would have been far more interested in Dominic Carter's appraisal of Giuliani. Not to mention Budd Mishkin's."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"This book could have been either a refreshingly new analysis of Guiliani's politics or an uproariously entertaining tale of his reign. It's neither.Kirtzman the New York 1 man likes to talk about the chain-smoking, styrofoam coffee cup world of political camapigns. He goes on and on about Ray Harding, Peter Powers, Bruce Teitelbaum, and of course Christyne Lategano. He's gossipy, BUT not gossipy enough to tell us whether Rudy and Christyne ever hooked up, or how Hizzoner met his &quot;very special friend&quot; from the East Side. There's no new dirt in this book.Kirtzman has the good sense to describe the opera buffa elements of this mayorality, but so many funny bits are left out! Where is Guiliani's aria against double-parking U.N. diplomats? His tantrum against Grammy organziers from LA? Only one sentence each about hot dog vendors, the downtown bunker, and New York magazine bus ads! Please!The author seems to think only in campaign terms. He never settles down to tell us about the work of governing or the debates about the actual impact of Guiliani's policies on New Yorkers. No mention of the controversy about methadone treatment or West Side stadiums, for example.Kirtman could also have told us something about the pre-1989 Guiliani, but he fails there too. Next to nothing about Rudy the student and Mob-busting lawyer.In conclusion, the book is a disapointment because it lacks detail and it doesn't say much that's new. The other new Guiliani book is probably better."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"I first set foot in New York City in late 1993, right before Giuliani entered the City Hall. NYC was a mess. I was scared riding in a car in Queens when the first time a 'spongee' came along to offer windshield wiping service. Or when riding in the subway we would not dare taking out a map or a camera,anything that could hint that we're tourists. Between 1996 and 1997 I went back and lived there for 9 months, which I enjoyed very much. During this time NYC was so absorbed into the new found prosperity and success of the financial markets/industry that I rarely heard people talking about the state of the city a mere 4 years ago. To say it's as safe as Tokyo is an exaggeration of course, but for such a high density big city, it was a hugely successful clean-up from 4 years ago. Homeless and graffitti is substantially less seen in the subway system. My friends and I would now have the guts to walk on the street at 3am...Then as time went on I heard the major had a lot to do with this change. And then I started hearing how local NYers describe Giuliani as such a fighter, never backed down from oppositions such as strike threat and stuff like that...After 911 WTC incident, I was very concerned about anything NY, having lived there for a little bit before. From the high-profile media appearance of Giuliani, I saw him maintaining the composure well enough to offer a symbol of calmness and toughness representing NY in the wake of the disaster towards the rest of the country and the world.Based on this and my past experience with NYC, reading this book is a joy. It's not just a story-book about how Giuliani came to power, how he succeeded and where he faltered, and from which an evaluation of his characteristics, philosophy and other inner traits. It's also an honest reflection of the social transformation of NYC during his 2 terms of mayorship. It's not easy for an average American to appreciate the unique nature of this society, whether it be racial, economic, crime or just social problems, because NY is so different from the American heartland. However, the book was particularly great for someone like me, who mostly knows the places and the background environment in which these incidents develop, but does not actually know the events described in the book much, if at all, because I'm not a local NYer.I thought the author has produced an honest account of both Giuliani's campaigns to the mayorship and also his major tasks and difficulties faced during the 2 terms. Being a journalist, the author has written the book in such a way that it reads very practical and fast. There's a lot of substance and facts in it, with quotes from many people around the major, which I think is a very direct and insightful way of peeping into the thinking/culture of the 'inner circle'. I think the author has done a great job connecting all these together to produce a seemless flow and smooth taste throughout the chapters of the book.For me who didn't know much about politics, this is also an eye-opener as it described the political power struggle and way of thinking so transparently by reflecting it on the daily events surrounding the major's agenda, and in general, the social happenings of a multi-racial, complex society.The only thing I would have liked to see more in this book is a little more words on how Giuliani reacted or what he has done, if any, that's related to the great boom of the American economy and hence the Wall Street during his 2nd term. But maybe that's not quite relevant to the grand schema of things for this book anyway. So even without that part which I'd be intersted to know more about, this is still a very engaging read!"},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"Who would have thought that a television journalist would be such a good writer? Kirtzman tells the story of this fascinating, tortured man like an old pro. It's a dramatic recounting of a moment in time that the author obviously felt the need to describe for the world. I didn't know any of the people he wrote about before I picked up the book, but his descriptions are really vivid, and the drama he builds makes us care about these characters. It's one of the better books I've read this year. Really well done."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"In the eighties there was Bonfire of the Vanities. In the year 2000, Rudy Guliani:Emperor of the City, Andrew Kirtzman's equally riveting tale of New York City and its real-life, larger-than-life mayor. A must read for anyone fascinated by the machinations of big-city politics and the impact of powerful personality on a populace."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"Having lived through those turbulent years and having to begrudginly give my approval to many of the things that he did,I find that the balance in this superbly written and easy to read study make me more comfortable with my feelings. Kirtzman doesn't take sides as much as he presents both sides allowing the reader to get a better feel for this complex and often forbidding and not forgiving mayor without sacrificing your basic reactions to the man. A must read."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"Rudy Giuliani must be a difficult man to write about just for the sheer abundance of anecodotes and controversies he has generated during his years in public office. Kirtzman edits these stories beautifully, however, producing a compelling narrative and, more importantly, a fascinating character study. The success of this book for me was in part a result of that editing; Kirtzman didn't make the mistake of so many modern biographies, giving us minutiae instead of insight. Instead, like a consummate reporter, he distilled a gripping story and a convincing portrait from the jumble of contradictions that is Rudy Giuliani."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"I was overwhelmed by the author's fairness about a mayor who either was loved or hated but never ignored. Mr. Kirtzman's book provided what has to be considered a fair and objective review of the mayor's positives and negatives. I never felt that the author was taking sides, I never knew where his bias was. Whenever it seemed that he was challenging the accepted wisdom about the mayor he would balance it with another point of view.It revealed that the mayor missed an opportunity to truly be the best when his need for total control limited his ability to be open with the entire city.Read this book, not just once but a second time."},{"Title":"Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City","review":"There is no question that Rudy Giuliani is a fascinating figure that has reshaped the political landscape of New York City. Kirtzman provides a fast-paced and entertaining account of Rudy's career from its beginning to the present, capturing both the highs and lows that many of us are familiar with, while not being aware of all the finer details. Thankfully he does not concern himself with sensationalizing his subject like another recent Giuliani biographer, painting a much more balanced portrait instead.

You have to admire his character as he shapes New York from the \\"Rotting Apple\\" as Time magazine portrayed it under Dinkins, to the \\"Capital of the World\\", as some call it today. While this book seems intent or attacking Giuliani at every turn, it can't hide the remarkable job that he did as Mayor. The book ends with him bowing out of the 2000 Senate race ,so it doesn't cover his apt handling of the Sept. 11th Attack recovery."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"For those of you who already own the Hedge Knight trade paperback that was originally published by Devil's Due, this is the exact same material you've already seen, re-released by Marvel Comics. It may have different cover art, but if you order the book expecting something new you will be disappointed. Now, on to the book itself...I was a bit skeptical when I heard that someone was going to adapt George R.R. Martin's Hedge Knight short story into graphic novel format, but I love comics so I gave it a try.The original Hedge Knight story, which appeared in the Legends anthology, was my introduction to Martin and his epic Song of Ice and Fire series. To be blunt, his writing ruined me for just about every other fantasy author. Nearly every other fantasy series pales in comparison.So how did the Hedge Knight, a relatively straightforward tale about a knight who attends a tourney and finds himself entangled in the affairs of princes, translate into comic book form?While Ben Avery's adaptation covers all of the main points of the story, it just doesn't have the same feeling. He does an admirable job, but it's still missing something intangible that the prose story gives the reader. I wish I could explain it better, but the feeling you get after reading this volume is similar to when you see a movie that has been adapted from one of your favorite books. It never quite measures up.Mike Miller's artwork is the book's saving grace. His renderings of Martin's characters matched the pictures I had in my head from reading the story so closely it was downright eerie. From the epic battles to the mundane sequences, Miller's artwork is a major enhancement to the overall storytelling. Seeing his interpretation of Martin's characters is more than worth the price of admission.This paperback collects the entire Hedge Knight limited series, plus a new story that leads into the second Hedge Knight story from Legends II. It may not please all George R.R. Martin fans, but it is a worthy attempt at adapting the story, and is well worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"To begin with, I have enjoyed the Song of Fire and Ice from the beginning, and I have been itching for the new book for some time. When I heard there was a graphic novel, I was both interested and disappointed. The first because it was another tale in a very interesting setting. The second because A Feast of Crows had been running late and would rather have had the book instead of the graphic novel. Upon reading the graphic novel, I found all of my fears allayed and that the book does more than just add to the setting of the Song of Fire and Ice.I was pleased to find that the novel used figures that had been mentioned in previous book. It allowed me not just to hear about them through other character's accounts and histories, but I was able to 'see' them for myself. The book added further depth to the already expansive world.I also discovered that the novel was based on a short story previously published in an anthology in LEGENDS, edited by Robert Silverburg. The story had been adapted to the comic book format later. Knowledge that the novel was based on a previously published story allayed any frustration I was feeling about Feast.Most importantly though, beyond my obsession with the Song of Fire and Ice, the story was an excellent display of chivalry and character. How the virtues of knighthood of protecting the innocent and poor combat with the corruption that grows among the nobility who make up this same order. The character is taught as a Hedge Knight he is the truest form of a knight, with no other allegiance than to his vows.I highly recommend this book not just for fantasy enthusiasts, but it is also a good moral tale, which is not necessarily straight forward."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"I first the discovered \\"The Hedge Knight\\" when reading the \\"Legends\\" short-stories collection -- it was my first introduction GRRM's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series and immediately led me to pick up \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" which I had owned for nearly a year without reading. The great thing about this graphic novel is that is does a great job of bringing a visual aspect to Martin's written words. In many ways, the artists just \\"got\\" the feeling of the short story and Martin's series down to a tee. This a great addition for any collector of Martin's work and a must-read for fans of the series."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"If I could, I'd give a copy of this comic book fantasy to every police officer, sheriff's deputy, and constable in the world. The story told is that of a Medieval morality play, in which what is right and what is \\"officially proper\\" are at odds with each other, as they often have been (and still are) in the real world. The \\"hedge knight\\" Duncan the Tall is a symbol for every good man who defies or fights an evil System for a noble cause. The story offers a reminder that while laws are written by men, morals are not, and that the world is sick when one forbids what the other requires.Seeking fame as a knight, Dunk and his recently acquired young squire go to a tournament. During the games, one of the king's grandsons, Aerion, takes offense at a puppet show being shown by a young woman puppeteer, so he \\"arrests\\" her and begins to beat her, breaking her fingers, while his guards hold off the crowd. Duncan hears of the trouble, charges through the crowd, tosses the guards every which way, and falls on the princeling in a fury of fists and feet.Knights must protect the weak and defend the innocent, even if the oppressor is someone with rank.The princeling's guards finally subdue Dunk, and the Aerion has threatened to break out all of Duncan's teeth and then disembowel him, when suddenly Duncan's squire appears and orders Aerion's guards to back off. And they do. It turns out that the squire, whom Duncan had known as \\"Egg,\\" is in reality a prince himself, shamed so badly by his brother's degeneracy that he ran away from home to live among the peasants.Duncan is charged with treason and held in a prison cell, not allowed to participate in the tournament games. Ancient laws give Sir Duncan the choice, either of having a hand and a foot cut off, or to face the prince in single combat. Duncan chooses the combat. The same ancient laws, however, give the princeling an option. Instead of facing Duncan alone, he can insist that he (and his party) fight Dunk (and his) in a sort of collective duel in which seven knights face seven knights in a joust-like battle -- but with real weapons of war, not with tournament mock weapons. The battle would continue until one side yields or until all the knights on one side are dead.The problem is that Duncan is a \\"nobody,\\" whereas the princeling can count on the help of several of his royal relatives and can command members of the king's guard to fight on his side. When Duncan protests that he knows of no one who will take his part, he's told (by Aerion's father) that his failure to come up with six champions to fight beside him, in the single day before the battle is to begin, will prove his guilt - the idea being that the world is full of good men, and good men always fight for a just cause.It is an assumption that is largely false, and the pretense to the contrary is no doubt highly convenient to those in power. But, nonetheless, Duncan does find six champions, despite the treacherous defection of one who was expected to volunteer. The last of the champions was Aerion's uncle, Prince Baelor, heir to his father's throne. Of all the royal characters, Baelor is the only one to concede that Duncan did right to punch Aerion in the face, and he is taking Duncan's side for the same reason that Duncan fought Aerion to save a puppetteer.The best moment of the book, though, is when Duncan enters the field early and is joyously mobbed by affectionate peasants. Duncan - never the brightest knight in the realm - asks himself out loud why the peasants love him so well: \\"What am I to them?\\"His answer is a reply from the armorer who made his shield: \\"A knight who remembered his vows.\\""},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"When I first saw this listed I thought Martin had done the same thing Jordan had done with \\"New Spring\\", in other words I thought he had taken the awesome short story from \\"Legends\\" and expanded it into a longer novel forcing me to spend extra money even though I had already shelled out for \\"Legends\\".Thanks to reading a couple of the reviews I learned I was horribly mistaken and had kept myself from enjoying an awesome story in comic form.It is the exact same story from the short story \\"The Hedge Knight\\" but as every reader knows the change of mediums from prose to comic gives the reader a new experience. I would never say that one or the other is better, that is up to the reader, but I would definitely say it is a real treat to be able to switch between the two. The artwork is beatiful and true to story, and I didn't feel that anything was left out that had been in the short story.My only disappointment is knowing they can't do the entire series in this form also."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"So much more than a comic, it's a graphic novel.

One of the great names is SIR DUNCAN THE TALL. So here we can see the begining of basic knightly virtues that make Dunk the Lunk, a man with the potential to rise as high as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Dunk's a great guy. So is his squire Egg...or His Magesty Aegon Targaryen(the Unlikely) 5th of his name. Hopefully there will more Dunk and Egg stories after the Sworn Sword(legends vol2).

I give the actual book 5 stars. This is the first edition graphic novel of \\"The Hedge Knight.\\" A year after thisThe Hedge Knight - Second Edition [Graphic Novel] was published, which contained a few new pages of artwork for some of the individual characters. A year after thatHedge Knight Volume 1 Premiere HC (Book Market Edition) (Hedge Knight)was published, which is hardcover, a little higher quality, and contains a few pages of artwork on the house sigils. The Hardcover edition is superior to both of those and should be purchased instead of this edition. There is minimal difference in price. ***\\"The Hedge Knight\\" is a novella based on the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series by George R.R. Martin, and takes place 100 years before the events depicted inA Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1). This is the first book regarding Martin's \\"Tales of Dunk and Egg\\" stories, and follow the exploits of a Hedge Knight (basically a knight who is not employed) named Dunk and his squire named Egg. THIS IS A GRAPHIC NOVEL (comic book) based on the story that was originally published inLegends: Short Novels By The Masters of Modern Fantasy, and follows Ser Dunk as he enters a jousting tournament only to find he is soon fighting for more than just recognition.For anyone who has read the Song of Ice and Fire series, \\"The Hedge Knight\\" follows the same writing style. Although the characters are new, most of the names have been mentioned by Martin in his previous books. I found that I had to do a little research after I read it to understand the families and who exactly the characters were as they relate to present events, but once I did I was pretty impressed with how well Martin had tied the stories together, as this novella focuses on the Targaryen family, who is only mentioned according to their past exploits in A Game of Thrones. That being said, no knowledge of the later books is necessary to enjoy the story, and fantasy, medieval, and comic fans should enjoy \\"A Hedge Knight\\" as a standalone graphic novel. It definitely makes it more enjoyable to have read the other series going into it though.Although I am familiar with comics, this is the first graphic novel I have ever purchased. The adaptation is written by Ben Avery, who does a fantastic job of accurately translating the novella to this medium. The artwork is by Mike S. Miller and is even more exceptional. The characters in \\"The Hedge Knight\\" are not as developed as those from Martin's other books and this story doesn't have as much suspense or the plot twists we've come to expect, but as a short story it certainly entertains and provides another look at the world Martin has created, as well as giving insight into some of the names Martin has only touched upon in previous books. Given the choice, I am also glad I read it for the first time in the graphic novel, rather than the short story that was printed in the Legends anthology.The Dunk and Egg stories are continued in the short story, \\"The Sworn Sword,\\" which can be found inLegends II: Dragon, Sword, and Kingand will be out as a comic book in the Summer of 2007."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"I ordered both of the Hedge Knight graphic novels thinking they were actual novels, so I was quite surprised when I opened up my Amazon package to find comics/graphic novels instead.

I was surprised (and pleased) at how the story was paced, and some of the interpretations of arms and armor, heraldry, characters, etc. was creatively done. Keep in mind, fans of fantasy, that there is very little of the fantastical in this story; only a dream sequence dealing with dragons, and a flashback, contain what could be considered fantasty elements, really.

R. Martin's acclaimed \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" epic fantasy series. The time period is about 90-100 years before the events of the first book in the series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\". The main character is a very tall young man named Duncan, who was the squire of a hedge knight, Ser Arlen Pennytree.A hedge knight is a freelance fighting man. He makes his living by hiring out his services to lords of the land and also by fighting for the prize money at tournaments. A hedge knight is not beholden to any Lord, and can choose to accept only those jobs that they feel is morally right. However, a hedge knight is landless and must \\"scrape out\\" a meager living. Ser Arlen dies from a fever chill on the way to a tournament. Duncan buries his old master beside the road, says a prayer, and decides to compete in the tournament in the place of the deceased hedge knight. He packs the horses and takes the road to Ashford. On the way, he crosses paths with a bald-headed young man called \\"Egg\\" and agrees to take the youngster as his own squire.After much trouble, Duncan, who styles himself \\"Ser Duncan the Tall\\", finally gets his name on the tournament list. Unfortunately, trouble found him in the form of an altercation with one of the princes of the ruling House Targaryen. Ser Duncan intervenes while Prince Aerion Targaryen is in the process of beating a woman.For his crime, Duncan was to lose a hand and a foot. However, the good Prince Baelor Targaryen gives him a choice: Trial by Combat. After much negotiation with the accusing party, it was agreed that it was to be a Trial of Seven. Prince Aerion would pick seven fighters on his side, and Ser Duncan must find seven to stand with him.On the night prior, Ser Fossoway, promises to help Duncan. Egg, who turned out to be Prince Aegon Targaryen V, also promised to bring in honorable knights to help fight for Duncan's cause. During the morning of the tournament, Ser Fossoway tells Duncan that he has decided to fight for the other side, Aerion having made a promise to grant him his own lands if he were to do so. Meanwhile, Fossoway's squire, enraged by his master's treachery asked to be knighted so that he may fight on Duncan's side. Aegon also brings in four other knights, including two from the Hardyng family and one from the Baratheon clan. Still, they are one knight short. Duncan appeals to the crowd, asking them to fight for his cause. Not one of the noble knights present wanted to risk their lives, or offend their Lord, by fighting for him. However, at the last minute, Prince Baelor Targaryen himself decides to take Duncan's side and agrees to fight for him.During the fight, Prince Aerion unhorses Ser Duncan and proceeds to beat him with a morning star. Obviously at a skill disadvantage, Duncan relies on his great size and street fighting style. He manages to grapple Aerion to the ground and pounds the prince with his shield. The prince yields and withdraws his charge against Duncan.The fight claimed the lives of both of the Hardyngs, as well as the life of Prince Baelor Targaryen. Towards the end, Prince Maekar Targaryen offers Duncan a position among his household knights, and asked him if he would take his son, Aegon V, to be his squire. Aegon had declared that he would never squire for anyone but Ser Duncan the Tall. Ser Duncan agrees to take on Aegon as his squire, but only on the condition that he be allowed to travel and live the life of a hedge knight. And so begins the adventures of \\"Dunk and Egg\\".I highly recommend this book to youngsters. Lots of good, moral values there. Here are some that came to my attention:1) There are good, and bad \\"apples\\", in every family. Witness the pettiness and cruelty of Prince Aerion Targaryen. Compared to the nobility and generosity of both Aegon Targaryen and Prince Baelor Targaryen. Prince Baelor, considered to be the greatest knight of his generation, willing to die so that a lowly Hedge Knight might prove his innocence.2) Most times, we trade our personal code of ethics for a life of security and prosperity. The knights who refused to lend a hand were all beholden to the service of their lords. They live comfortably in their castles. And yet, it is the hedge knight, a landless knight, who is most true to the vow to \\"protect the weak\\" and to stand up for what is right. How many times have you compromised your ethics just to make a sale? As a manager, how many times have you fired employees, knowing they did not deserve it, simply because it served the needs of the employer?3) How many times have we abandoned a friend, or a cause, just because the opposing side had more to offer us?These are just moral themes that came to mind as I was reading this terrific short story. I suggest that if you can afford it, buy a few copies and donate them to your child's school library."},{"Title":"The Hedge Knight","review":"This is a really well done story. I shied away from it at first, since I am not a huge fan of the graphic novel format (I don't like spending $20 on something that takes 15 minutes to read). But it is a really good story.

Sloan Jr. was CEO of General Motors from 1923 to 1946. This book was originally published in 1964. Sloan is seen as the first person to have worked out systematic organization in a big company, planning and strategy, measurements, the principle of decentralization - in short, basic concepts of a discipline of management. This is a difficult book to review, since it is more a historic piece on GM's history and development from Sloan's perspective than an autobiography. It does not discuss the individual Alfred P. Sloan Jr., it discusses Alfred P. Sloan Jr. as professional manager. The chapters also come across as business school lessons in different subjects, ranging from general management through to accounting, marketing and compensation strategies.The book consists of two parts. &quot;Part One is an integrated continuous story of the main lines of General Motors' progress, involving the origin and development of the corporation's basic management concepts in the areas of organization, finance and product.&quot; It discusses the extreme growth and development of the automobile industry from the early 1900s through to the early 1960s. It also discusses the methods General Motors introduced used to manage the corporation (Sloan all through the book keeps emphasizing the concept of the corporation). He later became known as a committee-man, because he used different types of committees to get/keep various divisions talking and working with each other.&quot;Part Two consists of individually distinct sections dealing in some detail with engineering, distribution, overseas operations, war and defense products, incentive compensation, and other aspects and branches of the enterprise.&quot; This part of the book discusses in greater detail the different experiences and events during Sloan's reign as CEO. It discusses some very interesting subjects, such as the evolution of the automobile, relationships with dealers, World War I and II efforts, and personnel and labor relations. Chapter 23 and 24 are really the conclusion to this book.Yes, this is a great book. It is a TRUE business classic. It discusses all the subjects involved in business from a CEO's point of view. I was amazed to see the amount of detail Sloan has gone through while writing this book, there are plenty of quotes from annual reports, memoranda, conversations, etc. However, some readers will be disappointed by the lack of insight into Sloan's personal life. This particular edition includes an introduction by Peter F. Drucker, who explains why this book is MUST reading for all MBA and business students, but also all people that want to be serious about management. Highly recommended. The book is written in simple business US-English."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"Alfred Sloan can tell it like no other. From the early days of GM to the time he retired, this book chronicles the issues that faced GM. Marketing, segmentation, labor relations, competition, and many other aspects of managing an industrial giant. If you like this type of book, this is a classic. Prefer the tales and hype of the net economy, then this one will probably put you to sleep, though there are lessons here that anyone can learn from."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"On the good side, this book has a great deal of information about the growth of General Motors, and it's ghost-written by a journalist, so it's easy to read.Sloan was one of the first modern-style businessmen. He grew GM from a bunch of mechanical geniuses and seat-of-the-pants administrators to the biggest company in the world after World War two.However, the U.S. auto industry was at the peak of its powers and was about to begin the long slow (but inevitable) decline. And unfortunately you can see why. In 1964 autos wouldn't last more than a few years, and were sold on the basis of the annual model change. It truly was a seller's market, and you can see how the problems of today stem from the attitudes of that time.Sloan is at his best describing the period 1921-1929 when the industry fell into place. The thirties get little mention and the period after the war is treated as one long period with no developments.Sloan is glib when it comes to showing off the attitudes of management of that time. Because GM couldn't sell high-profit cars during the war but instead did defence work, this \\"proves\\" that wars do not benefit business. There are two chapters, one on labor relations (\\"how we kept the hourly paid workers' wages down\\"), and following that, on executive bonuses (\\"must be kept in place\\").It's a worthwhile read, but it's becoming more historical than instructional."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"Alfred Sloan teaches the reader how an successful manufacturing company should be organized and operated.He shows how GM involved the Kettering Research Labs in elements of product improvement, how the various divisions of GM were organized and their relationship to the parent organization, how they employed developments from Kettering Labs such as the electric self starter and the &quot;Kettering Ignition System&quot; into modern auto design.Mr. Sloan also describes how GM entered non-automotive businesses such as Frigidare Refrigerators and diesel electric train engine manufacturing and grew those entities into successful enterprises.A must-read for students of the manufacturing business."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"In this book, Alfred P. Sloan tells the story of his years as president and CEO of General Motors. His story is relevant for anyone who needs advice on how to save a company that is on the verge of bankruptcy and get it growing. Sloan has divulged his insights on organizational structure, management processes, financial control, product strategy and research. Here is some of the advice he offers:Balance cooperation and control: Sloan implemented a framework of coordinated policy and decentralized operations. Top managers made policy, and individual business units were free to implement the policy in the way they wanted. He created interdivisional committees to ensure continuity.Management. Rather than expecting managers to behave like drill sergeants, Sloan pushed for \\"selling\\" at all levels. Corporate leaders were expected to sell their policy decisions to divisions. Division managers were encouraged to sell operational initiatives to top management.Finances. Sloan created a system for reviewing appropriation requests to control spending. He also created a system of four-month forecasts to make sure the size of inventory did not exceed the needs of production.Product Strategy. Sloan developed a marketing strategy for General Motors to offer an automobile for every price range. The company had previously been stuck offering cars only in the mid-price range, and had lost considerable market share to Ford.Research. Sloan recognized that research was just as important as manufacturing and put both research and operations on the same organizational plane.Distribution. Sloan turned automobile dealers into business partners and simplified the process of distribution for General Motors. He also created GMAC, a financing entity that allowed the \\"average man\\" to buy a car and pay in installments. When he began this program, banks refused to lend money to working people to buy automobiles, considering them a bad risk."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"I have been hearing for years that this book is a must read for anyone who aspires to be a great manager in the business world. What I found it to be was a fairly dry chronicle of the ascension of GM. I have no doubt that Sloan was a genius and perhaps the book was more of a revelation in 1963.However, today many of the strategies discussed are somewhat obvious. For example, one of the overarching themes in the book is Sloan's belief in decentralization. At some point he realized that some centralization relative to certain business functions is needed. The company fine tuned this balance over the years and this is discussed in detail. This makes alot of sense but this a process that is taken for granted today. Anyone working in the business world for a few years at a medium to large sized company has seen this phenomena in action.There is also quite a bit of material about financial controls which is good, again nothing revolutionary although the techniques were probably innovative for the time. In the end, I think the book works better as a decent history of the auto industry and GM although the writing style is so dry most \\"car nuts\\" would find it boring.The history of the auto industry is populated with some remarkable characters, many of which were very eccentric with a real passion for automobiles. You won't find any anecdotes about that in this book, and of course that was by design. Sloan's intent was to chronicle the history of GM and his involvement with the company, and that is what he does. However, he does it in such a matter of fact way that some folks might find it tough to stick with it to the end. Not exactly a cure for insomnia but comes dangerously close at times."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"This book \\"My Years with General Motors\\" was originally published in 1963 and is just as relevant reading today as any books written by top managers since then. The book is not easy to read, it is well over 400 pages of thoughtful text, but it is well worth reading for people with an interest in the history of General Motors, the history of the automobile, history of industrial technology in the 20th century, etc...It was published shortly after I was born and I was aware of it during grade school but unfortunately didn't bother reading it until recently. The book is well-positioned with the Bill Gates quote on the cover that reads, in part, \\"... the best book to read if you want to read only one book about business...\\". I completely agree with that!This book is better than any other book I am aware of regarding the Automobile industry if you are interested in business and management evolution. It provides much better insights into business than books I have read by and about say John DeLorean, Lee Iacocca, or Howard Hughes. Those other books may be more entertaining however for people looking for entertainment. This book provides broader insights into general industrial management for contemporary use than say the two books written by Bill Gates do.This 1990 edition of \\"My Years with General Motors\\" also provides an insightful introduction by Peter F. Drucker that adds considerably to the understanding of Alfred P. Sloan. This book is interesting for what it doesn't cover as well as for what it does cover.It does seem Mr Sloan believed in the importance of a well defined structure for management, a constitution if you will. However, the ultimate goal is to put people to work to produce the best possible result. Leadership is seen as more important than structure by Sloan, this is not what the popular opinion of General Motors would be however.That is why I recommend reading this book as an Excellent Historical Account of Management at General Motors. Four out of Five Stars."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"It was a bit depressing reading this triumphant memoir - indeed, one of the greatest business books written during the twentieth century - in May 2009 as the benighted American industrial icon, General Motors, slid into bankruptcy. It made the story of Sloan's storied leadership and GM's dramatic early success all the more incredible. Beyond that, \\"My Years at General Motors\\" resonated with me for a number of reasons.First, Sloan provides a fascinating overview of the early automotive industry in the United States. As someone who was raised in a \\"car family\\" (my father sold Fords and my uncle managed a GM dealership), the story of how Durant and then the DuPonts and Sloan built GM to overtake Ford and ultimately dominate the car industry is a captivating one. The fact that I spent the first decade of my professional career in the software industry, which in the 2000s roughly equates to the car business in the 1920s, only added to the allure of this book.Second, as an executive in a central role in a business unit-dominated company I sympathized with the challenges that Sloan faced in getting control of such a distributed organization as GM in the 1920s. As Sloan describes it, his goal was \\"decentralization with co-ordinated control.\\"Third, it is sobering to read what can happen to a genuinely disruptive innovative organization over time. According to Sloan, GM was a pioneer on multiple fronts: the first to develop market segmentation of car brands and the roll-out of the annual model; the first to create a dedicated, central group focusing on body styling; the first to create a range of financial operating metrics across business units; the first to treat their dealers as an integrated part of their total operations; the most aggressive automotive firm in developing consumer finance (GMAC) for car purchases; a technical innovator in the commercial development of the diesel engine for locomotives; a leader in human resource incentive compensation models; and a leading inventor in consumer refrigeration (Frigidaire). Most amazing, from my perspective, was the work of GM's Post War Policy Planning Group, which before the German defeat at Stalingrad issued a detailed report that accurately laid out the contours of the coming Cold War and described how GM would compete in a bipolar political world. (\\"The net result of the foregoing general viewpoints...is that there will probably be certain lines of demarcation or division to the west, south and east of the Soviet Union, within which the Russian idea will predominate, and outside of which the American and British viewpoint will prevail.\\")That said, for all of GM's purported innovation under Sloan, his story makes it clear that the greatest factor in the demise of Henry Ford's dominance was classic external market disruption, namely the emergence of the used car market and installment paying. GM simply took better advantage of these developments and others than Ford.Finally, Sloan and his fellow GM executives were incredibly lucid writers. For me, this was the most glaring difference between then and now in corporate America. Much of this memoir is made up of extended quotes from Sloan's internal policy papers. The clarity and crispness of these documents is impressive. By reading these nearly century-old memoranda - and without knowing the first thing about the automotive industry in general or 1920s era General Motors in particular - one can easily grasp the central facts and critical dilemmas that Sloan and his fellow executives faced. Just imagine trying to do the same reading the interminable e-mail threads and obtuse PowerPoint strategy decks that undoubtedly have flown back-and-forth between recently ousted GM CEO Richard Wagoner and his top lieutenants. (Note: interestingly enough, the contemporary exception to this Twitterization of business strategy is Amazon.com, where CEO Jeff Bezos requires that any new ideas be presented in clearly articulated white papers, not PowerPoint.)In sum, Alfred Sloan is a real lion; an aggressive and imaginative businessman of the first order. In the closing chapter of his celebrated memoir Sloan writes: \\"There have been and always will be many opportunities to fail in the automobile industry.\\" Unfortunately, it appears that his unworthy executive heirs at GM have, in a perverse sense, taken full advantage of the many opportunities afforded them."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"\\"My Years with General Motors,\\" by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr, Doubleday, NY, 1963, with introduction by Peter Drucker, 1990. Sloan was President/CEO/Chairman of the Board of General Motors from 1923 to 1956. He created the systems and organization that made GM a great corporation. That organization was studied as the model for large corporations for decades. The book also provides a look into the history of GM and its various strategies.General Motors was created by William C. Durant in 1908. Beginning with Buick, he acquired a series of auto companies including Olds, Oakland, and Cadillac, with the idea of competing with the then market leader, Henry Ford's Model T. Durant was the visionary who brought together much of the modern GM, but his organizational style was hands on-producing delays in decision making. He also lacked adequate financial controls. He was forced to resign as President in 1920 when the slowdown of 1921 forced financial difficulties on the company and later on Durant himself caused by margin calls due to speculation in company stock.The Dupont Company was a major investor in General Motors until forced to divest its shares in the 1950s. Dupont's investment began in 1917, when they saw GM as a growth opportunity. They hoped to supplement earnings that might otherwise decline after World War I. In addition, Dupont made the transition from an explosives company to a chemical company after World War I based on surplus nitrocellulose capacity. Plants had been constructed for the Allies during the war to make smokeless powder and later were sold at distress prices. Nitrocellulose proved suitable in auto paint and in the fabric coatings used on auto tops. The investment gave Dupont access to the chemical needs of the auto industry during a major growth phase. Initially Dupont personnel staffed the GM Finance Department.Pierre S. Dupont came out of retirement to succeed Durant as President of GM. He brought experience in the management of a large corporation. Sloan, meanwhile, came up through a manufacturer of roller bearings acquired by GM. He rose steadily through the ranks and succeeded PS Dupont as President after his resignation in 1923.A strategy had evolved to compete with Ford on styling and quality. Ford had over 50% market share; no one could compete with his costs on much smaller volume. But he kept prices low by making the same model with little or no change year after year. That made Ford slow to adopt improvements. GM planned to compete with Chevrolet, which was to have similar costs based on an air-cooled, copper-clad engine. Air cooling avoided the need for a water jacketed engine block, water pump, radiator, and associated plumbing-a considerable savings. GM Research under Charles Kettering was confident the engine would perform, but the operating divisions were uncomfortable with this unproven engine design. Overheating was a problem which Research worked to resolve, but then 1923 proved to be a strong sales year, and a decision was needed. PS Dupont had put his faith in the copper-clad engine, but it was dropped soon after his resignation. Some say Corvair is the only air-cooled GM model to reach the market (after the VW Beetle established practicality).Sloan makes clear that GM is primarily an engineering company. Most executives have engineering backgrounds. The company is heavily committed to developing new technologies and bringing improvements to market. Sloan pioneered decentralized management to allow divisions to make their own decisions promptly. Headquarter's role was to set policy. He then used corporate committees to promote interactions where appropriate such as in purchasing. He created a return on invested capital system to measure performance of the divisions. This is presumably the system that favored production of SUVs rather than small fuel efficient vehicles.It was Sloan who came up with the pricing brackets that differentiate the GM divisions. (Pontiac was created in 1925 to fill in a gap in the line as a low priced six cylinder model.) He also instituted installment selling (and GMAC to finance it), used car trade-ins, the closed auto body (and added Fisher Body to the GM family), and the annual model change. The annual model was intended to leverage the trend toward comfort, convenience, power, and style in selling new cars.Sloan took pride in the steady improvement in auto technology during his tenure. He mentions the development of ethyl gasoline and high compression engines, improved transmissions-eventually automatic transmissions, balloon tires and improved suspensions, and in 1923, Duco lacquers that made it possible to finish an automobile in an 8 hr shift rather than the two to four weeks once required. Duco was also available in a variety of colors. The first production vehicle was the \\"True Blue\\" Oakland in 1924.Styling was not ignored. Harley Earl was brought in as stylist in 1926, initially to assist the Cadillac division. His focus was to lengthen and lower the American automobile.Strong dealers were considered essential to success. GM helped its dealers implement accounting methods to better manage their businesses. Financing was available to assist promising dealer candidates who lacked capital.GM was a major factor in the development of diesel locomotives for railroads. The business was a logical extension of internal combustion engines, but also a diversification should recovery of auto sales be slow after the Great Depression. GM's Electromotive Division was the leading manufacturer of diesel locomotives for over 50 years.GM's venture into household appliances, later Frigidaire, began in 1918, when Mr. Durant acquired Guardian Refrigerator Company of Detroit, a home refrigerator company. The initial machines were large and cumbersome. The 1922 model weighed 834 lb. Weight was reduced with an air cooled compressor and air cooled coils in 1926. GM Research in co-operation with Dupont invented Freon-12 as a non-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant gas in 1931. In 1929 they had made 1MM units; in 1932, 2.225MM. Competitors included Kelvinator (1914), GE (1927), Norge (1927), and Westinghouse (1930). Frigidaire was expanded to include a full line of household appliances after World War II.GM ventured into aviation in the days when the piston engines used were not unlike those in motor vehicles. GM had an interest in Bendix Corporation, North American Aviation, TWA, and Eastern Air Lines. Soon after the 1927 Lindbergh flight, some thought personal airplanes, called flivvers, might be in the future. The initial investment was the US division of Fokker Aircraft, the famous Dutch aircraft maker. GM bought a 40% interest while they made planes for the US military and commercial airlines. Later Fokker US was renamed General Aviation and merged into North American Aviation. North American was a holding company that owned Eastern Airlines and stock in TAT, predecessor to TWA, and Western Air Express. The Air Mail Act of 1934 prohibited airplane manufacturers from owning airlines. TWA stock was sold in 1935; Eastern in 1938 (when Eddie Rickenbacker arranged backing to buy the airline). In 1937, Allison Div. of GM completed development of a 1000 hp reciprocating aircraft engine that was widely used in fighter aircraft in World War II. By 1947, 70,000 engines had been made at the plant in Indianapolis.During World War II, the company rapidly converted to production of military equipment. A major problem was the shortage of skilled manpower. Tanks were welded in a merry-go-round system that required learning only one simple weld rather than full scale training.In his later years Sloan created the Alfred P. Sloan foundation to fund basic research, but especially to support talented researchers. He also participated in formation of the Sloan Kettering Cancer Hospital.The book ends with a discussion of labor relations and incentive programs. The appendix includes sales by division for 1909 to 1962, and staff organizational charts. Indexed.This is a highly readable account of the GM story. Sloan omits some unpleasantries. He does not mention the death of workers in the development of leaded gasoline, GM's role in supplying Nazi Germany through its Opel division in World War II, or the violence of some auto strikes. Most will find it fascinating reading."},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"This book first of all is a very well written book, it breaks down in a very structural way, what the author tries to convey.The book also reflects the thinking that went around on building General Motors, I don't think the reader is going to find many insights to management, as it has advanced so much, but the reader will be able to understand the logics and the insight of how to build strong business procedures, and for then strong organizations.I do strongly recommend this book to be read.Rafael WeillVenezuela"},{"Title":"My years with General Motors (Business leader's book)","review":"This was one of a couple of books I bought for Tom for Christmas: price was good, condition GREAT!

I especially enjoyed the realistic character development that occurs throughout the book and I enjoyed the way the book ended. I know there will likely be a sequel, but even if there isn't one, I appreciate the fact that Frasier did not feel compelled to wrap the ending into a tidy bow. She didn't need to go off into a romantic ending nor make everything end perfectly. Instead, she mimics true life.Her storyline was creative and unique. I will be recommending this to my friends and family. Keep up the great job Anne. I'll be on the lookout for your next novel. Welcome to the mystery writers' genre. I think you have much to offer."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"\\"Wow\\" I have to say that this is the scariest book I have read. For a debut Anne Fraiser Rules. This is a book you have to read during the day. I recommend that when the sun starts to set YOU should close this book . Even though I read it in two days. The first night I had to sleep with my light on. I am so looking forward to reading Anne's books when they start hitting the shelves.For anyone who likes a good psychological thriller and a really twisted character this is the book for you.

She won the lottery at age sixteen; a goaltender on her high school's hockey team had her kiss his gloves and his team won. When she didn't, they lost... or he lost his own luck.She decided to leave her hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, and go to college in Chicago. Her luck ran out: she became pregnant. Her boyfriend broke up with her before finding out. Her parents died.And then the Madonna Murderer came about. He killed only unwed women with male babies, and left his calling card: a snow globe, for the smothered baby. He only had to kill one more mother - Claudia - and son, and he would finish killing. However, something went wrong: Claudia got away.Flash forward. The Madonna Murderer is out again, and Claudia - now known as Ivy Dunlap - is a criminal profiler, who would like nothing more than to catch the man who killed her baby sixteen years ago. Even if it means she has to be bait. Even if she has to put her own life at stake.This is a very good book; I quite enjoyed the many insights into the mind of the serial killer, and Ivy was a very likable character. The main reason I'm giving this book for stars is because it just didn't do it for me. There was something missing that I just can't seem to name, possibly a different ending. It ended without ever really ending... a sequel could very well be made out of this, and I'd definitely read it."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Great read!! wish they had fell in love and went to canada in the end though. i would recomennd to anyone!!!!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"The book was ok. At first I wasn't too sure about it. However, I became more and more intersted in it the further along I read, and I didn't want to put it down about 3/4 of the way through it. I think my main complaint is that I felt like the book continually flip-flopped between the characters perspectives, even within the same paragraph. At times I had to reread a sentence or two to figure out who was \\"talking.\\" If you have some time to burn, it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I am hard to please and love suspense books. this one blew me away. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Thriling, engaging and a must read. Reader will not be disappointed.. I am now on my third Anne Frasier novel.."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Pick a clich&eacute; - it probably applies... A real page-turner... Had me on the edge of my seat... I couldn't put it down... I really did like this book, and I felt the story was well woven, with plenty of suspense and enough realism to make me look over my shoulder a bit more than usual.Ivy is difficult to get to know, but for good reason. She has isolated a part of her past, and tried to live her life around it, never letting anyone get too close to her again. Now she is facing her demon, and there is hope that she will be instrumental in finding him, and end his terrorizing. Max starts off annoyed by her presence, but gradually starts to appreciate her dedication and knowledge, and is fully on her side once he finds out why she is so connected to this case.Some of the details of the crimes and the autopsies were tough to read, and somewhat disturbing. Probably the same thing I would feel if I saw an actual one. Even though I felt I knew what the outcome of the investigation would be, I still was avidly attached to my Kindle until I had finished the last word. And there was the shortcoming. I wanted just a few more loose ends to be tied up. The reader is left still speculating on a couple of very important relationships, and I really wanted to see those resolved. Maybe the author is setting up a sequel, but that doesn't help this book!Even with that, I liked the book well enough to still give it the 5 star rating. It won't be for everyone, and it almost went into too much detail for me at a few points, but still, over all, it is on my lists of both top rated books and authors."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This book was extremely good and kept me on my seat the entire time. I loved how the author switched from the current story of the detectives investigating the crimes and also gave us a look inside the mind of the serial killer and what he was thinking throughout the book. I'm a big fan that the two main characters simply remained friends and the author didn't feel the need to add a romantic element between them. Very good read, I would recommend the book. I look forward to reading more of Anne Frasier's work."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I really enjoyed ready this book. The suspense, the mystery, and the connection with the characters were things I just could not get enough of. I love reading from different peoples point of views as I'm ready a book and Anne Frasier executed that vert well. The way she wrote this book reminds me of how Karen Rose rights her books, and she's my favorite author of all time. I'm looking forward to reading more books by Anne Frasier, and I will recommend this book to my friends and my teachers. Thanks for the good read :)"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Thank you, Anne Frasier for restoring this editor's faith in a well-crafted story. I downloaded this on a free kindle offer, and unlike so many of the freebies, this one held my attention, one I couldn't put down. Aside from a few typos and a couple of formatting issues, the writing was fine.This suspense novel has depth in characters and story. A strong but suffering heroine, Ivy Dunlap doesn't shirk from doing what she thinks is right. While at first glance, it seems like a typical serial killer suspense story, Frasier weaves in some philosophy and interesting facts along the way that take it a step above ordinary.The characterization of Max and Ethan along with the father/son relationship brought tears to my eyes at one point.I'd definitely recommend this read to anyone who likes a page-turner and will read more of this author's work."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Usually crime thrillers aren't my thing. They tend to go one of three ways: the storyline gets drowned in the smutty goodness of two detectives/specialists/etc. Or there's an overabundance of professional and clinical terminology like a police report, or the tale takes the criminal's view so in depth you walk away with this dark voice in your head. This one told the tale perfectly. There was some heartstrings tugged, there was intense thrills in the search, and there was a monster you loved to hate even when immersed in his head, while still allowing for you to find empathy for the child that grew up to be him. Without spoiling the story, I have to tell you that all the characters will move you. In both positive and negative ways, that in the end make you take a deep breath as you close it, and take a moment to readjust to your reality."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Great book, bought it by chance and ended up reading it in two days! I could not put it down!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"It's been some months since I read this one from Anne Frasier, but I definitely enjoyed it and would rate it 3.5 stars (but I always round up, not down!). I found this to be a solid thriller, well-written and fairly spooky at times. It was somewhat predictable in parts, but there were also elements that were unique; it didn't just follow the standard suspense/thriller formula and so wasn't boring. I liked Ivy's character quite a lot. She was strong and smart, yet had her flaws and had a good backstory. I really enjoyed this, and if you enjoy this type of book, I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Being a serial killer fiction fan, I bought this one based on the compelling cover and interesting storyline. It turned out to be a solid read. Good writing, excellent pacing and the author did a good job of into the mind of the serial killer. But I never really got 'into' the characters. I think that was because there was a lot of description that is the typical serial killer thriller cliches."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Books like Anne Frasier's Hush are the reason I read.

She lost her parents and the man she planned to marry dumped her saying he found someone else. A few months later she found out she was pregnant and did her best to take care of herself and the fetus. On the day she was sent home from the hospital after giving birth to a son, The Madonna Murderer killed her baby and almost stabbed her to death.The detective in charge of the case arranged for Claudia to get a new identity and move to Canada. There she studied and became a psychologist and wrote a book about serial killers. Now the Madonna Murderer has become active again and Ivy Dunlap is asked to join the task force and aid in his capture. Ivy realizes that this was what she was waiting for the last sixteen years to do as she needs to bring her baby's killer to justice even if it means putting her life in jeopardy.Anne Frasier has written a fast paced and exciting serial killer thriller that is not at all run of the mill. It is told from the perspective of the only person to survive the killings and readers learn that an incident like that needs closure. The heroine's willingness to pursue closure for herself demonstrates a bravery that few possess.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier's novel \\"Hush\\" centers around a set of serial killings dubbed the Madonna Murders. Unwed mothers with newborn infants are stalked and both are murdered. At each scene, the killer leaves a snow globe that plays \\"Hush, Little Baby.\\" Other than the snow globe, the killer leaves nothing behind and has the police baffled. That is until Ivy Dunlap turns up. Ivy was once an unwed single mother with a newborn baby boy. She was attack and her son murdered, though she managed to survive. She went into hiding and the police reported her as dead in the newspaper. Ivy decides that it is time to resurface and help the police catch the madman that killed her son.This was my first encounter with Anne Frasier and I really enjoyed her work. The mystery element of this novel was well-developed, as were the characters. The crime, the Madonna Murders, was also very intriguing and engrossing. I had trouble putting this book down and was a little creeped out when I read this book at night (I was jumping at every little noise!). This novel was a quick read and one I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I had read many wonderful reveiws of this book, so was eagerly anticipating it, only to be disappointed. I thought the story was far too predictable, and a bit trite. The only thing different about the plot was the killer's M.O. which was shocking, but not very imaginative in my opinion. I really like being on the edge of my 'seat' when I read a thriller, and this book didn't do that for me. Maybe I have just read far too many thrillers in my lifetime, but my feelings about this book are lukewarm at best."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This was a great read, a book that was hard to put down from beginning to end. I am an avid reader, but I tend to stay hooked to the same authors. After I got my Kindle I started looking in to books for free download, but I must say I would not have had a problem buying this book. This book can stand up to the likes of Lisa Gardner and Mary Higgins Clark. I really enjoyed the friendship that developed between Detective Irving and Ivy. It was nice to read a suspense/thriller novel without an intense romantic rendezvous splashed in the middle. I also enjoyed how everyone's individual lives had a background that allowed them to all intertwine and understand each others background. I think the author did a great job of bringing a perfect resolution to the struggles that each character battled. I don't like to tell a lot of details on the book, I find it is better to let each reader dive in and learn each character for themselves. All in all, great read and I would be more than happy to read other books from her."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"After 16 years, the city of Chicago is once again rocked by the vicious acts of the Madonna Murderer. This man stalks single mothers and their infant sons, and the city is soon in a panic. In search of some expert assistance, the head of the CPD calls up a former victim turned profiler to help with the investigation. Ivy Dunlap leaves behind her safe, quiet home to return to the city that spawned her worst nightmares. Max Irving is the veteran homicide investigator who resents Ivy's involvement until he understands her past. Can the two of them track down the merciless killer who has evaded capture for so long? How will this madman affect their lives and those of their co-workers?After reading numerous (too many to count) serial killer novels, I really didn't expect this one to be very memorable. Wrong! Frasier lends a breath of fresh air to this somewhat tired genre. Her characters are very life-like, and her research is incredible. She has a great eye for detail, and I was so captured by this story that I had to keep reading the book for each twist and turn. The forensics are interesting, the police procedures are believable, and the situations are creepy enough to hold your interest. The serial killer here is vile, insane, and driven by some very human motivations. This is certainly the most unique novel of its kind that I've read in quite a while. If you're looking for a nail-biter, and you don't mind losing a few hours of sleep, then Hush might be just what you're looking for. Another pretty good suspense thriller is BLINDSIGHTED by Karin Slaughter."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier is an excellent author. HUSH is her first book and I couldn't put it down!

From the first page, HUSH had me hooked and kept me turning pages.Ms. Frasier's fascinating array of protagonists are sometimes gritty, but always sympathetic and believable. Not afraid to write a story the way it deserves to be written, this author has definitely earned her place among the stars of spine-tingling fiction.I do hope Ivy and Max pair up again in Ms. Frasier's next offering, available in March '03. Please tell me it's so!Don't hesitate to snap up a copy of this book. You'll be recommending it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Finally a serial killer book that doesn't feel like a rehash of every cliche known to the genre.

I enjoyed the story quite a bit even though it might not be the most original suspense story. In fact, it was a little predictable and typical at times but it still pulled me in and kept me interested for the most part.Unlike most of the suspense stories I read, Hush revealed a lot of hints on the identity of the killer early on in the story so I immediate know the background of the killer. I'm not used to this arrangement but am still intrigued and motivated to read along. Out of the few main characters I think the killer is probably the most interesting one since his/her story was more compelling than the other two main characters. Many suspense stories have killers who turned out to be individuals who have unexplainable motivation or the reasons for them to commit the crimes are bit a of a stretch but in this case, the horrible act seems to make logical sense at least the way the author made it to be.There were slightly gruesome scenes in the story but still tolerable comparing to some other stories I read. Some readers might not think it is necessary it but I see the needs to have those planted in the story to show the brutality and cruelty of the killer. I like the ending even though it is predictable and a little too convenient."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Always checking the free list - really glad I got this one. Good story, keeps you guessing. Doesn't do the usual guy meets girl - hook up, which sometimes takes away from the actual story. Don't get me wrong, there is something between the detective and the profiler, but it is pretty much just hinted at. I really love this author and look forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Fast paced - full of action - thrills and twists. I will look for other books by this author.

I also found the characters different and interesting."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This was the first Anna Frasier book I have read. I must stay, it was a book that you just can not put down. Just when you thought you knew the way the plot was going it changed. How she discribed her charactors and broght them and the store together was great. No dead spots in this book that make you want to just put it aside. It held my interest clear up to the last word she wrote. If you get this book I truly don't think you will be sorry.I must say, this book has made me want to read more of her books.Thanks so much Anna."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Most of this book is fairly predictable for anyone who reads a lot of mysteries or thrillers. A serial killer is preying on unwed mothers and their infant sons. What sets the novel apart is the characters, who manage to be more than their stereotypical counterparts. The main homicide detective has a teenage son adopted from a dying girlfriend. You understand his sense of \\"duty\\" but also that he has grown to love Ethan desperately, even if he doesn't know how to convince him. Ethan struggles with the usual issues of being adopted, but the strained relationship with his father is elevated to something just a little bit more. Ivy is the typical \\"consultant with a past\\", but while that explains her drive to catch the killer, the author refrains from making her the \\"hero with all the answers.\\" She is fallible, and often lets her own feelings get in the way. Minor characters are fleshed out, allowing them to be both tough and human. The villain was probably the weakest character, seeming to rely too heavily upon the usual \\"mommy issues\\". All in all, not a bad novel and I am looking forward to future releases."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Picked up Hush because it was on the Amazon free list. Really enjoyed it. Kept my interest until the end. Liked the characters and the mystery. Will read more of the author's stories.Maggie Dove"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Hush gives us a fully realized serial killer known as the Madonna Murderer. Born of a mother who is an obese, angry woman, whose personal cleanliness leaves much to be desired, the Madonna Murderer kills single mothers, along with their baby boys. As if rescuing these children from the fate he now suffers, the Madonna Murderer, stabs to death the mothers, and then kills their babies as painlessly as possible.I love when a writer really fleshes out the serial killer, giving us the reason for his obsession, until it makes a kind of sick sense to the reader. Blessed with intelligence, and a horrific upbringing, the Madonna Murder is compelled to set his life right in the only way he can.It's been almost 18 years since the Madonna Murder killed(or so he thinks) his 13th victim, and then disappeared. Little does he know that one of his victims lived, and has been living under an assumed name, making a name for herself studying serial killers. When the Madonna Murder resurfaces, Ivy comes out of hiding to help capture the man who ruined her life, and sent her into hiding so long ago.Working with Max Irving, and nearly-burnt-out detective, Ivy must relive her worse nightmare in order to catch the Madonna Murder as he starts up his killing spree again.Ann Frasier has written a tightly paced suspense/thriller than kept my interest until the very end. I loved her flawed, yet impossibly brave characters, who kept going at tremendous cost to themselves. I did tend to get confused because the name Ivy, was too close to Irving, and I had to keep rereading parts to keep them straight. This took me out of the story too often. It seems trivial, but when you're reading as fast as you can to see what happens, any speed-bump is not appreciated.I do hope Frasier gives us more of Max, and Ivy. These characters are the kind you want to spend more time getting to know."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Hush was a good read. I especially like how the author digs deep into the mind of the killer and keeps the reader engaged throughout the book. I look forward to the next book by Anne Frasier."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier is a great writer who provides terrific thrills and chills, and this book it no exception. It's a really good read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I found this book to be very slow reading, I tend to like a book that keep's you on the edge of your seat and this book just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Well written, suspenseful tale of a serial killer and the one victim that comes back to haunt him. What struck me the most about this novel is the psychological depth to the killer, as well as the woman who brings about the climactic ending. Of course, the suspense built like it should and there were a few twists I didn't see coming. Overall, the characters were interesting and compelling, the plotting tight and I'll definitely be reading more from this author!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I downloaded this book on my Kindle Fire because it was free. Always looking for new authors because I am caught up on my favorites - J.A. Konrath, John Sanford, James Patterson, Lisa Gardner, Tami Hoag, etc. This book was captivating and suspensful! Can't wait to read another book by this author. Check it out...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"A few months ago I was browsing Amazon.com in search of some new thrillers to read. I was particularly interested in reading debut novels, picking along the way Danielle Girard's \\"Savage Art\\" and Bruce Elliot's \\"Still Life\\". I was recommended HUSH and after seeing what it was about and reading one or two reviews I decided to give it a shot.Am I glad I did.I must say I didn't have much hopes, with the typical storyline of the serial killer on one side and the tough detective aided by the out-of-town female profiler who hides her horrible past. First thing that comes to my mind with novels like these is that the lead characters are going to be living a secret affair by the middle of the novel (this has happened, for example, in Tami Hoag's \\"Night Sins\\" and at least two of the books in Kay Hooper's \\"Shadows\\" trillogy). Then the suspense is sometimes just opaqued by the romantic element.Big surprise, that does not happen, and that's just one of the things that make this a great read. Despite of course there ARE some traces of interest between Max and Ivy the novel always keeps the focus on the case and -this being another winner in this novel- on the characters' personal conflicts.Thus Ivy, Max and the Madonna Murderer are skillfully portrayed, though the best are Max, with the love for a son who doesn't love him back, and the killer, with remarkable glances at his twisted mind.Other interesting characters are Abraham Sinclair who appears briefly but who I feel I know so much about and Ethan with his teenage conflict with life and the way he feels alone in the world. Yes, Ethan sometimes appears as a selfish brat, but who can deny most teenagers behave like that?Now, I am not saying this is the best thriller I've ever read. I really haven't thought about which one it is to begin with. But I can undoubtely say it's one of the best I've read this year (along with Jeffery Deaver's \\"The Bone Collector\\"). The book in my opinion has a few flaws but the work as a whole more than makes up for them.I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I read my first Lisa Gardner book because of a little blurb on the cover saying that Tess Gerritsen said something good about it. I picked up Hush by Anne Frasier because of a quote on the cover by Lisa Gardner. If it's good enough for Lisa, it's good enough for me. I certainly wasn't disapointed. This was a great book with a truly twisted, sicko bad guy. Other reviewers mentioned that there was no wrap up to the book. I went and re- read the ending thinking I had missed something, because it seemed to me that all the loose ends had been taken care of. It seemed pretty clear what the futures of the main characters held. Anyway, this is the first Anne Frasier book I have read and it will not be the last. I loved it. Borders on being 5 star worthy. I'm kind of hoping we get to see Max Irving and Ivy Dunlap together again to solve another crime. Good job, Anne Frasier."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"18 years ago, a killer ravaged Chicago killing unwed mothers and their infant sons. A total of 13 women and babies were killed in the rampage, and the killer was never caught. The Chicagp PD named the killer the Madonna Murder, after the Virgin Mary. But unknown to the killer, one of the women survived. And 18 years when the crimes resurface, a woman with a different name and no past returns to find the man who ended the life of her son. With the help of Detective Max Irving, Ivy Dunlap gets on the case. But the search to find the killer will take her to places she never thought she could go.With a damaged heroine, an original and terrifying villan, HUSH is a fantastic freshman effort which covers new ground with the serial killer plot. An entirely absorbing plot, HUSH is required reading for the thriller buff. One might want to settle down in front of the fire just to read it in one sitting to get all the clues together."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Author Anne Frazier has another persona, that of romance writer Theresa Weir, who produced such novels as Some Kind of Magic in the '90's. If Hush is a fair example, her more recent venture into the crime/suspense genre be considered a mixed success. Frazier has introduced a variation on the character of killer who preys upon women with the introduction of the Madonna Murderer, who targets unwed mothers and their newborn sons. The remaining characters, however, are right out of central casting. Hush has been effusively touted as chilling, heart-thumping, and engrossing, but while there is plenty of gruesome detail (slicing off one's own tattoo, for instance), the narrative lacks the edginess needed to stimulate genuine horror. From the get-go, the romantic subplots are all too predictable. And somehow, there is never any doubt that this killer will be brought to book by protagonists who can survive anything.Frazier is a competent writer, and Hush is not a bad novel, simply a formulaic one, enjoyable if you don't expect more."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier has delivered a very nice freshman effort with this book. The book flows easily and reads quickly. Ms. Frasier took two uncommon approaches that I particularly enjoyed:1) Many of the secondary characters were fleshed out with unsympathetic characteristics, and the primary characters were similarly &quot;blessed&quot; with ambiguous, less-than-angelic motivations and actions.2) Many tangential characters appeared, then did not return. For a reader used to seeing every single character reappear to have loose ends wrapped up at the end of the typical book, this realistic portrayal of life was much appreciated.For example, the scene taking place in the bagel shop adds more realism to the book than any amount of police jargon could, even though it's completely irrelevant to the main story. Do I really need the co-worker showing up later as a witness or victim? No, I don't, and in this book, you don't get that.This book is a very quick, very enjoyable read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier's Hush is the best crime/thriller/suspense novel I've read in a long time. Very tight plot line. All questions are answered at the end, yet like real life not everything can be tied up pretty with a red ribbon. Some things are left open ended, but this talented author leads the reader so that they can definitely read between the lines and come up with their own satisfying solutions. The main characters are complex with the same problems real people have. I found myself relating to some of the same issues that Ivy and Max faced on an emotional level. Of course not on the same twisted psycho level! The Killer is not some cardboard cookie cutout bad guy, this guy has real issues! A very complex and frighting character, but one that at times evokes the readers sympathy. Of course he is really crazy and must be stopped! This is fiction, and fiction at it's best. It will keep you entertained until the very end. Some books just go on and on, blah blah blahing, but this storyline keeps jumping ahead and keeps the readers interest, not easy to do with so much on the bookshelves to choose from in this day and age. You will not be disappointed with Hush. I am currently ready Sleep Tight and that story is just as promising as Hush. Anne Frasier is a welcome and refreshing author to this genre! I will continue to buy and enjoy her novels."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Wow!! This book was well written and very suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat reading this book. Ms. Frasier is very descriptive in her writing. Her characters are well developed. I was so surprise with this book. If you like mystery and some horror this is definitely the book to try out. You will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I got this book based on the reader reviews. I was hoping for a good suspense novel. I can say that it was fairly suspenseful after it got going, but it didn't quite do it for me. First off, it was too wordy. Many times I found myself skipping the boring descriptions to find the suspenseful stuff. It just seemed to drag on a bit too much with non essential information. Second, it didn't have any good twists in the plot or surprise ending that made you go WOW. Thirdly, and probably the most annoying thing of all was how it left you hanging. Not just like there was another story plot that could be made into a sequel, but like it was missing the epilogue. The story line wasn't completed, the characters didn't have any sort of resolution and it made me frustrated. I got her second novel as well thinking that the characters would be in that one as well and answer some of the questions left at the end, but it doesn't. I have to say that if this is how Anne Frasier is going to write, I won't ever read another one of her novels. She has potential, but needs some reader input before writing anymore. In all fairness, I will say that she did her research well, but once again, it was a little to wordy. She did have a knack of keeping you turning the pages, but it only led to a great let down at the end. If you like books that Keep you turning the pages, give you twists and turns throughout, has a touch of romance in as well, and then and leaves you in complete suspense until the very end only to stun you even more, than try reading Iris Johansen. Start with the Face of Deception. That is the first one in the Eve Duncan series. The Killing game is the next and that is the best by far. Iris Johansen will not leave you dissappointed as Anne Frasier does in HUSH."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier writes a high stakes, fast-paced tale with strong characters to make it a journey you won't forget. And what impressed me even more is that she does a great job with the details! She obviously knows her stuff when it comes to crime and police procedure and spoon feeds her readers to add texture to the story. The protagonists are both real, with real problems and that, too, adds to the books authenticity. Nicely done!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier is so amazing!!!

On the contrary, I found the book to be not scary at all, with very little blood. The protaganist is not in the same league as 'Hannibal'. It is a very easy read.I had wanted more. I recommend the book only as an easy whodunit mystery."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasiser does an excellent job of keeping the reader riveted from the first page to the last page of this book. HUSH is dark and chilling and had my heart racing for practically the whole book. The characters were fleshed out and real. You can tell that Ms. Frasier has done her research. The detailed information she provides to make this seem real is very impressive. If your looking for a book that will make you sleep with your light on, I recommend you read this book if you like being held in suspense and never knowing what's going to happen next.

The killings start again becuase of this. This is when Ivy Dunlap is called to come back to Chicago. She was on the Witness Protection Program. She is a very brave character.

A tormented detective, a victim turned psychologist and a deranged madman lead the cast.

A serial killer is murdering new mothers and their infant sons, and it's up to detectives to catch them.The writer brings in a figure from the past; this person enriches the storyline tenfold.The characters are a bit canned, and the plot is predictable. It becomes apparent early on that the good guys will win, and a love story is busy hatching behind the scenes (one which you can see coming a mile away).The end left me with questions. The killer obviously mistook one of the main characters for something/someone he was not, and I seriously expected there to be a part two. I felt like many things, including a twice-adopted child, led up to the idea that he secretly belonged to the main character, but the ideas behind that were never developed.In all, a good read."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Based on this novel i would say that Ms. Frasier is an above average writer. I appreciated her writing structure and style amd i enjoyed the way she developed her characters into real people. This was an above average read right up to the climax at which point the writing and stucture took on a compressed, forced feel. Yes the ending made sense, it just lacked the depth and flow of the rest of the novel.If your main focus is good writing and character development than this is a worthy read. If your focus is more about action, suspense and creativity than i would give it a pass.

This book is truly for the type who love a suspenseful story."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"First novels can often get glowing reviews, sometimes justifiably so; sometimes you have to wonder. While \\"Hush\\" is certainly a worthwhile effort from a new writer, it's far from the classic that so many have credited it.While the plot is unique in its depiction of a serial killer, Frasier doesn't do a lot to add much to the whole genre. He has, what else, a mother who has abused, dominated, and humiliated him all his life. The dead baby letters that purportedly push him over the edge is stretching credibility, and the denouement is fairly predictable.Now, what's good is the dimensions she gives Ivy Dunlap and Max Irving; they are quite different for leading roles, and at times, they're not that all likeable. Ethan Irving is a real pain in the..., whining and worrying about who his real parents are. His going off with the killer is also somewhat immature for a sixteen year old to do, but it does make the plot more \\"chilling.\\"A graphic, somewhat overwrought, novel, but has some merit in its narrative and does demonstrate Ms. Frasier's potential. RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"The minute I finished reading Hush, I logged on to Amazon to see if there were other books written by Anne Frasier. Usually with books that have a female character who is a sole victim of a gruesome crime, the woman is painted as a true victim; one that hasn't found strength to find her way in life despite the tragedy. Although Ivy is still pained by the murder of her child, she has found the strength to not only go on but the strength to do what needs to be to done catch the killer. The book is written with the same creative intensity as those penned by Tami Hoag and Lisa Gardner."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Hush is an absolute page turner. This woman will make a mark in the world of pyschological suspense. Be prepared for a long night. I already look forward to her next book.

Good writing, minimum of typos/errors, nice pacing. I don't think I ever really fell in love with any of the characters, though, and the thing that bothered me the most was the regurgitation of everything that everyone who reads about serial killers (fiction or not) already knows (as a child, wet the bed and killed animals, etc.)...and in the form of conversations between the investigators, which was a bit unbelievable. Ditto on the passages talking about how a certain character would be forever marked by his run-in with the serial killer, need time and therapy, etc., etc. I guess I'm saying that some of what I read in this book was, by virtue of the fact that there are so many serial killer books out there, cliched.Even so, there were some passages that I fell in love with, and I tip my hat to the very resilient Jinx!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Loved this book.

It's the best book I've read in years."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"The deranged serial killer/grizzled detective/psychological profiler is hardly a new genre in the world of thrillers and suspense. What sets one apart from another is the depth of the characters and how adept the author is at getting the reader into the head of the serial killer. Anne Frasier it batting a thousand on this one.Ivy Dunlap now lives in Canada when she gets a call from an old acquaintance in Chicago with a cryptic message: \\"It's happening again\\". 'It' is the resurfacing of The Madonna Murderer, someone Ivy has intimate knowledge of from 16 years past. How does Abraham Sinclair know Ivy? He worked the case when she, the soul survivor, was assaulted by the serial killer.Ivy has had one thing on her mind for 16 years: Kill the man responsible for killing her newborn and changed the entire scope of her life forever.Enter Max Irving. Single father, one of the best on the force..grizzled veteran. Almost sounds cliched but his back story is as interesting as Ivy's when considering his adopted son, Ethan, was born by a woman Max only knew for several weeks. She died and Max adopted him and has treated him like his own son ever since. Ethan is 16 now and Max is waging a personal war of attrition:that of dealing with a teenage son who wants to know about his real father.It's that depth of characterization that really sets this book apart from other thrillers that follow a similar formula. Hush is filled with many great characters, even the bit players having their own emotional baggage that made me interested in them, even if they had minimal page time.Of course the serial killer is super deranged. Convinced that he's saving people and is acting righteously. But when the point of view shifts over to him Frasier makes it chillingly apparent how deranged the inner workings of his mind are.I really can't say enough good things about this book. It flows great, is paced fantastically, has just enough police procedure in it but not enough to bog the story down in technicalities and jargon. The character interactions are believable and the subplots are great.I've been reading through my backlog of kindle downloads recently (Pilfering as many new, recommended, free and deal e books as I can) going from author to author but I think I'm going to spend a little more time in Anne Frasier's neck of the woods before moving on to the to be read pile, hush was that good."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I started reading this and couldn't put it down. This author knows how to craft a thrilling story and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I will be reading more of her stuff."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews given this book. I though it was well written and fast paced. One reviewer indicated it was boring in places where too much detail was given. Unfortunately, that attitude is the problem with our general society today, unless someone is shooting, chasing, slashing, exploding, literally doing something, folks think it is boring. There must be moments of reflection, background, and description to make the whole thing tie together. Ms. Frasier did that very well.I particularly liked the fact that the plot was not so deep that the reader got lost in the wandering of the story. At times it was predictable; but there is nothing wrong with that as long as the trip along predictability is well done...and it was. The prologue was perhaps a little rushed. It seemed that too much effort was given to tying up all the loose ends, when sometimes it is alright to leave a few loose ends. All in all, though, I enjoyed the book and will definitely read Ms. Frasier again."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This book was a freebie when I found it.

The concept of the Madonna murders is just dark enough, just twisted enough, it could be taken from the headlines of today's newspapers. Anne Frasier created characters I found myself caring about. One investigator with a haunting past, struggling to face the darkest moment of her life. The other balancing parenting with a dangerous career, while realizing the potential cost to his family. A serial murder, in many ways a victim too. Richly drawn, complex characters, dealing with the darkest issues of human personality, in a crime wave targeting the most helpless and innocent.

You Never know!!!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I just finished reading this book and I am glad that I found it because it was a really good one. I got it, because at the time, it was offered as a free e-book and after reading the description and the reviews that other readers had given it, I thought that I would give it a shot. It was well written, although at times it seemed like it would jump from one character to the next with no previous indication that it was about to focus on someone else. It wasn't hard to figure out which character point of view I was then reading from when this happened, so it's not anything that disrupted the flow of the book.At the end of one of the later chapters, there's two lines of dialog that seemed like they were just stuck there. There's no indication of who is speaking or anything. It's just two quoted lines of text and then the chapter ends. At the beginning of the next chapter, there's still no indication as to who had been speaking at the end of the previous chapter. This was just a minor hiccup in the reading, but it also wasn't anything that disrupted the flow of the book. I did come across several places where words seemed to be missing or a blatantly wrong word was used (I found the word \\"he\\" a lot in weird places where it didn't make any sense that it was there) and because of this I found myself having to read a few sentences more than once because my brain was attempting to make sense out of it.The characters were all likable, well almost all of them, and I even found myself feeling somewhat sorry for the killer (then again, I sympathize with Jason Voorhees too, so what that says about me, I couldn't tell you). It wasn't overly done with graphic scenes of violence or sexual interests, but it did give enough of a discription in these areas to give the reader a reasonable mental image of the scene without giving the book a \\"PG\\" rating feel. The plot, the story, the characters and the little bits of information that was provided about the killer all through out the book kept me interested from beginning to end. After reading this one, I would really like to read more of this author's work. I liked this one and I'm glad that I found it and got it.

It had my nerves tingling all the way through. I find most authors try to drag the suspense too far and I end up skipping a couple of chapters because I'm ready for the end.

The fact that the killer's motives and actions have a solid basis in psychological fact make them all the more chilling, especially in the scene where he gives profiler Ivy Dunlap a present. There are a few missteps and cliches, especially at the beginning, preventing me from giving this 5 stars, but I still give this a strong recommendation."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This was a good thriller that kept my attention. Couldn't put it down until for 2 days. I would never have picked it up other than it had Jayne Ann Krentz's name on the cover. It certainly was intense.

However, I really enjoyed the story line, and the way Anne Frasier was able to portray two characters' POV.

Too much character and scene building in one \\"resume\\" style lump - doing so bogs the book down. Acceptable in a first book by a new writer. Now, after learning that this is a pseudonym for an established writer I am less impressed. It is still a good effort, though very predictable, with a plot that could be taken from many a police procedural crime show. It is also in places unrealistic from a psychological response point of view.It was not a bad book, reasonably enjoyable, just not memorable. I will still give it four stars considering that many of the well established top selling authors in this genre are currently releasing work that is sub par."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This is not the HUSH I read. Read the one by Eishes Chayall. It was well written. It teaches us about a religious community. Many aspect of the insulated world are really good. That being said it shows how powerful people can harm many. This had to be extremely difficult for the author to write. It many ways it had to set her free. Hopefully her words opened the eyes of the community and yhey should now know the SHAME is in there silence."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I am finicky about the books I read.

If you like serial killer/thriller stories, then this is a good book for you to read. As soon as I started reading I was hooked on this book. The serial killer that Anne Frasier creates is smart, bold, and a bit scary. You will be on the edge of your seat as you get further into the book and read about all of the crazy things that the serial killer in this book does. The ending is good, and adds a bit of extra shock factor with the statement on the last page. I hope to see more books from Anne Frasier in the future.

Good characters and held my interest, would like to see a follow up."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"First off, I have to confess that serial killer murder mysteries aren't my thing. It's been done to death by the likes of Patricia Cornwall and Kathy Reichs. I used to read them, now I seldom do unless my mother passes on one she's read. That said, I downloaded this book for free when I first got my Kindle and had no idea how quickly I'd soon amass a collection of over 100 books and I enjoyed it. The characters are likeable (except the killer), the plot progressed at a nice pace. That babies were being murdered was deeply disturbing to me and there was a hinted at but unexplored plot line with a twice adopted child that may or may not have been the heroine's baby that she believes is dead, but overall it was a fun read."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I thought it was good while I was reading it. It was interesting and the characters were just ok but not great. The book wasn't that great. There was really no twist, not that much suspense, it was kinda just blah with a blah ending. It was just a standard average police drama about the cops and a psychological profiler hunting down a serial killer. I expected more suspense and a better ending. I love surprises and twists and this had really none. No outstanding or memorable characters, and not a memorable book."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"As an old guard reader of murder mysteries, the book is very well done especially if this is her first effort. Well worth the read. As an older person I tend to evaluate based on complexity of the plot and am a huge fan of PD James... so whatever I say should be qualified by that fact."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This was an excellent book!

I would recommend this book and it's not boring at all from the start to the finish."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This book was fantastic. I never wanted to put it down. All the characters had complex personalities that really made the book come to life. You got to see both the professional and personal lives of the majority of the characters which made them seem more real. The only problem I had with any of the characters happened to be the main character. Her personality seemed to be what most people would use as a cover. She seemed very tough with a \\"go-get-em\\" attitude when she really should have been scared out of her wits.All the events that took place in the book were realistic and that contributed a lot to my liking of it. It really makes you think about how quickly things can change and/or take a turn for the worse. I will definately be reading more novels by Frasier."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This book was exciting the entire way through. It was not predictable and was full of suspense. The only small thing that bothered me was that there were a few unanswered questions. The ending was wrapped up, but some of the earlier questions (unrelated to the murderer) were not answered. Overall, still a great book."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I only recently downloaded this book as one of the free downloads available and wow, this story blew me away! I literally could not put it down till I had finished it.You could feel the hatred and anger that the Madonna killer had inside of him and just how sick and twisted he was. Ivy as someone who lived through his attack was a strong character, and her determination to find this man provides many a nail biting moment.Highly recommend this book, loved it!!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I'm new to Anne Frasier and am beginning to wonder what I've been missing. Okay, I devour Minette Walters, Michael Connolley, Karin Slaughter, Ruth Rendell and Val McDermid novels the instant they're published. I ordered this Amazon paperback with limited expectations. But the plot and characters drive this narrative to heights I'd never expected from an \\"unknown.\\" Forget Patricia Cornwell, Sandra Brown or Lisa Garnder, even. This author writes compelling thrillers. A lean thriller that keeps you flipping the pages at a furious pace in helpless fascination. Brisk character development enhances the narrative, and these aren't cardboard cutouts. Can readers ask for anything more?"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"If you enjoy suspense and thrillers then this is the book for you! I enjoy Lisa Gardner and Tess Gerritsen and she ranks right up there with them. This is a great debut book and I'm already looking for her next book that is due out in April."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I just finished reading \\"Hush\\", which I finished within less than 24 hours because I seriously COULD not stop reading. The book pulls you in from the start and never lets go. The author gives her serial killer life, makes you feel like you're almost in the story watching him. One part of the book actually made my stomach turn, the detail was so graphic. I almost felt I could smell rotting flesh next to me. But I still could not stop! The other characters, the good guys, make you feel their torment over the case- a serial killer who stops killing for 16 years is back and unfortunately scarier than before. It's a GREAT book, and has encouraged me to purchase other books by this author. DON'T miss out!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Anne Frasier writes a compelling and engaging book, the suspense is palpable and keeps you adhered to the book. The plot tantalizes with relentlessly mounting tension and buildup, only to fall completely flat with an abysmally unsatisfying ending."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"Frasier hasn't really added anything new to the serial murderer genre, but she has managed to inject it with mutlifaceted characters and a rather chilling examination of a murderer's mind.Fleeing for her life after a brutal assualt which leaves her child dead, criminal psychologist Ivy Dunlap returns to Chicago, the scene of the crime, with a new identity to finally put a stop to the madman who changed her life forever almost twenty years ago. Aiding her in the mission is Max Irving, a veteran homicide cop with Quantico training, who has no idea who Ivy really is and is having problems of his own with his adopted teenage son, Ethan...who looks remarkably like Ivy. Unique to Frasier's characterization is that, at times, the protagonists aren't all that likeable. The plot progresses in a fairly predictable fashion, with some genuinely surprising twists, to a satisfying denouement, which leaves some red herrings as exactly that.So basically, you have a very suspenseful, if mildly predictable thriller, with characters who surprise you, a killer who truly is diabolical, and some plot twists that will actually take your breath away. All in all, good fun and highly recommended. I look forward to future offerings from this author."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This book has so much to offer the reader who enjoys suspense. I picked up this book and could not put it down until I read the last page. I felt like I was part of the team trying to track this serial killer of new moms and their baby boys. I think Anne Frasier has a hit on her hands and I can not wait until March 2003 for the next book."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"The beginning of this book was rather slow and difficult for me. The characters of Max, Abraham, and Ivy seemed rather disjoint, and Max was just a bit too uncooperative to be believable. I'm sure this was an intentional character trait so that he could become more human as the story developed, but it made it difficult to like the book at that point.As the story developed, however, it became more engaging. I especially liked the killer's point of view, how he was staying one step ahead of the police, not by being lucky, but by being clever and actually making smart inferences, and not to the cliche'd point of \\"wants attention, makes mistake, gets caught\\". The ending is not so much of a plot device (like you see in some crime fiction) as it is a believable result of his actions and good police work.Overall an enjoyable read and I think probably a good introduction to this author, as I am interested enough to check out some of her other work."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This was a great book. There were a minimal amount of typos and it kept my interest throughout. I was surprised that the ending didn't go in the direction I was sure it would. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This was the first Anne Fraiser book I read...

Couple of unexpected turns in the story kept it interesting. Some parts were very preditable and that sort of spoiled it for me. It was fun though."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I borrowed this book from the Kindle owners lending library having never read a book from this author before. I was pleasantly surprised - this book was fantastic! The book is a crime thriller with an interesting and believable premise. The characters were easy to connect with and developed throughout the read. The book has an actual ending which wraps up a lot of loose ends which is something that's been lacking in a lot of the books I've read lately. At the end of the book I was sincerely hoping for other books which feature the main characters from this book, because I felt like the author just started to unravel their true personalities and develop their relationships.Overall I loved the book and I plan on reading other books by this author (also available through the KOLL). The digital version had a few typos but I didn't find that they took away from the read. Highly recommend this one if you like the detective / crime thriller genre!"},{"Title":"Hush","review":"I took a chance on this partially because I had read one or two reviews and partially because the cover art was so striking. I honestly wasn't sure whether or not I would like it (let's face it, some works will disappoint) but I am very happy to tell you that this is a non-stop page turner of a book that gave me the chills. I jumped when the building settled, checked to make sure my doors were locked and the alarm was set...shades drawn, you name it.I understand this was the author's first work.

I was far too graffic for me.I only read the first chapter and it seemed to course .Not my style."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"This book had a very weak premise. There is no logical reason to have a former victim join the police task force as an investigator and of course she saves the day and catches the bad guy in the end. The book also has a lot of needless talk of the lead detective's home live and it just waters down the book more."},{"Title":"Hush","review":"As a reader of many of these types of books, this was extremely disappointing to the point that I regretted spending the money for it. I won't buy another written by her."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I'll tell the truth: Not all of this novel is exciting stuff. A lot of it is stream-of-consciousness writing that seems to meander about before getting to any kind of a point.But that's intentional. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a semi-autobiographical tale of a young Irish writer from his childhood to his early adult years in the early 20th century. This young man is working out his own belief system, his own philosophy and thoughts about religion and artistry, and rarely does such a thought process occur directly and expediently.Thus, the rambling text.But that's not to say there's nothing of import to be found here. If nothing else, this short novel shows the budding work of James Joyce as he builds his writing strengths and style that will eventually become more apparent in his longer, better knows works, Ulysses and Finnegan's Wake.Besides that, for a writer, there is much to learn within this book. Of the handful of stream-of-consciousness readings I've experienced over the years, this one is by far the best. Even though the story meanders here and there and all over the place, a writer can follow Joyce's thought process and how he eventually gets to his own viewpoints and ideas."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" relates the mental growth and spiritual awakening of Stephen Dedalus, Joyce's alter-ego. Very little actually happens in this book. It is almost completely an introspective look atthe changes that occur in Dedalus as he grows from an innocent, somewhat oblivious boy, to the psychologically and philosophically restless young man all too aware of the forces that buffet the Ireland of his day. It is a remarkable work that should not be missed by the serious reader."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The book is great, of course, but does anyone else find a jump at page 208 back to page 145? Then when you get to 208 from the jump, it skips immediately to page 273. I can't get my money back now because I've already written in the book, and I'm extremely disappointed that the copy does this."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"As many do, I read this in preparation for tackling Ulysses, in which Stephen Dedalus makes a return appearance. This has been called Joyce's most accessible work, however I found Dubliners faster paced reading personally.The style of the book changes as the title character matures from a young child to a young man. The part that affected me most was the episode at school where, after he has fallen to immoral ways, a speech is given on Hell that is as riveting and detailed as Dante's Inferno. The fiery pits are described as an abomination across all the senses, where not just pain from sensory touch is there but in smell, sight, taste, hearing - and quite effectively described.Stephen's subsequent change after confession and struggle to achieve harmony with God is inspiring even given the eventual outcome of that attempt.The latter part of the book bogs down considerably as it falls into philosophical debates on questions that many a young (and old) person ponders. The ending is hopeful but uncertain."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Joyce lives up to his reputation for being a brilliant yet exceedingly difficult author. In Portrait he gave us a semi-biographical subjective peek into the development of his own thought through the creation of his alter-ego Stephen Dedalus.Short on plot but full of incredibly beautiful phrasing that makes the reader stop and read certain passages a second or even third time to make sure it's fully absorbed, Portrait follows the intellectual, spiritual and social development of young Stephen as he manuevers through family, church, school and friends relying entirely on his own point of view at the time.The most intense section of the novel deals with his spiritual struggle and personally, I've never read a more gripping description of a young soul grappling with these questions.Joyce evolves the style of writing to reflect the subjects growing maturity and the choice of language and the pacing at the end of the book are markedly different from at the beginning.All in all a bit of a tough read but I felt rewarded in the end and am feeling ready to tackle Ulyses next."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Actually, I listened to an audio version of this book - it was the only way I was able to finish it. Even so, it still took me quite a while to get through it. The writing is very dense, and self-absorbed. The book offers many rewarding insights into stream of consciousness thought processes, and typical youthful struggles with issues like religion, good and evil, aesthetics, books and learning, family relations, nationalism and politics, sex and love, asserting one's independence, and getting along with teachers and peers. The detailed accounts of Roman Catholic dogma were a bit tedious, yet I ran into references to them in other works soon after finishing those sections. Having been brought up Protestant, I was spared a lot of the gory details created by the human imagination regarding what hell must be like.A rather profound insight that came in handy one day while teaching was that people who work hard to live pious lives often end up with a short temper, impatient with the visible weaknesses of others. That also was confirmed in a separate context soon after I listened to that part.I had to give this work five stars - it is acknowledged great literature - but I wasn't so sure I liked the narrator that much the further I got into it. I guess anybody can be hard to like when they make an effort to be brutally honest about their thoughts and feelings. The narrator's ambivalence about things like his teachers and his interactions with them were sometimes disorienting, but that was certainly his purpose - to show that there are many possible views of the same interaction, and you have to make your own calls. The question posed to the narrator toward the end, about whether he had actually ever loved anyone in his life so far, put the entire work in a perspective worth pondering.I think for the razor-sharp insights and the utterly lucid writing, this work is eminently worth reading. But you may have to push yourself to make it to the end - I did, anyway."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Not a very auspicious beginning to what is now known as a modern literary classic. Even further, not quite the introduction to James Joyce I had hoped for. However, as I delved into A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I realized just how revolutionary Joyce has been in the evolution of modern literature. The stream of consciousness format of his writing was something new to me -- I loved being able to feel Stephen's maturation and progression of thought. Another treat was the constant backdrop of conflict between various Irish sects. I always find myself fascinated by Irish history (perhaps because it is so very lively). The religious themes throughout the novel were fodder for some heavy thinking; being raised a Christian put Stephen's struggles into a different perspective for me. All in all, an amazing read. I'm starting Dubliners, and I can't wait for more of Joyce's poetic, eloquent work."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"For someone who isn't prepared for this kind of book, a Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man can be a very difficult book to read. He writes using a stream of consciousness, and can be pretty confusing at times. Also, I would suggest that before you read, you have somewhat of an understanding of what has happened in Ireland, and what was going on during the time this book was written. This is because in the book, Joyce includes a lot of these things from the history of Ireland.The focus of the book in on Stephan Daedelus, a young man in Ireland in the early 1900's. As the years pass, Stephan goes from being somewhat religious, to living an extremely pious life, to moving away from the church, and deciding not to believe anymore. Throughout the book, Stephan distances himself from others, and tries to stay out of arguments over religion, politics, and Irish freedom movements. He doesn't interact with his friends a whole lot, and basically isolates himself from others, choosing the life of an artist.Personally, I didn't enjoy the book very much. It moved at a very slow pace. I also think that most people would have a difficult time reading this book, not only because of the background information needed to understand parts of the book, but also because I don't think that a lot of people would like the 'stream of consciousness' style of writing that Joyce uses. It was an ok read, but I don't think that I would read it more than once."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man takes the reader on an historic and intellectual journey. Through the eyes of young Stephen Daedelus do the readers see Joyce's life and the challenges that he encountered. The intentional naming of his characters enables Joyce to relate more closely to his story and be more expressive in his writing. Ireland at the time was in another battle of Catholicism versus Protestantism. This is exemplified at the dinner table scene, where young Daedelus tells of his family discussions and his budding interest in religion. Initially he was a \`free thinker,' not willing to be part of the \`group.' However, as he grew older and wiser, he saw the good in religion-the moral compass it provides followers with.Stephen's journey is one of a young boy trying to cope with his binary society. In Ireland of the late 19th century, one was Catholic or Protestant, family man or individualistic, or \`in' the group or not. As Stephen ages, he learns to cope with these trends in his life; he grasps religion to the extent of almost being zealous. The unique part about Portrait is that it enables the reader to peer into the life of James Joyce, an acclaimed literary mastermind. Like Stephen, Joyce was a Catholic trying to cope with his society, eventually pursuing the arts (in the form of writing). This unique style of writing makes Portrait not only classic literature, but a masterpiece capturing the life of a genius."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I had to read \\"Portrait\\" for my AP Brit Lit class. My opinion? I do not plan on reading James Joyce again...at least if I have the choice. Joyce is considered a \\"master\\" of literature...but in all honesty, I see little point in much of this novel.\\"Portrait\\" describes the life of Stephen Dedalus, an Irish Catholic (for much of the book) and rambunctious artist (for the rest). Three out of the five chapters are completely confusing; I honestly had no idea what was going on throughout them. This is partially due to Joyce's stream-of-consciousness writing style, but also because we are unable to get a firm grasp on the personality of the characters (other than Stephen, of course).But \\"Portrait\\" isn't all bad: chapters 3 and 4 are very well written. This is why I gave \\"Portrait\\" 3 stars (rather than one or two). With a descriptive, riveting (and somewhat frightening) sermon given by Father Arnall, Stephen realizes how deep in sin his life truly is, and beings considering a life in the ministry. This is the most interesting part of the book, in my mind. Not only are the descriptions amazing, but also the religious challenges he faces hit very close to home: I too am considering a life in the ministry.But other than Stephen's brief religious encounter, this book does very little for me. \\"Portrait\\" is a \\"coming of age\\", \\"who the heck am I?\\" sort of novel...which, as a graduating senior, should have meant something to me. And it didn't.If you enjoy \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" (and other such plotless, stream-of-conciseness novels) then feel free to buy this book...you might just enjoy it.But I sure didn't."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This, to me, is the greatest work I have ever laid eyes upon (although let it be known I'm still working on Ulysses.) This work was pure genius, and my only regret was the fact that I was forced to read it in college and may have missed out. I have read the reviews and criticisms, much which seem to revolve around the beginning. The beginning and the end to chapter 4 are Joyce's most striking moments. Consider that the beginning is really from a child's point of view. Psychologically, Joyce is right on target, as he relates everything to how a six year old does...through the senses. The curious asking of 'why?' is what plagues the mind of a child. The major conflict between whether he should give into his carnal desires, or whether he should pursue the ministry out of fear was another stroke of genius. Stephen here is displaying what every adolescent goes through. Erik Erickson would call it the psychosocial stage of &quot;Identity versus Identify-Diffusion&quot;. In other words, adolescents' seek to find out &quot;who they are&quot;. Stephen does this when he sees the woman at the end...not as a carnal object, and not as something forbidden, but as a thing of beauty. Stephen becomes the &quot;artist&quot;, he has found himself. Joyce was years ahead of his time. The fifth chapter, Stephen Hero, probably would have been better left a separate book, but it's excellent to see the character Stephen has evolved into. His wit in &quot;Ulysses&quot; always has me cracking a smile. Those who demonstrate a marked disdain for the book, may wish to try reading it in the shoes of the author and the age the author is in, rather than reading it 3rd person objectively, the difference is astounding."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This was a wonderful book about the struggle of an artist coming to terms with himself. This book helped me see the way that being an artist runs counter to society. The story flows at an even steady pace, and needs to be read carefully. Every line that Joyce writes deserves at least a moments thought. This is the kind of book that can be read and studied over and over. It is however written for a narrow group of readers, and someone looking for light reading should proabably read something else. If you do read this novel though, enjoy!!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"In my past I have failed to examine the habitat of human nature in general. A Portrait of the Artist as a young man offered me the knowledge of religion and art tied in with the overwhelming story of a boy growing up. I found that James Joyce's writing was not only inspiring but also challenging. I found myself in the shoes of Stephen Dedalus, and truly believe in the traumatic story of his struggles in life in comparison with my own."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man is worth reading if you read books often. If you don't, your time might be spent to better ends on another book, because it is not particularly interesting or stimulating if you aren't already fascinated by Joyce's writing. Nonetheless, it IS a very famous and well-regarded book and you may want to read it because of this."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"With \\"Portrait\\", Joyce puts significant demands on the readers. To enjoy the book wholly, they should know Irish history of the late XIX century and the catholic doctrine. They should be attentive and sensitive to languages and their interplay. They should also be able to relate to the outsized sentiments of a boy and a teenager. In short, the book's readers should have an old mind and a young heart: a tall order. Maybe this is why this book appears so unsettling to many readers, young and old.The story is not overly complicated: a boy grows up in a family whose members are ferociously nationalist, or religious, or both, is sent to Jesuit schools, and in a typical teenage fashion rejects the values of his environment - \\"his home, his fatherland and his church\\" - and embraces solitude and a firm belief in looking for a vague notion: beauty expressed through art.Of the values he rejected religion was the hardest to let go. Stephen has never been close to his kin folk. The Ireland that he yearned for was long lost or not yet conceived. But religious he was. He abandons religion because in his mind it is incompatible with being a creator: a creator of his soul no less, god-like himself. He does it even in the face of the original sin, without denying god's existence and with full understanding of the possible consequences. Stephen is a revolutionary Hero, burning all his bridges in the name of a future better world: the world of yet uncreated beauty promised by no one but by his solitary ardent soul.Joyce's eye zooms past appearance and in on his characters' soul: a \\"bat-like\\" soul waking up alone in the night makes a housewife call a stranger to her bed; a classmate's soul peeks out, self-embittered, through his eyes; Stephen's watchful guarding of his soul ends up making him abandon his religion. In creating his portraits, Joyce is much more cerebral than visual. Even though he tells most of the book in the third person neither Stephen's nor anyone else's appearance is made apparent. People are perceived by what they say rather than by how they look. Someone's Ulster accent or equine facial features will be the only supplement to their thoughts.The book's structure is uneven. Robert Louis Stephenson wrote \\"That style is most perfect which attains the highest degree of elegant and pregnant implication unobtrusively \\". The beginning and the middle parts, such as the family Christmas dinner and Stephen's personal triumph of mustering his courage in the scene with the rector, fit this definition quite nicely. The end of the book feels less so. It seems that by the end of the book Joyce still had some Tolstoyan lecturing to do and just made Stephen grab in succession three of his friends (not counting the sparring with the dean of studies) and confess his thoughts on religion, beauty and art.Joyce is a master of economical expression. Some times he highlights the object's appearance: the cork-covered water splashing against the docks or the rainlaiden trees may be highlighted with a droplet of a single word, but a word so evocative that it promptly colors the phrase. Or he could mask the object completely behind a (beautiful) metaphor: \\"Trinity... set heavily in the city's ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring\\". I much enjoyed the book for these moments of elegant and concentrated phrasing."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Although I have to acknowledge the wonderful use of language that Joyce displays in this work of fiction, I found that I had a great deal of trouble getting into it. This is a coming of age story and perhaps it would hold more relevance for a male than it did for me. There is some dispute as to whether or not this is an autobiographical story or not. What is is a \\"stream-of-consciousness narrative\\" and it is a style that Joyce is credited with developing in his body of work. The book centres around young Stephen, and his changing viewpoints as he grows up. We see how an innocent' idealistic youth changes his ideas as he matures and as life happens to him. It leads him to question his Catholicism and his idea of family values. The language is what is really beautiful about this story! I had a bit of difficulty getting into the story, but felt that it was an important enough work to persevere."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Wordplay is immediately brought to the reader's attention. It is hard to think of a more word drunk person than James Joyce.Even at Christmas Stephen Dedalus's family argued about Parnell. At school Stephen was accused by the English master of uttering heresy in his essay. He was tormented by other boys when he claimed Byron was a better poet than Tennyson.James Joyce casts this story of his exquisitely sensitive, exquisitely gifted younger self into a tale of schooling under the Jesuits, being subject to the whims of everyone about him. It is said of the character that at Belvedere, one of the schools he attended, he had battled the squalor around him and the riot of his mind.At the college everyone makes a retreat for the feast of St. Francis Xavier. Stephen sought to bring his senses under rigorous discipline for spiritual reasons. He tried to mortify sight, hearing, taste, smell. At the end of the restraint and piety he was still easily subject to imperfection to his surprise. His soul had a sensation of desolation, spiritual dryness. A priest asked Stephen if had had a call to the vocation. Stephen was destined not to be in an order, but to be on the outside and to have to make his way.Finally Stephen is a university student. His mother has to wash him he is so dirty. He searches for the essence of beauty. He talks of Aquinas with the other students. He says he has lost his faith, but not his self-respect. There is beauty. There are women.Speaking of faith, it seems blasphemous to attempt a review of this masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"While those who read simply to seek a defined storyline and ignore language usage may find this novel plodding and pointless, those who appreciate literature for its aesthetic value will no doubt treasure this novel as one of the greatest ever. Admittedly, the plot is certainly not well-defined when compared to that of other novels; Joyce didn't emphasize plot, he simply let the story flow naturally through the stream of consciousness technique which is displayed in &quot;Portrait&quot; in its infant stages. In this story, physical circumstances and crises play a supporting role to the mental ponderings and perceptions that accompany them, which throws many unexpecting readers for a loop. Frankly, this book is not for everyone (ever get the feeling Joyce wanted more people to hate his works than revere them?), however the use of language is superb: the &quot;bird girl&quot; scene contains the most beautiful prose that I have ever read. If you are at all interested in literature, this book will no doubt satisfy you, a must read!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I'd have to agree with the review below me. This is a tough book to get into, but more than worth it once you do. Joyce is well known for developing stream of consciousness, and this book is remarkable in that aspect. After reading this book, it is no surprise to see that Joyce is recognized as the literary giant that he is."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's semi-autobiographical novel is probably the most read of all his works, most likely due to the fact that it is less bizarre and easier to read than his other novels. Realizing this, most readers jump into &quot;The Portrait&quot; expecting it to be a simple and straightforward story only to find that nothing could be farther from the truth. It is extremely complex and ahead of its time and damn near prophetic. Many readers criticize it because the plot is so realistic that whereas other books are fantastical and overblown, the plot to &quot;Portrait&quot; is so prevelant that it could have happened to anyone, and indeed, similar series of epiphanies do indeed happen to many. Perhaps ironic is the fact that many of the same people who criticize this lack of action enjoy spending their time watching &quot;real life&quot; shows such as &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot; that are heavy in realism and light in action. The difference of course between those shows and this book is that while the shows are completely and utterly mindless attempts to quench the public's ever-growing hunger for drivel, &quot;Portrait&quot; is one of the most though-out, complex psychological testaments to the life of a human being ever put to paper. It is the story of a young man, growing up in Dublin in the same manner as all other boys, and how, along the way he became different than the rest. In this age, society is obsessed with peering into others' lives, in &quot;A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man,&quot; we peer into someone's soul: an artist's soul."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"No matter how many times I read Portrait, it always fascinates me. Joyce's allusive and symbolic writing gives us a wonderful sense of the world according to Stephen Dedalus, changing as he changes. Good notes or a Joyce fan are a must for a first read-through to avoid getting &quot;stuck&quot; in the stream of Stephen's thoughts as others have, but the book rewards time and attention well, revealing its complex structure and Joyce's own complex conception of the world. A must-read."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's work is obviously a great piece of literature but for today's youth it is not the best novel to recapture the desire to read. I think it's a wonderful book to study in an English course but also I found it extremely difficult for one to read out of pleasure with the exception of the die hard Joyce fans. If you have some time to kill and also have the desire to higher you're learning then I suggest this book but if you're looking for an enjoyable rainy day read look somewhere else."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book displays some of the most beautiful prose ever written, (especially the part with the &quot;bird girl&quot; at the end of the fourth chapter). The secret to enjoying this book, however, is to not try to fly through it. Read it slowly to appreciate the language and the meaning. It is a beautiful book and it is NOT POINTLESS!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"When I first started reading the novel, I was confused beyond belief at what the heck James Joyce was talking about, but about 10 pages into it, I became completely enthralled in the story. I identify with Stephen much more than one should, probably, because I'm pretty messed up psychologically, but I found this to be a wonderful book. If one does not just read for the plot and instead looks at themes about life and growing up, this is a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is a detailed examination of the artist. This is packed full of knowledge, which should be the point of enjoying an art form such as writing. Those interesting in perpetuating their own petty cliches and content to read the same story a million times in their lifetime by all means do, but for someone who wants to grow everytime they read a book, read authors such as Joyce or Gaddis, who forge complete characters and understand the infinite human condition."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This novel is considered one of the greatest ever written. If you are a professor of English, to you it probably is. This novel starts off very easy, but then accelerates into a more complicated novel as the main character gets older. If you're looking for a book to tear apart in search of symbols and metaphors, then this is the one. If you're looking for a nice, easy read, I'd look somewhere else."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait&quot; is an example of art as emotion delivered.

Portrait gives us 200 pages of beautifully written prose. At its best moments, I just sat back and let the words flow over me. But to be honest, I didn't find much substance to the work. It was an interesting theme, the struggle an artist must undergo to break free from the world in order to create--and even though it was told in a unique, original fashion--i was not particularly moved by any of the thoughts, or ever particularly engrossed in Stephen's life. I will say though that for someone interested in dipping into Joyce, this is a MUCH wiser first selection than Ulysses, which just might force your reading comprehension faculties to commit suicide..."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This novel is one of the greatest works in the English language. It is not only beautifully written but it can carry a different meaning for people at different stages of their life. Young high school students will find some themes very interesting while a man of 40 can draw new pleasure from reading it a second time. For those interested in Joyce's work, this is a good place to start, for it is easier than his other novels. This is not to say that it is an overly easy book to understand. Anyone who has read The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner knows that the stream of conscienceness style of writing can at times stifle reading comprehension but for the most part give a unique, exciting view of a character. Overall, though, this is an excellent novel and worthy of anyone's effort."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book simply defines all that makes us believe in freedom of spirit. It takes us on a trip from the naive childhood of Stephen Dedalus up to the point where he shuns all he was taught and pursues his art. Brilliant."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man relates the mental growth of Stephen Dedalus, who represents the author James Joyce. Very little actually happens in this book. It is almost completely a reference to the changes that occur in Dedalus as he grows from an innocent, somewhat oblivious boy, to the psychologically restless young man all too aware of the forces that buffet the Ireland of his day. It is a remarkable work that should not be missed by the serious reader.The notes at the end by Seamus Deane do present points of clarification and interest, but for anyone who can't pass on a footnote without reading it (ahem), it does interrupt the flow of the narrative a great deal."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Good fiction uses narrative story to describe details of a character's life. Great literature does the same, but with the description, it capably details broader concepts and greater concepts.This book revolves around Stephen Dedalus, but really tells us about the Ireland of his time. Stephen is almost unanimously known to be the author. Joyce's depiction of his emotional and intellectual growth - preteen, teen and young man - paints a broad picture of Ireland - at least Joyce's Ireland. His Irish Catholic Ireland, where issues compound over religion, language and rite. He is confused as he questions the unquestionable -- Catholic religion's centuries-old traditions. And, his questions are eloquently asked on the pages of this novel.One friend of Stephen comments on this young man's realization of possible non-belief in religion: \\"It is a curious thing ... how your mind is supersaturated with religion in which you say you disbelieve.\\" And, so this may accurately depict Ireland's strange and hypocritical relationship with the Roman Catholic Church.And, this book is chock full of Catholic quotations, recitations, and references. So much so, that my Penguin edition of this novel immensely aided me with its extensive endnotes (over 600 in total) describing the words (sometimes archaic or colloquial) and often describes people (often Irish history's leaders for or against the Catholic Church) or statements (often relating to the Bible). I highly recommend that all readers get such edition or a similar publication as the nearly 100-year gap in time and continent's division have made many passages herein obscure to modern American readers.As much as Stephan is confused about religion, he is confused about Ireland - not surprising as much of Ireland's confusions stem from religion. At one time, young Stephen says, \\"Do you know what Ireland is?. . . Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\\" Of course, this a curt response made impulsively in discussion when men are tired, inebriated, or both. But, it probably reflects what others felt, what others thought, and what others publicly proclaimed. Note: most of the other provisions regarding Ireland show pride - immense pride.Joyce admits Ireland had its faults. Inequitable and overly cruel torture placed upon the parochial students is described in detail. Religious zealots overstated their arguments to audiences too young to receive such extreme philosophy. Chapter III's amazingly well written speech of purgatory can only be deemed as provocative and funny. The humor comes from teenage Stephan's response: \\"thinking of sin\\" is a sin; and committing any one sin is the equivalent to committing all of the sins; and committing one sin is enough to prevent anyone from being free of purgatory. Hence, little Stephen concludes that his lustful thoughts of a girl guaranteed purgatory. He was a marked man. Then he goes to a confessional and discovers there are exceptions to the rule promulgated in the lecture. Catholicism, he discovers, is laden with exceptions to the rules. Grey lines, not black lines, define acceptable behavior. To a teenager this is perplexing, to the young man this is blasphemy.Incredibly insightful. Incredibly long lasting. Amazingly applicable to even today's Ireland. This book has lasted for decades for these reasons."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"If you're considering purchasing this book, or if it's being forced upon you and you are having a difficult time, or if you are like me and want to read and actually understand writers like Joyce, purchase the SIGNET CLASSIC edition of \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" There is an absolutely fantastic introduction by Hugh Kenner that is, IMHO, indispensable. You can get all the SparkNotes and whatever else you want, but Kenner's intro is very concise, to the point, extremely clear and better than anything else I've ever seen as far as beginning to understand this classic.Plus it's less than 5 bucks!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce is the single most important writer of the 20th century. Simply put, the form of the novel exists in two stages - pre-Joyce and post-Joyce; no other novelist approaches the impact on the literary landscape that Joyce acheived in perfecting his style. The story behind the actual writing of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (originally entitled Stephen Hero) is that Joyce began writing basically a semi-autobiographical account of his childhood up through his early adulthood. He then decided that he wanted to convey the events of his life in a form other than direct disclosure. The rest, as they say, is history. Enter stream of consciousness. Enter free association. Enter Freud, Shakespeare, Greek mythology, the Bible, Catholicism, the complexity of man, the simplicity of man, social class,and Irish lifestyle (to name a tiny portion of what this novel presents) without ever having to mention many of these influences by name. What it really boils down to is that this novel began a revolution in the way literature is read and written. Sounds over the top I know, but think about it. What Joyce experimented with here he later advanced in Ulysses (which is even better than A Portrait) and totally submitted to in Finnegan's Wake (of which I didn't understand a single word). His direct influence ranges from Faulkner to Proust to Nabokov. For those who are just getting into literature and may not know those names, those three are heavy hitters. Like sumo-wrestler heavy.The content of the novel itself reveals the inner character of Stephen Dedalus and, in turn, of James Joyce himself. As I said before, this novel is both largely biographical as well as psychological, perhaps more important in what it says about the human mind in general than what it says about the Irish mind of early 1900s Dublin. And frankly its just beatifully written. This is not Joyce's finest work (that would be Ulysses), but it is certainly one of the foundations upon which modern literature stands. And for that reason, even if you don't like Joyce's work (which is your loss to say the least) you have to respect it. To respect it is to at least read it. It's a tough style, but it's worth it. Trust me."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Portrait of the artist is a vitally important novel for anyone interested in writing, writers, genius, repression, Catholicism, intellectualism versus dogmatism, the life and mind of James Joyce and novels as an art form. The writing style mutates and develops throughout the story, reflecting the different ages of Stephen Dedalus, from the baby talk and visceral imagery of his parents, governess Dante and Uncle Charles in his early childhood, through his schooldays as he wrestles with his intellect, his faith, his sexual awakening and his guilt to the advanced articulate and experimental style he invokes in his late adolescence, including an experimental journal at the end of the novel.The themes in Portrait of the Artist cover the whole spectrum of growing up, but the principal drama surrounds the intellectual development of Stephen. He is a formidable mind, a free thinker. But his faith impells him throughout towards the narrow minded dogmatism of the Catholic Church. At times, the church holds the upper hand, as Stephen is terrified into confessing his sins with prostitutes in the face of Father Arnall's legendary, sensual, brutal 'Hellfire' sermon on the fate of sinners who don't repent before god. But Stephen wrestles with such demons, and grows, and fights, and ultimately prevails. He sees the image of the rotting cabbages in in the kitchen gardens and considers the disordered symbolism of this as more appealing to his natural essence than the neat tidiness of the shrine to Mary.Stephen realises he must leave this claustrophobic restrictive life behind. The end of the novel chronicles his last days in Dublin before leaving Ireland. His conversation with Cranley forces home the realisation that Stephen is growing up, his childhood is behind him, and, most importantly, he is prepared to err and make mistakes, even if this means damnation. He is able, as he says 'To discover the mode of life or art whereby your spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom'.Stephen, with all his passionate intellectual talent, is ready to hit the world, and the forces such as Father Arnall who seem ready to stamp on such independence with vitriolic counter ideological pamphleteering cannot stop him. Thank God for that. The original title of the book, Stephen Hero, is apt indeed."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book seems to have been written for style more then anything else, and at times it makes it difficult to read, this is true. But overall the book is not to difficult to read, it is a great introduction to Joyce, if you plan on reading Ulysses, or Finggans Wake, and it's an excellent book to read over and over because you will find things you missed and find reading Joyce's style become easier everytime you read it. Joyce does go into greek mythology a bit and reading about Deadalus (he built the labrynth) will allow you to better appreciate some of the symbolism. But don't read this book if your looking for a nice story to read, read it to appreciate the style and the poetic descriptions Joyce uses. And remember the book is narrated differently as Stephen matures, so it is a little difficult in the beginning due to the constantly broken thoughts when he is an infant, irrational, and extreme (puberty), and then finally logical and intelligent at the very end of the book"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN has been credited variously as the harbinger of the modern novel, the first novel to employ stream-of-consciousness writing, and as the most notable of the K&uuml;nstlerroman genre--novels in which the principle character develops an artistic temperament in defiant opposition to all forces suppressant to creativity. In the case of young Stephen Daedelus--the budding &quot;artist&quot; of A PORTRAIT--Religion, Country and Nationalism are the labyrinthine obstacles to creative freedom.

Joyce describes Stephen's education throughout school and college; Stephen has many changes of heart throughout this semi-autobiographical novel, and, as Stephen's attitude changes, Joyce's writing style changes. Overall, A Portrait stands as a literary masterpiece and should be read before reading Joyce's greatest novel, Ulysses."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man, by James Joyce, is about growing up Irish Catholic in late nineteenth century Ireland.When the book was first published, the style was so radical critics didn't know what to make of it. Although very readable, to understand the book requires that the reader pay close attention. There are many shifts in time and place, and shifts between external consciousness and dreaming or thinking. The author makes these changes without warning; yet, some of the transitions are so seamless, they are magnificent. His dialogue can be difficult to follow sometimes, precisely because it is so smooth. Although written almost a century ago, the language and style still feel very modern.The main character, Stephen Dedalus, grew up in a well-off Irish Catholic family. His father was a businessman who also dabbled in politics but was not religious. He sent the young Stephen to a Jesuit boarding school because, as he told his son, with the connections he will make, he will be able to go far. Stephen's mother was a kind, traditional Irish Catholic. The family lived in the country, but they were forced to move to an apartment in Dublin when their financial situation declined.As a child, Stephen is physically slight, introverted and intelligent. He wears glasses. It is very touching how Joyce evokes the sensitive nature of the grade school Stephen, especially with regard to the rough-housing of classmates and the undeserved, cruel physical punishments of his teachers. Several images of his childhood, including of his father are seen, playfully, through a glass. Joyce seems to like that image. Stephen worships his father in the way many young boys do.During the time when Stephen was a young boy, the great Irish nationalist leader Parnell had recently fallen from power. Although a Protestant, Parnell had the support of both the Catholics and the Protestants in the north and the south. He was the one leader in Irish history that had the potential to unite all of Ireland and lead them to independence.The men in Stephen's family constantly talk, and argue, politics. The women in the family concurred in the Bishops condemnation of Parnell. Stephen's father and uncle raged at the Catholic clergy. They remained militant Parnell supporters. A family Christmas dinner ends abruptly because of a near violent argument over Parnell between a devout Catholic aunt of Stephen's and a diehard nationalist uncle. It is clear Stephen identified with his father's position.Stephen goes through all the insecurities, emotional chaos, yearnings and sexual desire of adolescence. Stephen loves women and has crushes on several. They appear somewhat alien to him but lovely and sensual nonetheless. He goes through a phase where he becomes a regular in Dublin's red light district.In college, Stephen attends a retreat given by one of his Jesuit teacher's from grade school. The priest delivers one of the most frightening sermons of all time, seemingly endless apocalyptic images and booming rhetoric of hellfire, suffering and eternal damnation. The sermon is the centerpiece of the book, about twenty pages long. As a result of the sermon and retreat, Stephen became overwhelmed with guilt and went to confession.In college, the students and faculty acknowledge Stephen to be intellectually brilliant. In college, Stephen becomes as much an expert in his subjects as any of his Jesuit professors. He digests, deconstructs and masters everything the priests had in their arsenal to throw at him: Aquinas, Aristotle, Plato, literature, every language and subject.In his last year of college, as you can predict, one of the Jesuit professors asks Stephen to seriously consider become a (Jesuit) priest. He turns him down. He sees the Jesuits as lifeless. They are not like Saint Ignatius, he observes. They are not what they are supposed to be. Stephen shudders at the thought of spending the rest of his life living in an institution like the cold, rigid Jesuit grade school and residence he attended as a child.In the end, Stephen rejects the Catholic Church and Ireland. He says the attitude of Irish Roman Catholics towards Roman Catholicism is that of a, \\"Dullwitted loyal serf.\\" Stephen understands better than anyone that his intellect and personality are saturated with Catholicism. He can't stand it and declares himself an agnostic. He says he needs to get out of Ireland to decide for himself what he believes and doesn't believe. He is disgusted with Irish culture, or the lack of it. He tells a friend that, \\"Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\\" Stephen's friends have gotten used to his brilliance over the years, but his rejection of Ireland and Catholicism astonishes and mystifies them.One friend even suggests that he become a Protestant. Stephen replies, \\"I said that I had lost the faith but not that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?\\" Likewise, Stephen bristles with hostility towards the English. The dean of students of his college is a Jesuit from England. In a casual conversation, Stephen sets him up by using the word tundish instead of funnel. \\"Is that called a tundish in Ireland?\\" the dean asked patronizingly. Stephen answered, laughing at him, \\"It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, where they speak the best English.\\" Later, to a friend, Stephen says, with hostility and contempt, that this Englishman came to Ireland to learn proper English.Stephen's mother tells him that he's read too many books. She tells him she prays that he will learn about things of the heart. About his impending emigration, Stephen says, \\"Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.\\""},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"If you're gonna buy a copy of \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\\" you can't go wrong with the Wordsworth Classic edition. Its advantages are several:1. It's extremely cheap.2.

Don't make my mistake."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I'm always up for a good challenge, whether it be in books, music or movies, and from what I've heard Joyce is about as challenging as they come in the literary world. However, since it seemed like &quot;Ulysses&quot; or &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; would be a bit much to start with, I found myself reading &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; as an introduction to his work. And although I found this book about as easy to get into as Princeton, it was about as rewarding as well. &quot;Portrait&quot; is certainly anything but a light read. Joyce's meandering narrative and serpentine prose can be confusing to say the least, and on more than one occasion I had to read a sentence about five times in order to figure out what I had just read. For all its verbosity, though, &quot;Portrait&quot; is an essential read because the story of Stephen Dedalus carries so much resonance. I'm about the same age as Stephen was in this story, and I can relate pretty easily to his search for answers. Growing up in Ireland around the turn of the twentieth century, Stephen faces existential questions that should ring true for a young person coming from any culture at any time. He tries to find satisfaction by giving in to his lust, and when that doesn't work he goes all the way to the other end of the spectrum in seeking fulfillment through religious devotion. In the end, however, neither of these extremes provides Stephen with the answers he's looking for. Stephen's story demonstrates one unfortunate fact of life: when you're seeking meaning, there are no easy answers. Ultimately, as Stephen tells his friend Cranly, he decides that his solution is to &quot;express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can,&quot; even if it means making mistakes or being spurned by society. In &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,&quot; Joyce outlines some important ideas that have since become prominent in literature, notably noncomformity, self-expression, coming of age, and the nature of religious belief. This book may not have been perfectly written, but since Joyce was aiming so high it's easy to overlook any imperfections in his style. &quot;Portrait&quot; was written with plenty of intelligence and soul, so it's easy to see why it's still read after all these years."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I've seen some reviews that criticize the book for being too stream of consciousness and others for not being s.o.c. enough. The fact is, for the most part it's not s.o.c. at all. (See the Chicago Manual of Style, 10.45-10.47 and note the example they give...Joyce knew how to write s.o.c.). A better word for A Portrait is impressionistic. Joyce is more concerned with giving the reader an impression of Stephen's experience than with emptying the contents of his head. What's confusing is the style mirrors the way Stephen interprets his experiences at the time, according to the level of his mental development.When Stephen is a baby, you get only what comes in through the five senses. When he is a young boy, you get the experience refracted through a prism of many things: his illness (for those who've read Ulysses, here is the beginning of Stephen's hydrophobia - \\"How cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum.\\"), his poor eyesight, the radically mixed signals he's been given about religion and politics (the Christmas meal), his unfair punishment, and maybe most important of all, his father's unusual expressions (growing up with phrases like, \\"There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes\\" how could this kid become anything but a writer?)It is crucial to understand that Stephen's experiences are being given a certain inflection in this way when you come to the middle of the book and the sermon. You have to remember that Stephen has been far from a good Catholic boy. Among other things, he's been visting the brothels! The sermon hits him with a special intensity, so much so that it changes his life forever. Before it he's completely absorbed in the physical: food, sex, etc. After it he becomes just as absorbed in the spiritual/aesthetic world. It's the sermon that really puts him on the track to becoming an artist. One reviewer called the sermon overwrought. Well, of course it's overwrought. That's the whole point. Read it with your sense of humor turned on and keep in mind that you're getting the sermon the way you get everything else in the book: through Stephen.After Stephen decides he doesn't want to be a priest, the idea of becoming an artist really starts to take hold. And when he sees the girl on the beach, his life is set for good. That scene has to be one of the most beautiful in all of literature. After that, Stephen develops his theory of esthetics with the help of Aristotle and Aquinas and we find ourselves moving from one conversation to another not unlike in Plato (each conversation with the appropriate inflection of college boy pomposity). In the end, Stephen asks his \\"father\\" to support him as he goes into the real world to create something. I like to think that this is an echo of the very first line in the book. The father, in one of many senses, is the moocow story. The story gave birth to Stephen's imagination and now it's the son's turn to create.This is such a rich and beautiful book. I suppose it's possible for people to \\"get it\\" and still not like it, but I really think if you read and re-read, and maybe do a little research, the book will open up to you the way it did to me."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"If you're going to buy 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' as a paperback, I strongly advise you to buy this--the Norton Critical Edition. It's depressing to see that the Penguin Classics edition is the number one selling version of this wonderful book.This book is TWO DOLLARS more than the Penguin version. For that $2 you get better quality paper, ink, and binding. More importantly you get Editorial notes that explain Joyce's obscure terms, ultimately making the book more readable. You also get over a dozen other writings dealing with Joyces text. These extras (200 pages worth) provide background information on Joyce's three major themes--Irish politics, Roman Catholicism, and \\"Aesthetic\\". Also, there are critical essays which range from general interpretations of the book to specified studies (ie feminist perspective). Being a difficult book, the supplemental material greatly enhanced my appreciation for 'Portrait'.For ONE DOLLAR -LESS, you could go with this:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Dubliners (Barnes & Noble Classics). Here, not only do you get Portrait of the Artist_, but also you get the collection of short stories, Dubliners. Not to mention better editing. You still get footnotes. And there's some (not a lot) of suplimental material.For FIVE DOLLARS more than you would spend on the Penguin book, you could getA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Everyman's Library (Cloth)). If you're going to buy a book, why not get one that will last the rest of your life? Well then, that would be the Everyman's Clothbound you seek."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"One of the great changes in literature in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was the birth of autobiographical literature. Even at the end of the 19th century, it was very unusual for any writer to make one's own life the basis for a purely literary work. To be sure, Dickens had put much of the London he knew in his youth into his novels, but there is no Dickens novel that can be described as purely autobiographical. Mark Twain had written memoirs that employed novelistic techniques and Samuel Butler put much of his own life into THE WAY OF ALL FLESH (a novel written in the early 1870s but not published until 1903), but it was only with such works as D. H. Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS (1913) and James Joyce's PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN in the English-speaking world and Marcel Proust slightly earlier in Paris that authors began taking their own lives as material for works of fiction. In Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS, a host of real life characters and actual life experiences became characters and scenes in novels. Likewise, most of the events of PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST were based on actual events. It isn't quite autobiography, but neither is it pure fiction. Because the genre of fictionalized autobiography has become such a common literary form in the century that has followed Proust, Lawrence, and Joyce's work, the importance of this work can hardly be overestimated.PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is important also for the innovations Joyce made in narrative. While the events in the story occur along a time line, Joyce is not particularly concerned with most of the details in the timeline. The narrator is not concerned to tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, but instead wants to present a series of prose snapshots from various periods in the life of Stephen Daedalus, who is transparently based on Joyce himself. The narrator lays out the events, but he isn't concerned with explaining them or making them clear. There is, in fact, little or no interaction with the reader. Most narration presupposes the presence of the reader, but PORTRAIT ignores any reader. This leads to a certain coolness in the prose that some find discomfiting.What cannot be denied is the brilliance and the genius of the prose. It is a prose that alters and matures gradually with the central figure of the tale. The first pages border on baby talk, while the final pages are as mature as Daedalus at the same age. In terms of form and execution, this is easily one of the most brilliant works of fiction of the past century. Moreover, it is a remarkably accessible work. For those who first come to Joyce through the agony of reading some of the more stressful sections of ULYSSES or, worse, FINNEGAN'S WAKE, read PORTRAIT will come as something of a shock. Compared to ULYSSES, this is remarkably easy going.The complaint that I hear some make of the book is that nothing happens. That is true, if by \\"happens\\" one means an interesting and unusual plot. The \\"story\\" if there is one is that of a young man growing up, gradually gaining consciousness of the world in which he lives, and eventually rejecting the Catholic vocation urged upon him to become a writer. The book is stuffed with details from Joyce's own life, from the political preoccupations of his family (though Joyce himself was amazingly unconcerned with politics) to the family obsession with singing (both Joyce and his father possessed a near-operatic quality singing voice).I would urge those who do not care for the book because \\"nothing happens\\" to at least entertain the possibility that there is more than one way for a novel to be brilliant. If one can see the ways that PORTRAIT expanded and developed the possibilities for prose, it will be easy to appreciate it for the work of genius that it is."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; is an impressionistic, semi-autobiographical work in which Joyce, through the character of Stephen Dedalus, relates the events and impressions of his youth and young adulthood. The novel flows effortlessly from Stephens first memories as &quot;baby tuckoo&quot; to his final journal entries before embarking on a promising literary career in Paris. In the pages between, Joyce's virtuosity of prose explodes in passages with frightening intensity. Even those who dislike Joyce's confusing, sometimes-infuriating style, should be awestruck by his undubitable writing ability.However, as anyone reading this review should already know, despite his virtuosity, Joyce is not for everyone. He is simultaneously one of the most beloved and despised writers of the twentieth century. For those of you who are unfamiliar with his work and hesitantly contemplating becoming acquainted with it, here is some food for thought: first, start with &quot;Portrait,&quot; it is far more accessible than his subsequent works and a better introduction to them than the also-excellent &quot;Dubliners&quot; is. Second, do not try to judge &quot;Portrait&quot; by the same standards as other books. Joyce is not trying to tell an amusing story here, he is trying to relate the impressions of a young man torn between two existences: a religious or an aesthetic. If you are a meat-and-potatoes type of reader, meaning the kind of reader who prefers a &quot;story,&quot; Joyce will not be your cup of tea. Lastly, Joyce's reputation perhaps does his works injustice. Yes, he is extremely encyclopedic and takes on many themes in his works. But perhaps too many readers get sidetracked from the aesthetic merits of his works by concentrating solely on the intellectual values. It is his prose which can be universally appreciated, whether you understand the ideas it portrays or not. His prose is his bread-and-butter. Some people pompously brag of their &quot;getting&quot; Joyce without actually appreciating what he does. I don't claim to be a bonafied Joyce scholar, but it is my experience that to enjoy Joyce is to appreciate &quot;literature for literature's sake.&quot; If you enjoy literature, poetry or prose, than you should enjoy the style with which Joyce writes, that is to say, all styles. And he has seemingly mastered all styles. That is not to say that the many thematic levels in which his novels succeed are to be ignored, for their expression is not seperate from the means with which Joyce does it, but congruous with it.To read Joyce is to revel in the limits of artistic creation and then to read on as the limits are then stretched further.Bon Apetite!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Every March, we celebrate St. Patrick's Day. We wear green so no one will pinch us. In elementary schools, we read Irish folklore about leprechauns and shamrocks. When we grow up, we learn about the \\"troubles\\" and the centuries-long conflict between the Protestants and Catholics, but our knowledge of Ireland tends to stop there.Perhaps the next best thing to kissing the Blarney Stone in order to have a taste of Ireland would be to read James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.In this work, largely through various vignettes, we observe the growth and development of the \\"artist\\" Stephen Dedalus. (He is not to be confused with Stephen Dedalus of Ulysses, but he may have been named after the Daedalus of Greek mythology.) We begin with his childhood, at the beginning of his formal education, and the portrait James Joyce provides fades when he is an adult.Although the novel is relatively short, please do not suppose that it can be read quickly. Just like it would be foolish to endure a long wait in the Louvre and then glance at the small Mona Lisa for only a second and walk away, in order to appreciate this book, you will need to dedicate some time and thought.A Portrait is rich in detail, creating vivid images that bring the pages to life. Be sure to notice the imagery. Artists often have dexterous hands, and hands are observed throughout the book. Other recurring symbols are roses, birds, and water. There are several contrasts--cold and hot, wet and dry, unpleasant and comfortable, and distressed and happy, among others. White, red, and green are important hues that regularly appear.James Joyce is expert at \\"showing not telling.\\" The masterful use of detail and imagery attest to Joyce's skill in writing. In this book, he also employs new techniques that are more developed in later works, innovations that set him apart in the evolution of modern English fiction. For example, in A Portrait, we find several examples of stream-of-consciousness narrative. Fortunately for the reader, it is not as difficult to follow as passages in other books that employ the technique more intensively. It also serves as another manner in which Joyce skillfully presents Dedalus's growth. The first part of the book is more random and hard to understand (like the thoughts of a young child) while the forms of expression change until the end of the novel, which is written as organized concise journal entries.Perhaps A Portrait resembles a journal of the author himself to a certain extent. Both Joyce and Dedalus were Irish and educated at Jesuit schools. They later changed their perceptions of the Catholic church and also left Ireland. Furthermore, both the author and the protagonist faced financial problems and had impaired vision. They also had peers that admired their work as thoughtful and clever literary artists.In addition to taking the time to look for imagery, brushing up on the history of Ireland may be helpful in order to more fully enjoy A Portrait. However, it may be enough just to know that Charles Stewart Parnell (1846-1891) was an Irish nationalist leader that was popular until 1889, when the public learned of his adulterous affair with Katherine O'Shea.Personally, when I read A Portrait, my enjoyment of the book declined somewhat after Chapter II, when Dedalus is a teenager and engages in immoral activity. Perhaps I lost some interest because I could not relate as well to the main character, or maybe it was because I did not like the different attitude of the \\"grown up\\" Dedalus. It also seems that the action slows down somewhat near the end.However, upon finishing the book, we have a well-developed picture of the life of Stephen Dedalus (and possibly James Joyce, as was mentioned earlier). Thanks to the excellent imagery and thorough detail, we feel as if we had traveled to Ireland and even developed a relationship with Dedalus. As with carefully prepared portraits, in observing them, we notice subtle aspects of the subjects, the creators, our neighbors, and ourselves. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a four-leaf clover worth picking."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Depending on one's taste and level of concentration, James Joyce's &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; is either tedious flop or a wonderful cornerstone of world literature. (I believe the latter.) I won't go into a discussion of &quot;A Portrait&quot; here because if you are looking at this particular Viking Critical edition, you've already committed yourself to reading it. The value of this edition lies in the critical essays and notes at the end. The notes will help the reader along, as they explain some of the terms and/or conditions that are particular to Joyce's Ireland. The essays are, each and every one, valuable tools. Whether it's an examination of Joyce's life, the creation of &quot;A Portrait&quot;, the influences it would have, etc., every essay is a heavy-weight that enchances an understanding of the book. (At least it did for me.) If you're seriously considering reading &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; this is the edition to use."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a semi-autobiographical story of Stephen Daedelus as he grows from a young child to a young adult. Virtually every word Joyce uses is deliberate. The novel is not one that a person can read and understand without completely focusing on what Joyce is saying.Joyce uniquely uses language to portray the young Daedelus as he grows and matures. The language is very simple in the beginning, following a stream of consciousness format that portrays Stephen's young age and undeveloped thought process. As he grows in all aspects of his being - physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and mental - the language reflects his growing complexity. Joyce also uses language to show the changes in Stephen's relationships with others - especially his family - that result from his growth. Throughout the novel, Stephen goes through various periods and levels of alienation. During his early years in boarding school, Stephen feels distant from the other boys and counts the days until he can return home. However, after a heated discussion over Christmas dinner with his family, he feels as though they are somewhat remote. He cannot figure out which adult to side with over the political issues concerning the Catholic Church and the Irish State. Thus, his young mind experiences its first feelings of alienation from his family. These feelings mark the first instance of a desire to break from traditional viewpoints, and the point at which the language begins to change.Gradually, this emotional separation becomes more pronounced as he starts to notice his father's imperfections, such as his excessive spending habits and the tasteless company he chooses to keep. By looking down on his father's actions, Stephen widens the distance between himself and his father. Thus, he loses his childhood naivet&eacute; and sees his father as an imperfect human being. Joyce reflects this change in the language by replacing childish phrases with more experienced reflections.As the novel progresses, the language Joyce uses becomes even more complex in structure and content. This illustrates Stephen's progression as his ideas and views of life become more his own. As Stephen's family sinks into the slums materially and socially because of his father's excessive spending, Stephen develops the courage to break away from them and stand independent with his own ideals and views.His emotional separation from his family finally leads to his physical separation from the familial and social environment he was raised in. He embarks from Ireland, leaving everything he opposes: his family, the Catholic Church, Irish Patriotism, and his old self. The language of the novel follows Stephen's internal progression as he moves from simplistic and undefined views, to his eloquent and personal theories about art and life. It is at this point of resolution that Joyce shifts his language from a distant point of view to the first person narration of journal entries - only after Stephen finds his own independent voice."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is one that has stayed with me and continues to infiltrate my thoughts and ideas daily. I often find myself mulling over the path of Stephen Dedalus through this book. He begins as an innocent child mired in the sins of his family, country, and religion. He finishes by breaking the bonds that chain him to the earth to soar from Dublin as a great &quot;artificer.&quot;The painful, glorious growth of a soul reaching for truth and beauty is chronicled here in sharp intensity. When Stephen is castigated unfairly by Father Dolan he bravely reports the breach to the rector. This bravery is soon rewarded with sneering jibes by his father who relays to Stephan that he has had a good laugh about the incident with Father Dolan. &quot;'You better mind yourself, Father Dolan,' said I,'or young Dedalus will send you up for twice nine.' We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; The betrayal by both his father and the church is very intense and painful, a slap in the face.During his adolesence Stephen endures overwhelming sexual desire coupled with a contrary and all consuming reverance for the teachings of the Catholic church. These two opposing compulsions come to a crisis with the retreat in honor of Saint Francis Xavier. During this retreat, Father Arnell gives sermons on the four last things: death, judgement, hell and heaven. This is an intense odyssey into the nature of eternal damnation. I am not Catholic nor Christian, but I must admit that this section did make me squirm at times. The depth and breadth of the torment of hell is communicated herein with excruciating detail by Father Arnell. In mortal terror Stephan confesses his sins and attempts to lead a pure and devotional life. The life of devotion ends when he is later offered the priesthood. He realizes at that moment that he must renounce the church and choose to &quot;learn the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world.&quot; Free of the church and father, Stephen finally must confront the bonds that his friends, mother, and country claim on him in the final section. One by one through discusions and encounters with his classmates he slips these bonds and resolves to go away from Dublin and all that keeps him earthbound. This is a beautiful novel of growth and deliverance. It will be one of my cherished books always. As a final note I want to let readers know that the edition I am reviewing, The Modern Library Hardcover 1996 edition, has several misspellings and punctuation errors. It almost seemed as if the publisher had used a spell check type of program to proof read the book instead of a person. This is extremely irritating in that I bought the Modern Library edition so as to always have a sturdy, well made edition of this beautiful book. I find it insulting to the author and the reader that more care was not taken in the publication of this edition."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I have never encountered a character quite like Stephen Dedalus. He is sad, happy, complex, strange, unlikable, but always fascinating. Stephen is the main character in Joyce's \\"Portrait of an Artist\\", which is a semi-autobiographical tale of Joyce's alter ego. The story is told entirely in third person, although most of the time you swear it is being told in the first.The story is not as important as the form, or as the emotion. These elements are precisely what makes \\"Portrait\\" so good. As far as plot goes, it is not concrete, yet that goes perfectly along with the flow of the story. \`Portrait\\" opens boldly and brilliantly, charting Stephen's incoherent thought processes as a youth. Sentences wildly strung together, uneven, yet right on target on how a mind so young might work. The second part of the story is dark, menacing, and wandering. Almost like a nightmare with words. This goes along well with the emotional turmoil of Stephen's soul as he enters into sin. The third part of the story is controversial, ad it probes the positives and negatives of religion quite well. Stephen begins to turn his soul over to God at this point, mainly because of fear. The fourth part deals with Stephen's \\"awakening\\" as he breaks free of religion and starts to discover what he truly wants. The final part of the story is mostly scenes of dialogue, and is the most philosophical part of the book and the most structured. Here he is an intellectual, artistic poet and thinker. He still leaves his future wide open, yet has finally reached the point in his life that he feels will take him where he needs to go.Supposedly, \\"Portrait\\" has loads of symbolism. The book explores a variety of issues from Romanticism to Religion. I doubt if readers of this book are going to pick it all out with a single reading. I didn't. I wonder if the readers will care about that, or will just do as I did, and focus on how original the material all is. Even not knowing what was going on at times, I was drawn in by the story's hypnotic hold it had on me. I was riveted by the artistic use of words, similes and metaphors conjugated together to form an often confusing, yet always captivating story, or even a poem if you like. This book is more of a feeling than a story, and even though the book becomes a bit more structured as it progresses, it never loses its dreamlike war on words that keeps you locked it its trance.Even though I am giving \\"Portrait\\" a perfect rating, I don't think it is one of the greatest novels of all time. I wished I could have got just a bit more out of it. Possibly my view could change if I would just examine deeper into it. I doubt it thought. Like all enthralling dreams, one can't look too deep, but rather is mesmerized by the whole experience.Grade: A"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's first novel, \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, published in 1916, sets out, in the form of a fictional (auto)biography of Stephen Dedalus, the programme of Joyce's artistic vision. An elliptical work by any definition, \\"Portrait\\" proceeds by fits and starts, offering the reader glimpses, sketches, portraits, if you will, of defining moments in the formative years of Stephen Dedalus, from earliest childhood through his education at university. While certainly the specific story of a single individual in late 19th and early 20th century Ireland, Joyce manages to produce a narrative that is personal, national, and even universal in its significance.As much as \\"Portrait\\" can be said to begin anywhere, the text itself begins with childhood reminiscences, from a uniquely immature voice and with the universally recognizable fairy tale entrance, \\"Once upon a time...\\" That the novel takes as its main point of view the consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, this seemingly fanciful beginning clues the reader into envisioning the tale to follow as a modern take on the developmental narrative. The goal is not the rescue of a woman, although women feature prominently and problematically; the enemies to be conquered are Stephen's own immaturity, his own doubts, and the stagnant traditions of family, political, and religious expectation; the prize sought is not gold, but an idea of the self upon which Stephen can make his way in the world.\\"Portrait\\" is divided into five sections or chapters, each detailing a different phase of Stephen's quest for self, or as the title suggests, for becoming \\"the artist\\". The first part has Stephen face his first and longest lasting challenge - his roots; specifically, his family and the political and relgious tensions that hold them together and threaten to rend them asunder, as well as his early school years, wherein he must come to terms with outside authority. The second details his movement to Dublin, and his attempts to deal with various adolescent difficulties: peer pressure, his father's declining circumstances, and the awakening of sexual desire. From this point on, \\"Portrait\\" has set the main themes that Stephen must wrestle with in order to grasp his place in the world.Stephen's quest leads him through short careers as a sensualist and as a religious devotee before leading him to art. In order to fulfill his destiny as an artist, Stephen must, as all good fairy tale children, wander the world alone, living as his cunning and wits guide him - away from his family and even his country. Hence the universalizing aspect of \\"Portrait\\": like most people, Stephen Dedalus must finally leave familiarity for the dangers and promises of the outside world. Stylistically, Joyce's narrative mirrors the developmental level of Stephen at each of these five crucial moments of his life - from the short attention span of a child through the nearly pedantic focus of the theorizing artist, Joyce's technique filters through an adult consciousness the various stages with a grace that makes a largely third person novel seem as though it emanates from a palpable personality. As Virginia Woolf saw, even in the early 1920's, Joyce's \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" was at the forefront of a new way of writing about the very essences of human life in its day, and remains a landmark text of modernism."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I was reading the book and thinking it was an interesting, yet limited, portrait of that young artist, until I got to the last 50 pages and it blew me away."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I recently re-read this edition of POTA and was pleased to find the experience even more exhilirating than when I read the book first in college 25 years ago.

Read it, and read it again!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"If you enjoy reading beyond simply plotline and love absorbing and getting your hands on beautiful language and interesting writing techniques, then James Joyce's The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is definitly for you. From the very start of his novel, Joyce grabs you with his sometimes unconventional use of language and his mastery of the written word. As you watch, or read, the character of Stephen Dedalus grow and mature into a young man, you are carried along by a developing tone and language. At the age of arounnd 6, for example, Joyce masterfully entertains the reader with a true to life child's point of view of things. Sentences are short and tangents are rampant. Stephen's thoughts tend to be random and unfocused. For instance, when he sees a brown train, it isn't just brown, it's &quot;a long long chocolate train with cream facings&quot;. I found it fascinating to experience the growth of Stephen. At the end of the novel, when he is in his mid to late teens, he is a sophisticated thinker. He now exclaims, in a style reminiscient of Hamlet, &quot;To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared unto him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory&quot;. His complex thought processes are incredible.It's these great thoughts that make this book a worthwhile read because the plotline is lacking. Fortunately for us all, Joyce has the ability to turn the mundane into fascinating, and the normal into an experience of a lifetime. I loved savoring the beautiful and interesting language and thought processes involved with this book and found that I didn't really mind the lack of plot. Definitly a great experience and worth your time."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"At the beginning of this novel, I had a hard time with Joyce's writing style, but once I had read more of the book, I realized that his writing is amazing. He jumped around a lot, which confused me so that I had to read parts several times before I understood them. At first that bothered me. Then I realized that this style of writing helped to tie the events of Stephen's life together. I think that it brought a greater depth to Stephen as a character because I was able to understand why he acted the way he did and I could understand the reason behind his thinking.Joyce's symbolism is also effective. It shows Stephen's growth from a little baby to a man, and shows how his thinking develops. I didn't pick up on it at first because I was working so hard at simply understanding the plot and making sense of the sentences. I admit that I didn't appreciate the use of figurative language at first. I felt like it got in the way of the plot. Although I still do not fully appreciate the symbolism and amount of description, I now realize that it is necessary to understand the path that Stephen ends up taking in his life. When I went back through the chapters and looked specifically for symbols, the ones that I found told me a lot about Stephen at the stage of life he was in. I could see why he felt the way he did about certain things, like his family, friends, women or school. Without these symbols, the story of Stephen's life would have been just a story, instead of a deep study into the heart and mind of a boy growing into a man.After praising Joyce's portrayal of Stephen's development, I do have to add a negative, and perhaps a little contradictory, opinion. I felt the plot wasn't anything to scream about. I understand that the novel is a portrait of a young man, but sometimes I felt like I was only getting a brushstroke instead of a whole portrait. Let me explain. Although Joyce wrote much description about how Stephen felt, or his reasoning about events and people in his life, I didn't feel like the events themselves were described very clearly. Sometimes I didn't even understand what was going on when Joyce wrote about an event because he used so much figurative language. In my opinion, it would have been more effective to tell the events more plainly and save the real figurative language for describing Stephen and his growth into a man. I felt like I had to dig through a bunch of muck to get the real scoop on what was going on at a specific time in the book. This may seem contradictory to my previous paragraph, but in that paragraph I was saying that the symbolism helped to explain Stephen's feelings and thought processes. In this paragraph I simply want to way that the plot would have been a lot more enjoyable had it been a little easier to follow.Having said that, I would like to say one more thing that I liked about this novel. I thought that the way Joyce showed dialogue was very effective. It made it seem like I was in Stephen's mind, hearing what he was hearing, instead of being a third party just listening in on a conversation. It was another thing that bothered me at first but then I understood the purpose for it. The paragraphs flowed a little better without all the quotation marks and commas that usually accompany dialogue.Overall I think that this book is well written with interesting insights. It was hard to get through, and a little slow at times, but I feel like it made me a better and more thorough reader simply because I was forced to read carefully. I would recommend this to a patient reader who is willing to spend time to understand what Joyce is trying to say."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"As a high school senior, I have just started grappling with more difficult literature. Reading Portrait and Faulkner's As I Lay Dying provided a sound basis for more difficult works, like Morrison's Beloved. All of these works, with their use of the stream of consciousness so popular in modernist literature, powerfully express their authors ideas.Also, this is probably one of the best works about teenage rebellion, ever."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"My first stab at this book was in preparation for my college orientation thirty plus years ago. I was impressed by the description of the Jesuit retreat, but didn't get through the whole book.The second time I read it was in 1992. I remember being enthusiastic in my reaction and preferring it to Ulysses, which I find impenetrable.Having just read it a third time, I must say I am more struck by the parts than the sum of those parts. I particularly favor the dialogue, first the Christmas dinner argument re Parnell and, secondly, Stephen's banter with peers at University College Dublin. The dialogue is brilliant, once you figure out Joyce has his own style of punctuation for it.The book requires work, hence the one-star reviews from those looking for ease of reading and entertainment. Next time I try to tackle it, I plan to use a reader's guide, unapologetically. It should be a felony to require high school and college students to read it without a guide and a guidebook. I could use both to get me through Ulysses."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I first read Portrait over last summer as part of my high schools English curriculum. I found it deadly and unreadable. When we began analysing it in class, however, it became clear to me that this is the most briliant work I have read yet. The first page, while seeming like child's banter, contains themes, images and words that recur throughout the ENTIRE book. The greatest thing about Portrait is that the narrator is inextricably tied to the book. Stephen is the narrator, and he is as far from omiscient as one gets. Every perception the reader has is through his eyes, so the reader is dragged through all his moods. At the end of every chapter, Stephen has an epiphany. After the last epiphany, the reader is left to wonder whether Stephen has attained absolute truth, or whether his epiphany will be negated by future experiences. And then there's the passage of the &quot;bird-girl&quot; Don't get me started on the &quot;bird-girl,&quot; because it's one of my favorite passages ever, and accepted as one of the best in the English language. EVERYONE needs to read this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"There is, at least in my mind, two clear divisions of boringness. There is boringness that comes as a lack of interest in what the author is saying or the way the author is presenting it, and then there is boringness which comes as a product of lack of understanding, or not wanting to understand, what the author is presenting. The latter is experienced by every reader who tried to pick up a book by Joyce (although some, I'm sure, more than others). The first I mentioned could be attributed to a rather simple yet elaborate book that one is frustrated with not out of a lack of understanding, but out a lack of caring. For example, GREAT EXPECTATIONS. An example of a book that was 'boring' for the first reason.Let it be decidedly said that A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN is a great book. It just shouldn't be shoved down someone's throat. When and if it is, I can understand some exasperation. Why is it a great book? Because of its clear depiction of childhood in Ireland, the feeling of stream of consciousness with which about a million different levels of meaning can be extricated."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Irish literature is one of the greatest on earth. Not for the tremendous numbers of works that have been published, but for the power that this literature offers to readers like me. James Joyce is one of the authors that has forever changed my life.A portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is not only an autobiographical book on Joyce, but is also a door to penetrate the stream of consciousness in which Joyce's books are classified.As you will read that book, notice that power with which Joyce describes hell, classes, friends. There is a mystic mood from which we cannot escape. Stephen Deadalus starts a long journey into his own conscience and discovers that arts shall be is life. He discovers the lies of religion and governments. Deadalus will now forever have his eyes opened on the truth that life is in his single body.You must read that book to fully understand it. James Joyce is not as known as Stephen King, but he really worths better.Pascal Tremblay"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The first two chapters of this book are very good, but Joyce fumbles the ball irretrievably in the third chapter and the dreary effort results in a painful loss. The third chapter is a boring, over-wrought sermon; the fourth chapter brings more pontification, miserable soul searching, and hackneyed attacks on religion; and, the fifth chapter is garrulous and didactic---an excruciatingly dull and inartistic parade of platitudinous ideas, littered with a pretentious display of Latin.

If one has the chance, do read!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce is an autobiography novel about a Catholic boy named Stephen Dedalus going to college and his life. Stephen Dedalus goes to Clongowes Wood College in Ireland. At school, Wells is a bully who makes fun of Stephen and pushes him into a pool, so he got sick. Charles Parnell died in the novel. Father Dolan punishes Stephen by hitting his hand with a patty bat for making an excuse that he lost his glasses on purpose. Stephen was brave enough to complain to the rector saying that he shouldn't have been punished by Father Dolan. The rector said he would talk to Father Dolan and fix this situation. Stephen's classmates carried him up because he told the rector what happened and everyone thinks he's a hero.One summer in Blackrock, Dublin, Stephen spends time with Uncle Charles and his father and they told him stories about their family history. Stephen's family has financial problems, so they moved to Dublin and Stephen transferred to Belvedere College. He begins to act in the play and plays the part of being a teacher. He receives a money award and treats his family to a nice dinner. He brought gifts to please his family and try to accept his family. Stephen has a crush on Emma by he never expresses his feelings toward her. Stephen expresses his feelings in a poem to Emma. He has his first sexual experience with a prostitute and then he feels sinful. He feels sinful that he couldn't confess to a priest about his sinful thoughts. He got accepted to the university and he feels happy because he made new friends and he felt free. Stephen confesses his sins to his friend Cranly and Cranly wants Stephen to interact more with his family about his problems. At the end, Stephen writes in his journal about his life.The part that I liked is when Stephen went to the university because it was the part where he really started to mature and felt comfortable with his new friends. The bad part is when he felt sinful, he didn't confess to a priest at his school. The book was easy to read, but some words were difficult to understand. This book is about a boy going through life and obstacles to achieve his goals in writing, acting, and becoming an artist. I would recommend this to teenagers in high school and college students. If you're interested in this book and want to know more information about it, you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Although James Joyce uses superior methods of description, symbolism, and analogy in Portrait of an Artist, I found the content and overall story hard to follow, random, and disorganized, not to mention boring. I had few problems identifying and following the story of Stephen Dedalus as a young child, however, I became lost and confused as Stephen got older. There were few transitions to identify Stephen's age progression, and I found myself confused as to when, how, and why Stephen had grown up and ended up in the arms of a prostitute. My impression was still that of a gradeschool boy, and I did not fully comprehend how old Stephen actually was until his confession with the priest.Perhaps my own upbringing has hindered my understanding and comprehension of Stephen's life. Never having been a member of the Catholic church, I found it hard to understand Stephen's background and beliefs, which has much emphasis within this story.Overall, I would say the organization of this book is its downfall. Portrait was tedious, hard to follow, boring, and unrelatable. One of the greatest works within English literature? Sorry, but not in my &quot;book.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is brilliant, I read it aged 12 and thought this man understands teenagers.

The only reason I read it was because it was required for my AP English class. From its sorted beginning, I knew I was in for one confusing time. Yes, I must admit that it did get better, but not nearly as much as some would like to think. The plot was unclear, and his &quot;journey&quot; through life is easily dubbed a bore. Stephen Dedalus is on a quest of sorts -- he is growing up, discovering who he is. With that comes adventures. But Joyce never elaborates on the ones that are the most dynamic, and continues on to drone about everything in the same monotone style. Mind you, it's all stream of consciousnes, which makes it even harder to digest. I DO NOT reccomend this book to ANYONE. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because I want to give him credit for fooling everyone into thinking this book has any literary merit."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Maybe I am a peaky reader, but the main thing that I expect from a book is to have some sense. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce is a big disappointment for me, because it's very very BORING.I know that I should not say that I dislike a book before I have finished it. But this novel is pretty disorganized; I couldn't resist reading more than some pages. I felt that I had wasted my time with this book, where almost nothing happens. I also had the impression that Stephen is an outsider - who remembers the entire conversation at the Christmas meal (for example) - not the main character. Probably I cannot understand the stream of consciousness technique, because I couldn't read Mrs. Dalloway either.There are too many characters that do not seem to be clearly defined and that discussion about religion - on the First Day of Christmas - was too long for my taste.If all Joyce's novels are as this one, then he lost me."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I remember trying to read a little bit of \\"Ulysses\\" when I was in high school and gave up flabergasted at the \\"stream of consciousness\\" prose, thinking that it was all beyond the comprehension of a mediocre intellect like mine. Well its been about nine years since then and I've learned quite a bit about the world to know that just because something is unintelligible, it does not neccessarily follow that that thing is profound.Once the novel gets going after the first few pages, it presents a diverting story through Joyce's alter ego, Stephen Dedalus. When we meet Stephen, he is a student at a Catholic private school in Ireland, probably in the late 1880's or early 1890's. I'm guessing that his age is somewhere in early adolesence. We are treated to scenes of Stephen contemplating his loneliness, and receiving gratuitious sadistic punishment from Father Dolan which he did not deserve. We are treated to an excellent dialogue at Stephen's family's Christmas dinner where some family friends and Mr. Dedalus get into violent discussion on the subject of Parnell. Parnell was the Irish nationalist, founder of Sinn Fein, who apparently died under disgrace heaped upon him by the Irish clergy for adultery or some such indiscretion.Then as we get into Chapter two, about the time we are told that Stephen's father is going bankrupt and plunging his family into poverty, the novel somehow starts to follow apart for me. The story startsto lose its feel for the characters and their trials and tibulations. The narration starts to get a little sloppy, jumping around everywhere in an opaque, spacey way. Exactly what is happening is a little opaque but here Joyce starts to introduce mysticism. Suddenly out of the blue, we receive vague hints that Stephen is having severe spiritual struggles. He has very depraved thoughts in him. The end of chapter two sees Stephen having his first session with a prositute in Dublin's red light district. These spiritual struggles are introduced with great clumsiness.Well Chapter three begins and Joyce starts pouring on the mysticism. At this point he quite loses me. The spiritual struggles of Stephen don't seem real; they are not interesting to me. I really started to lose interest in the novel, what with the lengthy boring speeches of the priests and so on. I got to the point in the novel where Stephen has confessed his sins, felt much better and then started to wonder about his spiritual strength in the face of sin, and so on. Then I decided I had more urgent things to do than complete this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"i put off reading portrait for a couple years, i do not know what i was thinking. i really connected with stephen dedalus.a little background on myself:12 years of catholic schools where i was fairly poor compared to the rest of my schoolmates while being fairly more intelligent than a lot of my schoolmates. so i could really feel for young dedalus.this book is a powerful and amazing story of vocation, love, growing up and flying away. some parts are difficult and some background in catholicism and theology probably help, but you will be glad that you stuck it out. truly a classic work of literature.now on to Ulysses!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"If you are looking for mindless entertainment, go watch TV. Joyce's &quot;Portrait&quot; is for those who truly appreciate great literature and are willing to dwell on every word of a marvelous artwork. This (obviously) takes time, which you probably have if you are reading this recreationally. As a high school student reading this piece as a requirement, I too had a certain measure of difficulty digesting the book at parts (mostly due to time constraints.) The effect of this difficulty though, is the splendid epiphany that you can, by the novel's end, view the world through the eyes of the genius Stephen. Like Faulkner, Joyce demonstrates confusion not through description, but by confusing the reader. This artistic ability is what separates &quot;classic&quot; literature from forgotten &quot;popular&quot; novels of past eras. This may be a little more involved than &quot;Chicken Soup,&quot; but for those of us who think about what they are reading and enjoy literary analysis, the novel is quite wonderful. You can read it on your own, but I would recommend referencing the myth of Daedalus and Icarus before reading the novel. Also, have a historical encyclopedia handy for names during the read.

I read this when I was in my twenties and have never fully recovered. Bliss."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Here we have the life of Stephen Dedalus before we meet him in the Telemachus episode of Ulysses. The most riveting section of the book is Stephen's decision to speak up to the rector about being wrongly accused about the breaking of his glasses. Stephen seems so powerless, facing the unyielding bulk of the Irish Catholic church. I cringe along with him as he makes his way slowly along the passage-way towards the rector's office to seek a reprieve and justice.Joyce is a master of the intensely subjective point of view, allowing the reader into the head of a charactor but also just enough outside to gain the perspective necessary to understand the character's environment. In his effects, Joyce is unyielding and yet the immediacy is so great that I become intensely absorbed in the moment before being thrown outside and lost, required to then work harder at understanding than I thought was necessary.While there is greatness here, after reading Ulysses it feels like a warm-up, without the imaginative leaps and greatness of scope of that novel. Yet \\"Portrait\\" also introduces the reader to the author of Ulysses - his preoccupations, his prejudices against the church and ambivalence towards much of Irish culture."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is a literary classic and should be read by people who wish to be educated in fine literature."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"marooned\\"--an utterly wrenching and boundlessly suggestive term to describe the situation of the young artist."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Considering the fact that I had to read this novel as a part of a school class, I think that my whole approach to the work was different then what it would normally have been. This is because when I read for enjoyment in my free time it is not the same as when I know that I will have to be analyzing and writing about it later for a grade. Anyway, I still read that book and so I am going to give my review. First off, I am glad that I read the book when I did. Steven Dadelus talked about the time when he was in high school and then how he went to college for most of the book. This was great for me because I could relate to the book and some of the experiences that he was going through. A problem that I experienced was that James Joyce makes many allusions to the past in his work. Often times I could not understand or have sufficient knowledge of the allusions included in the book. This made comprehension harder but I am sure the notes provided in the back of the book would help. The difficulty that I had in understanding the book bothered me because I knew that I would have to engage in graded discussions and possibly have to write a paper based off the book. I am sure that if I had read this book on my own it would have been such a big deal if I did not get everything. Finally this book requires a higher level of reading and so I discourage anybody that is a junior in high school or younger to avoid the book until they become older."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Scared at first, yes. I find reading can be fun and relaxing.. but I didn't quite experience either while reading this book. Not to mislead you, I don't think this book is bad. I can see how someone might really get into it, but I can also see how one might hate it.Half way through the book, I caught myself wondering, am I past the first few pages? It just didn't seem like much was going on... at all. I would find myself reading a page and then stopping to wonder, \\"do I remember anything that I just read? Or is it that there wasn't anything TO remember?\\" Generally the answer would be no, but I went on anyways, the thought of re-reading the section I daydreamed through too much to handle. The stream of consciousness thing just didn't turn out to be *my* thing. I prefer to go off on mental tangents myself rather than have someone do it for me, although it was sometimes interesting to see where someone else might end up. However, I did enjoy some of Joyce's language and phrasing. I found myself unable to resist underlining sentences that were simply beautifully written. Also...some major issues in this book are Irish politics and religion. If you are involved or educated much in either, it will be a good help. If you find it hard to relate to either, you may end up in my position, either bored or confused.In the end, it all comes down to what you like. This book is a challenge, can be rewarding if you succeed with it, but I found little joy in reading it."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Although the hero of James Joyce's novel is called Stephen Dedalus, the events and characters depicted in it parallel the author's own experiences. In his early childhood, at the very beginning of the 20th century, Stephen was sent to Clongowes, a Jesuit boarding school near Dublin. He disliked the place because his classmates bullied him, because he was taught religion in a dogmatic way and because he was flogged unjustly by his prefect of studies. After that he spent a summer with his uncle Charles in Dublin. Stephen was then sent to Belvedere college, which he disliked as much as Clongowes. The spirit of quarrelsome comradeship couldn't turn him away from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the agitation and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship, which he felt was an awful anticipation of adulthood.Stephen was by then aware that he didn't belong. He also felt more and more estranged from his father after having accompanied him once to Cork and witnessed his drinking habits, a journey which ended in Stephen's first experience in love making - a sordid one.More disappointment followed as Stephen went to university, thus becoming a disillusioned young man - a disillusionment caused by academicism, love and sex, his parents, religion and perhaps also his own country, Ireland..."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"if action is not your boat then you will probably enjoy this book. it chronicles the events of a young man's, stephen dedalus, youth and adolescent years. joyce depicts the struggle between Irish nationalism and religion beautifully, all while keeping pace with stephen's journey from the strict jesuit Clongowes to the less sheltered Belvedere to trinity university. don't expect to feel the same about Ireland's struggles after finishing this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Jimmy could write.

On a more profound level it questions private moral judgment and alligence to God. The choices are priesthood or independence, ultimately, as the boy doesn't 'abandon' the church so much as walk outside and try to find something else in life.

If you are the type of person that enjoys pondering every aspect, every page, and every word - this could be right up your alley. If, however, you enjoy reading for the sake of reading, skip this book.It's almost as if Joyce took pains to confuse and annoy the reader. Though filled with good chunks of reading, the sentence structure is very awkward, and the progression of the book is disjoint and puzzling at times. Joyce will capture you with some aspect of the main character's childhood, and then switch to an extremely boring dialogue about philosophy.I truly understand what Joyce was trying to convey, and is the reason why it's two stars. The themes of religion, politics, sex, and money all come in to play, and affect the main character as he moves from childhood, to adolescence, then to his teen years.

Without benefit of an excellent memory I can only say that this is a story about light and darkness, one that does not shy away from delving into the complexities of the human struggle, unafraid to throw daggers into the hearts of those among us who desire to truly feel and understand. Religious piety vs. secular liberty may be the story's main theme, but it is a conflict representative of the most universal of struggles --the struggle that is existence in a world where light and dark bleed into each other, where joy and sorrow are so often the same, where it is sometimes hard to tell the difference between you and I."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"While the movie Nora was really well done, and the life of James Joyce interesting, and romantic to an extent, his writings are hard to follow.

Its on Hulu.com for free."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Notice that I did not use the word novel because that would imply that this wad of paper had the semblance of a plot.Thus I will ask the readers what is the purpose of a novel? For there are many and each author interprets the call to the pen in a different way.Some novels aim to entertain. They do this by either providing funny and witty insight into out lives, showing something outrageous, providing a gripping plot, and so on. Even Tom Clancy manages to pull this off.Some books are made so that the reader will think. They do this by either being mystery novels or by inserting deeply symbolic meaning into the text. Agatha Cristie (sp) and William S. Burroughs are writers of this category.Some books are meant to enlighten. These are the biographies, the historical fiction pieces and the works that provides philosophical insight into various entities.Joyce attempts to write a book of the third category, but in my opinion fails miserably. He attempts to provide his own bioraphy, but does nothing but exagerrate and mock his own actions (in a very unfunny way). He also attempts to insert philosophical wisdom on the esthetic, something which he comprimises by his mean spirited mocking of the self. He also attempts to paint a portrait of Ireland, but he provides no context for the reader apart from the view of a pompous artist.So why on Earth should you read this? Well, some people claim that this book is seminal. Perhaps. However, so many writers have written in the style concocted by Joyce that one wonders why bother reading the original if better examples of this style exist. I see none. This book is about as entertaining as a stone wall, but a little harder to get through. It doesn't grip you, it makes no attempt to hold on. You have to put in all the effort in this zero sum relationship. You have to trudge through this mcokery of art, while the pages just sit back and give you nothing of their own.At that point I ask \\"Why bother?\\""},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"If the phrase &quot;stream of consciouness&quot; strikes fear in your heart, then RUN, and don't look back. PORTRAIT could have been a simple, sweet coming-of-age story but, like an Eliot poem or similar modernist offering, one can't read it without stopping every twenty seconds, referencing footnote, endnote and outside resource to get the big picture. On the one hand--what a rich novel. But yet, one has to ask oneself, which book do you want your nose in: a Latin-English dictionary, or the novel in question?In essence, PORTRAIT is a stolen glimpse into the mind of a genius, and the pains and pursuits of his adolescent life. And through this we endure the broad spectrum of male puberty, in all its unabashed glory. (Meanwhile, I'm sitting here asking myself 'wasn't it painful enough the first time?')A deceptively dense volume and keen insight into Joyce the Man and turn-of-the-century Ireland. Tedious, but fascinating nonetheless.

There's nothing that I hate more than a religous/spiritual epiphany."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I have failed to understand the significance of Portrait, if it exists at all. If you don't like this book because you don't understand it, then that's OK, it is a book for distorted academicians. In other words, the author is elitist. Was Joyce so embued with self-sympathy that he decided to immortalize his life in the form of a book or what? The style of narration is egoistic: Mr. Joyce is so pumped up with innovation that he decides to startle the reader into admiration. And his motives are understandable: without the style, this book would be like sewage without a sewer.Now the plot. What can I say? The plot concerns the life of a introvert by the name Stephen Dedalus. He is \\"different\\" for some reason, I guess because he shuns social contact, so he becomes an artist. Isn't that justified: you abandon yourself from society, and so you become a castaway, and to keep yourself from plunging into greater vagueness, you become an artist. Its almost as if Joyce himself is justifying his lifestyle. Anyway. Stephen has many mundane travels in such boring places as his quaint Catholic school, the disenchanting streets of Dublin, and the descriptionally absent countryside. I sometimes wonder what this book is truly about: the sexual maturation of a castaway, or an exploration into a unappreciably vague mind, or perhaps a egoistic narrative of social evils? The book's conclusion is equally vague: nothing happens, as I understand it. The process of vagueness probably ends in shaping a teenager into an \\"artist.\\" He even invents his \\"artistic theory\\", which is an unexpected break from the otherwise mysterious thoughts that choke his mind. There is plenty of sex (the bad kind, one that arises from pandering and failure), but not much more. Nonetheless, people most likely read this book to find out how it became famous.

I would heartly reccomend against reading this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is definitely a uniquely written, thought provoking book. Being a novel sharing the growth of an artist, it includes the experiences of a young man, Stephan Dedalus, and his interpretations of them. The novel is one of self-realization. This search occurs to everyone in life, as we set out in the world to see who we really are. The \\"who am I\\" dilemma is inevitable, and this novel shares the experience through an artist's perspective.Through Stephan's experiences he learns many things. He realizes he's still a boy when he's young. He strives to grow, he strives to participate in mature activities, and he strives to be the person he thinks he is. Yet as in any life, he doesn't grow up until he learns from his experiences, and grows from the insight he gains in each one.Joyce is an interesting author. The novel starts in a confusing fashion, the subject bounces, and the sentence structure is odd. However, his style ties into the growth of Stephan, and the connection between the writing style and story line is creative and interesting. The book starts when Stephen is young. His mind is scattered, and he doesn't see any need to analyze anything. He sees life from the surface, and lives to live instead of gain anything. This portion of the book is written in just this way. It tells the basics, it says what's going on, but offers no insight as to why, or how, or what anyone's thinking. As he grows older, however, Stephen learns and grows through his experiences. He gains maturity and insight into the things of life, and he offers a more thematic outlook on his experiences. He analyzes his situations, and gains more from them. The writing also matures. Words become meaningful, hidden symbols cover the pages, and with careful reading, the reader can see the growth in Stephen without paying attention to the plot.The novel is full of these meanings, symbols, and analogies. There are connections to birds, maturity, art, beauty, and water. Others exist as well, and many are found through personal interpretation. To a reader merely reading the book, these small twists are ignored, leaving the book meaningless and boring with a decent plot but not one to get excited about. However, with careful study and analysis, one can be immersed in searching for the small symbols and meanings hidden within the writings of the novel.The author goes in to a lot of detail about growth, and self-worth. A person needs to know who he is in order to fulfill everything he can out of life. Stephen's journey through this realization is portrayed a lot as he gets confused over girls, religion, family, school, and his personal insight on life. He feels alienated toward the world, as most people feel before they realize who they are. He's trying to place himself in a world without the experience needed to accomplish a position. Through his experiences, however, he learns. Stephen learns that living life is more important than figuring it out. And this realization alone helps him figure it out. He learns the pure joy of beauty and finds his joy in art, and in himself.Over-all, the book was interesting. Being a person not too detail oriented, I had a rough time with it. However, after analysis and pondering, I came to enjoy the novel, and all it has to offer. I found the growth of Stephen interesting, and his inner struggle clearly portrayed through his experiences in life."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's' fictional but semi- autobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, is a deep and extremely creative book. It is a novel about a boy, Stephen Dedalus and his struggles to grow up, break away from the confining restrictions of church, family, and country (patriotism), and to ultimately find himself as an individual and artist.Throughout the book, Stephen moves around many schools, and is always alienated. At first, he longs for his family and feels like an outcast, isolated from his peers at school. Stephen' s sensitive nature and isolation from others is evident as he wallows in the unfairness and troubles he finds in various situations. Here, we first see Stephen beginning to develop some individuality when he decides to stand up for himself and speak to the schoolmaster when unfairness occurs. Rewarded for his bravery, Stephen begins to find more of a place among his peers, yet it is still awkward and difficult.Constantly, we see Stephen trying to fit himself in places where he doesn't naturally fit. School is an excellent example of this. Sometimes his essays contain too much &quot;heresy&quot; for a Catholic school -teacher's liking, so they try to discourage and confine Stephen's true self. Often there are bullies which only elevate Stephen's fear to be himself, like the time when some bullies try to make him say one poet is better than another. Repressed by these forces, Stephen is very unhappy and confused.In church, Stephen struggles to adapt himself to the moral rigors and rules of the Catholic faith. He in essence tries to purge himself of sin at one point after an incident with a prostitute and the sermons of a priest basically scare him into confession and piety. As he tries to deny his natural side but it is to no avail.Stephen's plight is like that of a fish and a bird in love and the relationship just not being able to work. Stephen's body is like the fish and his soul is the bird. In the book, Stephen's soul tries to survive in the water, but he's drowning and unhappy. The end solution turns out to be the fish/ body of Stephen in essence growing it's own wings to be able to dwell in happiness with his soul.Stephen has to make the choice to either give up his soul and individuality to adapt to society and the restraints of his family, country, and church or &quot;to live, toe err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.&quot; (Pg., 123). Obviously, by the end of the book, Stephen had &quot;recreated&quot; his life in a way that he could be free and happy. His newly created wings take him away from the country that tries to tie him down with patriotism, the family that drags him down with their unintelligent spending of money and rules, and the church with it's monopolizing power and foreboding echoes of damnation.The book is a journey that uses a lot of abstract imagery, like birds and Stephen's feelings towards them at the beginning and the end of the book. At first, Stephen fears the birds: &quot;the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.&quot;(Pg. 2) but gradually throughout the book, the birds change to a friendlier, beautiful thing to Stephen. I think this says a lot about his view of self-liberation and freedom. At the beginning, freedom is scary- all Stephen wants to do is be accepted, but by the end, the birds are &quot;a strange and beautiful&quot; (Pg. 123) thing that Stephen admires. His view of freedom has changed as he has liberated himself from the three restricting forces: Church, Family, and Country.The talent of Joyce as a writer to convey vivid images and feelings to the reader cannot be denied. He is truly amazing at painting a picture with show not tell writing and description. I enjoyed that aspect of the book. Despite the talent of the author, I found this book to be uninteresting, strange, and annoying at times to read because it simply didn't cater to the reader. As an author shouldn't you write to the audience? I had to work vigorously just to keep my attention through the long, tricky passages where Joyce tries to represent something figuratively. It was often an annoyance and frustration that made the reading less enjoyable. Overall, the writing level of idea, creativity, and thought were excellent, I just thought he could have made his points and ideas more clear to the reader."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, by James Joyce, is perhaps one of the most difficult books to get into that I have ever read. It begins somewhat randomly with odd words such as moocow and baby tuckoo. Joyce's thoughts are hard to follow, and the lack of true dialogue makes it even more difficult. Luckily, after enduring the first few pages, I was soon swept up into the troubled world of young Stephen Dedalus. I could relate to many of his childhood experiences and my heart ached for him at times. There were other instances when it was amusing to view the world through his young, boyish eyes.As Stephen moves into adolescence, I am struck by the parallels between this book and Hermann Hesse's Beneath the Wheel. They both tell about the spiritual journey of two young boys, though the endings are different. I feel a deep sense of empathy with Stephen's estrangement from his peers, his guilt, and his desire to do what is right. When he goes off to University I really admire his change in personality. He begins to develop a nonconformist attitude, and decides not to do things just because other people think he should. He branches off from his peers and goes about developing his artistic abilities. He listens to his internal forces, rather than the outside influences. This is the ideal personality, the perfect way to live your life. It was so refreshing to read about someone who was able to shake of the chains of society and live his own life. He is unconcerned with politics and appreciates the aesthetic quality in all things. Beauty becomes very important to him. Near the end he makes the decision to follow the footsteps of his namesake, Daedalus the mythical creator of wings, and fly. He leaves Ireland in order to become completely free. I admire his deep independence, although his moral convictions I do not. I think a firm religious foundation is essential for truly becoming an individual. That was Stephen's tragic flaw; an anti-religion attitude. I understand his unwillingness to accept Catholicism just because his family was Catholic. The greatest men in history have searched long and passionately until they found what true religion meant to them. That is the one thing that restricts Stephen's progression. He would have been truly great, if only he would have sought for religious truth.This novel was enjoyable to read most of the time. It was cleverly written with vivid descriptions and a unique style. This book is not for everyone to read. Those with closed minds and hearts should not even bother. However, those looking for a moving, inspiring story would do well to venture into this book. It's fascinating to watch Stephen grow up and mature and see how things that happened when he was a boy, profoundly affect his adolescence and adulthood. So, screw your patience to the sticking place for the first few pages, and delve into James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist. You'll like what you find."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,&quot; is a testament to the potential power of prose. Supposedly semi-autobiographical, it displays the first instance of Joyce delving into the stream-of-consciousness technique in novel form, and though not as experimental as &quot;Ulysses&quot; or &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; it remains an essential for anyone who enjoys literature."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"okay this is a review for all of you teenager like people out there. i too must confess to being of this obscure species! but, unlike other people my age, i actually am chosing to read this book. i can only imagine what would happen if it were assigned to my english class... im sure they would riot. i admit i have a greater understanding of the irish language and culture, having lived in cork when i was 16 (and now im 17... geez the time flies..)so what i have to say about this story is this: in the teenage world of the intellectual, the interested, and the apathetic, i fall under the categorie of interested. this book ranges from the highly interested to the intellegent. in other words, you have to be really interested in irish culture and/or the coming of age of one james joyce, or really intellectually inclined to the extent of thoroughly understanding joyce's stream-of-consciousness style of writing. i admit that i do not truly understand it. actually, i am not quite done the book and i am praying that the end will bring it all together, but im not holding my breath. i've heard finnegan's wake is worse though... anyway, i recommend this book not to everyone, but to people with high attention spans or keen interest in ireland at the turn of the 20th century or people who like challeneges or literature professors or people with lots of time on their hands or kids who want to prove they're really smart...i dont see why they say james joyce is such a genius, if only a select few of us will truly understand his work...? and believe me he is hailed as a genius in ireland, he's on the ten pound note. i'd give this book a B-"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Reading the reviews for this book, you'll typically get one oftwo types of people:1) the sullen high school student which saysthe book &quot;sucks&quot; because it was hard to follow and/or has a boring plot2) the elitist pedant responding to this who calls the high schoolers are idiots who just aren't &quot;in the know&quot; enough to appreciate this book.Though I tend to side with the #2ers, I hope to strike a happy medium. Yes, this book is boring if you look at it as a story with a plot and nothing else. No, you can't say this book is great because you didn't understand it but feel obligated to pretend that you did.This book really isn't that hard to follow, plot-wise. It's a little--very little--stream of consciousness-like in its style, but if you pay attention you'll know what's going on (be grateful; in Joyce's last novel he creates his own language and writes in it). It is, however, a modernist work, which in Joyce's case means it gives the inner mind precedence over the outer world. If you can get into it, it's a wonderful book, very moving at times, and always thought-provoking. Most people place this book in the top 5 novels written this century (Joyce's other famous novel, Ulysseys, is almost always #1).If you just can't get past the manner in which this book is written, then don't bother with it. Try again in a couple of years; I wouldn't have enjoyed this book much in high school. Otherwise, give it a serious shot--that means actually *reading* the text instead of passing your eyes across it and seeing the words--and you'll probably be very happy with it; I was, at least. END"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"To relate to this book, one must have undergone a singular thing: life. Joyce tends to strike readers as esoteric, and this may very well apply to his later works, but the simultaneously silken and granular, static and dynamic, putrid and esthetic language of this book constructs within its contratictions and eddies of variety a vision of the adolescent experience so vivid and voratious that a single word reflects that vision as truly as a particle of light reflects the object of its illumination. The perfect preparation for &quot;Ulysses&quot;, this book will gently dip the reader into the murky waters of stream-of-conciousness prose as well as acquaint him or her with Joyce's philosophical viewpoint. And if none of that interests you, the prose (in particular the lyrical &quot;child-speak&quot; of the first chapter and the sleepy, fluid imagery of the second section of the fifth) is quite simply a feast of adjectives and verbs so dripping and tremulous that the reader might sense them squirming on the page. This novel will echo thickly through the artistic plane of the mind that we all to some degree possess."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce really challenged me with this novel, yet I enjoyed every minute spent in attempt to grasp the full meaning. What I liked the most were the epiphanies at the end of each chapter, where Stephen's senses are drastically heightened. Each epiphany is then followed by another series of questioning and doubt. I am sure that many readers can relate to Stephen in some way, for he struggles to find the meaning in his own life. He cannot find it through nationality, family, and even religion. Likening himself to Lucifer, Stephen remains in a state of doubt and disbelief in Catholicism, claiming &quot;I will not serve.&quot; He must break free from all of the restraints that are holding him back from individual thought and go beyond in order to develop his own artistic theory. I am thankful that we were forced to read this in AP English. Thank you MR.

For me, it's a classic because it's full-fledged art about what it takes to become a full-fledged artist: the obsession, the intelligence, the ego, and the time.&lt;P"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one of the more complex books, from a reader's standpoint, in that it doesn't move along in a logical fashion. However, this shouldn't dissuade you from reading it. There is much to be learned in the semi-autobiographical novel by James Joyce. It is the story of a young boy and his experiences growing up in Ireland. The age of the main character (Stephen Dedalus) at the beginning of the novel is not known. But it can be inferred that he is probably between 6-9 years old. The book continues with his life experiences, from his point of view, until he is in his late teen years. There is much to be learned about life in Ireland, the role of the church and politics in a boy's life, and the development of a young man as he grows up from this novel.The literary techniques used in this novel are very interesting, no doubt ideas from an extremely talented writer, but it is these techniques that can leave a reader easily wondering what's going on. The language of the novel itself progresses with the maturity of the main character. The book begins with small snap-shots of young Stephen's life. The ideas put forth in the first few pages are ideas that you might expect from the mind of a young grade school child. Unfortunately these ideas are also as random as you might expect from a young child and it is sometimes hard to follow the plot. Thankfully as the novel progresses it becomes more structured in its presentation and is much easier to understand. In fact, at the end of the story, the novel is written as entries from a journal. Some of the images that Joyce uses throughout his novel are birds, water, hands, and the color white. It is interesting to look at how Stephen's perception of these different images changes as the novel progresses.The issues of religion and politics play a large role in this novel. I am not very familiar with the politics or religious conflicts that existed in Ireland during the time period when this book was written. It would be helpful to be aware of these issues while reading this book, as they are very central to the plot. It was interesting even with a lack of knowledge to see a young boy's perception of the Catholic Church and also to see how his perception changed as the novel progressed.Another interesting thing that I found while reading \\"Portrait\\" was how Stephen was constantly trying to find somewhere to fit in. He seemed to be an outcast throughout the book, finally at the end deciding to leave his country and religion behind. I didn't like the ending because it seemed to me that he was just running away from his problems. This seems to be a common problem today and I didn't like the fact that it was romanticized in \\"Portrait\\".I was required to read this book as part of an English class and I can honestly say that it is a book that I would not have read otherwise. It had its good points and was definitely thought provoking but I don't feel that I would highly recommend it. One thing that might be helpful in reading this book would be to look at some commentary of the book before attempting to read it. That way, you could be familiar with what to look for rather than plodding along (as I did) for much of the book trying to figure out what's going on."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"There's a reason why Stephen wasn't the main character in &quot;Ulysses.&quot; While his hypersensitivity, acute intellectualism and quasi-pretentious ideas about the aesthetics of poetry and Shakespeare are attractive from a distance, his callow arrogance and sarcasm are ultimately off-putting. Leopold Bloom, for me, is the greatest character in 20th century literature because his age has brought him qualities that the post-adolescent Stephen can only ponder or mock: humility, inquisitiveness and a love for his wife that can withstand the challenges of Blazes Boylan.I don't mean to disparage &quot;A Portrait&quot; by claiming its worth lies primarily in its position as a precursor to &quot;Ulysses,&quot; but it really is dwarfed by that book and Joyce's masterpiece, &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot; Here, the prose experiments are clumsy and frustrating: take, for example, the romantic drivel about birds, dew and Eileen in chapters four and five; while Joyce might have intended this second-rate Yeats impersonation to demonstrate how Stephen's naivete is struggling with new ideas, it's fairly embarrassing nonetheless. The journal entries are kind of cool as a taste of what would soon come in &quot;Ulysses,&quot; but they come off a bit dry.I found Stephen much more likeable before his decision to repent in the third chapter. Before, he had to struggle with the conflict in his soul between the pleasures of the brothel and eternal damnation. This was also before he became stubbornly confident in his own self-righteousness, and I can believe that the feelings he describes are painfully real. Afterwards, he briefly becomes a priggish repentant, and then the climax of the novel comes when he throws off the yoke of the priesthood and embraces the sight of Eileen stroking the sea-water &quot;hither and thither&quot; (a delicious reminder of the much more appealing ALP in the &quot;Wake&quot;).Eileen is now kept in the distance as Stephen prattles endlessly about Aristotle and Aquinas, his precious individuality and his oncoming exile. His friends are intelligent but boorish and scornful. By the end of the novel, Stephen is ready to embark on his artistic journey, but I couldn't help noticing how cynical his final journal entries sounded.Joyce is the master novelist of the past century, and even his mediocre work is woven with the threads that would continue in his two final novels. &quot;A Portrait...&quot; remains a fascinating though curiously empty tale of a young man growing detached from his senses and beliefs."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I wanted to like this book, it is after all considered \\"literature.\\" It isn't that the book isn't well-written. It is. It isn't that the book has no value, of course it has much value. I for myself, as I couldn't finish the book, like Joyce's main character Stephen Dedalus:I 'do not know where the universe ended.'In this instance, this book was the universe that I did not know where it ended. I think male readers, people who like a stream-of-consciousness read that captures primarily the ambiance of another person's experience, languishes over what to think and feel, and begs the question, \\"Is that right?\\" will like this book. I suppose this book is a coming-of-age story of some kind.I did not like it. Stories that move me are stories that have a plot, and point, along with the lovely prose. I felt despair in the reading of what, at times, felt like a carefully recorded description of a person's mundane experience. Stories are meant to be life, with the boring bits left out. Sadly, I found much of this book boring. I found it an excruciatingly detailed recap of someone's experience, and every mundane little aspect of that experience at that. I believe a writer has an obligation, when not writing memoir or pure biography, to entertain.It really feels, at times, as if the author purely wrote down other people's words as delivered and considered that dialogue. The work is filled with details and description and dialogue and action and it meanders, without point. Sadly, I will have to use that queer word, as Joyce calls it, and say that, for me, this sucks.In contrast, I love the writerly genius that isDubliners (Illustrated Edition)."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"At first it's elusive as hell, but once Stephen starts to develop mentally, it goes through some very well rendered (if fairly standard) buldinsroman tropes. Especially the little creative epiphanies he has along the way, which feel vital and at times, even beautiful almost a century later. There is a lot of mucking about with nascent catholic guilt, and the various kinds of guilt that arise from blindly accepting, fighting and eventually rejecting said catholic guilt. I felt like there might also have been a whole layer of classical allusions which I'm just not educated enough to get, what with the little quips in latin and all. I like Stephen Daedalus, but I didn't find myself genuinely caring about his ambitions and insecurities the way I did with the characters in Dubliners."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is a deeply compelling and memorable work. Every writer from novice to master levels should read The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is a must read for the following people:The Irish, Catholics, anyone who likes a good bildungsroman, Agnostics, Poets, Writers, Modernism Enthusiasts, Artists, people who love aesthetic theory, and Hipsters.If you do not fall into any of the above categories, then you probably haven't heard of this book and therefore would not be looking at this review."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man follows Stephen Dedalus from his childhood through his coming of age. Joyce chronicles Stephen's sexual, emotional, and intellectual awakening as the novel progresses. As Stephen ages, Joyce's writing style evolves with him, increasing in complexity to reflect Stephen's increasing awareness and intelligence. As Stephen expands his mind, it brings him into conflict with the Catholic ideals he was raised with, as well as challenging his notions of nationality.There are far too many layers to this novel to really do it justice in an Amazon review and I'll save everyone from reading another English lit essay. Suffice to say that I found this novel challenging to read, but ultimately rewarding in its well-crafted prose and thought-provoking ideas. Stephen's grapples with his faith, his country, with love, and ultimately with expression were intriguing and compelling. For its simple beginnings, the novel contains description and passion that sears the page. For example, the accounts of hell in the third section alone were so terrifyingly rendered that I had nightmares the evening I finished reading it.This is one of the most powerful pieces of literature I've read in some time. I highly recommend it to any one who is or has been a seeker of knowledge and what is true. This book may not have the answers, but it's an interesting portrayal of the mental journey of one man."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The writing is most definitely the work of a gifted scribe. The use of language and descriptives is amazing. Unfortunately, large passages of the book are devoted to somewhat demonizing Catholic sermons that make a point, but a long winded one. The two most interesting discussions - What is art? and Do you believe in god/religion? - occur only near the very end of the book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I began reading this book with the wrong attitude. More than anything, I was worried that I would have a difficult time getting through it, and didn't even want to try. To be honest, the first page alone scared me to death. Joyce jumps from wetting the bed, to the smell of his mother, to songs from his childhood. (ALL IN ONE PAGE!) Once I got past the initial confusion and frustration, I really enjoyed all that Joyce had to offer.Coming from a religious household, I really got into all of the Roman Catholicism that Joyce shares with the reader. I was able to relate to the moral and religious struggles Stephen encounters throughout his maturation. On a personal level, I can identify with the many high and low points that occur during one's spiritual journey. It is a great book for teens, who often begin to doubt what they believe, whether they are of a religious persuasion or not.The best part of Joyce's work, by far, is the stream of consciousness writing style he uses. At the beginning of the book, his writing is very disconnected, jumpy, and rather confusing. But this writing style (which can be a stumbling point for many) is meant to show the way the mind of a child functions. As Stephen gets older, his thoughts become more and more cohesive, and the reader has a much easier time getting through each chapter. By using this style, Joyce shows us in writing what constantly goes on in our heads without consciously acknowledging it.All in all, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a very thought-provoking, and even addictive book. Give it a try, even if you are timid about reading James Joyce for the first time. This book has something in it for any person of any belief system."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"When I first started reading this book it bored me. I kept finding myself thinking about other things while mudering the words in my head. I didnt really understand the whole background between the church and the Irish leader, but I did some research in class and the book made more sense to me. When I came to chapter three the book started to hit me more. I could actully relate to Dedalus, although I had never really gone to church. I have always believed in god and always been taught to pray to god, but never really attended church, because of this I have had times in my life where I have felt afraid, because of my sins I have commited. I have also heard alot about confession and even baptism, both things I have never done, which also scared me. The book turned on me and confused me even more in the next chapter when he decides that he totally has nothing more to do with religion and wont even pretend to for the love of his mother. This book overall was alright, I never started to appreciate this book until I was done reading it and actually analyzed it. The stream of consciousness is a very neat approach to a book and draws the reader in, because they think some of the same thoughts in the sam situations. During the this time of my life I am growing older and seem to be seeing things in a different light. I read this book at the most perfect time of my life."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's semi-autobiographical Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one of the most challening, informative, and enlightening works I've read thus far. Tracking the life of the protagionist, young Stephen Dedalus (from a child to his early twenties), we see how he grows and changes spirtitually and intellectually. We see how he lives in fear and awe of the highly influential (espically in Ireland at the time) Catholic church which he and his family are a part of, an institution which he initially respects and fears, then grows to question and challenge, eventually leaving the church for good. We see Stephen conversing with fellow intellectuals at his university, and we gather opinions and thoughts of educated, respected young people during a harsh time in Ireland's history.The language, places, and events described in Portrait are what make the book espicially challenging, as many readers (like myself) would have been lost without the notes in the back. Eventually, you beging to paint a very vivid mental picture of what Stephen's life was like in Ireland and form a better understanding of Ireland's political issues at the time (if you, like me, are not an expert on 20th century Irish politics) and of his issues and questions as well.My favorite aspect of Portrait is that even though the issues Stephen/Joyce faced as a young man are very different than the ones facing young men today, there are many parallels to be drawn. As we come of age (I am 18 myself) we finally being to form an identity of who we are and what we truly believe. In Joyce's day, there could be family arguements and stress caused over which side of the religious fence you were on (Catholic/Protestant). In our day, there have been many family fights between the more conservative Americans in the family and the liberal members of the family, and how we all think our country chould be run and how we should live our lives.As a child, Stephen lived in fear and awe of the intimidating church he attended, yet as he became a mature young man he drew his own conclusions and formed his own identity, breaking away from what he was lead to believe by his parents. Today, almost the same instances can happen, as they have for me. I would fear attending church of Sundays as a child, afraid that the priest would give another sermon of the horrors of hell and tell us what we need to do to save ourselves (read the book for a very graphic depiction of hell by one of Stephen's priests). Now, however, I have drawn my own conclusions on religion and life, and no longer have to be a part of the church that I was told I had to believe in as a child too young to make of all this deep thinking, as Stephen was as a child.The most important messege that can be taken away from Portrait is to find your identity and never be afraid to express it, despite the reactions you may recieve from your parents, peers, etc.The messege is be who you are, and that is a messege that will never fade away with time."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Portrait of the Artist is Joyce's Kunstleroman about the growth of sensibility in a young genius. The novel is luminous and because it is early Joyce, it's accessible as the writing style is straight ahead narrative modified to reflect the writer's age in various stages of his youth. It is easy to witness the writer's sensibility heighten as he matures: his sense of protest, his growing perspective of his life, church and nation. Proust and Joyce wrote at about the same time but met only once briefly in an awkward exchange and Joyce lived for years in self-imposed creative exile in Paris. In the later chapters there are stylistic similarities between early Joyce and Proust, whose style and narrative voice are consistent throughout the 4300 pages of La Recherche du Temps Perdu. However, Joyce's narrative technique changed radically as he grew as a novelist from Portrait to Ulysses and finally to Finnegan's Wake. In Joyce's willingness to experiment unfettered by style, voice, syntax, genre and diction he changed the English language: he left it better than he found it. Chapters 4 and 5 are brilliant and take flight like Daedalus, the inventive hawkman. If you seek an entry point into Joyce's work, this relatively simple, straightforward novel is your window. \\"To speak of these things and to try to undestand their nature and, having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come to understand -- that is art.\\" I can't encourage you more strongly to explore Joyce -- he was the most luminous genius who ever wrote a novel."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A previous reviewer states that this book doesn't focus on substance, and that the substance (for him) is in the story. While I don't disrespect this view, it does seem unnecessarily limiting for oneself as a reader.In my opinion this is an innovative book because it focuses on internal response rather than external action--the internal is the substance of Portrait. Of course being innovative doesn't make it good--it's the fact that it does this introspection very well, completely, and unapologetically that makes the book a successful endeavor. One of my favorite moments is the first full paragraph of 254, which starts \\"A louse crawled over the nape of his neck...\\".I can understand that to some, this endless recording of introverted response might seem self-indulgent in its excess, but I think that the length and dramatic language is needed to express the depth that is inside, not just little Stevie Dedalus, but all of us.Isn't this one of the prime purposes of art? To force us to look at ourselves in a way that we haven't before? Of course, if we don't give the piece of art a fair chance, it can never succeed.Unlike other reviewers--I'm not reviewing based on whether or not I agree with the main character's conclusions (and therefore James's conclusions), but on whether or not the artist achieved his aims.Incomprehensible? It's only incomprehensible if you expect to read a clear and informative essay. That's not the purpose, it's to convey the innermost thoughts of one individual--and these thoughts/feelings/responses are not always perfectly clear--in fact, they rarely are, in any of us.Why a 4 instead of a 5? Because Portrait feels more to me like a series of stories that only happen to occur chronologically, rather than a bonified novel. I don't feel like I've gone from point A to B when I'm done. Maybe this aspect is unavoidable given the true goal of the book, as I've interpreted it, but I'm just being honest."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This spiritual autobiography contains within it the themes which Joyce would expand and elaborate in his masterwork ' Ulysses'. But this work too is a masterpiece which gives us a portrait of an artist in development , and a picture of the society, the church, the family he would go into exile from . Joyce's center is in his consciousness of language, and his creation and recreation of it. He begins the autobiography in the baby language of beginning, and throughout adjusts styles to the situation and level of life he happens to be in. But the fundamental portrait is of the young artist in development, a development of his knowledge and artistic skills but also a development toward knowledge and estrangement from the world which he comes from. He will leave his family, and his native land and his church not so much for the exile of Trieste or Zurich or Paris or any place in particular but for that situation in which he can be wholly alone to shape in the smithy of his soul the uncreated conscience of his race. Joyce master of ironies sees perhaps the vanity of his own vaunted ambition but nonetheless is true to it to the end. This work is filled with remarkable and beautiful passages, interesting meetings and in a way memorable characters. It opens us to a new world the world of a great artist whose epiphanies on oval leaves will tell of the great transformation and development of his life- in which the spiritual realm is no longer the Catholic and conventionally religious but is usurpred by the great truth telling and beauty- creating realm of Literature. This work is in parts difficult to read, but even if with the help of some kind of crib it should be ventured . For it is a great work indeed."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Do you wish to be an author of a book some day? Do you want to make a movie or a script for one? If so, do you want it to be popular, that people will like it? Lots of people. Well, in the past, and not so distant really, before most things were businesses and entertainment, there was this thing called, 'art'. Hard to say what this thing was and is, but this book is an example and Joyce is a maker, an artist. What is interesting about this work is it is art and sort of shows what it is to be an artist at the same time. I think it is for young people. As I say I am not sure what art is, but it seems to be appreciated more by people after the artist dies then when he was living. But I do not think most artist mind, much, since they probably write for themselves and not so people would like it. But maybe you will, who knows?"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Portrait...defines a new turn in the century of fiction writing. From the cold, heartless times of Ireland, here is a tale of growing up that offers a critical insight into the heart of an eight year old.Joyce's style is inimical,imperfect yet charming. he paints the human world of emotional bonding in the most natural way on a child hearted canvas.A great contrast from Ulysees, Portrait...is definitely a read that would make you sit up and wonder about the simplest of life's truths"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is my first Joyce book to read. I had high expectations. It was difficult to get a feel for his writing initially, but I finally got into the rythm of it and it started to flow.The book does not have much action; it is introspection and dialogue and remembrances that all run together. It is unique and exhilirating to read, but is not a page turner as many top-rated books of today are. It reads more like a memoir than a novel, and according to accounts I read, it is a story similar to Joyce's own.I was able to relate to the tension between living a secular versus a religious life.I think for serious readers, this book has to be on the must-read list."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is an interesting book about Stephen's life in college and how he had to overcome obstacles of family problems and his religious belief of God. It tells how he struggles with life in the real world. The style writing of the book was easy to read, but some of the vocabulary words were hard to understand. I liked the book because it tells about Stephen's life in college and so on. I liked the part where he stood up to the rector and told him that it was wrong for Father Dolan to punish him. I liked the part when Stephen went to the university because it was the part where he really started to mature and felt comfortable with his new friends. He felt free to write in his journal about events that happened in his life. The book was interesting talking about God (Jesus) and what happens to sinful people. The bad part of the book is when Stephen sinful for sleeping with the prostitute. He shouldn't have slept with her because there are consequences to his actions.I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults because this book is hard to understand for younger children. I would recommend this book to college students because the book starts in college and goes on."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Better than the story itself, was the wonderful language in which Joyce used in writing it. I think that the story is worthy of being accepted as a classic merely for Joyce's superb usage of words. Now, as for the story in its self, it wasn't that great. I mean, it was good, but I've read better. The story - a semiautobiographical account of the life of James Joyce - is very emotional and at times makes you feel as if you're the main character, Stephen Dedalus. Go ahead it and read it, just don't expect it to be a roller-coaster ride."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Portrait is a wonderful novel, don't let anyone tell you differently. All of the simple minded dunderheads can complain all they'd like; those who are &quot;in the know&quot; will certainly appreciate their abscence from the table of literary discussion.

Not only was the stylenothing like D.H. Lawrence's _The Rainbow_, which I had just had so much trouble with, but, as I had read _Ulysses_ (and Don Gifford's annotations to the same) over the summer, I felt that I had the necessary background to understand what could have been a very confusing narrative. For instance, when Parnell's name turned up, I instantly knew that this was the Irish politician who had nearly gotten a bill through the English parliament on Home Rule, only to then be disrailed by a scandal involving his long-time affair with a married woman. I also knew that the clergy had been somewhat hypocritical on the Parnell issue, waiting until he was declared guilty in court of adultery before coming out with their own condemnation, a fact that did not sit well with many Irish nationalists. Facts such as these, gleaned from my six weeks with Joyce's masterpiece, gave me a key to the background of the text.But even more, what I liked about _Portrait_ was the, for Joyce, fairly clean style with which the story was told. I feared that _Portrait_ might reflect any one of the experimental styles in _Ulysses_, I was pleasantly surprised by the fairly linear (if occasionally vague with respect to time scale or particular period) storyline.Things didn't stay simple for long, though. Chapter three and the extended sermon was tough to wade through, even if I did feel a personal connection to the crisis of faith experienced by Stephen. In the next three chapters, I was much more unsure of what exactly was taking place-the sentence structure was more complex and the descriptions less concrete.I am somewhat confused by what actually happens at the end. I think I understand that Stephen refuses the priesthood because his brief experience as a religious acolyte (debasing himself by refusing the pleasures of the world) and his soul is still uneasy. He also, I feel, begins to have a doubt of the power of faith, a rationalist's questioning of the sacraments of faith. And he rejects the way of Irish nationalism for its own sake. But what does he assume as his path? The title gives some indication that it is art, but I hesitate to point at anything in the last chapter that shows this."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&amp;#65279;A Portrait of an Artist was a surprise to me. I read it as a school assignment but I actuallyenjoyed it a little. It was a thought provoking book and was very well written. James Joyce's'fictional but semi- autobiographical novel was very creative. It was written in a style that I havenever read before. It wasn't first person or third person, but it also wasn't quite a third personomniscient. It was a new style to me but James Joyce made it work.It is a novel about a boy, Stephen Dedalus and his struggles to grow up, break away fromthe confining restrictions of church, family, and country (patriotism), and to ultimately findhimself as an individual and artist. Most of these struggles are very similar to things that all of ushave gone through(with exception of becoming an artist). I think many of the problems he facedwere a little amplified, and that helped show what kind of person Stephen was. He was verythoughtful and he tried, like many of us to fit into many places that he didn't naturally fit.All through the book Stephen changes schools and is never accepted by the other kids atthe school. Eventually he decides to stand up for himself by talking to the school master afterbeing punished unfairly. He is rewarded for his bravery and begins to be accepted by his peers.But he still doesn't quite fit in.The thing that stuck out most to me was the jesuit priests and how they preached abouthell and damnation. I thought it was an extreme way to try and control the way the kids act. Itseemed as though they were trying to scare them into being good instead of having them do it forthe right reasons. Ultimately scaring people into something rarely works. If you want them to dosomething they have to do it for the right reasons or they will not continue to do it in the future.One of the most interesting things for me was seeing the way Joyce used the imagery, heis so good with words. I enjoy reading the vivid descriptions he uses and find myself forming amental picture much easier than I do when reading other books. One thing I disliked about thisbook was the lack of plot. I t was difficult to find a story line to follow. While the creative style,imagery and wording of the book interested me I did find it hard at times to continue readingbecause there was nothing that made me want to continue to the next chapter. Nothing thatcaught my attention and made me want to find out what happens next.Overall I would recommend this book because of it's creative style and great word usage.I think if you read this book through and give it a chance, then you will be satisfied. With thisbook you do have to read all the way to the end or it will seem like a waste of your time."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man is an intense book. I realize that it is often at the top of many a best-seller list. But, it will not be at the top of mine, although the book is both well crafted and thought provoking. James Joyce shadows the main character, Stephen Daedalus, through his youth, starting at around six years of age. Joyce shows Stephen's progression from dependent child to free artist in a very unique way. There is a change in the writing style of the piece just about every chapter, which can be very confusing. Showing Stephen's progression as a person through progression in writing style is unique. But, it can cause serious problems for an unsuspecting reader. I for one, upon first picking up the book, found the first few pages just about impossible to decipher. I did not understand what was going on. After a few readings, and some help from friends, I finally understood that Joyce begins his book from the stream of consciousness of a six-year old child. When I understood that, the book had much more worth to me, but until I did, I felt convinced it was a piece of garbage. Another key to note is that in order to fully understand the allusions in the book, one must be familiar with the myth of Icarus and Daedalus.One of the best things about Portrait of An Artist As a Young Man is the use of language. Joyce is a master with words, and can, in a few short sentences, create very vivid pictures of what he hopes to portray. His bird imagery especially, is developed to such an extent that the reader can follow just the progression of the images to understand what is happening in the plot of the story. Plot, though, for this book, is not the best word to use since Joyce did not create a real plot for the book. There is no real storyline to follow, which made the book difficult for me to read. There is not much to carry you through. It is a fight to stick with the book, because most of the time there is nothing pushing the reader onwards, at least in my opinion. Still, sticking with the book did give me a sense of accomplishment in the end, as I was able to finally put it down and think about it. If I had not been able to think about the true significance later, it is quite possible that I would have missed the point of the book, and for that reason, hated it."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I read this years ago in college and once or twice afterwards though I haven't had the chance to re-read it in recent years. Still it lives on vividly enough in my memory to allow a review, here, I think.Joyce was a strange one, where writing was concerned, focusing as he did on language as a means to evoke the world rather than merely for telling a &quot;story&quot;. Over the years I have come to conclude that fiction requires narrative requires storytelling . . . and yet Joyce successfully broke that rule and he did it first in this book.PORTRAIT is a book which builds the world of its narrator in the telling, without really following any kind of plot or storyline or giving us a beginning, middle and end. From the opening lines of ludicrous baby talk, where we see the world through the young hero's infantile eyes, to the end where the young lad, after much intellectual wrestling in his school days, steps off into the wider world, this is a book which paints a young man's coming of age, through his very subjective experience of life, with words. Indeed, all good writing &quot;paints&quot; its world to some extent. But Joyce, and several of his contemporaries, set out to re-write the rules of writing by only painting the picture, as though the story (an artificial element in most cases) did not count at all. And they did what they set out to do. Joyce did it most dramatically of all with this book. Like Hemingway, Joyce was a literary impressionist, building the world through bits of language instead of merely describing it or telling us about it.I think we need to get back to basic story in our day, as theirs was, to some extent, a false trail. But it was a trail worth following and of great value to all readers and writers alike. Aspiring writers, and anyone with a real craving to explore the literary world, ought to have a go at this one. It's an original.SWM"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors. I love Joyce's pure stream-of-consciousness writing and the exhilaration and lyricism inherent in his gorgeous prose.In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, we meet Stephen Dedalus, later to become a central figure in the monumental Ulysses, for the first time and we follow him through his boarding school days, to the university, to his decision to leave Ireland for Paris. Although it is an excellent idea to read this book before embarking on the much more involved and symbolic Ulysses, those who consider A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man only a prelude to Ulysses are definitely cheating themselves. This book is a masterpiece of its own accord: vibrant, exhilarating, luminous, joyous.Even if Joyce had never written Ulysses, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man would be enough to assure his place in history as one of the world's greatest authors.

Containing some of the most empyrean prose ever engrossed (particularly the famous &quot;bird girl&quot; scene at the end of the fourth of the book's five parts), it is however perhaps a bit too divergent to be approbated by the scores of high school and college students assigned to read it. An exemplary example of a book that can really only be appreciated by literary buffs, this novel planted the seed for the century's greatest work of literature."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"So concludes James Joyce, with the subject quote, in this Irish coming-of-age novel. I first read this novel a few decades ago, and felt it deserved a re-read, in particular, to contrast it with other novels in this genre. Most recently, I've read the Norwegian novelist, Per Petterson'sIt's Fine By Me. There is also the classic French workLe grand Meaulnes., and, for better or worse, the AmericanThe Catcher in the Rye. In terms of Joyce, I'd also read his stream-of-consciousness masterpieceUlysses. A re-read of that should await at least a first reading ofThe Dubliners, if notFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin).In approaching this novel, the \\"reference frame\\" of the reader will be a dominant consideration: practicing Catholic, or, ex-Catholic, or, never-once-was a Catholic. Because, unlike the other three coming-of-age novels mentioned above, religious dogma, in the form of Catholic beliefs, permeates this work. Naturally, the anticipation, and reality of sex makes more than a cameo appearance. There are the shifting relationships with parents and adults as one moves toward become their coeval (Stephan visits his father' childhood home of Cork, with him, and his father treats him more as a brother). And there are the forms, and reality of obtaining an education, dominated by the schools and professional educators.Stephan Dedalus is the character that largely serves as James Joyce's alter-ego. The novel commences in his infancy, with a nursery rhyme meant to instill fear, and therefore obedience: \\"Or, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.\\" A fitting prelude to the religious dogma that promotes so much of the same. The next section depicts boarding school scenes, the austerity and coldness of life, the spectrum of teachers who seek to guide, influence, or impose their will on the children. I thought the Christmas holiday scene, when Stephan is first at home, especially apt, since it illustrated the sharp gender division related to the Catholic Church, unsurprising, perhaps, to anyone who has attended one of their services, particularly in Europe. In a later scene, Dedalus is wrongly punished by a rector. The young lad, despite possible dire consequences, reports the rector to his superior, and enjoys a modest triumph of righteousness.For me, the climactic scene occurred half-way through the novel. At the age of 16, Stephan succumbs to the temptations of the flesh, on a commercial basis, and then is immediately tormented with his \\"mortal sin,\\" and the ever-so-graphic depictions of eternal torment that are promoted by Church officials. The only \\"salvation\\" is confession, and he must muster the courage to tell a complete stranger what an abysmal sinner he is. As an ex-Catholic, this sequence of events resonated, as did terms I had not thought about in a long time, like the difference between \\"actual\\" and \\"sanctifying\\" grace. Stephan's burden of eternal damnation is, at least temporarily, removed, and he does so well in his true contrition, (contrition that transcends mere fear of eternal damnation) that he is approached by one of the priests in order to discuss the possibility that he has a priestly vocation (yes, the \\"join the brotherhood\\" pitch).But a scene of a young woman, gazing out to sea, with comely legs, deters Dedalus from thoughts of permanent abstention. In a passage that anticipates another famous one fromUlysses, Joyce writes: \\"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on and on and on!\\"I'll give Joyce a hearty amen, from the amen corner. 5-stars."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"One of the best books ever written, and certainly one of the top five examples of what has been called the \\"perfect\\" novel. More important for literature fans in general, Portrait is a more enjoyable experience than Ulysses; and anyone who denies this is, I think, simply being untruthful. Or snobbish. Sad, beautiful, brilliant, this book has it all. And unlike Ulysses, it has a specific point of view, a rapidly changing main character, and a wholly engaging plot -- one human being's struggle to become himself. Is Ulysses in fact \\"better\\"? Maybe, but Portrait is a much, much better read. Drama involves evolution of ideas and characters, which Portait has, but Ulysses, however finely constructed, does not. In Portrait, we go from Stephen as a child fascinated by the thick substance of things to Stephen as the emerging adult rejecting his family, his faith, and ultimately even his pride -- however incredible passages in Ulysses read, in the final analysis, they cannot compare with this transformation that takes places in less than two hundred and fifty pages. Here the reader is often presented with a clear subtext that Ulysses lacks -- that of the proud author simultaneously pounding his chest to the skies while clearly illustrating the pitfalls of an arrogant, self-absorbed human personage. Stephen is undeniably intelligent, but Joyce takes pains to illustrate both his errors as well as his brilliance. To say, in other words, here was a brain floating along on the river of potential, but billions of other brains were there along with it. And who is ever to say what course is ever the more estimable? Let us admit, then, that Ulysses attempts to transcend literature. Fine. But before it can be transcended, it must first be defined, and I think that is what Portrait does. Joyce wrote the best book that could be written, considering the constraints of the form -- and then he embarked on re-envisioning the form."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I was forced to read this for AP English, along with Dubliners. Joyce wrote this book with himself in mind - the main character's life is almost autobiographical. Therefore I don't want to insult Joyce himself, but the main character's attitudes were absolutely repulsive to me. Cynicism and outright pretentiousness can only take a man so far.That being said, the writing is incredible, as can be expected. My issue with the book is the simply bitter aftertaste this person's attitude left in my mouth. Read it if you don't mind a main character who would refuse to take communion for his own dying mother just because he hates religion. This is not heroic indifference to the society of the time. This is being a jerk."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man\\" is a rare kind of book. The author, James Joyce, lays his soul bare to the world with this thinly-disguised autobiography of growing up in and around Dublin, and in the process leaves generations of the world's smartest people confused about who he really was. Somewhere, hopefully, the man is smiling.The book begins and ends with a journey. In the beginning, it's the storybook tale of a \\"moocow\\" going down a road to meet a boy, one Stephen Dedalus. At the end, it's Stephen himself, now a young man, who is readying himself to depart the cradle of Ireland for parts unknown. In between, there's not that much of a plot, just snapshots of Dedalus at various key points of his emotional, spiritual, and mental development. Characters slip in and out of the narrative without the author making much of their fate, much as it is in life. \\"Portrait\\" feels like life in that and other ways, Dedalus and Joyce processing the world around them in bits and pieces.That's the boldness of \\"Portrait\\" for me, not its stray bits of stream-of-consciousness but the way it retains a wholly subjective and impressionistic view from beginning to end. You feel always like you are inside Joyce's head. Dedalus loses his innocence but never his vulnerability, and for that he retains our interest. Joyce's vivid descriptions and careful character development makes \\"Portrait\\" a book that seems to actually hold the soul of a man within its pages.\\"He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld,\\" Joyce writes at one early point, while Stephen is fantasizing about women but actually undertaking the wider challenge of adulthood. \\"He did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him.\\"What you get reading this book is a rare bird indeed, a celebration of the imagination both in its form and in content. Stephen goes from dutiful child to pubescent sex fiend to pious schoolboy, each time feeling the need for something more. His climactic refusal to serve his Easter duty (ironically the book was published in 1916, the year of Ireland's Easter Rebellion) makes for a kind of statement of principle that gives the book a sense of purpose and uplift, even if you, like Joyce perhaps, aren't clear as to what it all means.Joyce's books after this got terribly cute and recondite. But here you get something very powerful and immersive. Even chapter five, where Dedalus spends a lot of time lecturing his college mates about his theories on beauty, Joyce keeps things grounded with impressionistic details and narrative handholds like his friend Cranly's chewing remorselessly on a fig. It's a challenging book, but a fair challenge that rewards you multifold for your effort.My old 1968 Viking paperback edited by Chester Anderson includes copious annotations (best left aside for a second reading, they spoil Joyce's careful rhythm and flow) and several essays. One, by Wayne Booth, asks an interesting question about whether Joyce was seriously presenting Stephen as pure artist or was sending Stephen (and thus himself) up as a kind of poseur. I enjoyed this essay very much for the way it has at \\"Portrait,\\" but I enjoyed \\"Portrait\\" itself much more. So will you."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"In PAAYM we have the artist-hero,given a mythical name,Dedalus.There is really only one character,Stephen himself, and we see the world through his consciousness, other characters only impinge upon his mind. The girl,E.C., whom Stephen watches on the beach provides him with the epiphany that determines him to be an artist..There is an arrogance to the title,the mythicisation,the ambition:\\"to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race\\".But this is accepted by the reader who has been taken through the developing stages of his consciousness.Stephen becomes Daedalus,the master-craftsman who in his daring and ambition partook of the Promethean.Joyce gives a precise portrait of the artist as a young man,with the tension between his ambition and what,in the novel,he has actually achieved:the novel as dramatic poem.Like the \`God of creation',Joyce is quite outside this and\`remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible,refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his finger-nails.'There is a struggle against forces-family,Church and state-that threaten to stifle his development.Concomitant with the movement outward from Ireland,is the movement downward into myth.On a superficial level Stephen is dissociating himself;on a deeper level he is becoming a creature of myth.This decision-systemization-led onto Ulysses.Stephen Daly became Stephen Dedalus.Joyce was determined to emerge from the groove of previous literature.He gives the picture of infant consciousness,with tastes,touches and smells all distinct if not yet understood.The narrative is not sequential but a hodgepodge of memories due to Stephen's fever,early schooldays,holidays at home, rendered discontinuously and with intensity.The great injustice inflicted by Father Dolan makes Stephen a victim, who becomes heroic,whose protest against unjust pandying at a Jesuit school is a prelude to larger protests against Church and State.Joyce makes his (and modernism's) 1st employment of interior monologue,the stream-of-consciousness technique,moving through a range of more complex styles,which chronicle the development of his consciousness and culminates in meditations on the aesthetics of Aristotle and Aquinas and a commitment to an art based on\`silence,exile and cunning'.The novel becomes a manifesto for the task of Ulysses.The novel brings out well that his rebellion against Irish life and R/C religion did not stop their deep influence,substituting art for religion;and turning ideas of mass and substantiation into the \`epiphany' of literature,everyday life into art:'the spiritual eye seeks to adjust its vision to an exact focus'.Passionate intellectual argumentation has remarkable emotional force.He renders the'luminous silent stasis of aesthetic pleasure..the supreme quality of beauty,the clear radiance of the aesthetic image..arrested by its wholeness..fascinated by its harmony..the enchantment of the heart'.That Joyce lived out the conclusion of the novel's \`non serviam' vow increases his achievement of the non-juring exile of extreme self sufficiency in his encounter with \`the reality of experience'.Because he is dealing with the prurient Victorian world of his adolescence the preoccupation with guilt and fear and growing sexuality play a major part:a sermon on hell,a visit to a prostitute,masturbation.Joyce's poems are like songs,he had an auditory imagination,he was a singer:Joyce lived in a world of words,words as sounds,divorced that is from meaning,using verbal association.There is the hypnotic use of repetition,chains of association are built up,words of sensory significance deliberately used to work on our subconscious minds.The relationship develops between author and object rather than author and reader.This equates the prose with the experience or replaces the experience with the prose.This makes the work self-conscious,deliberate,stylistically akin to Flaubert.He captures subjective experience through language rather than the actual experience through prose narrative(Cf.Stephen Hero).I prefer this and Dubliners to Ulysses."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book offers a unique perspective on the Catholic faith and its tradition. An Irish boy, Stephen Dedalus, who is brought up expected to believe whatever is presented to him is confronted with a very big problem: accept his faith without question and follow the conventions of his upbringing or pursue his dream to be an artist. Pursuing the path of an artist would make Stephen happy but should he risk alienating his family and fellow Catholics in favor of a dream?While most of us are not presented with that specific dilemma, we have all experienced a similar situation. Do we dare to be different or just go with the flow? James Joyce has created a very real character in Stephen Dedalus with which all of us can relate to on some level.A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a perfectly designed coming of age novel. It follows Stephen Dedalus from his young and impressionable years, incapable of thinking for himself, to his isolation from his peers in family while realizing that his Catholic faith is not all that he thought it was. We see him finally begin to explore his own way of thinking and stop following outdated customs. The inner conflict he faces and his confusion of right is wrong is something that is familiar to all of us and further helps the reader relate to his situation and empathize with the tough choice he must ultimately face at the end of the novel."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's fascinating novel takes us into the mind of Stephen Dedalus, a young Irishman longing to understand and express himself despite his ennui and nagging dissatisfaction over nearly every facet of his life: his social class, his education, his religion, his sense of morals.Every now and then I take down one of those venerable volumes of the English lit canon written mostly by dead white European males and, more often than not, I find that there is a good reason that they have been enshrined by generations of English professors. The most extraordinary thing about this novel is the way Joyce evokes the sense of a soul struggling for freedom beneath layers of received cultural baggage, breaking the shackles one by one until the conclusion, when Stephen has found the courage to set off into the world to express himself as fully as he can. I think that some other reviewers on this page have overemphasized the importance of preparation and study for appreciating this work. I read a bare bones edition and, while I don't deny that the experience would probably have been enhanced by more information, I did not find it to be essential. I found some sections toward the end of the book, when Joyce describes a more self-aware Stephen's developing theories of literature and aesthetics, to be somewhat boring, but I've always been impatient with literary theory. On the other hand, Stephen's internal struggles with religious convention are riveting. All in all, this novel will reward you for the effort you put into reading it."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"There are many editions of James Joyce's &#34;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&#34; available, but this is easily the best Kindle edition. The text is based on Chester Anderson's 1964 text. There are also a good number of annotations by Seamus Deane--fewer than in Anderson's Viking Critical edition but sometimes more detailed and aimed at a less scholarly audience. best of all, this edition is a very well constructed ebook, with a good table of contents to facilitate navigation to the beginning of chapters and with an excellent implementation of endnotes. Annotated items are marked witha superscripted number that links to the endnotes. The notes are all placed together, so you can read other notes rather than having to go back to the main text to go to other notes.All in all, this is the best Kindle edition of Joyce's classic. The text is based on a standard version, the notes are helpful, and the implementation highlight the advantages of the Kindle format."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This wonderful work of Joyce really comes alive with the performance which includes singing and piano."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The perennial work of the great master of the 20th century, James Joyce, beginning his revolution in the form of how a story is told. The book shows us the adventure in growing to think for oneself, avoiding the snares of the culture one is raised in, discovering the very nature of beauty and it's relationship to the meaning of life. It gives a rememberance of sin and experience as well as the purpose of art not to provide an escape from life, but as a means for the honest expression of it.Some people will never like this book and think it too ponderous, but for those of us who love this book, we hold it all the more dearly in our hearts."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"There are writers and there are artists, and what Joyce could do with words was, unequivocally, art. This book is luminous. Awe-inspiring. Stendhalian. Five stars shortchanges it. Saul Bellow, Ernest Hemingway, and Wallace Stegner would cut off their DICKS in exchange for the talent Joyce had. This book transcends \\"subjectivity\\"...I didn't even LIKE it, being a philistine who prefers meaning over aesthetics, but I will be the nth bibliophile to say that this is a masterpiece, and that Joyce was a...genius. (I can off-hand think of only two peers for Joyce: Nabokov and Lowry.)Portrait is a bildungsroman that follows the life of Stephen Dedalus (Joyce) from childhood to young adulthood. We inhabit his mind as he confronts his milieu, his education, and his faith. We witness him sin and repent. We witness his intellectual evolution. We witness his increasing spiritual malaise. We witness his thoughts, his perceptions, and how he translates those perceptions INTO thoughts. The results are extraordinary. Some passages escape the confines of mere talent and nudge the ceiling of sublimity. Great stuff.Now, this book won't be easy to digest. Know that going in. You're gonna need to be PREPARED. This isn't something you absent-mindedly take to the can with you. This book demands effort, attention, concentration, and latitude. You'll need to roll with some punches. You'll need to hike up a few steep hills. You'll need to strap yourself in. You'll need to be able to keep up with the cognitive pace demanded...but take your time, and all will be fine. Joyce vacillates between prose and verse at times, and the deft treatment of language--of words qua words--will cause some stress and confusion. You have to push on through.The MLA got one right (mirabile dictu!) by anointing Portrait as the third best novel written in the 20th century. (NB: \\"Best\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"fun to read.\\") This book is truly on another level. Give it a go--skip the worthless, pedantic Introduction by a nondescript egghead--and enjoy the ample rewards, richly deserved..."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"any reader who intends to be well equipped to approach the most challenging literature (i.e. Ulysses, Faulkner) must read Portrait. Its value as an engaging narrative won't be fully appreciated upon an initial reading, but it is a book worth several readings, and it will yield a reward equally rich in its depth as it is enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is one of those great pieces that really divides the audience. If you read fellow reviewers' comments, one says that no-one should rate this below 4 stars while another says no-one should rate it above 1 star. Some people admit they don't get it, some people say there is nothing to get, and some dive deep into Joyce's world. What a gift!For my own thoughts...as I rate it, I think I need to rate it more as a piece of art rather than a typical piece of literature. When I review literature, I consider character development, plot development, narrator's voice, story-telling ability, etc. With Joyce, he shows you so much and tells you so little, that it's really hard to nail alot of facts down. How old is he in the beginning? How many siblings did he have? Did he have a crush on the same girl throughout the book? Why did Dante have 2 brushes? What exactly caused his father's fall? There is just so much information that Joyce doesn't bother telling you. It's like the opposite of watching &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; or &quot;Scrubs&quot; where you get a play-by-play account of the action and a foreshadowing of what was to come.At first I was very unnerved by his approach. I like to have a groundwork laid, and I didn't even know how old Dedalus was when the book started (I had trouble translating the Irish school system to an equivalent year here). However, the world as seen through an intelligent but vulnerable and geeky boy was fascinating. I loved the vivid accounts as seen by a child with no attempt to correct or add to this perspective by some adult voice.As the story progresses, Joyce skips through time, apparently selecting important scenes in his young life. But he doesn't tell you they are important. He just shows them to you, like flipping through a picture book. He leaves you to draw up your own conclusions. If nothing else, it was clear that Dedalus (representing Joyce) was on a tough track. He had an artist's temperament even early on (emotionaly, extreme, caught within himself), but as his family slipped into poverty such a nature would be harder and harder to accept.By about the middle of the book, I became completely enraptured with his use of metaphors...the images are so lovely, so perfect, so unforced that it hardly seems right to compare them with the crude, simple, ignoble ones I run into so often in literature. This mastery of words thrilled my soul, regardless of the plotline and character development; in this way, it was more like music than literature.By the end I saw a clear progression of Dedalus' character, as is well described in the 2nd spotlight review. Not only does the complexity of the writing increase as Dedalus grows older, but his characater evolves as he tests the water in many arenas. He has gone from a pretentious child who is so vulnerable because he has no outlet and no understanding of how he is different to one who can dialog with the masters (Aristotle, Aquinas, Augustine, etc). He has found a home in academia and a vocabularly to express his inner worlds. He made not have found peace yet, but he has found that he has a place in this world.However, again, I would say that the understanding you gain is more like that of glimpses gained through art than through literature. I don't know that I could ever fully understand everything he was talking about, why he was talking about, who he was referring to, etc. Therefore, I rate this highly as a masterful artistic rendering of a coming-of-age story. If you are looking for a clear fiction or biography, however, this might not be for you."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Considered perhaps the finest example of 20th century literature, this is the enormously frustrating, mind-numbingly convoluted, semi-autobiographical expression of one man's spiritual and intellectual awakening. I feared this book for years, and rightfully so. While the prose is immensely fluid - so much so that you barely notice the fact that you've easily read several paragraphs without understanding a word of it - the substance will prove more of a challenge than most intelligent readers are looking for. Unless one devotes an enormous amount of mental energy to close examination of this text, a basic understanding of the plot and message is the most the average reader will come away with. Alas, I opted for the easy way out, and as such, I'm sure there is plenty in this novel that eludes me.Joyce creates the character of Stephen Dedalus to describe his own experience as a boy growing into manhood. Joyce first examines Stephen's youth, giving careful attention to his family life and upbringing as powerful defining forces in his life. He then focuses on Stephen's spiritual development during his years at a strict religious boys' school. The latter part of the book explores Stephen's embarking on adulthood, as he presides over a battle inside himself between religious faith and intellectual pursuit. It is in this phase of his life that the artist, the writer, emerges victorious.How this all happens, however, is a cloudy, murky mess, unless you bothered to re-read passages several times and consult secondary sources that might offer insights into the book. While the writing is beautiful, it is also choppy. And while the substance may very well be brilliant, it is often too obscure to be appreciated. Surely that was Joyce's intention. This novel was meant to explore uncharted territory in form and structure, and Joyce has certainly done that.I will say this much - it wasn't as difficult as I had feared. Despite its inherent challenges, this book is a quick read and is by no means unpleasant. It's simply unsatisfying to invest time and energy in a book, and then come away with only a partial understanding of it."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; is James Joyce's autobiographical novel, first appeared in book form in 1916. After over 80 years it is still read and studied all over the world highlighting the place it has received in literature. It portrays the early and teenage life of Stephen Dedalus. This is the same character who later appears in \`Ulysses' (1922) as a matured adult.Joyce walks us through the life of Stephen Dedalus in five stages written in a third-person narrative. Anyone interested in Joyce's intellectual, spiritual and physical journey of life should read this great classic which is the prelude to \`Ulysses', one of the best novels ever written in the 20th centaury.As Ezra Pound correctly predicted \`A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' would &quot;remain a permanent part of English literature\\" for centuries similar to the place \`Ulysses' has reached in literature."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I bought this book but it took me a long time to get into it. The \\"Moo-cow\\" business I didn't get. It seemed so silly and trivial and I, of course, was very, very serious. But one day I don't know why I just sat down and started reading it. Being Irish and Catholic the book became very pertinent in a short number of pages. At the time I read this book I was shocked that somebody should know my personal story and personal thoughts so vividly. I realize now that this is the personal story of a myriad of young Irish Catholic boys. This was a very good book and it tackled some very serious issues regarding faith, religion, and the Catholic Church.This book was partially responsible for my life long interest in reading. Once I understood that the people who wrote books were the people who were speaking my language and translating my thoughts, I was hooked. Books were not all Mary Poppins and Alice in Wonderland.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\""},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Beginning biographically, the novel orbits a young Stephen Daedalus, born to one Simon Daedalus, baptized in Christ, and a son of Ireland no less. Stephen is not only a one-time product of these institutions, but finds himself constantly immersed in the imperialist miasma of their expectations and responsibilities. As he comes of age and begins to ponder his identity, he precociously questions the dramatic effects that these parental, political, religious, sexual, and literary internalizations have had on its (his) construction. As he finds his own voice (non serviam), the form of the book changes with it and the once narrated Stephen becomes the narrator Stephen.\\"The soul has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.\\"Stephen's transcendence comes in the form of a psychological revolution, a mutilation of the old self and a willful, deliberate creation of the new. Asserting that man is (or at least can be) his own creation, he struggles to create his own father, supplanting his biological father (and other fathers) for a spiritual father of his own formation - what can be read as a miraculous self-begetting.For Ireland, Stephen's story holds the key to spiritual freedom. With their victimization and oppression a national legacy, the Irish identity became strongly conflated with their role as victims. It became their destiny to be slaves, a people grown to love their enslavement and to fear freedom and its responsibilities, a people whose tradition had unconsciously become oppressing themselves.In Ulysses, Joyce later wrote, \\"History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\\" In contrast to most schools of thought which presume that the wisdom needed today can be found in the past, Joyce confronts the dangers that come with its blind inheritance and concession to the conventional life that it creates and encourages."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I have come back to this book every few years since my first encounter with it as a wild, aesthetic English Lit. undergraduate student, and I've never ceased to marvel at the absolute mastery Joyce holds over the written word. Grace Paley, a mid-20th century author once said that fiction writing was difficult for her generation because \\"Joyce had already used up all the words,\\" and this was his first work where Joyce took literary impressionism to new heights. I gave up on Ulysses by the (in)famous \\"Circe\\" chapter, and I just don't have the chops to even bother with Finnegan's Wake, but this novel actually became more readable for me by the final chapter. Perhaps being a male Irish Catholic who first read this as an impressionable fledgling aesthetic makes this novel my favorite, but Joyce's ability to make a mundane event crackle with the metaphysical weight of a Kantian treatise is unparalleled. Many one-star reviewers here lament the lack of a \\"story\\" in this book, but the magic of Joyce is his ability to elevate everydayness to such heights, armed with such a command of language that he must invent new words increasingly as his literary career moves onward. You don't read Joyce expecting a rollicking Tom Wolfe yarn; Joyce is more like the experience of watching dew drip from a flower in utter silence become more mellifluous than the NY Philharmonic, more eventful than 9 AM on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The dinner fight between Stephen's father and Dante, the hell-fire sermon of Chapter 3, his concluding conversation with Cranly about his choice to choose an aesthetic life over the ascetic, monastic life; all of these very simple events are charged with life, and purpose. The effect of Joyce reminds me most of Faulkner, who could turn a rural Southern county where the most monumental real event was the sun rising every day into a complex commentary on the most sophisticated mysteries of the human condition. Never has literary realism been done better than in this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Joyce's \\"Portrait\\" is a fantastic book, and many people below have reviewed it more thoroughly than I could. However, there are many editions out there, and I wanted to write a bit about the Penguin one, in particular the footnotes.I found the footnotes seemed to fall into three categories:1. The least useful ones tell you factoids about Dublin geography with no context whatsoever. For example, there's one on \\"From the door of Byron's publichouse to the gate of Clontarf Chapel... he had paced,\\" that tells us that Clontarf Chapel is on Clontarf Road. That's great, but where is Clontarf Rd? Does it mean anything? (For instance, is Clontarf in a slum area, a nice area, or what? Does the Chapel have some historical significance. If there's nothing to say about it, leave out the footnote). Unfortunately, these are by far the majority of the notes.2. Citations for quotations. These are varyingly useful. When Joyce refers to Adam and Eve's ejection from Eden, it doesn't need a footnote to tell us that it came from Genesis -- if you don't know that level of detail about the Bible, then you need more help than the footnotes will provide. There are a lot of these notes, and I wish most of them had been left out, but some of them are decent.3. Cultural notes. These are the most useful ones. There's a note, for example, noting that the Dedalus's second lodging is in a down-class area. Even here, though, some of them have no reason to exist. There's one giving an etymology of \\"The dear knows,\\" which I'd bet none of the characters is supposed to know, even as they use the phrase.What's totally missing are any notes on a more macro level, talking about, for example, Joyce's goal in each part, or the way Joyce's language changes over the course of the novel. I personally don't need those kind of notes, since this was my third time through the novel, but I'd love an edition to give to friends that they could catch some of those subtleties the first time through."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I'm not quite sure what to say. Every time I wanted to pick up this book I had to force myself. However, as soon as I started reading it was not a chore. This book contains some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. I think Joyce captured a young man's journey from childhood into adulthood with more truth than most writers. His seamless transitions from action to thought and back make you feel like you are Stephen, living and thinking those things. I don't feel like I took in even half of the content of this book. I'll definitely read it again after I've had a while (a couple of years, maybe) to process it."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"My second Joyce, after Ulyssess some six months prior. This novel is a vastly more direct and comprehensible text, benefiting from a clarity of presentation that allows intense absorption in psychology. It's a highly effective novel on multiple levels, excelling at showing an unconventional proccess of transition into adulthood and through it a biting analysis of society, modernity, religion and art. It works to the way it shows the protagonist with deep intimacy and emotional acuteness, but yet refuses to grant him any easy outs or transcendence. His status as a future artist doesn't bring him enlightenment or greater intrinsic natural worth, and it doesn't free him from the nusances and challenges of the society he inhabits. It's a very intense account, never more so than when it engages with the protagonist's struggle with his religion, his sexuality and their intersection. There's an intricate and gorgeously vivid presentation of what the tenets of traditional Catholicism feel like to someone who believes in them yet doesn't live up to their moral code. His absorption with intellect as well as sex, and the tortured guilt he derives from the later, make for a perspective that is so convincing it's hard not to assume strong autobiographical motifs. It's a level of intimacy combined with quality of writing that often feel more real than reality, and that turn a very sophisticated eye on questions of faith, politics and the modern world. The debates on Irish nationalism are particularly intense, and are of a specific content that I feel the need for more historical conext before I can really situate the literary incorporation here. The novel gives a strong sense of the basic appeal and tensions inherent in the desire for an autonomous society, in that respect functioning very similarly to the whole spirituality/sensuality axis, generalized to a more collective level. It's indisputably potent stuff.And yet the book in the end suffers by comparison with Ulysses, not having anywhere near that volume's power or raw, disorienting literary expertise. It's still a wonderful novel however, and points up the great things that can be done with well crafted writing.Worse than: Notes from Underground by Fyodor DostoevskyBetter than: The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is a paperback labeled \\"SoHo books\\" and says it was printed in the United States of America.

Ulysses turns ordinary people in an ordinary day into an experimental novel. Portrait, much the same, uses the very ordinary life of its author as a model for the main character. Unlike Ulysses, Portrait simply fails to generate a whole lot of interest, unless one is specifically enthralled with the relation of young men to their priests, or interested in the mundane conversations of university students. The book begins strongly enough with a clever rendition of the earliest years of Stephen Daedelus. But, as the book curves more to Joyce's struggles with his Catholic upbringing, my interest begain to wain, and by the end, suspecting Joyce had lost interest in his own book, I was quite happy to have only a few more pargraphs before me. Now, I have an equal disinterest in sailing, but have read books on sailing which captured my interest against my will. Portrait never reaches this point, and while understanding it on an intellectual level, for me there is a distinct lack of pashion, drama, story line, or the basic subtle artistry that makes for a good book. There were some high points highlighted by a sermon so explicit an exposition of the Christian Religion as to expose that religion. Certainly Joyce with this rendition of the sermon proves his ability to outwrite and outpersuade anybody who had written of Christiantity to date, and so flashes a bit of his great talent. In the end, I felt that Portrait contained a few very well written parts, and while the writing certainly is on a high plain, in the panopy of literature this was barely average."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"There is nothing special about this book. The language might be beautiful but it is not extraordinary. The plot is linear and lacks complexity. While I was reading the book it seemed like the writer was writting for himself and not for the readers. If a reader likes to feel as if he is ignored and disrepected, then maybe he would appreciate the book. As for everyone else, I would recommend &quot;Black Boy&quot; from Richard Wright, which is a book far better than &quot;A portrait ...&quot;, for its rich and intriguing plot and ideas portraited with a sense of care for the reader. James Joyce fails to convey his ideas with &quot;tenderness&quot;, his artistic sense builds arrogance, rather than &quot;a portrait&quot;. &quot; Most defintely, this book is not one of the best 20th century's books.

Such a crushingly dull book!James Joyce was something of a philosopher who chose to crouch his thoughts in novel form. As such, this book is more or less a long series of ongoing inner monologues (and occasionally dialogues) on life, the Church, family, and a few other topics. Plot is nonexistant, or in those rare cases where it peeks through it's brushed aside and covered by long discussions on religion, or dad, or (yawn). I could find no incentive to keep reading, except to claim that I'd finished it so I could truly lambast it with authority.From time to time you'll meet madmen who claim to really like Joyce and his prose style. They're either lying or insane.By the end of the novel I was gasping for breath and praying for it to end. I don't know how I dragged myself through it.

Because James Joyce's style is different, which makes his work a masterpiece based upon the structure. He uses the \\"stream of conciousness\\" technique very well. Despite the fact that it makes the story kind of hard to follow, and a bit tedious, you somehow get sucked into the character's mind. However, I felt that the overall story was kind of boring, and nothing that I haven't read before from other exemplary authors (such as W. Somerset Maugham, author of Of Human Bondage and The Moon and Sixpence). The story about a young man who's slowly engulfed into nihilism, beauty, and sexuality, wanting to pursue a life as an artist, is mundane to me. So many authors have written a story like this before, but much more affectively. There's nothing that I got out of this book personally. Coming from an author who has so much praise and prestige to his name, I was hoping that I'd get something out of this novel. As I said, this book is a masterpiece, but only for its style, not necessarily for the story."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I thought that A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was a very interesting book. James Joyce was not only able to capture the political turmoil in Ireland at the time of his youth, but also the the alienation that every man with radical ideas went through.The people living in his time were only open to widely acceped ideas, whether they be political or religious.Joyce should also be commended of his amazing writing style. None have yet surpassed him."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Now, usually I'm one of those &quot;everyone's entitled to their own opinion&quot; people, but everyone who read this book and just wrote it off as boring or stupid or hard to understand or whatever other comments that often get tacked on to this beautiful book may just have been (a) Not intelligent enough to understand it (b) Not mature enough for it. (c) A sad combination of both. The reason I say that is this: I first attempted to read this book when, in retrospect, I hadn't achieved an appropriate level of intellectual maturity: in my misguided youth I set it aside as impenetrable, overly convoluted, and (yes, I know) boring. Happily, I picked it up again, mostly because of all the literary hype surrounding it, touting it as a Great Book. This same hype made me a little apprehensive about it, since it would be hard for it to live up to all of that. However, I shouldn't have worried: Portrait is a wonderful book not to be missed by anyone with any intelligence. I'm the first to admit all that stream of consciousness business can be irritating and intimidating, but to me it hardly registered in the book. Portrait completely transcends that. Yes, it's pretty fascinating to analyze, but its a work that can stand on its own. Beautifully written, deeply meaningful, its an enrapturing read. Don't pass this up because it was written by James Joyce...It's not even that long, and it bears little resemblance to his other works (ahem, the TRULY imprenetrable Ulysses, the dead bore The Dubliners) in my mind. To me, this is the book he wrote which actually lives up to the reputation of the great writer James Joyce.

With prose that flows off the pages like a stream, only to be plunged down a waterfall, PORTRAIT captures the true essence of human nature that can apply to all people of all civilizations that simply want to stray from the norm without being persecuted too harshly.It is not sin or evil that attempts to destroy the complicated life of Stephen, but the intensity of the Irish hierarchy that eventually destroys his soul.Though sometimes preachy, PORTRAIT contains enough raw material that will make you cry, laugh, and simply put, enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce does something that I cannot ever forgive him for---he makes me dislike reading. It's not that I am scared or overwhelmed by difficult fiction. I love William Faulkner, and puzzling through his books is usually part of the fun in reading him. However, the difference between Joyce and Faulkner is that Faulkner always seems to have a burning desire to impart some meaning to his reader, whereas Joyce doesn't seem to care one way or another whether his nonsense writing ever makes sense to anyone. As far as his novels go, \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" is the most accessible, but that's not saying much seeing as its competition is the idiotic \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" and the Great Book of the 20th Century, \\"Ulysses.\\" This is one case where I really do feel scholars have equated incomprehensible writing with great literature.

I can't help it, the man was an amateur for all his life, a typical tinkerer and home improvement guy who probably never really found the kind of subject matter that could have distracted him from his self-consciousness. His short stories would barely be remembered these days if there wasnt his name under the title. They are imitation pieces, ventriloquistic exercises, and pretty flat and lifeless if held against Chekhov and Kipling, or Flaubert and Kathleen Mansfield.Joyce had his fair share of difficulties like everyone of us and at some point threw a Manuscript of 2,000 pages into the fireside. The legend goes that his sister Eileen rescued parts of it from the fire. (A similar legend surrounds the first draft of Nabokovs &Ograve;Lolita.&Oacute;) Joyce re-edited the remainders and with the help of Ezra Pound it was published under the title of &Ograve;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&Oacute; Much later the remainders of the original draft appeared as &Ograve;Stephen Hero.&Oacute; If it had survived in full it would probably have been a very long and rather insufferable autobiographical novel about a clever young man realizing that he's too good for the society into which he's been born.An attitude the author never really changed: take for instance &Ograve;Nausicaa,&Oacute; the notorious masturbation scene in &Ograve;Ulysses.&Oacute; Superbly written as it is, it gives us the whole deficiency of Joyce in a nutshell. He imitates the presumptuous and pompous phrasing in certain fashion magazines of the period, but just tell me to what end? Is it to poke fun on the cliche beset thoughts of the crippled girl? Well I fail to see the joke, this is just cruel. Satire either attacks a subject that has the capacity to bite back, or it is merely an act of snobbery. Joyce, the writer, was a rather small character and in the sentiment of his period thought it to be cool to be &quot;anti-philistine.&quot;Apparently &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot; and especially &Ograve;Ulysses&Oacute; were written by an author who went on a quest for his own style. Finnegan's Wake eventually was the place where the eagle landed. I dont think I am alone in my opinion that Joyce had landed on the most barren rock in the entire Universe. Joyce had tons of talent to burn, but something went seriously wrong here. I am all for modern art, and consider the term &quot;post modern&quot; a phony contradiction in terms. But lesser talents accomplished more - DosPassos, O'Neil, Kafka, Proust, Marianne Moore, Auden, Hemingway, Nabokov, they all have their moments, even clowns like Bukowski and Douglas Adams (who is a linguistic genius in his own right.) Borges could put in 3 lines what took a Joyce 30 strenuous pages without ever achieving a comparable impact. With one exception.If we compare the &Ograve;Portrait&Oacute; with the leftovers from &Ograve;Stephen Hero&Oacute; we can see what good editing can accomplish. Joyce was very fond of copiously scribbling in the margins of the galley proofs, so the improvements in style are probably entirely his. The overall structure though (like that of T.S. Eliots &Ograve;Wasteland&Oacute;) might be based on suggestions by Ezra Pound. Pound also helped Joyce to find a publisher for the &Ograve;Portrait.&Oacute; It was the time when Joyce had been in his Flaubertian phase and emulated the Frenchmans method to present events strictly from the protagonists perspective and in terms of the characters faculties of perception. And what an emulation it is.Style is the most direct access to an artists temperament. Narrative style is a conveyor - only in essays and poems style is allowed to be a player. Approaching Joyce is an experience not dissimilar to &Ograve;The Approach to Al-Mutasim.&Oacute; After crossing through all the veils we step into an entirely empty room, like the Holy of Holies in the Jewish temple. Beyond the private circle of his life, Joyce had nothing to say. Catholicism and Thomas Aquinas philosophy leave you badly prepared, not only for the second law of thermodynamics and Special Relativity, but for democracy, a truly free Ireland, or sex with your wife, and life in general.Only in the &Ograve;Portrait&Oacute; Joyce managed to bring all the pieces together, and though I must say, that the throes of adolescence in the clutches of Catholicisms screwed morality and hygiene make not exactly my favorite read, what counts is HOW Joyce brings across his story. And he does it brilliantly. The book is full of flavors and sensuality. We hear the dull thud of the wet leather ball on the rugby pitch, shiver in the clammy dormitory, feel the slight vertigo of Stephens trance in the rocking train compartment. All this is fine writing except for the first part, when Joyce attempted to reproduce the mind-set of a small boy.His choice of words comes a tat too cute and betrays the condescending adult. Joyce was certainly not a Tolstoy, even not a Kipling. Nabokovs &Ograve;Speak Memory&Oacute; is a fine description of early childhood that respects the child. Joyce of course had no intention to glorify this particular childhood, or to be objective. He wrote out of his bitterness of something to be left behind, and the sooner the better. So the ventriloquism sometimes comes on a false note. Still with all these minor flaws, this is a major novel in the language and must read for the aspiring author."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce is a story about a young boy named Stephen Dedalus, who wants, desperately, to fit in with his peers and to fulfill what he believes his destiny is. Stephen come from a very religious school and is emotionally young in the beginning of this story. However, as time goes by, Stephen struggles with many forms of sin as a way of coping with depressed feelings from being an outcast as well as from family troubles.This book is unique because the genre is similar to an autobiography. Everything the reader learns about Stephen is through his own thoughts. Fro example, \\"The ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his sought no outlet.\\" (Ch.1, p.74) In this quote, Stephen shares how he feels at that particular moment in time. Majority of this story is Stephens's critical thinking and decision-making.For that reason, this book was not often a page-turner for me. Nevertheless, when it was a page-turner, Joyce often foreshadows the events to come, such as, \\"For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and these changes in what he deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish perception of the world.\\" (Ch.1, p.74) In this quote, Joyce foreshadows changes in Stephen's life that will force him form his easy life of boyhood to the hardships of an adolescent who is soon to become an adult.Another prominent example of foreshadow is, \\"He had heard about him the constant voices of his father and masters, urging him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be hollow sounding in his ears.\\" (Ch.2, p. 92) This immediately made me wary because Stephen is basically saying that his conscience had begun losing its influence on him. It foreshadows his fall into sin.Overall, I would rate this novel a 3 out of 5 stars. For hardcore literary buffs, this book is perfect. It is full of symbols and character conflicts. If you are someone who loves to delve beneath the superficial plot line and into character or allusion analysis, then this is the book for you. But if you are looking for an easy read with exciting events and dialogue, as I prefer, than I would not recommend this book. For me the style of writing was difficult to follow because it is written in a stream-of-consciousness format, which sometimes jumps from topic to topic with very subtle segues. The conflicts of Stephen's life were also difficult for me to relate to because I have experience very little family dramas or great sins. But if that does not sound like you, go for it!! Hope this was helpful!!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this work. While it was impeccably written and deeply philosophical, the style chosen to write it in was distracting and caused far too many pauses in reading. It did give me some inspirational insights to methods in which I can add elements of philosophy to my own writing, but overall led me to understand methods of writing that serve to distract and confuse readers. His overall purpose (of showing the evils of Irish Catholicism, and the necessity of embracing a Nietzschian way of life) seem lost on the reader that doesn't care to struggle through the overemphasized rhetoric. I'm glad I read it, but wouldn't do so again."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Following the plot of &quot;A Portrait&quot; is like trying to chase a fish through a murky, moss-covered swamp pond. Understanding the meanings in the work is as simple as clearly seeing the bottom of this same pool. The reader can feel the great depth of this bayou-book by the height of the clammy, chilling water on his body. Even when he has finally climbed out of the pond, moss and other marks cling to him. The reader can feel too the power of the work by the invisible, unmistakable currents and swirls that unceasingly surround him through his chase.Why would someone read this book, a book with difficult plot and meaning, and unclear, intimidating depth and power? Obvious gold nuggets glint beneath the water, felt beneath the reader's feet, seen amidst sometimes muddy chapters: they are Joyce's masterful short phrases. They compel the reader forward, delighting him as he fumbles after the fish, chasing after this elusive, wriggling rainbow trout, a leprechaun leading to more gold. The imagery and alliteration of Joyce's short phrases force the reader on to each next page, and assure him that the tiring toil of draining this swamp is an effort well rewarded.The entire mural of &quot;A Portrait&quot; may seem abstract and unclear, but the delicate images, the stinging images, the firm and the flimsy images--each is an intimately executed brushstroke or a perfectly mixed color that enchants the reader. These are the glinting nuggets hiding in the pond, chunks of pure lyric beauty. The images stick in your mind and haunt you like some catchy tune; the make you want to stride on onto the beach and run \\"far out over the sands, singing wildly to the sea\\" (123). To find these nuggets a perceptive reader will soon be \\"scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb\\" (25), hunting with fervency. He will wander \\"the dark, slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and doorways\\" (70). Even taken completely out of context as above, these \\"eerily convincing portrayals,\\" as R.B. Kershner calls them, retain their majesty. And though an understanding of much of the novel may be as solid and stable as a dancing fire, \\"Above the flame the smoke of praise/ Goes up from ocean rim to rim\\" (159).Joyce pleases the mind's eye, yes; but the mind's ear is his true workshop. His symphonic work has an enormous scope, but each alliterative phrase rises up from the orchestral noise as a melody to be inhaled. \\"Little, fiery flakes fell\\" (101);\\"the warm, sunny city outside\\" (62); \\"the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow\\" (159). Here the gold nuggets come so thick that surely they comprise a vein that the reader must mine. They permeate &quot;A Portrait&quot;, filling it: \\"cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin\\" (54); \\"darker than the swoon of sin, softer than sound or odour\\" (71); \\"stirring his soul slowly from its listless despair\\" (79). I will let the examples speak for themselves as they speak to the listening reader.If the reader will feel each atom of gold, each artistic phrase, as he chases the elusive fish of plot, the swamp of confusion covering &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; will begin to drain, as Virginia Woolf's affirms in her commentary of the book. \\"Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incidence scores upon the consciousness.\\" And until those patterns become clear and the mossy water flows away, simply enjoy the gold glinting at us from below, radiant under Joyce's illuminating talent."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I found this novel interesting, and not as difficult to read as I anticipated, although it is certainly not an easy read. I enjoyed the stream of consciousness, and found the beginning of the novel when Steven is young particularly interesting. I enjoyed this novel very much, even though I dislike Faulkner, who supposedly writes in a similar style.
