I was afraid they would not be very durable, but they are very sturdy and the paper used for the pages is nice and thick. I wanted to find copies of my favorite classics that I can have for a long time and that would hold up to many re-reads and that is exactly what I have found in these. It doesn't hurt that they look great on the boofshelf either. I am also very glad that I ordered them from amazon and not from someone else (I did see them on a few other sites, for full price) because the price was amazing and they arrived properly packaged and in perfect condition with not a single flaw or bent corner, which happens easily to hard covers.

Personnally I think this is one of the best works Jane Austen came out with! It took a couple of pages for me to adjust to the antique english, but once I did, I loved immersing myself in a culture long gone. Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end. None of that here's-the-last-page-sorry-you-still-have-questions nonsense (fine for a series, but definately not a stand-alone)!If you too are looking for an extremely well-written, entertaining classic with a happy ending, don't let all the collegiate level stuff scare you!

I have to admit, as and avid Austen fan, I'm a bit obsessed with this one. One cannot come upon better characters than the beautiful and witty (way to be a smart girl!) Elizabeth Bennet, and the tall, brooding, but devilishly handsome (not to mention exceptionally rich) Mr. Darcy. And of course, what better way to start off a romance than with two characters who hate eachother? And Austen does it complete justice--for we all know that they can't stay disgusted for long! However, did we ever expect Lizzy to actually refuse a man who has ten thousand pounds a year? Heck yes! And that's why we love her. I've never come across an author better able to create stunning characters than Miss Jane Austen herself. She's timeless. I highly recommend this book to every person who comes across it. Pride and Prejudice merits the title of MY FAVORITE piece of literature ever written!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One reviewer (Jane Stewart) thanked me for my input on the \\"revised\\" setting of P&P. My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th. Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period. So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796. (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you're looking for the Regency as memorialized by Harry Flashman, the regency of his father, with country house parties enlivened with chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours (as Flashy says), you've come to the wrong shop (as Flashy says).If you're looking for Sharpe roaring about Spain doing his Peninsular duty while beautiful and passionate ladies shrug off those gauzy empire gowns to reveal naught, knickers not having come in fashion, Miss Austen will give you the right about, and, if that fails, have the servants throw you out.The post-sixties restoration of Austen has I think its origin in a rejection by Western elites of the \\"spirit of the 1960s\\"...which was mostly chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours, a second Regency.It was Byronic, it was Blakean, it was mad, it was creative destruction, or destructive creation. I can't remember but it sure was fun.But creative destruction, may I introduce diastolic reproduction? People must be fed, infants amused, servants chastised, houses kept up, and daughters married off.However, \\"creative destruction\\" versus Austen's faith in a serious reproduction of fortunes and daily life forgets and shuns another -tion.This is exploitation. The sensitive reader is appalled of course in a minor key by Mr. Collins' toadying of Lady Catherine. But what's unsaid is that the land on which Austen's heroes lived was stolen land.I would have killed Jane Bennet off in her first fever. In my version, John Paul Jones lands and sets the Bennet's house to the torch. Elizabeth would have been abducted by a motley crew of Red Indians, pirates and Jacobins, to wind up at Waterloo crazed with love for a D'Arcy of a Frog, and nothing to be done.But: the work of art must be accepted on its own terms."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This CD is wonderful.

I don't have time to actually sit down and read a novel, so I purchased the audio version. I was very pleased with it. I thought the narrator was excellent. Wonderful Book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I saw the movie recently before I read the book but the movie inspired me to read the book and the book is far better than the movie. It's a wonderful classic with just the right amount of everything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's masterpiece and it deservedly bears this title. Pride and Prejudice is the perfect love story. It starts out with the Bennet family. Mr. Bennet has five daughters of marriagable age, and a wife who is in a hurry to marry them off. When rich Mr. Bingley moves to town, bringing his even-richer friend Mr. Darcy with him, Mrs. Bennet plans to have two of her daughters married within a matter of months. Things don't go quite as planned, though, when Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the story, meets the prideful Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is unlike any other young woman of her time (except perhaps Jane Austen herself). Elizabeth is smart, sharp-tongued, and stubborn. When she meets Mr. Darcy she considers him to be the most disagreeable person she has ever met. But sometimes first impressions (which was fittingly the original title of the book) aren't always right, and the story unfolds from there.I was reluctant to read this book at first because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the language. It was a little difficult at first, but the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of the language and the more I understood. What inspired me to read the book was the new movie version starring Keira Knightley, which I loved. Watching the movie before I read the book made the book easier to understand. Not only did I love the story, but I loved the rich characters who brought life to musty, early 19th century England. Everyone in the story has more to their character than meets the eye, and that made all the characters more realistic. I also liked how the book was very decent. It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have any profanity or graphic scenes. For those who are easily bored, this may not be the book for you because it is rather lengthy and tends to drag in places. This book is probably more enjoyable for girls than for guys, but by no means does that make this novel a Harlequin Romance. All in all, I was very pleased with Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad I got over my own prejudice of old fashioned language enough to read this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has become of the most renown authors around the world for her witty and classic characters. It doesn't suprise me that she is able to write such a wonderful novel as Pride & Prejudice.It is a story of a young woman named Elizabeth Bennet ,a.k.a. Lizzy, who has a great dislike for a handsome and rich man called Mr. Darcy. The story takes Elizabeth through twists and turns and some how she ends up in love with Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my favorite classics. I never thought this book was slow, although some might disagree because of the older english. I personally found the language in this book to be beautiful. I love the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She was a feisty, strong-willed woman, who wanted to marry for true love, as opposed to convenience or wealth, which was not very common during the time that this book was written. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A very loooooong time ago I was a Honors English student in college; we read the classics voraciously. While Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of my all-time favorites, I always dreaded reading Jane Austin. She can be very bland, dry, and boring. This book is a bit different, with the characters showing more wit than Austin usually provides.I recently read the \\"Zombie\\" format of this work and found it absolutely laugh-out-loud funny! Can't wait to see the movie! If you like this book, by all means pick up the P,P & Z edition and prepare to be charmed all over again.Best,Vienna"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did enjoy the novel, but was not particularly fond of how Austen (as opposed to Chralotte Bronte) portrays marriage as a necessity for women or essential for a woman's happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love the story, and this little book with gold edges is the perfect copy to keep and enjoy again and again. In our disposable society they just don't make books like this one anymore. Great gift for the Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, lover in your life, or better yet for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book several times, and each time it continues to amuse me more. the wonderful thing about Austin is the style of her writing is so wonderful and other worldly that one can keep reading the same book over and over and always find some new intricate detail of her writing to marvel over. I know that some people are not up for the task of 19th literature, but if you can just give it your all and dig in, Austin will certainly make it worth your while and more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a great book full of forbidden love, greed, bribery, sorrow and triumph. Jane Austin, once again, has written a beautiful novel that should be read by everyone! Not only does she describe everything well, but the way that she writes lets you infer how the character is feeling and thinking.Mr. Darcy is a great villian/hero when you read because he is so lovable and caring without being obvious.Lizzy Bennet is one of the greatest characters ever written about! She is spunky, speaks her mind and she is supportive of all of her sisters (which is very important when Lydia takes a turn for the worst). She is a great, admirable person in the story, which makes reading Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. Jane Austin really knows how to write!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Regarded as one of the classic pieces of literature, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice does not disappoint. The novel chronicles the life of Elizabeth Bennett, a young woman pressured by 19th century standards to marry a man with favorable prospects. Elizabeth, however, is a quick witted and intelligent individual whose strong character is too valued by readers to face a miserable fate by marrying without love.The story begins with a certain Mr. Bingley and his friend who come to stay at a neighboring state of Netherfield. The eldest daughter, Jane, seems to be the daughter of his fancy, and after several balls and gatherings, the Bennets grow acquainted with Bingley, his two sisters, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Where Mr. Bingley plays the gentleman, charming, sociable, and pleasant, Mr. Darcy appears proud, introverted, and rude. Mr. Darcy's initial haughtiness towards Lizzy and his continual dismissal of those around him make him disagreeable at first, but through Austen's subtle description and dialogue of him, readers see him as a misunderstood character. The conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy at the balls or in Netherfield are where Austen's writing shines. Elizabeth's witty and charming dialogue challenges Darcy's cynicism and brutal honesty. The tension and anticipation Austen weaves merely through these interactions solidifies Darcy and Elizabeth's possible romantic relationship.As the novel progresses, Elizabeth is faced again with the prospect of marrying a wealthy man when Mr. Darcy proposes to her. Shocked, and above all, full of indignation upon hearing that he would marry her despite of his character, Elizabeth flatly refuses him. Darcy must then prove himself worthy of Elizabeth's attentions and Elizabeth must realize she was too quick to judge on first impressions.BY steffi castillo"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels. Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing. I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy. Pride and Prejudice, an unforgettable book filled with unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am trying to read more classics because I never really paid attention to them in high school.

I love the back and forth between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, they were absolutely meant for each other!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful classic of English literature.

Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film.

However, I want to compliment Amazon for its free library of such titles. That people can access them simply and at no or next to no cost if a real benefit!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is so much to write positively about the charm of this book. However, I find the most delight I receive is in the clever phrases and word usages. It is a kind, long poem to my ears.Naturally, I do like Elizabeth as well. She is very human. She has the ability to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to realize her hubrus and change. I don't find this very often in modern works.I return to this book from time to time to retreat from life. It has become an old soothing friend to me!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"great book of course for any jane austin fan. this review is more for this kindle edition. i decided to buy the one dollar version after a few chapters because i do not like the repetitive use of dialog in all caps. it makes me imagine too much yelling. granted i do not know whether miss austin wrote it that way or the scribes of this digital book did. i just know i do not like it. if you are like me or unsure just get the sample first."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Perhaps the mother of all romances, this classic cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me Jane Austen story stands as a model that many modern romances seem formulated upon. Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of reviews of this book, I somehow feel it important to share my thoughts. This is one of my favorite books of all time, though I came to it very late in life. During my 5th reading of it, I started musing over why this book had such an incredible impact on me. I finally figured it out. This book and almost of all Austen's other brilliant novels speak to me about the life-altering possibilities of love. This reality was completely integral to the lives of women in the 18th and 19th century. If you were a woman, your fate -- whether you became a wife, a mother, a mistress of a fine home or stayed at home the rest of your days taking care of your parents -- was completely determined by a man choosing you. But this idea, even in our times in which women actually have options and power to change their lives, is highly compelling. These books -- these characters -- capture the feeling that everyone who has every fallen in love has that in one instant their lives, if joined with another, will be changed forever and exponentially and in ways they cannot even imagine. It is that feeling of possibility that Jane Austen has put into words, and why, I believe, her books are still as influencial as they were 2 hundred years ago."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had heard good thungs about this book from my school friends and heard great praise from my librarian the day I checked it out. I had always wanted to read a Jane Austen novel and this was my first. I had completley fell in love with it when I was stuck inside, at home, on three snowy days and could not put it down. I immediately began seeking other Austen books, but this one stuck in my mind. I have read this, Persuasion, Lady Susan, and have seen the Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion movies. I have yet to see Pride and Prejidice, but I am looking forward to it.Pride and Prejudice's main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is strong-willed, intelligent, and witty. She makes snap judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudices. She is the second youngest of five sisters and no brothers and is the favorite of her father.The eldest, virtuous Jane, is her favorite who rarely sees the wrong in anybody. Jane is considered the handsomest sister. The middle child, Mary, is principled and only lives to improve her accomplishments. The next is timid Catherine, or Kitty, who is followed by exasperating Lydia. Lydia is silly and, if you have ever read Persuasion, like the Musgroves. She is cheerful and a flirt going after the soldiers' and fancying herself always in love. Her mother is hopelessly silly and her father is sardonic. They meet this man, Mr. Charles Bingley, who is considered very rich that just moved into the neighborhood. He is a perfectly wonderful man who fell in love with a Bennet. His friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, his name even convinces us that he possesses arrogant pride, is even more rich than Mr. Bingley but is disliked by the shole neighborhood.\\"It is a truth universally acknowlegded that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\\", the first sentance of the book, states a theme of the novel. Marraige is talked of often in the book. Elizabeth meets both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy and judges their characters. One she likes and one she doesn't. You can probably guess. But is her first immpression of Mr. Darcy wrong?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you don't fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.Jane Austen's best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.Pay attention to Elizabeth's words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen. There are many occasions where Elizabeth's character shines through. She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself. It is as if Jane said, \\"Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like.\\"Elizabeth is multi-layerd.What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen's ideal man. He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there. And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy. Isn't it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?Also, pay attention to Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Bennet. Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they? Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant. He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.Mmmm. Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy. This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh. There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth. We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine. Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read \\"pride and Prejudic\\" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. \\"Pride and Prujudice\\" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth's gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other? Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness? Only time(and lots of page turning) will tell. This is one of few books that has kept my interrest and i hope it can keep yours too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. After getting a list of books to read from my teacher, my dad said this would be the perfect one for me. I was slow to begin, but once I got started, I was quickly consumed. It had everything a great story should have. This book reminded me of a Danielle Steal novel, but written much better, and surely not a beach read. It took time and effort to complete, but in the end, the novel was worth the hard work. This book taught me a lot about myself. Even more than that, a lot about who I want to be. When I finished reading and discussed this book with my dad, I told him that I wanted to be Elizabeth Bennet. She was a great protagonist to watch grow throughout the novel. She was a very round character, who was revealed in pieces, not showing the true whole self until the end. It was amazing for me to see how much I could relate to a story written so many years ago. I feel now like the times have truly not change much. Love is still love, loss is still loss, and friends are still friends. This novel was a true untimely classic. Although this story is about love, it is not all good times. It takes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy a long time before they become lovers. There are twists, turns, broken hearts, and shy wit along the way. This book was one of the first that made me both laugh and cry. I came out of reading this book with a slightly different outlook on life as I had before I began. At some points I wanted to just jump into the novel, rearrange some things, and come back out. It was so important to me for everyone in the novel to be happy, and everything to work out as I had it planned. The literary value of this work in unbelievable. As young as I am, and even though I have not read that many classics yet, I can tell you that this one is worth it. My favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of the beautiful rolling hills, the wonderfully decorated rooms, and the people. Austen must have had an amazing picture in her head when creating this work! She truly moved me! This literary work was enchanting. As great as the novel was, there were some downsides you should know before picking it up. Although beautiful, the language was difficult to understand sometimes, for me at least. It was spoken in strong 18th century English, and not always easy to comprehend. This novel takes you winding through the souls of two people, both filled with pride and prejudices, hence the novels title. The long journey to love, is far, and difficult, but in the end true love prevails."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Do not waste your money on this!

Jane Austen rocks, baby!note: somebody at amazon made a mistake, and the cover that appears up there is from the Oxford Classics edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time. ThePride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)edition provides helpful footnotes to help readers understand the nuances of the novel more completely.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It shipped on time and the product as advertised.

As a highschool student, I had to read this in my leisure time, b/c it is a lightweight classic. It has so many great characters. Subtle hints of sarcasm, and the stereotypical attitude of some characters, give the story a comical twinge. However, if you do decide to read this for a class, I personally think the story is most interesting as far as plot and drama goes, and unless the class is bent on feminist views, I found it hard to extract any valued literary elements."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!! I don't understand how anyone could call it boring. Granted, the people in the books talk a little much and sometimes I'm just like 'Get on with it' but I've sort of learned to skim those parts. This book is a comedy making fun of the English society in the early 1800s. It's making the womens'(woman's?) quest for a good future into a vicious man-hunt and it's hilarious. I agree that there was not enough written out dialogue. I really would've liked the scene with Elizabeth and Darcy played out a little more. But it's a GREAT!!! GREAT!! WONDERFUL!! book.

I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on &quot;Wishbone.&quot; It was my favorite episode. I decided to read it after finishing &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and aching for another great book. This is it! It has wonderful characters that you fall in love with, a wonderful love story, and insights that really make you think about . . . pride and prejudice of all things. It's wonderfully written, and it's fun to try to get used to the different usage of English.

Well, for anyone who is considering reading the book, I full-heartily recomend it to you. I previously just finished the book, and Jane Austen did a fabulous job captivating my attention and suspicions whether Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever truly get together. The latter is prejudiced against the handsome and &quot;supposively&quot; haughty Mr. Darcy, so until she realizes the truth does her opinion alter. Jane Austen adds humor to the story and created well-balanced characters which arouse much interest with the reader. An exceptionally written and intriguing story which anyone who has never read should."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep. I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however. It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment. There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine. There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence. Austen gets so much right: she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules. You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is. She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right. She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick. She is very witty but never casual. She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart. I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life: maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an enjoyable love story first and foremost but it is also an interesting commentary on the way that society used to look at the institution of mairage along with role of women with in that same society.

I very much enjoyed reading this book and would readily recomend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I was a young teen, a freind of my mother's had the 6 volume BBC movie version of this novel, but we never saw all of the episodes.

The book, and this is meant to be a compilement, is like a good Beatles song...deceptively simple, but rings so true and real, it can't help but tap into something very critical to the human experience.

I fell in love with this book and I have never found another one that quite compares with it's imapact. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic but i believe that things like this could have happened, and might still happen now! I mean you really never can tell. For example, in the beginning the main character meets the person that is to be her husband later in the book, and their intial meeting is not one of desriable happenings. Elizabeth sees Mr. Darcy as a arrogant and rude. He in turn sees her in the beginning as plain, except for her eyes, but he later developes feelings for her which mature throughout the novel. On her side the feelings mature as well...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was an excellent novel because of its distinct feminine superiority. Elizabeth Bennet, being the heroine in the novel, was a great character to whom women can relate. Her clever, independent quallities are what makes Elizabeth such an admirable character. My favorite chapter would be chapter eleven, volume two. This chapter is when Mr. Darcy proposes to Lizzy, and he expresses his feelings to her for the first time. Thisis my favorite chapter because of the way Lizzy refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal. She wasn't intimidated by Mr. Darcy's arrogance and his billowing attitude or his wealth. Not only did she decline his offer of marriage, but she criticized him for all his faults of pride and prejudice. This book is appropriate for ages fifteen and up because of its complex speech. The one literary device that I appreciate was irony. I found it ironic that a prideful, arrogant man would fall in love with an independent, strong willed woman. It was ironic that Elizabeth could see Mr. Darcy's faults of pride and prejudice but not see it in herself. Austen was able to use this irony to create the plot of the story. I enjoyed this novel because of the way it was written, the characters, and the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Mr. Dary and Elizabeth. The way that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth despise each other at the beginning and later realized their true feelings for each other was very romantic. It was an explicit novel that I believe anybody who enjoys reading would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An abundance of pride and prejudice inflicted on the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, is the main obstacle of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. The actions of the novel revolve around the central characters who undergo tremendous changes to overcome their faults. Mr. Darcy is accused of having such a pride that he could not believe Elizabeth appropriate enough to barely be in his presence. From then on, Elizabeth formed harsh judgments about Mr. Darcy and his personality. Their first impressions of one another clung to them so deeply that establishing a relationship was all the more heartwarming. The actions of the novel, between not only Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but with the entire Bennet family and other acquaintances, kept me wanting to read on for more. My heart was into each character and I could not wait to find out more about their relations. I felt myself laughing and, at times, talking out loud because of the actions of the novel. I remained in suspense throughout, which made the events more enjoyable. I cannot wait for the opportunity to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; again in my free time. I highly recommend the novel to anyone in search of a plot and a love for characters to read the amazing writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen merits praise even with the high expectations I contained for it. In the first few paragraphs, I was confronted with flighty gossip and lacy trifles that were rather discouraging considering that I had expected something more profound. Yet as the novel progressed, the flowery language had a zing to it that amuses a person as it pokes fun at those with immense wealth in nineteenth century English society and at the traditions that were upheld. The Bennett family holds the attention of the readers in this novel, especially the women, as they deal with society's regulations regarding entailment. The fact that a male heir does not exist in the Bennett family causes Mrs. Bennett to become anxious to marry her five daughters off to men with fortunes. The aspect of the novel that truly provides the reader with contentment resides in the moral development of two of the main characters. The character flaws that exist within Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are discovered, examined, and steadily coached until both can live more fully. I appreciate this fine piece of literature for the magnificent writing syle that Austen utilized and the clever character development that she employed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only picked this up after watching the latest excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's now-ubiquitous 'Pride and Prejudice'.Let me preface this review by saying that this is a novel like no other - it's Little Women with Declaritive Sentences, it's Gone With The Wind without the Overstatement. The story of the five Bennett sisters in their quest to make good marriages is as entertaining as it is relevant, and Austen's acerbic and subtle humour still shine today.Eliza Bennett has a problem. She is the only independant sister in a family of five girls, ruled by a weatherbeaten Father and a hyperactive Mother. She wishes to marry for love, and love alone, but times are hard, and if she does not marry for money, she will be poor, as her father's estate is entailed away to his only nephew, the connsumately hideous Clergyman, Mr. Collins. She meets and falls in immediate Hate with the snobbish, upper-class Mr. Darcy, and through a series of mishaps, revelations and balls, she discovers that he is not the man she first suspected him to be.Austen shows an almost unnatural intelligence with her prose. She is the definitive social commentator, and slips her jokes and judgements into her writing with such subtlety, that you forget she's doing it at all. Unlike Louisa M. Alcott's heavy-handed Christian-Morals littered about 'Little Women', Austen's morals are of a markedly more subtle nature. Truly ahead of her time, and an early feminist, her writing advocates independance for women, and shows clearly the faults and idiosyncrasies of men and silly women - a refreshing change for the period. Even today, her caustic protrayals of Mrs. Bennett, a woman as mercenary in her dealings with marriage as she is socially embarrassing, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, a wealthy, if somewhat inbred, dowager, and Mr. Collins, a greasy and truly venal human being, ring true as vivid and relevant descriptions of how to be an Idiot. The opposite can be said of her central character, Elizabeth Bennett. Clearly a semi-autobiographical heroine, Austen has created in Eliza an independant and intelligent heroine, but tempers this with several character flaws (the most notable being the titular 'Pride') to produce a young woman of believable depth and character.Her plot is long-winded and drawn-out, but, thanks to Austen's wonderful gift for making characters interesting as well as whole, it never once loses pace; instead, it becomes a joy to read. Her Cast Of Thousands each have a distinct part to play in uniting Elizabeth with her true love, and however small that part, Austen ensures they do it with memorable gusto.All in all, I urge everyone to read this novel. However, I think it's best read after seeing the TV adaptations, because while good, they cannot even begin to show the depth and intelligence of this novel. You'll appreciate Austen all the more after 'Pride and Prejudice'."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen is a classic that is well worth reading. The descriptions of the characters and their interactions with one another truly make this book enjoyable and unique.The book centers on the developing relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They start out disliking one another, but as the story unfolds, they begin to see each other in a different light. Soon, respect for one another develops and eventually a love that is greater than either have ever hoped to experience.The setting for this book is 18th century England, where there is a separation of classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Elizabeth Bennet is from a respecatble, middle class family, whereas Fitzwilliam Darcy is from a very notable, upper class family. Mr. Darcy sees any alliance between him or his friend, Mr. Bingley, and the Bennet family, as highly reprehensible in the beginning. Elizabeth's oldest sister, Jane, is in love with Mr. Bingley and believes Mr. Bingley to be in love with her as well. Mr. Darcy does not want his friend having any connection with the Bennet family, so he takes it upon himself to separate his friend from Jane and believes himself to be in the right to do so. This upsets Elizabeth greatly and she refuses to have anything to do with Mr. Darcy, if she can help it. Fate had something else in mind, though, and they kept getting thrown together.The interactions between these two characters were, at times, very humorous. Jane Austen developed them in such a way that I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next. She definitely did not disappoint my curiosity in wanting to know how everything would eventually turn out for the characters.British Broadcasting Company, in partnership with Arts &amp; Entertainment television, produced the movie, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet. I was so impressed with this movie after watching it on television, that I immediately went out and bought it. It stayed with the book for the most part and really brought Jane Austen's characters to life. It helped me to understand her characters and their situations even more.This is definitely a book I would recommend to most anyone who is looking for a great, romantic classic to read. It is my favorite book of all time and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Some might feel that Pride and Prejudice is just a feminine romance novel, but to me this book was much more. The words and language in the book were mesmorizing. I believe Meg Ryan put it perfectly when she said, \\"I get caught up in the language, words like felicity and thither.\\"(You've Got Mail, 1998) Considering Jane Austen's formal education ended at age nine, Pride and Prejudice proves that America as a whole has been \\"dumbing-down\\" their children. I feel Pride and Prejudice is a timeless literary classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is definately an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. what more needs to be said...it is my favorite book..EVER! i place it above the rest, and truly believe there is no comparison. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"At first, I had no desire to read 'Pride and Prejudice,' I thought that it would be drivel like so many other romance novels are. After the insistence of friends, I finally gave in and read it. While reading the first few pages, I was sceptical, but soon I was hooked. I couldn't put this book down and even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was intrigued and enthralled.For those of you who haven't read this book, you are missing out on a lighthearted, romantic treat. It is intelligent and fun and the characters are extremely likeable. I now consider it to be one of my favourite books.Also, if you haven't seen the film version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you need to see it. It may be about 6 hours long but it doesn't feel long at all. The book and the film are great companions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the first Regency romances ever written and still perhaps the best. This witty and complex novel features delightful characters, nonstop comic observations, clever dialogue and fast paced development of an excellent plot. Besides being a thoroughly entertaining read, Pride and Prejudice raises questions about appearance versus reality, society versus the individual and the nature of true love that still resonate deeply with us today. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex, lively and fascinating heroines ever created, and her growing romance with the highly intelligent, proud and magnetic Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of the most compelling ever written. This is a seminal novel that no lover of romance-or student of human nature-should ever miss."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a must read. All the senior English classes at my high school watched the BBC movie. Everybody loved the movie. Even the boys. Everybody I know has either read the book since (or read it again in some circumstances) or has plans to read it as soon as they get a chance. The characters are perfect as well as all the description. The entire book is, in a word, perfect. Read It. Watch the movie. Fall in love with Jane Austen (like I have). I am now in the processing of reading all of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is one of the great masters of the English language, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is her great masterpiece, a sharp and witty comedy of manners played out in early 19th Century English society, a world in which men held virtually all the power and women were required to negotiate mine-fields of social status, respectability, wealth, love, and sex in order to marry both to their own liking and to the advantage of their family. And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything. But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card. But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era. It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny. A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the versions listed is published by \\"General Books LLC.\\" Another reader complained about the tiny and almost unreadable font - you probably bought the version published by General Books LLC - and here's the reason.General Books LLC is an imprint of VDM Publishing, (google them and take a look at the Wikipedia article on them) and they specialise in publishing books that are free of copyright without doing any editing or quality control.

I have never seen an actual book loaded with so many simple errors as this ebook is."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am really enjoying this book. I won't comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the kindle version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book. Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature.British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers. The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living.Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure. It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved the style and social politics of the Regency period (the time of Jane Austen.) But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classics come to life under good audio treatment, as Irene Sutcliffe demonstrates by reading Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with passion and style. This is the best known of her novels, and some of Austen's less accessible descriptions spring to life under the voice of Irene Sutcliffe, who has worked extensively n the theatre."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a nice copy of the book. It has a built in ribbon bookmark and nice line drawing illustrations. It is about 3 inches wide and 5 inches long (smaller than a standard book). It is a very pretty version of the book though, and would be great as a gift. Seems like it is well made. It does have thin pages, but it doesn't seem problematic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair although not truly noticable was very strong and forgiving. Neither knew that they had feelings for the other until a rash judgement was made on both sides. Elizabeth declines the hand of her cousin Mr. Collins and therefore goes against the customs of the time period. Elizabeth defies most traditional customs when it comes to men. She wants to marry for love not money, or anything else. This novel keeps the reader interested and wanting more. Jane Austen is a superb author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a really good book, although there was some confusing description at some points. It's about the daughters of the Bennet family, Elizabeth and Jane in particular. The courtships of Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Mr. Bingley are the focus of the novel. Jane Austen does a good job of describing the romances because the dialog for the most part is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book has humor, drama, romance. Everything I love to read in a good old fashioned story. If you have never read Jane Austen you don't know what you are missing. Even my husband was a convert after Pride and Prejudice!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic that remains relevant in any century. The ultimate book on romance.

Most of them, I hate to admit, I find difficult to comprehend and relate to, but not this one. The dialogue was its greatest strength; it was so incredibly real! This book is so rich in its use of the English language. Pride and Prejudice is truly an enriching reading experience, and one that is guaranteed to be enjoyed over and over again. I just finished my sixth reading ... I can't wait for my seventh!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a fun, descriptive book. I used to think that was an oxymoron but it's not! Fun, descriptive books actually exist. This book is enthralling because I am able to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Austen book, beating out my second-favorite, Emma, by maybe half a mile! Every character is believable and human, and perhaps more importantly, can be understood by those of us of modern times.Elizabeth is entirely lovable because she is NOT entirely perfect. She has a penchant for mischief and irony that she has obviously inherited or absorbed from her wonderfully eccentric and hilarious father, and a slightly over-developed sense of her own worth that springs from her highly and consciously intelligent observation of all the folks that share her corner of the planet. But she is also wonderfully honest and capable of eating crow when she sees the error of her assumptions.Although this is a beautiful glimpse into the ways and mores of a very different age, it is also a timeless human drama, loaded with subtle humor."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is charming and i love when the author describe the old houses with appletrees, wild flowers and all that stuff.

Differences of class and upbringing, coupled with societal exposure and expectation lead the plot through many twists and turns that keep you reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today. Pride can get in the way of almost anything, and so can being prejudice. The modern spin is called Prom and Prejudice. The people changed to fit the time, but not the message. It is a wonderful book worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book, and it's really my favorite story of all time. Mr. Darcy is just about as dreamy as they come.

Also the progress women have made in having control over their lives."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is, to put it simply, unequalled. Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does. Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language. You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one. Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word. She understood people. We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work. How did she pull it all off so beautifully?I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity. I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so. If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph. Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently finished my 3rd reading of P&P;, and I cannot begin to say how much I loved it. This is one of those novels that you can read over and over and never get tired of because you find something new every time! One of the most satisfying experiences is just being able to go through it slowly and savor every little turn of phrase, though for me this was not possible until I had already read it and didn't have the urge to rush on and see how it ended. As for the novel itself, so many people have given a synopsis that it would be pointless for me to do so. All I will say is that if it sounds dull just from reading about it, I still would not give up because Austen is one of the few authors whose works are very difficult to give a plot summary for that does justice to the story.One other thing- I would also recommend this edition because it is one of the most pretty and elegant I have seen, yet still very affordable. A fan of Austen who would like to upgrade to a nicer edition of the novels should really consider Everyman's Library because there are few others that are more lovely or durable.In short, don't miss out on this wonderful reading experience!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful and well-written stories throughout the centuries. It isn't meant to be viewed as a serious tale, but is instead satirical, poking fun at the different conventions of society at the time. The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is well-developed and extremely likeable, as is her sister, Jane. Even Mr. Darcy, whom everyone dislikes in the beginning of the novel, is likeable in his somewhat clumsy love for Elizabeth. The struggle that Darcy and Elizabeth go through to finally admit their love is complex and draws the reader into the story even further. I must say that my favorite character is Mr. Bennet, because his off-the-wall humor had me laughing out loud several times throughout reading the book. I read this book when I was 13 and thought it was wonderful, and over the years it has become even better. This book is such a remarkable piece of literature that it only gets more interesting and more fruitful of a read the more times you actually pick the book up and read it. Jane Austen is a master of literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I read this Jane Austen novel, I couldn't help falling in love with it. The romance, which I think plays the main part,was overwhelming, along with the beautiful charactirazation and the so well-thought plot. This novel contains everything it should contain to be a bestseller, and a besteller it is, even almost 200 years after it was written. This book is a true recommendation for everyone who likes his or her books well-written and full of humor, love, intrigues, social developments and such lively and realistic characters. Somehing that struck me, was the fact that Elizabeth is such an quick-witted girl that is so modern for her time: she wants to marry for love, (which girl wouldn't want that?! it really is just like a fairy-tale) and she has got a will of her own. She doesn't like to be toyed with and she has got her feminin pride that makes her so strong. Should you be considering reading this book, don't hesitate and just grab it, and you will soon see: it grabs you!&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance. To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman. However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley. Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships. Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention. Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman. It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters. Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy. Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed. However, it is much more than that. It is a masterful tale of how people deceive themselves and the traps that they fall into when they are weak-minded and easily manipulated by others. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is also a beautiful and romantic story of how men and women find their soul mates in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If a classic is boring, then this is not a classic. If a drawing-room comedy is stiff and trivial, then this is not a drawing-room comedy. This is quite simply one of the loveliest, wittiest, most utterly _wise_ novels ever written about human relationships. Every word sparkles. The dialogue fairly dances. And Austen does this without any of the things that we often assume make for an exciting novel. The most suspenseful question that arises is whether a certain two characters in the novel have gone to Scotland or to London (this is suspenseful for reasons having to do with 18th-century English marriage laws and social mores). And this event, certainly the most sensational in the book, is really only important because it helps the two central characters make up their minds about each other. Austen's world is a world in which every detail really counts--in which the slightest look or the most insignificant word can have earth-shaking meaning. And the result of this, as of all great literature, is to send us back into our own worlds with the renewed conviction that it all really does matter. In that sense, Austen's &quot;realistic&quot; fiction is a lot like good fantasy, such as Lord of the Rings. By heightening certain aspects of our experience, Austen gives new life to the &quot;commonplace&quot; world we live in. This is a book that makes you feel alive, and glad of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found Pride and Prejudice an engrossing and well written novel. The book gives modern readers insight into the Victorian society, morality, and etiquette. The novel is made up of fascinating, well-developed three-dimensional characters. I loved Darcy and Elizabeth; although both were flawed people, they also had an essential humanity and goodness to them that made me root for them to get together. I thought the way Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy evolved was very realistic. I admired Darcy's love for his sister, and his strength, while finding myself frustrated by his arrogance and aloofness. I thought Elizabeth was a heroine modern women could relate to - she had fire, confidence and forthrightness.I also enjoyed the complex relationships between the various characters, be it Jane and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Mr. Bennett, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. What I liked was that even the characters we weren't meant to like, such as Lady Catherine, were not one-dimensional (this isn't the case in Mansfield Park). I was just as interested in finding out what would happen to Lydia and Jane as I was in the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. The one complaint I have here is that I wish that Darcy and Elizabeth had gotten closer sooner, so that the conflict with Lady Catherine could have been a bigger part of the novel. There were events that I wish had occurred earlier so that more time could have been spent on them - the novel got off to a slow start.That said, overall this novel has much better pacing than other classic literature I have read (notably Mansfield Park). The author does provide a great deal of detail and description, but she is such a good writer, and the prose is so captivating, that I didn't mind at all. The dialogue is superb. The novel had a lot of charming, funny moments. The uses of satire and irony were exceedingly well done; Austen is the master of this sort of comedy of manners."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my all-time favorite book, and believe me, I've read MANY novels. Jane Austen has excellently captured human nature here, and all of her characters reflect the environment they grew up in which was determined by the social classes of the time period.The main conflict of the book is based on the interactions between these social classes, which is reflected by the title. The prejudice and pride of BOTH the upper and middle class is what the story revolves around, but it isn't the action and intrigue that mark this book, it is the characters that make this &quot;Timeless Masterpiece.&quot;Elizabeth Bennet, whose liveliness and quick wit have often attracted readers, is the main character from the middle class. Mr. Darcy is her counterpart from the upper class. These two drive the book, adding humor and depth with every word.Everyone over the age of 12, including BOTH males and females, should read this book. This isn't a silly romance novel for young girls, it is a classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. It has so many levels. On the surface, it's a book about 5 silly airheads who chase men &amp; go to parties. They obsess over all the single men in town &amp; how much money the men have. On a deeper level, you see that women in that time period had no rights. They couldn't even own their own home. Their very existance depended upon finding a suitable husband. Of course they were interested in catching a rich man!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get much better than Pride &amp; Prejudice, people!

A beautiful story well written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":".it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's important to remember that Pride and Prejudice takes place during the later reign of George the Third at the beginning of the 19th century. The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I choose to right a short simple review, because no words can do justice to Jane Austens romantic classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the first book I've reviewed at Amazon that didn't have a bad review! That must say something. I truely enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. It proves that even back in the 18 century, people where humiliated by there parents and family too!

It was on the requirements list for my literature course at school, but I found it so compelling that I finished reading it at home! I especially loved the ending-it's so romantic! I also congratulate Jane Austen's sense of humour and her ability to create such diverse characters that seem so realistic. I thought Mrs. Bennet's empty-headed, foolish character was the funniest &amp; so incredibly contrasting to that of the cool-headed one of Mr.Bennet.

I couldn't help but root for Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Romance has very little to do with this book--it is one of the funniest novels I have ever read!

I love this book!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the most perfect book ever written. Great for lovers of romantic novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey and enjoying it so much, I decided that I would take another stab about Jane Austen and I am very glad that I did. I chose Pride and Prejudice because it is one of her better known novels and has been turned into numerous movies as well as a recent adaptation titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. The story is about Elizabeth Bennet who is a strong willed and outspoken young woman as she tries to find her true love. The most interesting aspect of the story is not Elizabeth's hunt for love, but her relationship with her parents. Mrs. Bennet is a flighty woman whose main goal in life is to have her daughters wed to wealthy men. While, Mr. Bennet is a sarcastic and cynical man with no interest in martial affairs. Elizabeth's contrasting parental figures is detrimental to all of the daughters and even places them in danger.Most people identify this novel with the relationship between outspoken Elizabeth and cocky Darcy. However, there is much more to the story than their love.Still, I am looking forward to reading Linda Berdoll's sequel titled Darcy Takes a Wife."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For the first time ever, I liked the movie (w/Colin Firth version) way better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm not really qualified enough to give the comments for this wonderful classic book.

They learn each other and learn to give and take for the sake of their love. No one could have opened this theme the way Jane Austen did and she did an amazing job, as you read it you see her style of thought and word from the first line to the last."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found this book to be a great one of the many that I have every read. It is now within my memory, and I will most definetly read again. It may be long, but it is definetly worth it. I love the way that Lizzy thinks and acts. Throughout the book you are triggered into seeing if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are ever gonna get hooked up. The thought of Jane always being there for her sister is also a very good necessityof the book. It shows how decent people can actually be and the relationship that 2 sisters can often have. I encourage you to read it and find out how good a book it is for yourself!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a really good book.

I am fascinated with the society and culture of the past, and find that only through reading can I visit this era. I found the dialogue very amusing as well as the characters mannerisms and behavior. As to their behavior, Ms. Austen could not have captured the essence of human nature any better than she did. She is able to show people's tendency to be insecure; selfish; arrogant; judgmental; opportunistic, and overly passionate. Elizabeth Bennet, was refreshingly unconventional with her frank and direct honestly and her wry humor. The conclusion satisfies the thirst for an outpouring of emotion, for Ms. Austin establishes a good degree of tension, which increases the farther in the story one goes. What I found unfavorable was the plot's slow progression and its tendency to drag. Mr. Darcy is rarely heard in the beginning although I admit he does appear more during the end. I also feel that Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy lasted too long, which resulted in choking the romance out of it. Along with its slow progression, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. This is due in part to the language that I find simultaneously charming, as well as to the characters' tendencies to go on and on about a subject of no particular importance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a satirical commentary on nineteenth century society. Austen uses dry humor and irony to show the absurdities of her time. Extreme characters such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet are used to accentuate the sexism of her society, and characters such as Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine De Bough are used to show the culture's obsession with wealth and power. Austen uses the character Elizabeth Bennet to counter these negative values. Elizabeth does not conform to the society's beliefs of how women should act, and she believes in marrying only for love. This novel is enjoyable to read, although it is at times wordy and somewhat predictable. The general plot is not overly exciting or suspensful. However, the problems of sexism and egotism examined in this work are issues still prevelent today. Therefore, readers, especially young women, can relate to this novel. As an AP English student, I would not highly recomend this novel to other AP students. While I did enjoy reading it, I did not find it to be on the same level as the other books I read this year. It took little analysis to find the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of the novel. Although it was not as chalenging as other books that I have read this year, many of the themes would lend nicely to the final thematic question on the exam. I would not replace another AP novel with this, but I would read it as a supplement to the AP curriculum."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you haven't read this book yet, you really must do so! I never read any Jane Austen in school etc, and just out of nowhere picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" recently. It instantly became my new favorite book.

My only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner! If you enjoy a good love story then you MUST read this book! The characters were so well developed and the story was so well delivered that it was virtually impossible to put it down. In my opinion, this book deserves way more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I could read P&P; over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira.

I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy. Although the 10,000 a year does work in his favor..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Okay so I started reading P&P; a week ago and with forcing myself, I finished it today. I wanted to read this because everyone was saying that it was such a great book and that its timeless and yadda, yadda, yadda.So I was a little iffy on the first volume, but I could handle all the cliches, the social ranks, and the writing. Around the middle of voume two, i started screaming at the book (screaming at inanimate objects-never a good sign) because i was so fed up with it. I couldn't get myself to get really into it like my fellow peers. Maybe its because I'm 14, but I don't get it. The writing is boring, its too cliched, too old-fashioned, annoying and I know that the lovers are supposed to be in passionate love and all, but it feels cold-no love or passion, just boring. I found myself falling asleep in the middle of every chapter after chapter 16. Maybe its just me, I don't know, but I did not like this book, at all. I can understand why people of Jane Austen's time would adore this book, but i don't understand how people of OUR time can enjoy this. If you're looking for a good British classic romance, Wuthering Heights, not Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Elizabeth is twenty years old, living in the Victorian ages in England. Life is a bit tricky for her. She lives with her overbearing mother, disinterested father, older sister Jane and three younger sisters, Mary, Catherine and Lydia. They are a reasonably well-to-do family for the moment, although once Elizabeth's father dies, their estate and any fortune he has left will go to a male relative, as he was unable to produce any sons. With the prospect of becoming destitute looming over her, Elizabeth's mother is desperate to get her five daughters, all in their late teens or early twenties, married off to wealthy men.The first man to come to her attention is Mr. Bingley, an eligible man who becomes their neighbor. Sure enough, he shortly becomes captivated by Jane, and everything seems on track for the two of them to become engaged. When there is interference from his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's family is thrown into turmoil.Mr. Darcy is almost universally disliked. He doesn't dance at the neighborhood balls. He doesn't engage in polite conversation or otherwise make himself seem social. After overhearing an unkind comment about herself from him, he loses any favor he might have had with Elizabeth. She goes out of her way to describe his odious nature to all who will listen. Despite his earliest impression of her, though, Mr. Darcy soon comes to find Elizabeth quite enthralling. What measures will he go to in order to change her mind and win her admiration?I liked the intertwining of lives in this story and some of the descriptions of what life was like living in the countryside back in the day. However, the story is limited by the time and style in which it was written. The plot drags along and the narrator spends far too much time dwelling on unemotional descriptions of scenery. I'm not sure if it was the intention of this story, but my strongest impression after reading it was that the life of those living in the upper class in England at this time had the most excruciatingly boring lives I can imagine. The characters in this story seemed constantly looking for anything to break the monotony of their day-to-day lives, and that impression didn't add much excitement to the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I understand that Pride and Prejudice is an honored classic. However, for me personally, I finally listened to myself and put the book away after reading about half of the story. The problem is that the characters are shallow and pretentious, and are simply not very likable or compelling. I think the novel, with all its gossipy nature, is the 1812 version of celebrity gossip television shows.I have read most of the English classics from the 1800s, including truly great romance novels such as Wuthering Heights or Tess of the D'UrberVilles, but sadly, found Pride and Prejudice to be boring and not worth my time. Full disclosure, as a middle-aged male, I may not actually be the target audience for the book. However, it should appeal to young women about the same age as the protagonists.Updated years later: Forced myself to finish reading the novel; I stick with my original \\"thumbs way down\\" assessment. The characters are all air-headed twits, shallow and stupid. A waste of my time, and I have no idea how it became a classic. Guys, this book is not for you - it is for young women."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story on how one family of five girls try to fall in love all in one year. Drama starts when the young Elizabeth Bennett crosses upon a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Darcy who soon falls madly in love with her. While thats going on, Elizabeths older sister, Jane has fallen in love with Mr. Bingley, the \\"new neighbor\\" in their town. This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion \\"love talk\\".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15. If you don't like romance novels, don't even dare to pick up this book.I still think Jane Austen is a good author.

Yes, it has a simple \\"nothing much happens\\" plot, but so do some of the best stories ever written. The storyline of P&P; gets 5 stars from me.But the book...while I love and deeply appreciate Austen's vivid imagination and deep understanding of human nature, her writing style is just plain boring. I think of it as Dickens-esque, back in the day when writers were paid by the word. Descriptive detail in a book, when properly used, enhances the story. And details that give background information can generate major interest and hold a reader's attention, again, if done properly. But dry descriptions, needlessly strewn in and testing the limits of patience, detract from the plot and feel of the book. No doubt in the early 19th century, when this book was written, people were fascinated by every last little word on the page -- after all, their lives were filled with the same tedium that fills the book.The adulation for this book reminds me of a sycophantic love-fest. It is \\"known\\" that this book is a paragon of English lit, and if you disagree with that opinion, you just don't \\"get\\" quality literature, or you aren't sophisticated/educated enough to appreciate it. Well, I definitely \\"get\\" it, and I'm not afraid to say that it was dull, and say furthermore that the book could have been cut in half and suffered no major losses.P&P; stands out for me, because it is the almost the only instance where I prefer the movie ('95 mini-series, anyway) version to the book. That never happens for me, normally the book is indescribably more satisfying than the screen, but this book is the notable exception. The mini-series distills down the storyline (which, again, I think is one of the best in English literature) to its heart, and whittles away everything that is superfluous until all that is left is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Sadly, the book falls short of imparting that level of satisfaction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"People who order this cassette should be wary!

I know you are all going to hate me, and never look at another one of my reviews, but honestly it is one of the few titles that I actually believe I liked the movie better. There, I said it. Maybe it is because modern screenwriters are able to present their attraction to each other better than Jane Austen could in 1800's. The movie is one of my favorites. I still get chills when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth she has bewitched him.

Mr Bennett is the epitome of patience, (a characteristic obviously developed by years of coping with his wife's &quot;poor nerves&quot;.) And Lizzie and the arrogant Mr Darcy?

And considering that I am a reasonably good-looking, tolerably clever, 30 years old Italian man, who doesn't see many chances of finding a girlfriend beacuse of his ill attitude... well, let me confess you that I am starting to feel a bit perplexed (and worried) about my future...

It was certainly, without a doubt the greatest piece of literature I have ever read, and I am an avid reader. In fact, I have read this book about 10 times, and I recommend this book to all my friends and to you because I did not like to read until I read the Jane Austen novels. After I read Pride and Prejudice, I realized that there are books out there that are worth reading for fun, and ever since, I have always been in the process of reading a book for fun, even in addition to the books I read for my high school classes. If I could give Pride and Prejudice more than 5 stars, I would. If you want to discover the joy of reading, there is no book that can better help you find it than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the first novel I had ever read by Jane Austen, and it certainly was not the last! The characters are humorous, and the story line is soooo romantic! I picked in seventh grade after my mother told me that I probably wouldn't enjoy it. I read it just to prove to her that I could, and now it is definitely one of my favorites. There were parts of the book that were long and confusing for me, but they were certainly overshadowed by all of the many exciting and romantic scenes! A must-read book! And after you finish this delightful novel, try another one of Austen's works, like Emma (my fave) or Persuasion. You will love them as well!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Just like Sense and Sensibility, I bought this for the amazing cover design, designed by talented letterer Jessica Hische.

That said, I think Pride and Prejudice is the best book she ever wrote. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent, and the story line flows with a sense of inevitability.

And what better way to do it than via Kindle?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, \\"then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.\\" the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!! if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am new to kindle books and found this book for free.

Finally I had the chance to read it and personally I am disgusted. I tried really hard to see what people love about the book. I cannot see it. There is no true love in the book, the characters are shallow and there is absolutely no story. It talks through the entire book of these five sisters marrying. I think that they are al pompous and rather annoying. I do have to say that Elizabeth is my favorite character as she doesn't seem to be as sucked in to the society nearly as much, but I do not see what there is in this book that has given it all the wonderful reviews. Though I do encourage all to reaad it and see for themselves what it is like. From the reviews people either LOVE it or HATE it there are no in-betweens.

And that is perfectly fine we are not all a like and have a right to our own views and opinions. Nevertheless, I must speak out and let my opinon be heard even though most of you who can't say enough about this book wouldn't want to hear.I am forced to read this book for my lit class and I find this book repulsive. I have never read such a novel that is completly incompetant, complete nonsence, the smallest talks of all the small talks in the world, it is about nothingness, and how several nothings trying and wanting to get married to other nothings for all the wrong reasons in the world. It is about people pretending to be inteligent and pretending to be civilized. It is a book where they compliment women as being handsome and men as being well...also handsome. It is quite contageous I might add because I find myself helplessly imatitating the language that it was written in. I am offended by every paragraph that I read. I have never felt such contemt for any work that I read. I pasionately despise this novel and I could write an entire paper on why. The 17th century English aristocracy and the way the people cary and behave themselves and think so highly of themselves and so low of anybody who is different, is offensive and without merit. You may think &quot;that I simply don't understand this work&quot; well I don't and I am not going pretend that I understand this &quot;classic&quot; Perhaps I am incapable of comprehending this novel. I do know however that there are a lot finer book writen in the 17th centuries and earlier and after, which are better, more meaningful then this book and are also classic but some of them are notoverated enough as much as this book is."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a classic. I decided to order it to add to my library. When I received the book, I realized it was unabridged meaning everything is a literal translation.

The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day. The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again. It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal. It doesn't surprise me that her original manuscript was rejected as it should have been and now I wonder to what extent politics played a role in her eventual success?

Elizabeth Bennett was ahead of her times, a lady who paled in the beauty of her sister. And I would love to meet someday a man like Fitzwilliam Darcy who can see through her lack of means and radiating sister to see the real woman whom he can truly love. And each of the five sisters represent a stereotype of women in literature in those days. The beautiful, the independent nurturer, the bookworm, the flirt, and the follower.

It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is, of course, a timeless classic. Beautifully written. I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function. (i.e., if you click on \\"Go to...\\" the \\"table of contents\\" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten \\"Popular Highlights\\" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and PrejudiceLove Jane Austen Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings.

Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though the language can be a challenge for me at times, I've ways loved this book!

I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it.

Am i the only person who thinks that were Elizabeth so intelligent then she must be able to look at things from both sides of the coin as the saying goes.

In other words, I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but in order to prepare I first purchased and read Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice sucks. Basically, it is extremely boring, even for a character-driven story. I consider myself an open minded person and I have read and enjoyed some character driven stories such as Jane Eyre, Crime and Punishment, and The Great Gatsby. With all of those books I could tell why the books were classsic; they had well developed characters who interacted in a way that was either entertaining enough, or had sufficient underlying philosophical or social subtext, that a person could read these books with a sense of interest.The problem with Pride and Prejudice is that it essentially seems to amount to a story about a fictionalized idealized version of herself as an intelligent somewhat socially unacceptable woman in the context of English upper class society who is able to tell people off in socially acceptable ways, be smarter than her sisters, and meet a grumpy, intelligent socially unacceptable man to marry. It is boring because it basically doesn't have any social commentary or philosophical suspect besides for \\"smart chix roxxorz\\" or perhaps \\"nerds for t3h win\\" and it is basically a self-referential story which continues ad nauseum. I cannot understand for a moment why Pride and Prejudice is considered a classic and not the literary equivalent of trashy internet fan fiction with a Mary Sue lead character. Actually, I recall reading somewhere that Charlotte Bronte basically panned Pride and Prejudice in a review as being boring as hell.I would recommend reading Jane Eyre over Pride and Prejudice because even though Jane Eyre is essentially another self referential fantasy about being a slightly socially awkward smart woman in the context of English society there are actual physical events that happen in the story that can somewhat hold your interest and actual entertaining fleshed out characters besides for the main character, whereas I get the feeling that Pride and Prejudice is basically a gripe about how everyone else is so shallow. If you're going to do that at least be entertaining about it like in The Great Gatsby. Trying to finish off Pride and Prejudice just caused me a lot of stress and pain and I had to force myself to keep reading. And I've read a lot of things in my lifetime that would bore most people into depression and somnolence.Actually my real recommendation for if you want a good piece of classic literature with developed characters, but you don't want to deal with the anemic pale flabby social dissatisfaction of a book like Pride and Prejudice, you should instead read something by Alexandre Dumas like The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers. Those books are written in a convoluted classical style (read it in French for extra points!), they have real characters, they have character interaction, but they're also event-driven rather than exclusively character-driven; actual physical events, rather than conversations at dinner parties, drive the story lines. The lead characters actually do things like engage in hand to hand combat, pilfer fine wines, and manipulate international politics, whereas the people in Pride and Prejudice just bad mouth each other at a dinner table. (Jane Austen doesn't even tell us what they're eating and drinking; at least Alexandre Dumas tells us how his heroes infiltrated no-man's-land and were taking fire but had brought a picnic basket with food and wine from a specific region and were having lunch and making fun of the enemy from behind cover.) And given how busy modern life is, do you really want to spend hours of your precious time reading about pale anemic English people bad mouthing each other over dinner over ridiculous inconsequential things, and not about musketeers taking fire while making snarky comments and knocking back wine? I mean, seriously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.BY Manuel Rosales"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is not about the book but about Amazon. I got a mail telling me it is a free download at 0.00 $, but then Amazon tries to pull 2.30 $ for this 'free' classic. Seems they need every cent now to survive the iPad threat."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen a great deal more than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".Elizabeth's sense of humor made her a much more interesting heroine in my opinion. She and her father seemed to enjoy a love for the absurd, although her mother's behavior did embarrass her. Other than that there are many parallels among the characters in the story: Elizabeth and Elinor, Lydia and Marianne, Jane and Mrs. Dashwood, Wickham and Willoughby.It still bothers me that all the women think about is finding a husband, that an \\"accomplished\\" woman \\"sang and played all day\\", but I have to assume that was the world Jane herself was exposed to at the time.You know that with a family that size and all those dinner parties, there had to be some people working very hard in that household, but they are barely ever mentioned and then only in brief passing and only in their concern for the family.Fifty years after these novels were published, we see books such as \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott depicting an American family. In this book the characters are much less one sided. Although some of the girls were still thinking primarily of finding husbands, they had to pitch in and help make the world around them.Another fifty years later, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L. M. Montgomery describes a young Canadian woman from a very different set of circumstances who puts the romantic side of life into perspective.Both Jo and Anne are charcters that I would encourage young girls to meet early in life. The Austen women in the books I've read so far, although they may be a study of women from a certain subsection of society in England at the time the novels are written, are not ones I'd place before my daughters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've watched the movie a few times and read the book twice, and I'm still as excited as the first time I read it! The characters are awesome, and I feel my heart all aflutter just like Elizabeth's when she finds herself in love with Mr. Darcy....*sigh*.A classic that can really never go out of style."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I think Jane Austen wrote a very good novel. I liked the characters in the novel and the plot. My favorite character in the novel was Elizabeth Bennet. I liked how she acted towards all the other characters with her quick wittedness and her cleverness. She was a very honest person who rose above her class bound society. She holds to what she thinks and believes in. For example in Chapter 3 she has a disliking toward the Bingley sister's, while Jane finds them &quot;charming&quot; Elizabeth still holds her feelings of dislike towards them.Another character I enjoys throughout the book was Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet was the only man in a house of six women. The women wore him out and all of them were very difficult to deal with. He would always give me a good laugh throughout the whole book by his sarcastic humor. I like him also because he reminded me of Elizabeth because of their quick-wittedness and also they were the two closest in the family since they were the two smartest. I thought the two of them were most close in Chapter 13.I enjoyed the novel's plot because of the girls and how they turned men down of proposals and the different down falls and happiness of all the girls' love lives. All the girls have disappointments and confusion with the men and people they love; yet not all of their situations work out the way some of the girls had hoped. Elizabeth holds strong and but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. Throughout all of the confusion, Jane and Elizabeth are happily married at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was forced to read &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; for a high school english class...but i immediately fell in love with it...it has everything from love, humor, stereotypes, and anything else bundles into one heartfelt, lovely story.

I have read Emma and Persuasion and loved them both, though not as well as Pride and Prejudice. You'll want to buy it so that you have it to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted to read Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice after a friend told me the book was so good. I bought a copy, and I can't say I was disappointed; this is a masterpiece. Austen did a really nice job talking about issues that you and I have trouble with--love, relationships, reputation, pride and prejudice of course--just to name a few. She did well tying in the love story with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy with all the other characters--even the most frivolous of characters had their part in the story.I really liked the fact that Austen developed the characters/story line between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwililam Darcy well. It is evident that the two were made for each other, but Elizabeth, after first bad impressions concerning Darcy and stories by Wickham, never noticed the true character of Darcy because of her predjudice (blindness) towards him. Darcy was just too full of himself until rejection by Elizabeth brings him back to his senses--not so proud now, are we? The roads to the happy ending were often bumpy, but Elizabeth and Darcy (along w/Bingley and Jane) arrived safe and sound, concluding the novel with a sweet ending. At times, the passages are really long/tedious, but in the end, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The chapter that I liked the best was chapter one because it talks about the Bennet family and describes how the mom (Mrs. Bennet) is really desperate for her daughters to marry a wealthy man. The reason that I liked chapter one is because it gives a brief opening about the book. It was important for the daughters to marry a wealthy man because they wanted to have a better economic status and be exposed to a better society.The literary device that I appreciated more was comedy. Comedy is a story that ends with a happy resolution of the conflicts faced by the main character. In many comedies the conflict is provided when a young couple who wish to marry are blocked by adults.I recommend this book for people that like to read books and are interested in how people were in the 19th century.I like the book because it tells us how families were in the 19th century. The reason that this is important to me is because we could see and compare cultures back then and how we are now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see Mrs. Bennett as an excruciatingly loud mother who lives only to search for husbands for her daughters. We can see Mrs. Bennett favors Jane as her first priority for finding a husband because she is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. One instance is when Mrs. Bennett found out Mr. Darcy was moving into a neighboring house. When she found out he was single, she automatically suggested/recommended Jane as a potential future wife. In contrast we start to see and understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense of his daughters. He doesn't critique his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50 because this story deals with the trouble girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, to which we can relate. The daughters were not that old, yet they were mature for their age. Teens will enjoy it because we all go through these teen stages of boys, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary device that was used in the story was analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. We are able to see their differences, but along with it their common interests start to show. For example, they both come from a different social background and yet are both intelligent, and have a tendency to judge harshly.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice, because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murder, but this story is nothing like this. It builds its own suspense through character's personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the early 19th century that reminds us of their rules and regulations that were used back then. For example women were just expected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a romantic novel which I absolutely recommend to readers. If one is able to comprehend a 19th century woman's role and priorities, entailment, and discover insights on characters within letters and situations, you will surely appreciate this novel. I would mostly recommend it to readers ages 16 and up.One of my favorite chapters was chapter 34. In this chapter Darcy declares to Elizabeth his love for her and proposes matrimony to her. He does this when his love for her is at a stage where he disregards all obstacles that kept him from doing this earlier. He also does it at a point where Elizabeth's anger towards him is at a crucial point.One of literary devices that I mostly appreciate was irony. For example, in chapter 34 Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being prideful while Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being prejudiced. Even though both characters have fault in pride and prejudice, I found it quite ironic how the reader may think that Darcy symbolizes pride while Elizabeth symbolizes prejudice. Yet these two characters are viewed in the opposite way, where Darcy symbolizes prejudice and Elizabeth pride.I really did like this book, mostly because it did not bore me. I hope other readers appreciate this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always wanted to read this book and I am sad to say that I was spurred into reading it because I wanted to read \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" and decided that to be fair to the humorous version of this book I should read the original.This was a very enjoyable book. It starts out a bit slow as Austen has to set up all the family relations. It takes a bit to keep all of the names thrown at you sorted out; it also takes a bit to get used to the manner of speaking used. There are many times when a characters is trying to say \\"no\\" but they take a whole paragraph of finely crafted language to do so.Despite the above; the language is clever and the story (after page 80 or so) is very engaging. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The plot has a lot of surprises and mis-direction and much attention is paid to characterization.It is not a quick read, you really have to pay attention to what you read. But for those who like victorian stories, this story should hit the mark. In fact this story seems to be what all the more recently written victorian fictions I have read are striving to be. Definitely a good read if these kind of humorous victorian romances are your thing; this is the original.Although I don't think I will be reading a ton more Jane Austen; I did find this to be an enteraining book. I am also looking forward to reading the spoof on it \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course Pride and Prejudice is fabulous in any form, but I do like this edition. Barnes and Noble Classics are hardcover with a nice dustjacket. Pages were a nice thickness, and what I especially liked, had that cool binding effect that makes it look like an older edition book where all the pages are different widths at the side."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which \\"so little\\" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels onThe Well-Educated Mind's reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,\\" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This has to be one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I love the characters who are all written exceptionally well. I love the language and Austen's style. I love the book.I've read it 4 times including the first, which was less than a year ago. Despite that, I still dislike reading certain scenes in public because they have me laughing or smiling like an idiot. At one point, I was reading, and I had to shut the book grinning like an idiot to walk around a lose some of my pent up energy.Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent character. But she has her flaws. She thinks highly of herself and her wit, and she forgets that even she can make a mistake. Jane is the kindest character in the book, and more gentle-hearted than anyone I know. But it works with her and I have no problems relating to her. Darcy is a proud, shy man who dislikes social situations. But he is caring, just, and thoughtful. Bingly is his exact opposite.I should probably stop describing the characters. But they are what make this book a classic. Jane Austen is a master of characterization. I can relate to them centuries later despite living in a completely different country and culture. Elizabeth and Darcy leave me grinning like an idiot and distracted for days after I am done reading the book. Obviously, it's why I'm posting this review nearly a week after I finished reading it for the fourth time in full!This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good romance, and even those who don't."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is considered a classic for a reason. Some books just stand the test of time, and this is one of them. Jane Austen has an impecable manner of getting to the core of human (and especially women's) emotions. The focal point of this novel would be not to judge a person at first glace. Their true character may surprise you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read quite a but, but this book is undeniably my favorite. I first picked it up my junior year of high school, and while the first couple chapters failed to capture my interest I decided to keep reading. I am SO glad I did, after a while I could not put it down.This book has just about everything- satire, reflections on women in society and family, wit, humor, romance, irony, constantly twisting and turning with surprises... the list goes on. Most of all, it just has this inexplicable quality that keeps you enraptured throughout the whole read.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The author takes us through life in the 1800's and the lifestyles filled with chivalry and of course, pride and prejudice. It was initially difficult to comprehend due to the older style of English writing. However, once you sit with this book for a couple of chapters, it's easy to get the hang of it. It's a page turner. This is the ultimate original chick lit. Beautifully written, young, whimsical, and provocative. Will remain one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After seeing a number of adaptations, I finally decided to read all ofAusten's novels. Northanger Abbey was not bad, and Sense and Sensibilityis excellent. However, this is the best so far. While there is a lot ofinsightful comment on the custom of English society of the time, anddiscussion of the character's motivation, the book just sparkles duringthe interchanges between them. While those between Elizabethand Mr. Darcy are justifiably famous, I would say that many of the othersare at the same level. My favorite are perhaps the interchanges betweenLady Catherine and Elizabeth. I am very much looking forward to readingthe remaining three completed novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a gorgeous little edition of Pride and Prejudice. The format is small enough to fit in a purse or pocket, but the writing is still clear to aging eyes. Ribbon marker.Makes a perfect gift, too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is an amazing author! I loved this book. I got a little frustrated with it sometimes, but I'm very glad I decided to keep reading it. Pride and Prejudice will always be a clasic. I plan on reading the rest of Jane Austen's books also. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with &quot;Once you get past . . .&quot; but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never before have I read a book as Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice. Honestly, I don't read much book but I'm glad that I read this one.Throughout the first and most of the second volumes, Eliza criticized Mr. Darcy for his conceited, haughty attitude. She berated him for being so snobby at the balls. Eliza made assumptions about Mr. Darct only using his appearance and brief conversations with him as her premise. She also believed rumors from absolute strangers (Mr. Wickham) that slandered Mr. Darcy's reputation. Any bad news that she could find even the most baised resource was a good enough for her, just as long as it intensified her hatred for Darcy. One of the greatest accusations she put against him was his acts of prejudce and his big pride. However, she had made these conclusions based on her own prejudce against Darcy. This is the irony. She was a hypocrite in her own way. She deserves equal censure for her pride and prejudice. Unfortunately she realized her defects at near end. It is not surprisng that hse feels horrible about her discovery of her true self. The irony in all of this is that she got so caught up in finding Darcy's evil that she became who she hated most. She became the vain and prejudced one. She became the enemy she loathed so much. As you can plainly see, this book had a lot of impact on me. It was really enriching to read and Austen's delicate use of language which integrates the formality of that time along with slight English humor. The amalgam of languages helped me develop an intense vocabulary. I learned a lot of new words and feel better about writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, truly shows what great books are made of. The novel revolves around a distressed mother desperately trying to marry her daughters off before her husband dies. As a result, some hilaroius mishaps and misunderstandings occur, turning the novel into a humorous love story. Its conclusion will leave you smiling for days. A great book for anyone interested in love and all its follies!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's novel, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, was a great novel written as a portrayal of what life was like in the eighteenth century in England. This amusing tale revolves around an embarassing couple, named the Bennets and their five daughters. The Bennets, were what I would consider to be one of the most disfunctional families in all of history. The book starts way back in time when women could do nothing but to marry well, and as one can see having five daughters was more a curse, than a blessing.In the beginning Mrs. Bennet starts off by telling her daughters to marry well. At the same time, a wealthy man moves close to Netherfield, the house that they live in. The oldest of the five daughters, Jane, falls in love with this man, whose name later turns out to be Charles Bingley. Charles falls in love with Jane, depite her family's strange ways. Mr. Bingley and his friend Darcy talk often of the Bennet sisters, and later Mr. Darcy falls in love with one of them... the oldest Elizabeth, but she unfortunately turns him down, even though she later begins to have some other feelings for him. Lydia, the youngest daughter elopes with a man named Mr. Wickham and the family is very upset about this action. Jane and Mr. Bingley are getting closer but his younger sister Caroline tries to break them apart.Jane Austen's novel reflects many ways of life, including both the good and the bad times, all while in the search for happiness. This novel's story almost reminds me of another classic called, Little Women, which surprisingly enough was not written by Austen, because it has the same type of story line."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read &quot;P&amp;P&quot; when i was very young and i enjoyed it but didnt understand much other than Lizzie Bennett was adorable. but i recently read it again and it was so wondeful, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story. what's amazing is that even thought the book was written in Regency England the characters seem so recognizable: the pompous sycophant Collins, the overbearing mom Mrs. Bennett, the dishonest charmer Wickham, and of course, the sometimes self-righteous, sometimes sharp-tongued, but always lovable Lizzie, who's just my favorite. Now that i have a boyfriend i can understand the relationship between lizzie and darcy much better: unlike today's soap operas, where people jump into bed within minutes of meeting, Austen recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing. it's just wondeful, the whole book, and i recommend all girls read if only to have a real role-model in Lizzie Bennett."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a love story that is slow developing, at least for Elizabeth Bennett. Because she is prejudice of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, she cannot see his fascination with her, nor can she see his true disposistion, which is delightfully uncovered over time. His fascination stems from her lack of desire to cater to his apparant haughtiness. She mistakes his shyness for rudeness and his disdainment for silliness as resentment towards others.And we musn't forget dear Mrs. Jane. Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They \\"went to town on business\\" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E; movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story. I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it. However, I was very mistaken! I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period. I loved it! I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E; movie kept, but no movie could ever compare! I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutley loved this book and had to keep reminding myself it was written ages ago. Apart from the dialogue, which was sometimes hard to understand, the story is timeless. Each character in this book was well developed and interesting. The twists and turns of the novel were well planned and thought out to keep the reader wanting more. I loved the setting of this book and Jane Austen's descriptions made you feel that you were there with them. This book is witty, charming, emotional and endearing. There is only one thing I didn't like about it...there wasn't a sequel. I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in a classic and a true romance.Bravo Jane Austen!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the first classic I've ever read and I really must credit Jane Austen for her wit. That's what got me sitting through the whole plot!The story is clear from the first chapter: Mrs. Bennet is trying for get her daughters married before her husband dies because since all five of her children are female, they won't get to inherit any of their father's money. Smart and sharp Elizabeth is the heroine in this book, and has a thing for judging people at a first meeting. It is not surprising that she developes an immediate annoyace for the arrogant Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy's friend falls madly in love with Elizabeth's sister Jane, who is astonishingly beautiful and shy.It's actually pretty boring to sit through the parties and dances, but there are some characters to keep us alive. Mrs. Bennet is one of the most comical characters ever; I can picture every one of her expressions when she is freaking out about her poor nerves. Lydia is flirtacious to the point of silliness. Mr. Collin's proposal to Elizabeth is so absurd,the seriousness of his stupidness and love for Lady Catherine de Bourgh is absolutely funny. Jane Austen has made her characters so lively and significant, you think you know them.Aside the fact that I've got a problem with Mr. Darcy being so rich and handsome (if I remember correctly), I liked this book. There are several turning points in this story, such as the letter that uncovers the charming officer into a man exploiting girls for money, and Elizabeth's sister eloping. I know Pride and Prejudice is incredibly old-fashioned, but that can't be helped. Try reading it at least."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading this book, my eyes have been opened to not only outward character but inner personality. Truly no other book has ever acheived international acclaim for so long. The reason is clear one of Jane Austen's best works, Pride and Prejudice has proven to contain the finest of elements which only contibutes to it's immortal relation of what happened during her days. Finally we have found a woman Shakespeare!!!A must read, for every literate."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has been considered a classic for many years and now that I've read it I definitely agree with its status. I read this book for a school project and did not expect much when I began reading. It was very difficult for me to get into the language and understand what was going on in the plot. I considered the book a bore until I was more than half way done reading it. I'm not sure at which point this transformation took place but I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and the plot. I wanted so badly for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together! I absolutely could not stop reading until I was done with the last page of the last chapter. Once I had finished I just sat there for a few minutes, reflecting on my experience with this book. My advice to readers who are struggling with the language is to keep reading! The challenge is part of the success you will feel when you finish the book. Jane Austen writes with beautiful imagery and has wonderful diction. This love story will touch you to the core. I am convinced that I will read Pride and Prejudice again, and in the second reading I will enjoy the first half of the book much more. I would say the ideal age to read this is college or older, at the youngest I would say a senior in high school. I urge you to read Pride and Prejudice and to let yourself appreciate Jane Austen's brilliant writing technique."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of my all-time favourites. It's Jane Austen's BEST literary work. This book revolves around 2 main characters- Elizabeth &amp; Darcy. Then there is Elizabeth's elder sister, &amp; her lover, Mr. Bingley. And then there are these other members of Elizabeth's family-Kitty, Lydia, Mary &amp; her mother, who are all silly &amp; superficial. Mr. Bennet (Elizabeth's father), feels Elizabeth is the only sensible one of the family. She certainly IS sensible, but not in love. When Mrs Bennet learns that Mr. Bingley &amp; his friend, Mr.Darcy have moved in Netherfield, she is overjoyed. After all, a bachelor with a huge fortune is always a target for matchmaking mamas. She schemes different ways to make Mr. Bingley fall in love with Jane, her eldest daughter. In the mean time, Elizabeth is busy antagonising with Mr. Darcy. But while all this is going on, a military regiment comes to town, &amp; the younger Bennets are busy flirting with the officers, the most popular of all being Mr.Wickham. After a few months of staying in Netherfeild, the Bingleys &amp; Mr. Darcy depart, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts. (the most important being Jane who really is in love with Mr.Bingley, but is no match for Mr.Bingley's sister,Caroline Bingley). After their departure, Mr Wickham discloses something about Mr.Darcy which makes everybody declare that they always knew him to a proud, selfish &amp; disagreeable man. Elizabeth, of course, believes him. Darcy, meanwhile realises that he has fallen in love with Elizabeth, but his pride is revolted by the very fact of marrying beneath himself. Whether he overcomes his pride &amp; proposes to her, what she does when he proposes, &amp; what happens after that, I'll allow to read it yourself. In the midst of all this lies the magnificent &amp; imposing figure of Lady Catherine de bourgh &amp; William Collins (also Elizabeth's cousin), who worships the very ground she walks on. This a VERY good book, &amp; the potrayal of the characters is so true, like its taken from real life. Take my advice..READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel of which I spent many a night, studiously reading, was a true masterpiece. The irony and satire with which Austen displayed the seventeenth-century society was beautifully mastered. The humor was impressive and understandable to the common reader. The relations, especially between Darcy and Lizzy kept the reader guessing about how their relationship would turn out. Thanks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is probably not Jane Austen's best book. That honor is reserved for \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper work. But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place. Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed. We can understand why Elizabeth is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters. We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred.

And yet they do not realize these books are classics because they relate so well. They may not know that some of today's hottest blockbusters are based on this story; the unlucky in love bridget jones was based on this eloquent novel. as was the bollywood hit Bride and Prejudice.This story is about the wit of a young woman, who is unable to fight for her position in society with anyone else. This story stands for the right-minded, showing how they can change everything around them with only a touch of cleverness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a charming and witty excursion through the trials and tribulations of a middle-class English family at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most of the action centers around a young spitfire named Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy), who, along with her four sisters and mother and father, is trying to negotiate the erratic fortunes of love and courtship amid the complexities of economics and social class.The independent and stubborn Lizzy meets the proud and very wealthy Mr. Darcy. His pride won't allow him to admit his feelings for her, and her adamant refusal to see his better qualities (her prejudice) stands in the way of their making a closer acquaintance. And so it goes for about three hundred pages -- but they are an intriguing three hundred pages of revelation, counter-revelation, comedy, and light suspense. However, to any experienced reader of romance novels, the ending will never seem much in doubt.Since Pride and Prejudice is a nineteenth-century romance novel, a prospective reader should bear in mind that the vocabulary and syntax reflect the time in which it was written. It has been called a seminal work and is standard fare in high school and college English courses; it certainly deserves that distinction. However, loading all this importance onto the book will constrain the casual reader from enjoying it as I imagine Jane Austen would have preferred -- a simple work of entertainment.The Oxford World's Classics edition includes a useful (but quite scholarly) introduction that provides the reader with a historical context for the novel and some background on Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is possibly one of the most beautifully written novels of all time. As one turns the pages of this timeless classic, she is brought into the wonderfully romantic world of Elizabeth Bennet and the rest of the so vividly depicted characters. One becomes familiar with the lavish mansions and picturesque countryside that envelope the setting of this novel, and at once becomes a part of the drama that surrounds the young women on whom the novel focuses.By far, my favorite character in Pride and Prejudice was Mr. Bennet. His quick wit and ability to survive in a household filled with marriage obsessed females are prime examples of the wonderful humor Austen brings to the novel. Another character I became quite fond of was Lizzy, for as a young female myself, I felt that the obstacles and tribulations she faced throughout the novel, especially the pressures put on her by her family and society, were timeless trials that all women go through.The turn of events in this magical novel leaves the reader both enthralled and ultimately satiated with the happy endings for the main characters. The plot is both unexpected and fulfilling at the same time, for Austen's writing is, at times, more gratifying for her characters than one could even devise in her own imagination. As the reader enters the world of the Bennets she gains a new perspective and appreciation of this era that lasts throughout the novel and leaves you thirsty for more at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun, character-driven novel. My favorite character was the father - he's a riot! Don't expect much to happen, but there's a lot going on. For example, it's an interesting study of British class differences at the turn of the century. Also, the options women had were much more limited than today and it made for very different relationship dynamics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now I, who sneered at Austen at the first, am planning on reading \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" over the summer. Austen, you have me converted!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have just finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the second time, and I liked it even more the second time around. (I daresay I might like it even more on a third or fourth reading.) Contrary to some of the reviews I've been reading, it's not just about five shallow young women trying to find husbands with the help of their annoying mother. Sure, some of the young women get married by the end, and the romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is very diverting, but that's not the whole point of the story. For the most part, it deals with the observations of the author, as well as those of Elizabeth and, on a smaller scale, Mr. Bennet. There is social commentary on the ideas of class that many people of that era held so dearly, and the way some of them behaved to get the results they desired, regardless of whom they hurt. Pride and Prejudice also pokes fun at human frailty and absurdity, which, I believe, crosses the boundaries of time. I found myself laughing out loud at some points at the behavior of the minor characters and how some of the major characters reacted to it. Most importantly, there is a lesson to be learned: how a good person can overcome his or her first impressions, his or her pride and prejudice, and get to know the real heart and soul of the person. As some other reviewers have said, the enjoyment of this novel is in the journey, not the ultimate ending.I think those who called it boring more likely found the slightly antiquated and verbose language a bit too difficult to follow. I will admit I was a bit daunted by it at the beginning, but once I got into the flow of the novel, I realized it wasn't that hard. One thing that really helped me get into the novel (which I highly recommend) was watching the excellent 1995 A&amp;E/BBC adaptation before reading it. By doing that, I knew what was going to happen and could pay more attention to the inner workings of the novel, the commentary. As I read, I found myself really enjoying the language (rather than hoping for a translator to appear) and wishing I could argue as eloquently as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy seemed to do.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a sharp, acerbic commentary on the absurdity of human nature, and I wish those who gave it one or two stars would give it another try."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"_Pride and Prejudice_ is the story of Elizabeth Bennett, one of my favorite heroines(I think that every strong heroine since must be based on her in some way), and Mr. Darcy, one of my favorite heroes(I've been in love with him since I first read the book). There are misunderstandings and scandals and very irksome supporting characters that you just want to strangle, but it's a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My measure of a superb novel is the ability to read it many times and be able to find something new or to see characters and occurences from a different perspective. This novel never disapoints. With each reading, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot have become more complex, funnier, and also sadder. Jane has become more than just a sweet girl pining for a lost love. Her passivity and inability to express her emotions seem a subtle warning to those of us who may share Jane's foibles. Elizabeth seems more self-conscious, more aware of her times, a woman's place, and the class system within which she must operate. Against this background she appears braver and wittier, her observations more trenchant. It would be hard to find a character as pompous and awful as Mr. Collins, yet he also elicits one's sympathy. And Mr. Darcy is wonderful in his rudeness and his smoldering desire. His haughty proposal to Elizabeth and her stinging reply are still hurtful. His subsequent letter is the opening gambit to the breaking down of Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice. These characters are so real and their emotions so true that the 150-plus years that separate us quickly disappear."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought this book was great. Not only is Elizabeth a strong main character, but the supporting characters make the book very enjoyable. They are so funny; especially the mother. I couldn't put it down. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must confess up front that I am a sucker of love stories. As such, Pride and Prejudice had me hook, line, and sinker from the beginning, turning page after page to find out if Elizabeth, the heroine, would find happiness in the end.A female friend of mine recommended the book to me (as did my girlfriend) with the caveat that most guys she knew complained that &quot;nothing happened&quot; in it. Needless to say, if you're looking for action and intrigue, look elsewhere. There is some little intrigue in Pride and Prejudice, but the heroine(s) play a strictly passive role. All the excitement in the novel stems from the suspense of the Bennet sisters' romances.Another minor caveat: I was initially slightly distracted by Austen's style of writing, which sometimes seems a bit distant from the action of the narrative (at least to someone more accustomed to more modern works).However, I feel that this hardly detracts from what recommends Pride and Prejudice the most (and what all love stories require): interesting characters to whom the reader can become emotionally attached and believable obstacles to their deserved happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a true English masterpiece. Not only is it magical,funny and sensitive. Austen also manages to entice you into her world. She creates the most perfect hero in Mr Darcy, a man willing to do anything to be with the woman he loves, even if it means having to stand Mrs Bennet as his mother-in-law. With Elizabeth, Austen manages to create a heroine who could easily be envied in both the nineteeth and twentieth just for her wit, intelligence and her honesty. Do not judge this book before reading it as a girly, old and an out dated piece that your English teacher rambles on about. It really does make you realise that there was life so long ago, and people have not really changed that much."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics I have ever read. The story of five young daughter's lovelives, along with their impertinent mother and lovable but sarcastic father, it is definitely a good read. The plot picks up as the book progresses, leaving the reader striving to know one thing: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy realize their profound love for one another and finally get together? I definitly reccomend reading this book. Try it, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must be honest and say that I had a prejudice against the book. I never thought that I would ever enjoy such a novel. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had charisma and charm and the tale holds a universal theme that can be understood despite the decades. I throughly enjoyed this book. A classic, timeless, and amazing piece of literature, I have the utmost regards for this novel. It was a spectacular piece of work that I cannot say enough about. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel took me completely by surprise. I had seen the movies &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and I decided to give this one a chance. It is by far, one of the best romance novels I've ever read. It is old-style romance, and yet the language and the feelings of Elizabeth Bennet truly capture every essence of what a woman feels when encountered with different situations. Although we see everything mostly through the eyes of Lizzy, a person cannot help to admire Jane Austen's ability to let your imagination be transported, momentarily, to a world where human beings are not so evil after all, and love is worth more than what is portrayed today in the media. Although the movie is very accurate, I would strongly encourage everyone to read this novel. If it is, indeed, Jane Austen's best work, it is absolutely worth every penny. Let yourself be absorbed into this magnificent story of all-time, and don't be surprised if by the end of it you feel like reading it all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous &quot;friend&quot;... or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred up until that point... To any such persons (and several more), Austen's novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true. As in most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!) getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course, the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Overall, this novel was a good read. However, it lulled in many places and a lot of determination was required to finish this novel. I am pleased I did though, as the ending was very well written and the portrayal of characters by Austen (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) were very captivating - but not on a level with Dickens.As I suggested to a friend, this novel is a classic, by all means read it. However, don't be in a hurry to do so and if you never get round to it, oh well!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the \\"plot.\\" The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the entire thing. I can't even explain why. The characters were flat. The plot was predictable. The writing didn't really stand out. I still read it all the way through, so I guess that counts for something."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am sorry, I know that this book is loved by millions and I should love it; but, I do not. I just could not get into it. It is so bland that I could not even finish. Thank the stars for cliff notes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane AustinPride and Prejudice by Jane Austin was first published in 1813 by T. Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart, quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn, selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.Have you ever been on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character. Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. The plot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money. Either way, reputation really matters in this book.All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away. While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerve after a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice. I'll start with the good: the writing is fantastic. I can't argue with that...I love the language. You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated. In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story. I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano. It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love. It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" got together in the end seemed so forced. I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice. I guess a book about a bunch of women trying to find husbands doesn't interest me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I haven't read the book yet but what I wanna say is the book is too new and they were in a hurry of making or cutting this book which is result unsqare or imperfect cut.The letters don't look straight and lean to the right then left when you turn to the next page. It's quite funny and make me a little unhappy about it.Anyhow, I'm sure the story is as sweet as it has been. But next time, check your book shape!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a thread of ammunition in today's literary cannon. Being that it is, I felt I should read it. The plot in the book is very straight forward. Having been produced in the 19th century and entailing the reader with a striking and classic love scenario gives it historical leverage. What other 19th century novel can intertwine social class, love, and crazy parents?Austen's portrayal of social class played a responsibility in the novels greatness. Binding social class and love conveyed it to the current time. I especially enjoyed when the book started to occlude and Elizabeth was confronted by Lady Catherine regarding her love for Mr. Darcy. That moment was significant because it showed that social class does not dignify a person's love. Imagine you were teaching this tale to high school students: They could feed off of it in so many ways.I will admit that this work of fiction was complex at times, but the more I asked questions, the easier it was to understand. I watched the movie (2006 version) after I finished the book. Everything that I had envisioned the book to be about was correlated directly in the movie. The benefit of watching the movie was that it sufficed some of the minimal elements in Austen's book I was unsure of. I may read this book again, and if I do I would like to have a group to read it with. It always helps to talk out-loud distinguished novels like Pride and Prejudice so readers can pin-point missed segments and unlock blocked thoughts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a pleasant classic with a wonderful story. The book was at times difficult to understand; however, I especially enjoyed the mother character."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the book that I chose for my amazon.com report. I liked the book a lot more then I expected myself to. I think that it is a book that should be required to be read in one point or another in the sixth grade. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, New American Library, 1989. I gave the book a five star rating because it teaches you what love is and what it was like for the people back then. For them to fall in love with one another and have all the regulations and rules. It was probably hard for them. Everywhere in this book is love. Whether it is from mother to father or from daughter to mother or father.In this book a family of seven welcomes Mr. Darcy. He is a very rich and hasome man. Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet try constantly to get one of his five daughters to marry Mr. Darcy, but Elizabeth has other plans. For she is in love with Mr. Wickham. It turns out that Mr.Wickham is in love with Elizabeth. They begin dating and cannot stand a single day without each other, so they decide that they should get married and soon they become engaged. But then Elizabeth realizes that she does not love him anymore. She soon comes to a conclusion of why. She loves Mr. Collins.I am not going to give away a good ending because it is so exciting, but they all live happily ever after. Meanwhile Mr. Darcy is having trouble choosing who to marry. I will not spill the beans on who he decides to marry because I would write too much and then it might give all of it away. The other three girls do find their true love and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are happy because their daughters are happy.My opinion of this book is wonderful and outrageous. I think that this book is just like Jane Austen said, \\" it is like your own darling child.\\" Her version of this book has made me want to read more of her books because I think that they will be somewhat like Pride and Prejudice but I would never know till I read another one of her books. I also agree with the old saying, \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" because I picked up this book and said, \\"This does not look like something I would want to read.\\" I read it and said, \\"WOW! This was a really excellent book.\\"I think that the theme is a very important thing when you are trying to rate a book because basically it is what the book taught you about life. So the theme for Pride and Prejudice was that no matter how much you love someone you can't possibly be satisfied unless they love you back, and that love has no boundries. You can love someone and they can love you but you will still love that person no matter what happens. Even if that person leaves or passes away you will still love but you won't know it because it is just from the bottom of your heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,\\"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\"I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is known to be one of the greatest classic female novelists. Her stories contain strong heroines, who rebel against societal norms in order to achieve their full potential as women. Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most well-known work, does not fail to contain this familiar element of Austen's writings.The novel follows the story of the Bennet sisters, primarily the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth, and their misadventures in love. Jane is the sweet-tempered, docile, and beautiful daughter, making her Mrs. Bennet's favorite. On the other hand, Elizabeth is independent, hot-headed and sarcastic, making her Mr. Bennet's favorite. Mrs. Bennet's main focus in life is to have her five daughters married to wealthy men so Mrs. Bennet can live a life in comfort.When wealthy Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy move in to Netherfield, the estate next to that of Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet is elated at the possibility of at least one of her daughters marrying one of the men. Mr. Bingley is almost instantly taken with the innocent Jane, while Mr. Darcy manages to insult Elizabeth within moments of meeting her. This starts the rocky relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Blinded by pride and prejudice, both parties must face hurt and heartbreak before finally receiving their happily ever after.Despite strong characterization, especially of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice does not make my list of favorite books. The story is flat, with no interesting plot elements outside of the occasional use of verbal irony for some humor. As it is a romantic comedy, it is predictable and lacks the depth of most great classic novelists such as Dumas, Dickens, and Leroux.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted easy-read. However, if looking for a book that is engaging, it might be best to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Appropriate for children, this book has excitement, history, and christian thinking in the ways of social behavior. Safe for reading , I think a parent should read it first to clear it for their children, but it can be a good novel for children to read.Pride and Prejudice (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There's not much point to reviewing a classic like P&P--I've read it 16 times and found more to admire each time. But I've always wondered about the \\"songs\\" (Chapter 6) that Lizzy performs before giving way to her dull sister Mary. Was she really singing? I guess not, since the subsequent refs are to the instrument. During the time of P&P's writing and for a few years thereafter the English Scarlatti cult was in full swing, so the CD \\"Scarlatti as chosen by Clementi\\" is worth while listening for hardcore JA authenticity fans. Clementi was associated with the Broadwood piano manufacturers and the album contains pieces chosen from Clementi's influential English edition of 1791. Emilia Fadini plays these pieces on an English c. 1800 repro piano with some fire--I can easily imagine Elizabeth wowing Darcy and the crowd with K 381 (track #3).

This is my all time favorite, I have read it several times in just a few months."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If this book needs a recommendation, it would be that it has been delighting readers for almost 200 years. In Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen has created the quintessential spunky heroine who refuses to let her somewhat low position on the social ladder dictate her behavior. Her mother is determined to marry off her five daughters to the highest bidders, but Elizabeth refuses to look for a marriage of financial convenience. She is hopeful that her sister Jane will marry the amiable Mr. Bingley, but she has no real matrimonial ambitions for herself. She has a particular disdain for Mr. Darcy, from which comes the \\"prejudice\\" of the title. He is a prideful man, thus supplying the other half of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The language of the book is, of course, quite different from modern-day phraseology, but it's worth plowing through the conversations of manners and morals to uncover the delightful story of this star-crossed duo. May it continue to delight readers for the next 200 years!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel grabs you so hard that you just want to know what is going to happen next and why is Darcy and Elizabeth acting this way, what is the deal with all this pride and the prejudice?Even though that their life style in the novel in general does not seem very exciting like our present life style; however I think they were much more sophisticated than we are; they all read, write letters hence mastered the art of writing, and they all can play the piano! nice. in short, the novel is brilliant! that is it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Read this, and then re-read this. You will see elements to most every romance novel, play and movie produced since this work was published.

The book was free (amazing) and works splendidly across my non-Kindle devices, my iPod touch and my Blackberry. That way, I can sneak 10-15 mins worth of reading in on the train or bus without worrying about people making judgements about a man reading Austen.The test of a classic novel is whether or not you want to keep it handy and refer to it when you need inspiration, a solid read or just to get lost in a different world. Thanks to the Kindle edition of Pride and Prejudice, I can pretend I'm in the world of Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Before I read this book I saw the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel. Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel. Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors. She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think. Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is an incredibly talented author and although I do love her other books, I do believe that Pride and Prejudice is her best work. I am one of those individuals who thoroughly enjoys reading great literature from around the world but to be completely honest, I had never read this book until after the new movie was released a couple years ago. After falling in love with the film, I went out immediately to purchase the novel and upon completion, Jane Austen \\"bewitched me body and soul\\" (as Mr. Darcy would say).Elizabeth Bennett remains to be one of the most complex, interesting, and relatable characters I have ever read. She encompasses all the alluring qualities a respectable lady was supposed to possess from that time era but additionally, many rebellious attributes that links her personality and inner battle with personal feelings vs. societal conventions, to modern day. She knows the place of women in the community- how they should talk, interact in society, her social standing, especially in relation to men, however, she also struggles with ideologies of romance and being her own individual- speaking her mind, voicing her opinions- no matter if it is Lady Catherine or her best friend Charlotte, as well as denying reputable marriage proposals for the hope of finding true love.Pride and Prejudice is not just an enrapturing love story but really transports you into a time period that is much different from today's world. It gives you insight into a completely different lifestyle, exposes the flaws and obsessions of a culture, and most importantly, it is all done so from a revolutionary point of view- the perspective of a woman who doesn't necessarily agree with the rules of societal acceptability.It is a great book and I whole-heartedly recommend reading it. And it only gets better each time you read it. I guarantee you too will fall in love with all the characters of Pride and Prejudice. If Lizzy or Mr. Darcy don't satisfy your need for a personal connection, I'm sure you can identify with the many other colorful characters- the deceiving, selfish, yet undeniably charming Mr. Wickham, the benevolent and kind spirited Jane Bennett, the frivolous Lydia Bennett, or even the middle child Mary Bennett, who even though is most accomplish, often goes unnoticed and under appreciated.

What I can do, however, is give an honest and heartfelt account of what I thought of Jane Austen's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE'. I have always wanted to read some of the classics but have never up until now dug up the courage to actually do so. I thought if I was going to start reading a classic novel Jane Austen would probably be a good author to start with and what better choice was there than her stand out 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' ? I was pleased to find out that I was absolutely right. 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' has to be one of the most romantic novels that I have ever read. The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy literally made me swoon quite often (and I don't swoon!). Romance mixed with a little bit of drama and Austen's most descriptive prose made it impossible for me to put this book down. Now I see why 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' is on so many people's favorites list because now it is most certainly on mine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can imagine that Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy) is Jane Austen herself, couldn't you?Jane Austen is a wonderful writer. She deserves much praise. With extraordinary insight into feelings and actions of characters. She does a good job of making each character distinct and well defined. The Bantam Classic edition of all of the classics is much better then the Barnes and Noble version.You must read this book even if it's but only for once (even thought there may be a possibility of you may not liking it) to give credit to what I consider a historic acknowledgement to a female writer.

I read at night before bed... and there were some nights I stayed up until 4 reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No piece of literature explores the turbulent journey of a young courtship better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The novel centers around Mrs. Bennet's feverish efforts to marry off her five daughters to the wealthiest and most well-suited men as possible. Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the story and the second eldest Bennet daughter is a truly genuine, captivating, and refreshing character. In the novel Elizabeth encounters the most horrible creature of a man named Mr. Darcy. His haughtiness is outweighed only by his pride. On the flipside, however, Darcy is extremely attractive and wealthy to boot. The odds are definitely against these two throughout the book-especially because of disapproving family members and some ill-timed, hurtful comments. The reader's biggest question throughout is, will it work out for these star-crossed lovers? Sharp, well-developed characters and a beautifully woven plot coincide resulting in nothing but greatness. The 19th century-clad and somewhat frilly language could be considered tedious to some readers, but I believe it completes the effect of the novel. Subtle, witty dialogue constantly adds intrigue and humor. This novel guides the reader through the ups and downs of a love story with wonderful class and style. To say Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and a great work of art would be an understatement."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\"When first hearing the title Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen one might think that it would be another dull romantic book written ages ago. When in reality, Pride and Prejudice is a book that I could say I have actually enjoyed so much that I have read it myself several times. Pride and Prejudice is the type of book that draws the reader in deeper with each chapter, giving you new characters and personalities to make the book so compelling.The book starts off with a family known as the Bennets who have five daughters all with intentions of marrying to a young man with good fortune, except for one. That one is Elizabeth Bennet who wants to marry for love or to retire an old maid. It causes a great stir when a young man of great fortune, Mr. Bingly, has just bought a large estate in Loungbourn. This brings high hopes for Mrs. Bennet who has intentions of one of her daughters to catch his eye and to marry him. With surprise and great excitement Mrs. Bennet later finds out through gossip that Mr. Bingly has a friend whom makes twice as much as Bingly, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingly very quickly notices the eldest daughter of the Bennets, Jane. Mr. Darcy on the contrary refuses to dance with Elizabeth at their first meeting. In return this shocks Elizabeth of how someone could be that proud and that sets her opinion of him very low. Elizabeth reassures herself that this opinion of him could never change, but what if she is mistaken?Throughout the book Jane Austen never lightens up or falls short of her humor. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have many amusing conversations about how she believes he is proud and how he believes she is prejudice. This classic book will always remain one of my favorite books with the distinctive way Jane Austen writes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book to meet page requirements for my sophomore English class.

The story is based on the Bennet family, which consists of a mother, a father, and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is a country squire who is not very wealthy. Mrs. Bennet is a house wife and her goal throughout the book is to marry her daughters off to wealthy gentlemen. The main plot of the story is molded around Jane Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet finding their husbands, through both 'trials and tribulations.' Jane marries the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth marries the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy.Jane Austin did a wonderful job of writing Pride and Prejudice. She wrote so that you could feel the love that Jane was feeling, and you could feel the hate that Elizabeth felt. She also wrote descriptively so you could imagine the storm that Jane went through, and you could see the gorgeous house that Mr. Bingley lived in. Whenever I read this book I wished I had admirers like Mr. Bingley. I must admit that while the book had a happy ending, it made me sad because I wanted to be in Jane and Elizabeth's shoes.When I think of classic books, I think of stuffy old libraries where stuffy old people go to read books that were written back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Reading this book made me realize that these old stuffy books are called classics for a reason.This book was not a boring read! I am the sort of person who loves to watch and read teen stories. You know, the stories where the guy and the girl meet each other and fall in love. Jane Austin did a great job of keeping my attention. Reading the book mixed up the same emotions as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook did in \\"She's All That.\\"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that everyone that believes in love should read.

None of her novels were required in high school, no literature class that I took in college used any as a text, and I had never thought to pursue her for sheer entertainment. It is quite sad, actually, for I find Austen much more accessible than some of the classic that I did have to wade through, including Wuthering Heights and The Scarlet Letter. Austen has recently seen a resurgence in popularity, likely due to the recent BBC and Hollywood adaptations of her books, including the Emma Thompson vehicle Sense and Sensibility.Pride and Prejudice was Austen's second novel, following the success of Sense and Sensibility. Its original title was--and I'm not making this up a la Dave Barry--First Impressions. To my taste, this would have been a much more apt title, but it had been used by another author before Austen could get this book in print. The story is about the five Bennet sisters, who, while not orphaned or penniless, have few choices as to husbands because their father's estate is entailed on a male heir, and they have no brother. The father seems to have resigned them to their fate, but their mother wastes no opportunity to arrange a good match for her daughters. The two oldest--Jane and Elizabeth--are level-headed and quite understand the position that they are in, but the youngest three are flirtatious and giddy, a bad combination in winning society's eye. Disasters ensue when eligible bachelors Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to town, as well as the officers of the ---shire regiment.The reason First Impressions would have been a better title is that each character--not just the main two, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy--is constantly assuming things about other characters based on their initial reception of them. Mr. Darcy, in the country, is too proud to dance with any of the young women because of his mistaken impression that they are all declasse; Elizabeth forms her prejudices about Mr. Darcy because of her first meeting with him and this dance snub. The townsfolk think the best of Mr. Wickham because his first impression on everyone is quite favorable. And on and on and on.Very interesting, but it goes on forever, as the characters can never be quite direct given the mores of the time. That does not mean that they can not be insulting, as a particularly vicious exchange between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth shows. I'm glad that I have now broken my Austen fast, but I think that I can wait awhile before digesting any more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet girls are having a problem with primogeniture.

Since there are five girls and no men there cousin Mr.Collin's gets to inherit the estate. Mrs.Bennet takes it apon herself to find gossip on all the men in the town that are making a reasonable amout of money and hook them up with one of her daughters. This continues on thoughout the movie. Mrs.Bennet and all of the Bennet daughters get tangled up with all of the gossip and mishap,and this complicates everyones lives.Towards the middle of the movie one of the Bennet daughters(Jane) gets introduced to one of the wealthies men in the town, his name is Mr.Charles Bingley. Mr. Bingley has his eye set on her and they begin to like each other. Mr.Bingley's best friend Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy also takes a liking for one on the Bennet daughters(lizzy). Mr.Darcy is hard headed and does not show his liking for lizzy at first. He is rude and does not show much respect for her, in lizzy's eyes. Mr.Darcy is jelous of something and tries to break Mr.Bingly and Jane up. This creates lizzy to have more dislike for Mr.Darcy.The actors that were chosen to play in this movie were very perfect. They understood and comprehended what they had to do and did the job quite perfectly. I really admired how well the plot and characters where chosen. The scene designers and director chose the perfect places to shot the movie. I liked how the two wealthies men's estates in Pemberly and Netherfield Park were placed. This made it seem very realistic. I would defintley recommend this movie to others. It kept you wondering thoughtout the whole movie whether or not Mr.Darcy and lizzy , and Mr.Bingly and jane were going to get together. I feel it was more a chick flick,but would also suggest it to males as well. It might teach them a thing or two on how to approace a woman, and make them feel wanted and loved dispite what others say.Throughout this movie &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a really wonderful message. I feel the message was not to give up hope and try to persue your dreams. If something was ment to be it will always work out at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My sister's been raving about this book for years. It's not until months ago did I have the guts to pick it up. It's been sitting in my mini-library since I got it too... Then my sister once again kept asking &quot;Have you read 'it' yet?&quot; So, to stop this question from coming up in every turn, I decided to read it. I honestly expected this book to bore me to death considering the author is from the late 17th century. What fun could a writer be of that time, huh? Oh not to mention, the author was unmarried. What does she know about romance, right? Well, I was mistaken. I enjoyed this book sooo much, I ordered the DVD movie of it. There was some &quot;slow&quot; moments in this book however, I think it's the over-description of everything. But once you got through that, the book flows with lots of humor and intensity. I liked Elizabeth from the start. Mr. Darcy was kindda hard to like in the beginning but as soon as the book progress, you would love him and would want him for your own :-) The Dialogue in this book was my favorite of all. Uppity, Humorous, Lyrical, Heart warmer and truly of its time.I have read more than 80 historical romance novels in this year alone and I honestly think most of the ideas and formulas (marriage mart) were derived from this book (did i dare say that?). I couldn't believe this book was actually written at that time period. Amazing! Truly Classic at its best."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE was the first Jane Austen novel I read. I'm currently working on SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.

I definitely recommend it, though."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit, I saw the mini-series before I read the book, but the book was still good. Jane Austen is a wonderful storyteller. The only problem I had was with some of the lengthy description in the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE was the first book I downloaded onto my Kindle. How is it possible that this adorable, timeless love story is now almost 200 years old? I read this book while in high school and could not admit to anyone how much I loved it. There weren't a lot of Jane Austen book clubs for high school boys back then and white-bread suburbia did not lend itself to those types of disclosures. However, reading it and EMMA and JANE EYRE and Dickens spoiled me forever for good storytelling. To this day, I am drawn to novels of eternal themes: love, sex, family and friends. I don't mean to trivialize Jane Austen with my pithy Candace Bushnell nod, but Pride and Prejudice has all of the intrigue and sex and love of Sex and the City--we just can't see it. And, let's face it--Big is Darcy. . .200 years later. . .\\"abso--f'in--lutely.\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was surprised by how much i liked this book. Jane Austen's style is very original in its own way. Although it's way too gossipy and cheesy, the story was well thought out"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I was in fourth grade I picked up this book as a christmas present from my teacher. I still to this day cannot believe I chose this over \\"The Neverending Story\\", which I still haven't read but seems more down my alley. I got to page 50, then stopped. I can't imagine I understood most of that as a fourth grader, but anyway a few weeks ago I found it along with a few other adbandoned books from my elementary years. Now, as a 7th grader and a hopeless romantic devoloped through the years, I figured I could give it a shot, though my expectations weren't high. Well. This book was very good. I have to say I oly got up to page 110, I think, but what I have read was fantasticly (sp?) written. However, I'm more of a sci-fci, fantasy, adventure kind of reader, preferring classics like Black Beauty (did I mention horse nut?) and Watership Down, though I don't kow if that's considered a classic... Anyway, I also don't think I understood it as well as I could have and I seriously did not want to blemish my idea of this book, so I ould strt fresh in maybe another year or two. Who knows, maybe I'll even give it another go before 7th grade ends! But I'd like to say, if you're an older reader who can understand this sort of thing well, you can put up with a slow start, and enjoy classic works then this is the book for you! Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I will not make this a lengthy review, as there are many here already, but I will say that Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read. It is an amazing piece of literature, and I never cease to be amazed how many people can call it boring. For a story where surprisingly little actually does happen, with each read I cannot put it down. Each time I wonder if Mr. Darcy will be able to capture Elizabeth's heart, and I am always tickled when he does. I still get as choked up, and laugh just as much as I did the first time. Even compared to Austen's other brilliant works, I find Pride and Prejudice far superior.I also beg all lovers of its adaptations to actually read the novel itself. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been looking for books on CD (long drive to work) and thought I would try this abridged version of Pride and Prejudice. I happen to love Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic novel. However, this abridged version lacked some of the best aspects of the original story. They cut it down to 3 hours (can't be helped, I guess) and, therefore, the story really only deals with Elizabeth, Jane being a mere afterthought. The other sisters are barely mentioned. I am looking forward to when someone realizes that there are customers out there with CD players in their cars and they would like to hear the UNABRIDGED version of popular and classic books. I also felt that Jenny Agutter did not distinguish that well between characters, Mr. Bennett sounded just like Lady Catherine. I have listened to Sense and Sensibility with Juliet Stevenson and the difference between these 2 readers is amazing. You are really able to appreciate the acting skills of Ms. Stevenson versus Ms. Agutter on these CD's."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition.... Though observing it's low prince, I should have had more or less clue about the quality of the book... Once again I confirm that nobody argues about the novel which is really remarkable piece of work..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"She must have watched it close to 10 times since I got this for her. Something about that Mr Darcy. Anyway, I've never seen it but if you want to make your girlfriend/wife happy, get them this movie."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit I have heard of this book but never thought it would be interesting since the language was not easy. In general all classic novels are not easy. However, ever since I saw the movie, I couldn't help wonder what screenwriter has omitted from the original book. I decide to buy the book. To my surprise, I kept reading on. Usually when I read a book, I read a couple of pages then something came up. I never went back to finish the book. This book is different. The desire to know more about Elizabeth Bennet who was played by Kiera Knightly and Mr Darcy kept me going. During my lunch time at work, I read. At home, I would read until 3 or 4 am. Once I reached the end of the book, I wished Jane Austen had written the sequel. It's the most enduring romantic novels. Wished I was Elizabeth being admired by a rich noble guy like Mr Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The best story I have every read! And I have read it several times. And it never gets dull. This should be a mandatory read for everyone! It makes you wish you could have lived in that time period. For me personally, this was the best of Jane Austin's novels. Although, I believe they are all 5 stars, this one is my favorite. Oh, if only I could be Mrs. Fitzwilliam Darcy......"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For those who are able to set aside their modern-day literature expectations and experiences, reading Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful, even riveting experience. I admit that if I had been assigned this novel in high school or college, reading it would have been an ordeal and I would have cursed the teacher or professor all the way through. Maybe it's my relatively advanced age or the fact that I just saw the movie that caused my mind to open and made Pride and Prejudice difficult to put down and exhilarating to read. Besides the seemingly stilted language of the period, Austen leaves much, including emotions and dialogue, to the imagination. The former lessens more and more as the pages go by and the latter actually makes the story more sensual and exciting. I found myself rereading chapters for the sheer enjoyment of trying to get in the minds of Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Collins and all the others. The characters are unforgetable and I will revisit them from time to time during the rest of my life. Today Pride and Prejudice definitely makes my top ten list of novels to take to a desert island."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It will bring out the hopeful romantic in anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just finished reading pride and Prejudice and I loved it! I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading it, but before long I was completely transported into the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The language is so beautiful throughout the book, and although I found it a bit awkward to read at first I quickly adjusted to it. I can easily see why this book is considered a classic and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a great example of life in late 18th century England that depicts the struggles of women competing in a society dominated by men. Her main character, Elizabeth Bennet, portrays an independent, headstrong women acting out against her duty as a woman to get married in a time where men are the dominant sex. Her eventual love with Mr. Darcy creates a novel that is both humerous and romantic. I highly reccomend reading this classic novel by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this book my senior year in High School and I was afraid that it would be a boring, long read. But I was so wrong! It's an amazing story of...well pride and prejudice! Jane Austen is very witty and I found myself laughing and sighing and worrying as I read. Elizabeth is a wonderful heroine that you find yourself relating to and wishing to be! What a life those young women must have led! And Darcy, well I fell in love with him immediately. You can't get any better than Darcy when looking for a man who would do anything to protect and help you. I loved reading about the cynical Miss Bingley and her sister; silly Lydia and Kitty; obnoxious Mrs. Bennet; and hilarious Mr. Collins. This book is my favorite classic! I strongly recommend reading it BEFORE watching the movie!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read many, many novels including all of Jane Austen's; and still there is nothing to compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is unquestionably my favorite novel of all time, and what I consider to be the 'perfect novel.'and I've decided to break down the aspects that I think make it so.The Characters:Elizabeth Bennet is my favorite literary heroine of all time, for the simple reasons that she is probably the most consistent, well-rounded character that I have ever come across. Not to mention that she is extremely likable. Mr. Darcy, though not a very intricate character compared to Elizabeth, is undeniably well thought out, and perfectly drawn. But, for anyone who has read this(I think I can speak for just about everyone)there are three particular characters that are memorable, and even lovable, just for their perfectly delightful absurdity; Namely Mrs. Bennet whose \\"sole object in life was to get her daughters married; and it's solace was visiting and news.\\" Then there is Mr. bennet's pompous cousin Mr. Collins, whose proposal to Elizabeth is one of the best scenes in the book. Finally, there is Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy's haughty Aunt, whose class consciousness, and condescending airs are wonderful!The Plot:A simple love story, and a Cinderella story at that. Though there is no really important issues covered, no intellectual depth to fathom, it remains one of my favorite plots, becuase it flows so easily, there is no awkwardness, is tied together so well in the end; there is nothing I would ever dream of changing.The Diolouge:This is it's absolutely flawless point; the diolouge is perfect; perfect and consistent with each character, it moves the story along, and charms the reader non-stop.Language:Who can resist a novel that makes frequent use of the words:folly, felicity, ductility, oddity, and every other charming \\"ity\\" Austen uses.I really can say nothing else. I have read this book so many times I have so many different perspectives, so many opinions on it, have so much to say that I could not possibly say it all, so I decided to take the literary view, and build on that. All I can say in conclusion is go out, buy this book, and read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"And that says a lot! Elizabeth Bennet is the second of five daughters in the Bennet household. She is a lively and good-humored young woman of high understanding and an open mind. However, she has one defect, she is too quick to judge. Especially so when Mr. Darcy comes to her neighborhood. Darcy appears to be of a reserved, haughty and proud disposition owing to his large fortune and noble birth. Lizzy adopts an immediate dislike of him. Mr. Wickham, whom Lizzy judges to be an amiable man, gives her further evidence of Darcy's unworthiness, and she is prepared to accept and believe it (She is prejudiced!). Darcy notices all the defects of her rather embarrassing family, low-connections and inferior wealth in comparison with his own (He is proud!). Just when you think it's a dead end, however, the barriers begin to crumble away as more and more of Darcy's real character is revealed. Through more dependable sources, she learns that he is in fact a good-hearted, charitable, just man, and the most surprising and unexpected revelation, that he has more than a strong regard for her.My favorite thing about this book is Austen's portrayal of society through her characters: the greedy and self-interested (Mr. Collins), the rich and snobbish (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), the small-minded and ridiculous (Mrs. Bennet and Lydia), the decietful and immoral (Mr. Wickham), and the kind-hearted and easily victimized (Bingley and Jane). The novel is one of the funniest I have ever read, and so entertaining. Mrs. Bennet seldom speaks of her 'nerves' or complains without making you laugh. It is not a slow read either, despite the popularity of the novel there are plenty of unexpected turns to keep you going. Beneath the entertaining quality of the novel there are lessons to be learned. Lizzy misjudges Darcy, Darcy misjudges Lizzy, she misjudges Wickam, Mr Bennet misjudges Mrs. Bennet when he married her, and Jane (Lizzy's older sister) misjudges Miss Bingley. It is perphaps eight months since the beginning of Lizzy's acquaintance with Darcy that she learns his true character, and every moment proves more and more how good a man he is. I liked Sense and Sensibility, but I love Pride and Prejudice. Lizzy and Darcy are positively the most adorable couple I have read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. It gave me wonderful insight into old England and early authors. But what makes me give this book 5 stars is the fact that it was truly enjoyable. Pride and Predjudice can easily be called a vintage classic but also a modern classic. The book is easy to relate to on certain issues, let alone very amusing some times. READ THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I started to read this book for AP English expecting another dry, boring, and hopelessly long novel. However, I was soon pleasantly surprised to find that I was absolutely enthralled in it. It has a timeless plot involving the survival of love when experienced by two different people, each in a very different social status. The utilization of wit and sophisticated humor along with an intricate plot kept me fascinated with the subject matter the entire time. Jane Austen is indeed a wonderful author who's witty and exciting plot will most likely more than keep your interest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book ever. I have read it many times, four to be exact. Jane Austen is so witty and does a great job at telling this love story. As you read you begin to really know the characters. You begin to relate to their fears and desires. It takes great story telling to bring characters to life. Every lady who reads this book will dream of their Darcy...will wish that they were Elizabeth. No one can escape the enchantment of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An amazing book! I thought this was one of those &quot;girly-girl&quot; books that was mushy and stupid. Yet this isn't some Harlequin romance. In fact, it pertains equally to both genders. Elizabeth Bennet, Mr. Darcy, the characters are amazingly created by Jane Austen. A wonderful book, definitely worth the time and effort spent trying to understand it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"...I also strongly recommend that an interested reader try listening to the audio version of this novel. If you think the prose of Austen dry, I assure you that you will find a good reading of it a revelation indeed. Among the versions I recommend strongly are the version read by Irene Sutcliffe (Audio Partners/ Cover to Cover, or Chivers in the UK), and that by Kate Reading (Books on Tape, available from them).I found the Reading version very good overall, and outstanding for the portrayal of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mrs Bennet. The best scene, in my opinion, was that of Lady Catherine confronting Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn. However, I found Elizabeth less easy to distinguish in certain other scenes from her sister Jane, and the men done not as well as I would have hoped. Mr Darcy was a disappointment, in that Kate Reading read his dialogue in a less stately manner than I had expected. However, the reading of the novel was overall very good as I have said. I noticed many little details and phrases that I had overlooked in many readings of this novel, and that I had also ignored in my stay at the Republic of Pemberley (a website dedicated to Austen).I have not yet had the pleasure of listening to the Irene Sutcliffe version, but I plan to buy it very soon. ...If you are rushed for time, or spend a lot of time in your car (or listening to tapes), or if you want to experience Austen in a different light, do try either reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my second Austen novel, my first being Sense and Sensibility. I liked the first, but was blown away by this one. I adored all the characters, and although I knew (like everyone else) the whole time what would happen in the end, I was still overjoyed when the novel was resolved. However, I was dissappointed. I didn't want it to ever end! That's the mark of a good book. When you're done with it, you wish you had never read it just so you could read it for the fist time again. That's exactly how I felt with this novel. I could read it forever. I would reccomend it to anyone who remotely enjoys reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story? Jane Austen's novel enables the reader to embark on a journey with moments of laughter, suspense, frustration, and delight. Although Pride and Prejudice may seem like a love story on a superficial level, a deeper look reveals the complex themes of reputation, class, stereotypes, and first impressions.Exploring characters from different walks of life, Jane Austen effectively and passionately develops the personas of her characters, enrapturing the reader. First impressions can be dangerous and the author implies that society must discard preconceived notions and, in turn, explore beyond the surface. Elizabeth Bennett, the novel's protagonist, captivates the reader with her independent, free-spirited, and quick-witted nature. An anomaly of her time, Lizzy refuses to marry solely for status, for love is essential and she will not compromise her values for power and wealth. Her character is refreshing as compared to her marriage-obsessed mother, materialistic and pedantic sisters, and pompous aristocrats. However, no matter how much the reader hates these characters, he or she realizes that Austen has accomplished her goal of exposing these diverse individuals for who they truly are.The development of relationships and the characters themselves also enthrall the reader. First appearing as a pompous snob, Darcy initially repulses the reader, but through the progression of the novel, the reader begins to see Darcy as the kind, generous man that he is. On the other hand, Wickham appears to be the helpless victim of Darcy, but this false impression is quickly erased. Appearance versus reality is a reoccurring theme throughout the novel which forces the reader to resist deception and search for truth.The reader laughs with Mr. Bennett, cringes at Mrs. Bennet, sympathizes with Jane, flinches at the haughty remarks of Caroline Bingley, and wants to knock some sense into immature Lydia. The strength of the story lies in Austen's depiction of love as an element that can surmount class boundaries. Taken through twists and turns, the reader experiences love ignited, love broken, and love rekindled. But is this is a typical love story? Although Pride and Prejudice ends like a typical enchanted love story, Austen's development of the characters, storyline, and her shattering of class shackles enables the reader to acknowledge that the story serves a deeper purpose."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story?

You can not find better writing than in this book. The words flow together so beautifully. While the romance is barely tangiable throughout the book, it still feels overwhelmingly strong. Proof that less can be more. I am thoroughly impressed with Jane Austen's writing style and only wish we would all speak in such a poetic tone.I have stated the obvious about such a wonderful classic, but this, by far, is my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the best novels I have ever read. Jane Austen speaks out in mild but effective comical terms on the stupidity of tradition throughout the eighteenth century. Her main themes address the problems of true love, money and the importance of family life. She does this through the narrative of her highly regarded heroine Elizabeth Bennett. Through the love and devotion to her eldest sister we see Elizabeth at her best fighting for the interests of her family and connections. A wonderful novel of two sisters and their struggle for true love in a society with pecuniary worries and stations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is certainly a great love story and will survive for generations.I would like to point out something. Perhaps some British peope or people familiar with British society will be able to give me a satisfactory answer. While Mr Darcy abhored people who are ill-bred, unsophisticated and mediocre it is diffcult to see how he could put up with people like Lady Catherine, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst who are just as bad as Mrs Bennet, Kitty Bennet and Lydia Bennet. The latter group had less money and social status. Is this the reason ?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Why is Jane Austen's work so popular even today? Because she was just the best! This is on my personal top ten list. I've read it at least ten times and probably will read it several times again. It's funny, it's smart, it's romantic, and Elizabeth Bennett is my all-time favorite fictional heroine. You can read this book when you're 16 and every ten years after that. All of Jane Austen's books are good, but this is her best - and a classic that should be part of every woman's education and every woman's personal library. It's also proof that a book can have sizzle without any explicit sex."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time. Jane Austen writes with impeccable wit and creates characters who are likeable, laughable, and very real. Pride and Prejudice is an absolute delight, Jane Austen at her best. Read it. If you are anything like me, you will be in heaven."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this novel several times, peeling away the layers looking for new meaning. As someone else stated earlier, P&amp;P is not Austen's deepest work; however, it still contains many levels of meaning. Superficially, there is the charming and *credible* romance. As one digs deeper, one can find lessons on how to read properly (as Elizabeth learns) as well as the layout of a new meritocracy based not on rank, but taste and intelligence. This is not a bland love story, but a quiet, faintly smiling attack on pride, tastelessness, vanity, prejudice and obliviousness. The portrayals of Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine de Bourgh are masterpieces of sweet viciousness.Overall, Austen's late 18th century (*not* Victorian) work is a lovely balance of comedy and commentary, romance and drama. Fun, witty, but not swoony or saccharine, Pride &amp; Prejudice should please all but the most proud &amp; prejudiced reader (or the utterly unintelligent), for it is a charming novel, near to perfection."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW AND EVERY TIME I NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND GET MORE OUT OF IT.

JANE AUSTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY NOW AND AGAIN PICKING FUN AT THE IDEAS OF FASHIONABLE SOCIETY OF THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY ON COURTSHIP AND MARRIDGE AND MANY TIMES AT THE CHARACTERS SHE INVENTS. SHE ALSO MAKES MANY OF HER CHARACTERS REALISTIC AND WRITES HER BOOK COMPASSIONATELY SHOWING AN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLES EMOTIONS AND THEIR OWN OPINIONS.

Even the minor characters are immortal -- Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennett, Lady Catherine in particular -- these are characters without which our imaginations would be the poorer, would they not?As to Elizabeth, one can only lament that she is fictional, and not a real woman one could fall madly in love with...New readers of Austen, please note: although she writes about a period when women were in certain ways subordinate, she makes it clear that at least some women considered themselves to be essentially free and equal, and succeeded in holding their own, or more than their own, in their relations with the other sex. If I may venture to say so, her best women are both quite feminine and quite strong &amp; spirited. Her best men respect those qualities. So my recommendation is to read her with an open mind, and not let the social customs -- so different from our own -- prevent you from seeing the real human virtues (and vices) of her characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"jane austen has been my favorite author since i was required to read pride and prejudice in high school. her character development of the bennett family as well as the darcys and other characters is phenomenal. the tension between elizabeth and darcy drives the story forward and there are so many subplots inerwoven within the story that the reader will never be bored."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am a little anxious about clasics because they includes a lot of detailed descriptions which I can't give myself easily and their language are hard to fallow whos native language is not English....EXCEPT JANE AUSTEN's...

This book is a must read classic. It is a light hearted humorous novel that tells the story of how two people, Mr. Darcy, a conceited man of a much wealth, and Elizabeth Bennet whose family has no wealth to brag of and insignificant connections, fall in love once they each cast their prejudices and pride. This book overall was very much enjoyable from my standpoint."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm so glad I finally took the time to read this classic. I thought the language and different spellings (staid instead of stayed, for example) would be a hindrance at first, but I soon became so accustomed to the rhythm of it that it became a part of the story's charm. I thought the slower pace would be a turn-off, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed discovering the nuances of the relationships even more this way.

I feel like I found a treasure chest full of gold!

The dialogue between the characters is fabulous. The exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are spicy and clever. The book really illustrates the class issues of England at the time. It really sheds a harsh light on the opportunities or lack thereof for women. Even Jane Austen's personal story is a classic one for that time.

A great classic to read over and over."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Really enjoyed reading P&P by Jane Austen. The dialogue was relatively easy to follow except for the occasional English coloquialisms and the characters were superbly fleshed out.

She makes the words \\"good book\\" into flesh and blood. This is prime Jane Austen, complete with dry humor and convoluted relationships. The book itself is ok.

But a used Pride and Prejudice anywhere would be fine, as the gems are inside the book, and reading them is the whole point."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice several times. I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the \\"Classic novels\\", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works. Elizabeth Bennet is truly an inspiring character as the story is told through her, and her interaction with other characters clearly shows Jane Austen's view on all kinds of love.

The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Very insightful and fun.

Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love pride and prejudice.

LIKE CHATTING WITH AN OLD FRIEND WHEN I READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed reading this particular version of the epic \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is written in the form of a screenplay, leaving out most, if not all, of Jane Austin's fine and abundant descriptions of the surroundings the characters find themselves in, as well as descriptions of the characters themselves.If the reader wants to get a quick idea of what this tale is about, I'd recommend this book. It is a quick read and yet does the story justice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am one of those people who reads the classics simply because it's a good thing to do. With dreams of someday becoming a writer, it almost seems necessary to me to read all of the great works. That was what started me on reading Pride and Predjudice. I was completely sucked in!From the first paragraph about the \\"obvious\\" intentions of a bachelor and his wishes to marry, to the ending underplayed scenes between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, this book is an utter delight from the get-go. Lizzy is by far the best female protagonist I have ever read about. I can relate to her on nearly every level and was thoroughly engrossed in the story.When you begin having dreams of being a character in a book, you know that the book has taken you to a new level. This one had me dreaming for weeks. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants a good classic story. You'll never forget it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and prejudice is a well written book, it is a little bit difficult to read, but if you like old fashioned books, you won't bother. Pride and prejudice is a book with a kind of messaje. you can learn something from it. i learned that it is not right to have a prejudice about someting or someone before knowing the facts. just as i al ready said i think its a great story which you can learn from. the book is easier to read if you have seen the movie before just as i have."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was truly a delight to read (and to re-read many times)! Jane Austen is a literary genius! \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a heartwarming tale with a beautifully woven plot, filled with witty dialogue and, of course, a charming love story. It is no wonder that this book has been so wildly successful!Reading over the negative reviews of this book, I am very surprised that anyone could not like this story! I certainly don't know what these people were thinking when they decided that they didn't like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". This has certainly surpassed all other novels as my favorite book of all-time. Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy. I only wished that there was more (or that I was assigned to read it for my English class, which I would do with much pleasure)!In conclusion--read this book, for goodness sakes! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Books i dont think ever get better than this. I recently saw the movie that came out in november and i immeditaly fell in love with the story. I love how this book shows a true romance story. In this day and age i dont think teenagers or people my age even know what a romance movie or book is without the pg-13 parts in it. I was so elated to read about nothing of that sort. It is in my opinion a timeless love story that will win many peoples hearts over and over for generations to come. Mr.Darcy I thought was a very prideful man at first but the more you learn about him, he becomes a very loveable character and suprising one too. As for Elizabeth Bennet she is by far a outspoken but loveable character as well. I think all the characters you run into in the book are so colorful and i wouldnt have thought that a book written so long ago could have characters like that let alone some humor in it too. I think this book never got dull and that everyone should read it. However the words that are used can be quite hard to understand sometimes without having been exposed to words ,and phrases that are said differently, before. Over all it has become one of my favorite books and Jane Austen did a exceptionally good job at writing this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the all time best love stories about a young, feisty women in the 18th century, coping with everything from a mother bent on marriage to a seemingly snotty neighbor's friend.Elizabeth is the second oldest of five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, living in England during the 1800s. And as you can imagine, Mrs. Bennet's main goal is to marry off all of her daughters to wealthy suitors. When word comes that a rich bachelor, Mr. Bingley, is moving into a neighborring manor, the Bennet sisters are beside themselves and Mrs. Bennet's mind is soon set on the pairing of beautiful Jane, the oldest sister, and Bingley after one ball. At said so ball, Mr. Bingely is not alone, accompinied by his sisters and importantly, the very handsome (and very wealthy )but snobbish Mr. Darcy. Darcy later insults Elizabeth, aware she is in his presecene. Now holding a grudge, Elizabeth casts him aside. From then on, event after event seems to throw the two together but the question is: Will their grudges every be able to transform into love?I expected this book to be boring and untolerable but I was forced to shove my own words down my throat after only one chapter. This book is funny with hilarious comments and realistic moments. Everything you could ask for in a book.Recommended- 14 and up. This book can be hard to understand so give or take a couple yearsOverall- This book can be quite confusing to the average American at first considering its sophistacated text, so read it slowly and maybe a second time after awhile. It truly is a great and classic love story so I would encourage everyone to show their support to Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy by reading this enchanting book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you love reading about ballroom dances, castles, romance, and classic British humor, than Pride and Prejudice is the book for you. This 19th century novel has everything you want. It is filled with romance, passion, and drama, with just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in. Elizabeth Bennet's fiery personality captures your attention and holds it. Also, the mystery of Mr. Darcy's' true intentions of romance is held up in the air as you whip through the pages of this captivating read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice. New York: The New American Library Inc., 1961. 332 pages.Pride and Prejudice is the story of The Bennet family. With three lovely daughters, it is Mrs. Bennet's wish that they get married to successful men, although her husband Mr. Bennet thinks differently. With this we are introduced to Jane Bennet, the eldest of the three Bennet girls. She is the ideal daughter who thinks nothing terrible about anyone and who falls in love at first sight with a business tycoon. Then we have Lydia, who is a foolish girl, similar to her mother. She does no work, and goes around looking at all the troops who pass by their city and flirts with them. There she meets a young officer who she falls in \\"love\\" and elopes with. And last we have Elizabeth Bennet. She is the youngest and the brightest out of all three. She has both sense and beauty, although she is not as beautiful as her eldest sister Jane. Elizabeth is very loving and is especially close to Jane. Although at times she can be loud and rude, Elizabeth is never afraid to speak about what's on her mind. And then Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a very blunt and rude man according to Elizabeth, and the two just can't seem to get along with each other. Mr. Darcy however slowly starts to fall for Elizabeth and tries to woo her indirectly. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful heart warming story about a journey of love. This book is recommended for anyone who likes to read a good romantic seventeenth century novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the first novel I read by by Jane Austen couple of years back while doing my graduation. And this novel made me an ultimate fan of Jane Austen's writing. Elizabeth and Darcy's characters are carefully and meticulously created.Pride and Prejudice made me buy the entire collection of her works.Highly recommended! :-)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's, Pride and Prejudice, is an intriguing, nerve riveting structure pieced together with utmost meticulousness. Like a metropolitan skyscraper towering over its suburban brothers, Jane Austen's novel prevails as possibly one of the most powerful novels to fall into a reader's hand.The witty heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, prevails as the most interesting and involved character. She mesmerizes the reader with her wit and grace. Although Mary is the dullest of a girl, the remaining cast and her are a most interesting bunch. The third person omnipresent narrative allows the reader to peak at every character; in the process revealing the Mr. Bennet's hilarious sarcasm and views on his wife along with Mr. Wickham's and Mr. Darcy's true positions and personalities, which I could never bring across to you with as gracefully as is done by Jane Austen, so you will just have to read the book.As Austen introduces the players of the marriage game, which proves to be the center around which the plot is set, she presents the two themes that control the novel and are the title of it, pride and prejudice. Victorian society prevailed as the perfect setting to play out the two themes, as it was an era when social and economical status made a person who he/she is. Age, money, family name, and economical differences steer almost every single conversation and decision throughout the novel. They create for a most suspenseful scene; will Darcy, Bingley, Jane, Liz, and the rest of the cast surpass the boundaries set by pride and prejudice, and come together or will they let those boundaries keep them apart. Only one way to find out how sad or happy the ending is; you must read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When my friends and I were younger, we used to watch 'Wishbone' and every time we saw one we'd say, &quot;I can't wait to read that book&quot;. Well alas, eleven year olds aren't really suited for the books interpreted mostly because of the use of 'big words'. I'll admit, when I first picked this book up, I got a little too lost in the language. The characters seemed tiresome and vacuous. But taking advice from my mother, and the incredible drive of wanting to see Colin Firth in the series, but wanting to read the book first, kept me reading. And as I read farther and farther, I liked the book more and more. The cute story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy really caught my fancy (sorry, still using the language). It's a story that can still resonate today. With all the crappy love series that are in publication today, it's nice to see a story that has a remarkable heroine and a handsome beau who seems stuffy and rude at first, but is found to be remarkably charming and amiable at the end. I really adore this story and I recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a lovely tale of old."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The lasting appeal of Pride and Prejudice is worth explaining to those who haven't read the book or seen the movies before launching into a review of this British classic. First, there may be no finer book at exploring the topic of how appearances can be deceiving. Those who are physically attractive, employ pleasant manners and flatter us will earn our approval and cause us to feel affectionate towards them. Those who are less attractive to regard, keep to themselves and say insulting things will become people we will think poorly of. To see how misleading those reactions can be in assessing character, compare Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy. Lincoln was dour, ugly and awkward with people. Jefferson Davis was just the opposite. When it came to character, Lincoln had enough to hold the Union together and is now viewed as one of our greatest presidents. Most people don't remember Jefferson Davis unless reminded.Second, at another level Pride and Prejudice is a delightful romantic comedy that looks at how love develops through a series of painful mischances. Although not as light and funny as Shakespeare's comedies are (A Midsummer Night's Dream comes to mind), Pride and Prejudice will certainly bring a smile to most readers' faces in this regard.Third, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the best heroines ever imagined. Most readers will identify with her and be rooting for her to succeed. You'll almost feel like you've developed a good friend from reading this book.Fourth, Jane Austen is very good at poking fun at the pretensions of those who are self-absorbed or fascinated with social position and money. But it's a loving kind of fun. She realizes that these people are just silly . . . and don't know any better. We can enjoy a good laugh at their expense, but we should still love and support them. It's a good model for dealing with any goofy relatives we have.Fifth, Pride and Prejudice is a benchmark at how far women have come from the days when they often couldn't even inherit property from their fathers. You'll be as outraged as Mrs. Bennet is at these anachronisms . . . but you'll be assuaged to know that the worst of those bad old days are behind us.So, if those reasons to read Pride and Prejudice appeal to you, read on as I briefly describe the story.The Bennets have a challenge: They have five unmarried daughters who cannot inherit Mr. Bennet's entailed estate. With few prospects in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is always on the hunt. Mr. Bennet views Mrs. Bennet's fascination with this challenge as being something he would like to distance himself from.When an eligible young man moves into the area, Mrs. Bennet's instincts are engaged to the fullest. One of her daughters must marry Mr. Bingley. At the next ball, the pickings seem to improve when Mr. Bingley arrives with a friend, Mr. Darcy. Darcy \\"soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report . . . of his having ten thousand a year.\\" But Mr. Darcy soon turned the fortune hunters off by only dancing with his sisters and refusing to be introduced to any of the other ladies.Bingley finds himself very attracted to Jane Bennet and their relationship develops nicely . . . until he leaves suddenly for London with no plans to return. Jane waits for some news from him or his sisters and finds herself being cut off.In the middle of this, Mr. Collins arrives. Collins will inherit Mr. Bennet's property upon his death. He has just received a position as a clergyman from a powerful and opinionated sponsor, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and she has told him to get married. With four unmarried cousins, Collins decides the Bennet daughters are his best bet. In this way, he can provide a home for them and their mother after he inherits. First being inspired by Jane, he redirects his attention to Elizabeth after perceiving Jane's interest in Bingley and quickly proposes. Elizabeth will have none of it, and Collins soon finds a more enthusiastic prospect in another local family.The younger sisters are finding themselves more than entertained by the dashing officers in a local regiment. Through this connection, Elizabeth becomes acquainted with Wickham who confides in her that Mr. Darcy had treated Wickham with great unfairness after Mr. Darcy's father's death. That's just one more nail in the coffin for the case against Mr. Darcy.But in the background, we get hints that something is shifting. Mr. Darcy goes from finding Elizabeth to be ordinary in appearance to commenting favorably about one small aspect of her face, her mouth. But put the two of them together, and civil words do not follow. They are like oil and water.Jane and Elizabeth eventually make it to London where both hope that Jane will reconnect with Bingley. But no such luck.Just when things seem to be headed in a most bleak direction, a terrible event occurs that shakes everyone like an enormous earthquake. In its aftermath, each character finds herself or himself needed to re-examine their position and perceptions of one another.Will Jane and Bingley connect with one another again? Will Elizabeth find happiness? Will Mrs. Bennet marry her daughters off? You'll just have to read the book to find out. But unlike modern novelists, remember that Jane Austen wasn't against happy endings.Enjoy a great read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's great achievement (and she preferred \\"achievements\\" to \\"accomplishments,\\" if you speak early 19th Century English) was to produce a novel esteemed by its contemporaries for what they called its \\"probableness.\\" They noted she employed none of the fictional gimmicks of the time--their equivalents of car chases--and set a new standard for psychogical perception. Sir Walter Scott observed that he could \\"do the bow-wow thing\\" but he could not do this. Those who find fault with the centrality of marriage in the work do not recognize the limited possibilities for women at the time. Given the narrow sea-room available to her, Elizabeth did marvelously with the minimum possible surrender of her personal freedom. Really, though, the one who did marvelously was Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is, in my opinion, one of the best books written. Ever. I read this book as assigned reading in highschool, and fell in love with it. I was even accused of stealing my copy, which I didn't do by the way- I bought my own.Anyway, this book is so well written, the characters so well drawn, the plot so well planned, and the dialog so quick that I feel any praise I can give it will fall short of the mark. So suffice it to say that if you have somehow not been exposed to Jane Austen by this point in your life, you should IMMEDIATLY invest in a copy of Pride and Prejudice.For me this book was a gateway to the wonderful world of Jane Austen novels. Most highly recommened after P&P; (by me anyway) would be Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensability. I found Emma and Persuasion interesting enough, but did not love them quite as well as I did the three others. I have yet to read the rest of Jane Austens works, but I most assuredly plan to do so.Anything written by Jane Austen is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic. Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about. Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income. A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett. In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman. To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction. Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot. The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel. The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter. The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character. The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects. It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said. Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is available for free on the kindle (Pride and Prejudice) or cheaper by other publishers:Pride and Prejudice (Arcturus Paperback Classics)orPride and Prejudice (Oxford World's Classics)orFavorite Jane Austen Novels: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion.It is a great book, but there are other editions that would save you money. I have no idea as to why it is called a 1st edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Sometimes people make assumptions about others without really knowing the person. Almost every character in the book Pride and Prejudice has some type of prejudice towards someone else whether it is money, pride, or jealousy. Elizabeth made the assumption that Mr. Darcy was stuck-up, but he was really just shy and uncomfortable with social events. Elizabeth also thought Mr.Wickham was nice and truthful, but he really was a poor, gambling liar. Mr. Darcy thought that Jane didn't really like Mr. Bingley, but she just doesn't show her feelings very well. Both of Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine were both against the Bennet family because they were \\"lower class.\\" Some of the prejudices faded, and others grew through out the book. This book is full of pride, prejudice, and love. The theme in this book is really not to judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While any book as widely lauded as this one will also find its detractors, especially from among the ranks of students forced to read it, it is worth noting the number of reviewers (count me among them) who cite PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as their favorite work of literature. I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth. On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"BedBook\\" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can clearly see why anyone who reads English literature has high praises for this story.

When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable. Perhaps it comes with age :-).

I would recommend for anyone to read this book. Jane Austen was an amazing writer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old. In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails. Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother. She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"who doesn't love this book?

Now, even in the can, I'll never be without refined reading material!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"How a spinster who was living in relative isolation in the English countryside during the earliest years of the 19th century was able to write the ultimate romance novel is a question that nobody now alive can answer.Yet in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is exactly what author Jane Austen has accomplished.Written at a moment in time when it clearly was too early to have been inspired by the writings of other authors, P-and-P has every component that the greatest love stories require. The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife\\" which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth's romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal.

It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very well written book. It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel. In the first chapter you see that Darcy has a lot of pride and Elizabeth's prejudice towards Darcy.I like Jane Austen's use of dramatic irony because we as the readers know what's going to happen before the characters, like as the story goes on we know that Darcy will ended up with Elizabeth by the way they treat each other. I would recommend people of 16 and up to read this book because this novel does not make you want to go to sleep. It makes you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was such a delight to read. Anybody who enjoys reading will love the book. Its tales of love and money will grab and hold your attention. The author's use of conflict between her characters is marvelously done. Conflict was a literary device I appreciated from the book. It brings interest, excitement and wonder to the story.A favorite chapter of mine would have to be chapter nineteen. Austen's portrait of Mr. Collin is solidified in this chapter. The manner in which he proposed to Elizabeth was a prime example of his pompous nature.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted and romantic book. I would recommend the book to any teenager or adult. Its topics are very relatable to both age groups."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is chapter thirty four because this chapter presented the plot's climax. The author has carefully built the plot so that Darcy's proposal comes at the height of Elizabeth's anger toward him. This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book. When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family. The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters. When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate. Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason. She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers. That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way. But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about. This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head. For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn. What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers. To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place. For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted. Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her. Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused. The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment. I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an illustrious and fascinating book to read because of its twisted plot that attracts readers. What really made me crave the book was the love-hate relationship Elizabeth and Darcy maintained. My favorite chapter of the book was chapter two in volume III where Austen gives an optimistic overview on Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship as well as Jane and Bingley. She expresses Elizabeth's strong feelings towards Darcy and foreshadows a second proposal.I enjoyed reading the book because of the setting and the era in which it was written. It's quite interesting to read their proper English and try to understand their rare humor. I believe that the right type of age group would be senior students, around the age of seventeen to eighteen and above because of the mature language the author uses. I strongly recommend this book especially to women who like &quot;fairy tale&quot; type of endings in a novel.The literary device that I appreciated was dramatic irony because I found it appealing to see how Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was going to end up. It was exhilarating to see that Darcy was going to propose to Elizabeth for the second time and she not know about it while she was thinking she had lost him forever. That to me was good enough to want to read the book all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel written in the 19th century about the hardships of love, pride, and prejudices.My favorite chapter in Pride and Prejudice is Chapter 8, Volume 1. In this chapter, Elizabeth goes to visit her sick sister, Jane, at the Bingley's estate and during her stay at Netherfield, Caroline continues to insult her. ELizabeth, being the head-strong, outspoken person she is, became fed up with Caroline's constant insultsand began to reciprocate in the same manner and made Caroline feel foolish.Pride and PRejudice is a great, romantic classic that most people would enjoy. In my opinion, this particular novel is directed towards a more mature audience. Because of the sophisticated language and the constant event change, I also think that this novel should be read at a high school level or higher, depending on the person's own reading level and his/her understanding of the use of language in the 19th century.One literary device that I appreciate is the external conflict between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. At first Elizabeth &quot;could hardly stand to be in the same room as him,&quot; but as the plot progresses, she and Mr. Darcy become infatuated with each other and will not speak of their hidden feelings.I enjoyed this novel because it challenged my mind. It made me wonder what role women play in today's society: it has indeed changed dramatically, but the process has been slow. The novel forced me to think about my past predilections and the disorder they caused in my life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that I like this book so far.I have never actually read Pride and Prejudice before but i have seen the movie many times.

I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well it's quite simply a classic! I was only 12 when the TV show came on and remember becoming transfixed by it. It propelled me to Austen's books and I haven't looked back since.

So much has been already been written about the superb characterization and a decent plot, that I don't feel I can add much to it. I found the dialogue witty and intelligent.Austin demonstrates that timeless problem of how men and women continue to misunderstand each other. The language of civility is a hoot, and descriptions of what is socially appropriate add tensions and obstacles. This is a marvelous read and a worthwhile way to spend some time over the holidays."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There was a time in our 20's and into our 30's that a slight film covered our lives. Metaphorically speaking, of course, we were wandering around in our own world of literary complacency. We never realized this, though much like those Claritin D commercials, all our surroundings became sharper and brighter, due to Jane Austen and her charming novel, Pride and Prejudice. We would ask you, oh kind reader, to cast every last ounce of your sense and sensibility aside and read this book. Just be careful that in hast you don't pick up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which has a slightly different take on this classic love story.Miss Elizabeth Bennett is the second oldest of five girls raised in a poor(ish) family on the English countryside, outside of London. Smart, funny, passionate, loyal, and a tad bit prideful, she is the literary heroine of our dreams. Enter Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth with a pair of awesome sideburns). Seemingly arrogant, self righteous, and uppity; our Eliza quickly decides what he can do with all his preconceptions. Upon our word, there is hardly a man quite as standoffish and rude as this gentleman... or is there? Don't be too quick to pass judgment.Pride and Prejudice is likeable on so many different levels. Austen does an amazing job of changing rudeness into shyness, fierce animosity into extreme thankfulness, and all around bad guys into good ones...and then changing them back with the snap of her fingers. Pride and Prejudice stands as one of our absolute favorites and we are still anxiously awaiting an invitation to Pemberley Estate so we can check out Darcy's impressive home library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Unlike many required readings for high school literature classes, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an engaging read. She builds the complexity of this novel with each additional character introduction. As the story progresses, I felt the connection between myself and the Bennet women develop. Though not as dramatic as the early 19th century, the same credentials for an acceptable relationship exist in the modern 21st century. Wealth and social status, as well as appearance were essential to the acceptance of a spouse, to avoid embarrassment to one's family. There remains an element of judgment in relationships today concerning individual etiquette, wealth and physical characteristics. This prejudice extends to peers and family members. In Pride and Prejudice, it contributed to the anxiety in the developing relationships between Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In the opening of the novel, Darcy's pride leads to Elizabeth's prejudice against him. His admiration grows because of her rebuke. This scenario takes place in all aspects of our society. We want what we can't have or that which seems out of our reach. We are never satisfied. Darcy falls victim to these desires as Elizabeth's rebuke transforms his pride into admiration for her.Looking past the intricacy of the English language, I found Pride and Prejudice to be a novel of great complexity, where the lives of all characters are intertwined. From Mr. Collins marrying Charlotte Lucas, to Mr. Darcy finding Lydia for the Bennet's, each character had some effect on all the others. Austen keeps the reader wondering, only putting their minds to ease at the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a perfect novel.

It is a timeless story about the tangled relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. What I love so much about this book is how relevant these situations still are and how easy it is to relate to all of the characters. I have read other Jane Austin novels, and so far this is by far my favorite. Elizabeth is such a strong female character, and Mr. Darcy is a wonderfully complex and interesting male character.

Her mother's main interest is to see her five daughters, all eligible, nicely settled down and married to respectable and rich gentlemen.Elizabeth's personality, very unlike her mother's, unfolds throughout the pages in a crescendo of emotions resulting from various issues connected with the whole family saga and especially to her own contrasting feelings towards a certain young man, Mr. Darcy. Will Elizabeth's passionate and sensible nature, combined with a certain degree of boldness (for those days), make her discover what lies beyond his seemingly unpleasant and unreadable personality?The graceful politeness in the prose is charming, delineating a faithful image of life at the end of the 18th century in England.The intrigues beyond wished-for marriages are very accurately described by Ms. Austen, with a touch of humour \\"hither and thither\\". I could not help myself comparing similar issues with nowadays. Beyond the characterisation and a part from the language, style and general progress, I believe that human nature, as depicted, is the same as it always was and it is not all just about \\"love\\", it is also about people attempting to incorporate into a higher position in society, seeking integration at a greater level. It was also interesting, I thought, to see how relevant (or irrelevant) the \\"worth\\" bestowed on the female gender was back then, compared to the present day in most societies. This, combined with the rapidity with which one fell in love, got engaged and/or was forbidden or denied to marry, could be stimulating subjects for ensuing conversations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No matter how many times i read this book i always find more that i love about it! darcy and elizabeth are a most amazing couple, they dont make them like that any more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is a must read for all generations.

Jenkins, who wrote SF under the pseudonym Murray Leinster. The stories range from as early as 1934 (The famous &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot;, about alternate history lines parallel to ours) till 1956 (&quot;Critical Difference&quot;) and amongst them are classics as &quot;First Contact&quot;, ground for an idealogical flap with Soviet writer Yefremov back in 1959, and &quot;A Logic Named Joe&quot;.The book shows Murray Leinster at his best, being the writer of entertaining short fiction. Compared to some other writers of his period his work hardly seem dated and considering that his earliest story was sold in 1919 (!) that's quite a compliment."},{"Title":"The Best of Murray Leinster","review":"Murray Leinster's best work was his short fiction, and one of the best collections of his stories is _The Best of Murray Leinster_ (1978), edited by John J. Pierce. Perhaps it would be appropriate to mention what is _not_ in the collection. Pierce limits himself to stories from 1934 to 1956 and to stories of manageable length. Therefore, stories like \\"Mad Planet\\" and \\"Red Dust\\" from the 1920s are eliminated, along with the Med Service stories (which began in 1957). Leinster's Hugo winner from 1956, \\"Exploration Team,\\" isn't there, either, though another Colonial Survey story, \\"Critical Difference,\\" is included.Pierce's limitations are, on the balance, very sensible ones. Leinster wrote some very good stories before 1934 and after 1956. But it was between these these years that he wrote most of his best, most original stories. He was one of the first writers to use the notion of parallel worlds in straight science fiction (\\"Sidewise in Time\\") and one of the first to use the notion of the generation starship (\\"Proxima Centuri\\"). He wrote about computers before they were well known (\\"A Logic Named Joe\\"). And he wrote a number of stories about first contacts between humans and nonhumans (\\"First Contact,\\" \\"The Strange Case of John Kingman,\\" \\"The Lonely Planet\\") that became something of a trademark with him. A quick check of several \\"first contact\\" theme anthologies on my shelf reveals that most of them contain at least one of Leinster's stories. Certainly a great many science fiction story conventions used by modern writers today were pioneered and developed by Leinster.Aside from originality of ideas, Leinster's plots are his main strength as a writer. His stories consistently set up a problem and work with carefully extrapolated logic toward a fair solution to the problem without telegraphing the ending. \\"Keyhole,\\" certainly the least of the stories in this collection, is still admirably plotted. It's a story lesser writers have imitated simply for its neatness and cleverness. In a Leinster story, problems are always meant to be solved, whether it is survival in a parallel world (\\"Sidewise in Time\\"), a moral conflict (\\"First Contact\\"), or a technological problem (\\"A Logic Named Joe\\" and \\"Critical Difference\\"). Even the grim \\"Pipeline to Pluto\\" involves some ruthless protagonists who get their just desserts. Leinster is never really pessimistic.Characterization is Leinster's greatest weakness, mainly because he usually maintains an ironic distance from his characters. To be sure, there are certain characters in these stories who are well-drawn: the autocratic and imperious Professor Minott in \\"Sidewise in Time\\"; the duty-bound captain of \\"Proxima Centauri\\"; the aloof mental patient John Kingman; and Alyx, the planetary intelligence of \\"The Lonely Planet\\". But Leinster never systematically uses a point-of-view character. He never puts you inside a character's skin, never promotes a strong identification with a character. This is a relatively mild flaw in a short story or novelette, but it is a great liability in a novel.I don't know of any critics who are seriously arguing that Leinster is a major stylist among science fiction authors. He doesn't have the poetry of, say, Ray Bradbury, and he doesn't have the precision and clarity of Isaac Asimov. On the other hand, I don't see any reason to be overly snobbish about Leinster's style. It has always been competent and workmanlike. Its most characteristic trademark is its tone: dry, rational, logical, and ironic. There is a sense of humor that runs through Leinster's stories. It is understated in relatively straight stories (such as \\"First Contact\\" and \\"Critical Difference\\") and overt in comical pieces (such as \\"The Fourth-dimensional Demonstrator\\" and \\"A Logic Named Joe\\"), but it is always there. The style of earlier stories (\\"Sidewise in Time,\\" \\"Proxima Centauri\\") is more choppy, repetitious, and rough than later stories (\\"First Contact,\\" \\"The Ethical Equations\\"). Dialogue is also more effectively handled in later pieces. But that dry, ironic tone is there in all of the stories.Leinster was at bottom a craftsman who was concerned with telling a story well. At his best, he was able to tell some original tales with just the right amount of solid thought to them so that they were _about_ something. J.J. Pierce correctly states that no single collection can do justice to the stories that Leinster wrote, but this collection is an excellent start."},{"Title":"The Best of Murray Leinster","review":"Wonky technology and good-old sf. Nostalgic at best. This book contains the Murray Leinster classic \\"Sidewise in Time.\\" A pretty enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Best of Murray Leinster","review":"The other reviewers have covered the details that distinguish Leinster and this collection. It is definitely well worth reading. The stories \\"Sideways in Time\\", \\"First Contact\\", and \\"A Logic Named Joe\\" are classics. The latter story was written as a tongue-in-cheek projection of what computers might become in a time when computers were room-sized, vacuum tube monsters. It captures not only the concepts of the internet and home computers, but the existence of information sources like Google and Wikipedia. Furthermore, it alludes to the convergence of internet and TV. \\"The Fourth-Dimensional Demonstrator\\" is an enjoyable farce, while \\"The Ethical Equations\\", \\"Symbiosis\\", and \\"Keyhole\\" are more thought-provoking.To some degree, the technologies portrayed are dated. The stories certainly are not."},{"Title":"Cmo ensear valores a los nios","review":"I describe this book as a treasure.

The concepts/principles are there and explained well. However, the laws/statutes of each state, city, town etc. vary so much.....the book provides very little information in this regard.

The advice is backed up by the extensive experience and research done by the author, civil cases or civil codes which are referenced at the end of each chapter. It makes for a good guideline for someone who doesn't know where to turn when in need of solving a neighbor problem."},{"Title":"Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees, Boundaries & Noise (5th edition)","review":"If the neighbor's tree root damages your fence or foundation, or they never bother to paint their side of the shared fence and it rots, you need to know what to do so you don't get stuck with the whole maintenance or repair bill.ALL these shared Neighborly items (trees, fences, retaining walls, maintenance, damage) are covered under a very vague State Civil Code in most states, not by any local Building or Zoning Codes. There are no clear definitions of run-down or ugly. The government does NOT want to waste the taxpayer's money on petty disputes between hard-headed neighbors if they can help it, and wants the citizens to work it out on their own. This means that any disputes have to be settled in mediation or Court, and the local Building and Zoning Code Enforcement can NOT do a thing to help you unless the fence is too tall according to the local ordinances (for my town, that is over 7') or is a dangerous nuisance (broken, nails sticking out, fire hazard, etc.) and thus a life-safety hazard.The book tells you what letters and agreements need to be made and written down, how to (more or less) word them, where to send them, and so on. This helps you get the work quickly done and share in the shared expenses, and also helps you collect expenses that result from your neighbor's neglect. *Neighbor Law* is updated every several years, includes information for the various different States, and many handy sources for more information. The book explains how the mediator or courts usually judge what is a 'shared' fence or tree Vs. not shared when trying to divy up the expenses. This is important to know and NOT in any law book [Hint: depends on if you enjoy *some* use of it for shade, dog run wall, kids' play yard, fruit, nuts, pool fence, privacy, etc].This book will help bring you some clarity to a very vague law, is something you will refer back to many times (since now all YOUR friends will consider you the authority!), and it is well worth the very reasonable price in terms of the headaches and money it will save you over the years to come."},{"Title":"Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees, Boundaries & Noise (5th edition)","review":"In an effort to be all things to all people, this book is so generic that it offers very little guidance and borders on being insulting to one's intelligence.As an example, it spends a great deal of time telling you what and where you can plant trees to create a natural fence (conclusion: do it on your property); really? I can't randomly plant a tree in someone's yard? It tells you that you should keep it maintained and if you obstruct someone's view you may do so sometimes but not always). Um, that was very helpful.How about this suggestion, if you have a neighbor doing illegal activities, get your other neighbors to sue the offending neighbor for bringing down the property values by their activities. This will save you from bothering the police, who are often too busy to attend to your complaint and you will tick off the neighbor so they'll move rather than get harassed again by the neighborhood because of the fines charged by small claims court.Um, one ponders what reality the author(s) are experiencing. I guess they never heard of gang bangers, or heard stories about some criminals carrying weapons, or for that matter that some people like to retaliate when people call them out by taking them to small claims court. Sounds like these people are smoking some good stuff.Other common sense stuff like first attempting to talk face to face with the person, you have a conflict would absolutely never occur to anyone without having this handy book!In addition, people may or may not be able to harvest fruit that falls on their property from a neighbors tree.I think you get the essence of the author(s) direction in giving advice.I suggest this book for those who lack any form of common sense or interpersonal skills. Otherwise, since ordinances vary from city to city and county by county and of course from one state to another. It would make much more sense to contact your local government office for direction.Just my 2 cents, which in my humble opinion is more valuable than the book."},{"Title":"Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees, Boundaries & Noise (5th edition)","review":"Everything you'll need to resolve any problems with neighbors, must have book if you're experiencing problems with neighbors, fast and easy to understand results."},{"Title":"Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees, Boundaries & Noise (5th edition)","review":"Covers such topics as who's responsible for border trees, their branches, leaves, etc., what you can do to resolve disputes.

Im a guitar player wanting to play slide and I grabbed this book/cd off the rack. It doesnt really seem like this book is trying to start you from the ground up by teaching easy techniques then putting them together. It just kind of gives you some tab for an exercise, a track on the CD, the teacher talks while playing some neat sounding stuff, but never tells you HOW to do it. Sure, the tab is there, but give me some more guidance dude. Not much technique is ever given aside from the absolute basics. From there the book jumps to harder licks without giving enough guidance.Two Thumbs Down on this one."},{"Title":"Acoustic Slide Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"OK, I side with the guy who studied with Keith Wyatt at MI. Keith knows this subject like the back of his hand, and has a nice teaching tempo and style. I thought this was a great intro into slide guitar playing in general and a good jumping off point to actually find further instruction and put it all together or start listening to songs and picking things up yourself if you have any ear.The book gets you going with some simple phrases, which is the important part, in std tuning. It quickly goes to open G tuning, which I personally think is the best tuning to start playing and learning in. After adding some fairly easy phrases, there is a bit of a jump in skill level to get the full songs down that he has. In that case I think its about patience, going over each part little by little and really owning what you learn, not zipping through things. Then he ends up touching on open D tuning too, so its a great overview of standard blues tunings. If you want to translate to electric guitar, just tune to open A or E.The book does not have that many full \\"song\\" examples, or transcriptions of Robert Johnson songs, true, but the short song examples in there are full of great ideas you can take with you. And if you can master the longer example he has at the end of the book, then you are well on your way to going the next step, like a Bob Brozman or Stefan Grossman DVD with actual songs.In summary I think this book is great for getting you started learning slide technique and at least getting a few basic licks under your fingers."},{"Title":"Acoustic Slide Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I also disagree with the first reviewer. Blues is not about learning scales and modes. It's about listening, which is about what most of us (who pick up an instrument) do for the very first time or any time as a matter of fact. I happened to study under Keith Wyatt for a year at Musician's Institute in Hollywood California and let me tell you, in my whole life I have never seen a more fluent guitar player and musician. Words cannot explain how awsome this guy is in playing the blues. Trust me, if your curious about slide guitar, Keith Wyatt is the best place to start. Not only is he cool musician and blues player but he also a great teacher... I should know and you will too. Peace Out!

Perhaps the most incredible thing about the prose is how \\"modern\\" it reads; and isn't it sad, about humanity in general, how Walt's accounts from 1862-1865 are still TOTALLY relevant today, in 2005; and will probably remain TOTALLYrelevant for as long as human beings occupy this blood-stained planet."},{"Title":"Memoranda During the War","review":"I read this book while also reading &quot;Don't Know Much About the Civil War&quot; and Lincoln's letters and speeches.

He lets them speak their stories through his lines. Through sadness he exalts them.This book should be a required reading for all highschool or college American History classes."},{"Title":"Memoranda During the War","review":"Walt Whitman, upon hearing the news of the wounding of his brother George at the battle of Fredericksburg , took off from New York City to find him on the battlefields of Virginia. After discovering him at a hospital, and spending time with his company, Whitman decided to live in Washington DC. His sojourn there, which last many years, is brilliantly recounted in the simple book \\"Memoranda During the War\\".While working at the Patent Office during the war, Whitman volunteered much time caring and tending the wounded at the many Civil War hospitals that sprang up to take care of the men. Whitman would bring the men simple treats, such as fruit, or paper, or things to read, and spend hours tending to these brave men. This book is a recollection, however brief, of those times he spent caring for the men, including some important events of the time.While people learn about the history of the Civil War by memorizing dates and places, they often miss the impact of the Civil War. Whitman's book brings the impact of this war into real contexts. Even he, in his writing, says that the true reality of this war may be unknowable to those who would never see it. Whitman attempts to correct this by telling stories of the wounded soldiers he tends; stories of battles; and a particularly gruesome story of a raid gone bad and its horrific consequences.Whitman's prose is succinct and touching. The few soldier's lives he manages to capture on paper, some in just a few sentences, are compelling. Anyone wanting to understand this war certainly should spend an hour with Whitman as he describes his small part in this grand conflict, for with his words, comes a grander understanding of this war."},{"Title":"Memoranda During the War","review":"Avoid this edition at all hazards!

He wrote letters for them. To his dismay, he found far more Union Southerners, especially from Tennessee, than he expected. After the Battle at Columbia, Tennessee, no Rebels were left alive. \\"They let none crawl away, no matter what his condition.\\"Hero stories are almost always myths. MEMORANDA DURING THE WAR is made up of articles published in the New York 'Weekly Graphic' and published in 1876 to go along with his special \\"Centennial Editon\\" of 'Leaves of Grass.'\\"I shall not easily forget the first time I saw Abraham Lincoln. It was a rather pleasant spring afternoon on 19th of February, 1861, in New York City.\\" Whitman was from Brooklyn, New York. \\"The figure, the look, the gait, are distinctly impressed upon me yet; the unusual and uncouth height, the dress of complete black, the stovepipe hat..., the dark-brown complexion, the seamed and wrinkled yet canny-looking face, the black, bushy head of hair, the disporportionately long neck....\\" He describes Lincoln as having eyes with a deep latent sadness in the expression. Mrs. Lincoln, too, when she ventured out always wore black.At the first Inauguration, Lincoln's carriage had been surrounded by a dense mass of armed cavalrymen eight deep, with drawn sabres; and there were sharp-shooters stationed at every corner on the route. Four years later, he was in his plain two-horse barouche with his ten year old son, with no soldiers, only a lot of civilians on horseback, with huge yellow scarfs over their shoulders.April 14, 1865, a day to be remembered, as President and Mrs. Lincoln attended a performance at Ford's Theatre; at intermission, a shot was heard. Booth, dressed in plain black broadcloth, bare-headed, with a full head of glossy, raven hair, and his eyes like some mad animal's flashing with light and resolution, yet with a strange calmness, jumps to the stage holding a large knife. After he sprains his ankle, he turns around and looks at the audience his face of statuesque beautuy, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation...launches out in a firm and steady voice the words, \\"Sic semper tyrannis.\\"At the Cemetery in Andersonville, with its thirteen thousand graves, on the slope of a beautiful hill in June, 1875, he wrote: \\"And now, to thought of these -- on these graves of the dead of the War, as on an altar -- to memory of these, of North or South, I close and dedicate my book.\\"Whitman was an old man with a bushy white beard and white hair in the photograph by Matthew Brady in 1863. The first part by Peter Goviello appears to be a thesis on this particular book. He is an English professor at Bowdoin College, and previously published INTIMACY IN AMERICA: DREAMS OF AFFILIATION IN ANTEBELLUM LITERATURE. I didn't know there was such a thing, but then I took English Lit. and learned American Lit. by typing the exams for my college teacher/husband who taught both."},{"Title":"Cooked Goose","review":"Savannah Reid was a Georgia Peach who became a San Carmelita police officer.

To make matters even worse, Blass has a fit when circumstances forces his daughter Margie to move in with Savannah.In the parking lot of a department store, there have been a rash of rapes perpetrated by a man wearing a Santa Claus suit.

This book wasn't quite what I was expecting. From the title of this and others in the series, I was expecting a light, cozy type book. Obviously, I hadn't read the back cover. This book is much darker then what I normally read. In fact, I almost quite when I realized what I'd gotten myself into. I hate to quit on books, however, and I'm glad I persevered.The story works on several different levels, with sub-plots to keep you entertained. Even so, the mystery developed nicely, with plenty of red herrings that kept me guessing until the end. Savannah and her friends and family are interesting characters, and I enjoyed spending time with them, even if the reason why wasn't pleasant.I don't know if this book was abnormally dark for the series of if this is normal.

McKevett does not have Grafton's (sometime over-prolix) gift for scene-setting. Her tone is not as ironic and she gets preachy and sentimental.

But soon Savannah has a bigger problem, her old boss (Captain Bloss), wants her to be his 16-year-old daughters bodyguard, since she was the most recent victim (or, almost victim) of the attack. Soon Savannah is working hard to survive the holiday season, be a baby-sitter, be a hostess to her unexpected sister, brother-in-law, and their treacherous kids, and solve the mystery of the serial rapist, before he moves on to bigger things, such as murder.This was my first Savannah Reid mystery, and I must admit, I was very impressed.

The tale of his experiences and observations. At that time the British presence in the Antarctica region was called the Falklands Islands Dependencies Survey. This changed once the Antarctic treaty was sicned in 1961 (while Pearce was in Antarctica). Passingly interesting and funny in places, dry and tedious in others. Would never have finished the book if I hadn't been there and interested in the area. Intersperses his experiences and tales with a review of the history of scientific expeditions in the past.Obviously from a different era. They dumped their sewage directly into the water, threw garbage out the door to be delt with by the wind, and killed seals to feed the sled dogs. None of these happen anymore.The worth of this book is that he experienced the end of an era."},{"Title":"International Project Accounting (International Construction Management)","review":"I havn't read this book.

So I read a few pages and then, meaning to read it between life stuff, I put it in my purse (along with everything else I own). Several days later, I went out shopping with my 21 year-old daughter on her birthday. I was rummaging through my purse looking for money when I found the book. \\"Wow, I forgot about this cool little book!\\" I decided to give it to my daughter for her birthday. I figured she'd probably lose it or leave it in the bathroom in the mall.A few weeks later, I was surprised to get a text message from her. \\"i read the kabbalah book i really liked it\\". This from someone who does not much think about religion, much less mysticism.I was jealous because I didn't have the book anymore. So I had to order another one. And then I got a chance to read it myself. It IS a little book, but with Kabbalah, you don't need many words to start thinking about bigger ideas. The stories and commentaries are not just interesting, they bespeak larger mysteries yet to be explored. There is an excellent bibliography suggesting where you might go next in your literary journey should your curiosity be sparked. Despite it's small size, it is a big book. And it fits so well in your purse (or pocket!)"},{"Title":"Kabbalah: The Way of Light (Pocket Gold)","review":"An introduction to the Kabbalah, although kept simple, it remains as nothing mysterious. Rabbi Kushner gives some relevant examples to our time, however, I feel there is something missing in the whole of the study of the Kabbalah. Nicely presented and displayed with pictures, this short book is just an introduction that, because its so short, it misses many of its aspects."},{"Title":"Kabbalah: The Way of Light (Pocket Gold)","review":"This little book packs a pretty big message. Rabbi Kushner provides the reader with a basic introduction to the Kabbalah, using plain language, parables and stories. You are certainly not getting the Pritzker Edition of the Zohar here. However, you will get a very rewarding, moving, profound and enlightening book full of wisdom that can be read in an hour, but not easily understood in a lifetime. A wonderful intro."},{"Title":"Simple heraldry,","review":"Alternately known asSimple Heraldry Cheerfully Illustrated, this little British book was a delight of my teens and twenties; I read it repeatedly out of my local library during those years. Now I've acquired a copy of my own, and it's lost none of its charms. Moncreiffe (and Pottinger, who, although he seems to be billed on the jacket as co-author, is acually the illustrator) gives us an easily understandable, humorously illustrated look at the whole system and science of heraldry, beginning with the why of it (\\"A man in full armor was unrecognizable\\") and going on to show the elements of an \\"achievement\\" (the whole family device, supporters, motto, and all), the ways in which wives, daughters, and sons differentiate it, how other entities than individuals (everything from realms to corporate bodies) can use coats of their own, and the rules attendant upon description--colors, charges, partitions, and other devices. Anyone who needs to understand the basics of this field can't do better than to begin with Moncreiffe. The same team also produced the equally delightfulSimple Custom.)"},{"Title":"Simple heraldry,","review":"I purchased this book on peer recommendation. I was not disappointed. As one who studies Heraldic History, I found this book to be very useful in breaking down heraldic display to its most simple form for teaching young heralds. Great starter book."},{"Title":"Simple heraldry,","review":"Long out of print, Simple Heraldry: Cheerfully Illustrated (Moncreiffe and Pottinger) is the best book I have found to give to someone as an introduction to the fine science and art of heraldry. It almost looks like a children's book and indeed could be enjoyed by children, but for adults as well it offers a basic and thorough intruction that won't bog down the newly interested. This is the book that got the new Lord Lyon (as of 7 March 2008) interested in heraldry. A new reprint would be well met in heraldry circles, so until that happy day one needs to buy used. But, the cost is very reasonable for a truly priceless book."},{"Title":"Faces of Love","review":"I'll admit it; I am a sucker for a good romance novel. I picked up Faces of Love with little expectation, thinking it's a typical love story, but Wow! This is a little gem, a constant page turner; only put the book down when I had to. The author seems skillful in capturing a real essence of tried n' true relationship, proverbial mixes of humor, but best of all, it leaves you with a good feeling.For all you fans of this genre, this is self indulgence at its best."},{"Title":"Faces of Love","review":"This book is a must read. The author's ingenuity in mixing twisted plot with laugh out loud humor, down to those passionate interludes leave much to be desired. The author's style is charismatic, yet subtle in captivating the sentimental nature of true love. The romance is rich in culture; themes are gullible, yet inventive. A story everyone who has been in love can relate. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Coming Last Day's Temple","review":"This has to be the best book on the topic of the 3rd temple i have seen in years.

You will not finish it in one reading; you will not finish it in ten readings. You will enjoy it though. It goes in-depth (400 pages, to be exact) into the temple, it's place in Judaism and it's place in Christianity. One entire section is devoted to current events about the Temple. There are also chapters on sacrifice and why it's not necessarily a bad thing (though sometimes the explanation is clear as mud, it gets the point across).

Up to 1892, he added poems and revised the original twelve poems -- books also published under the same title, \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" In 1892, Whitman published (by then, recognized, not self-published) its final version, the edition he wanted to be thought the definitive \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" This is the commonly called \\"Deathbed Edition.\\" It contains over 300 poems. It does contain the original twelve, though not in their original or other previously-published forms. By then, they'd been many-times revised over the years, and released within other publications between the first and the last. In essence, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" was a nearly 40-year evolving work, under the same title, each edition containing the prior editions' poems further revised, plus additional poems.I wanted to read the original poems. I also wanted to see their final versions, and was curious to see their evolution. I noticed that some books include so many evolutions of the poems/book, they fill at least two volumes. I wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass\\" but I didn't need to become a scholar of it; I wanted to read the book. However, I didn't want only the Deathbed Edition -- I was both curious about the original and wanted to see more than 12 poems.I decided to buy an edition of the book that contains the entire Deathbed Edition, plus a few of the poems in their original form, and some commentary. I believe, after researching, I found the best I could. That would be my recommendation: if this is your first purchase of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" make sure to see some poetry from 1855, some poetry from the Deathbed Edition, and some poetry in between. That is, if what you want to read is the poetry and not own a collector's item or only the \\"definitive edition,\\" as Whitman viewed it (Deathbed). To me, seeing only the final version detracts something from its core -- and after reading the poems and comparing them, I feel this even more -- so in that sense I disagree with Whitman; he chose to make public many books over 40 years, yet wanted only the last to be considered the true version.As a reader, I find it unfortunate that this is a work that evolved over a lifetime under the same title; it renders each addition of poems to the book not books of their own, and also difficult to find on their own. So, for me, the compromise was to choose a book that includes the Deathbed Edition and part of the original, without having to read multiple books, or 1,000 pages, or a scholarly journal (though I would love to see the full original 12 poems).I understand a book will be released soon that includes both the full original (12 poems) and the full Deathbed Editions. I don't have it, so I don't know what else will be included."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I carry a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass with me where ever I go.

The one I carry is the 1892 \\"death-bed\\" eddition, which contains virtually all the poetry he ever published. However I also own the \\"first\\" edition, published in 1855.

Whitman is the most enthuiastic American poet I have ever read and his passion for life and nature is amazing. He did not ever want to miss a second of life or the smallest detail of nature. He shares his limitless love for all Americans, including, of course, himself. I particularly enjoy his frequent usage of listing without commas, which I find livens his excitement for life even more. Whitman, although he may come off as a bit over eager to some, truly makes you realize how blessed you are and how lucky you are to live in this beautiful place, and he reminds us all that we should not take any of these blessings for granted.

Walt Whitman opened my eyes and my mind to the posibilities of what could be put onto paper. I had never really liked reading until I opened this book and have not stopped reading since. Walt was a true American. It is incredible that Walt Whitman can make accurate references in his poems to just about every facit of American life. It doesn't take very many pages before you feel as if Walt has been in your shoes, seen things through your eyes, thought the things you have thought and felt the feelings you have felt.

The poetry speaks of Walt Whitman's connection to his fellow man, nature, and to God. It is not to be missed.Leaves of Grass speaks to the turbulent times in which Whitman lived, being the Civil War era. He speaks out against the horror of war and he embraces the spirit of compassion for his comrades. Yet the book is also a reflection on matters relating largely to uplifting themes. His poetry has evoked thoughts about what is of value within my life. Even though it is the product of another era, it speaks to the timeless values of humankind.As the author of a spiritually-themed novel entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I look for books that provide food for my soul. This is one that certainly hit home for me. It is also a book written by a gay man. Since I am gay myself, I appreciated the affirming nature of Whitman who embraced his sexuality with little judgment. This was a remarkable example which reflected his inner peace during a time when being a homosexual was not accepted.Whether or not you are a man, woman, gay, or otherwise, this book will speak to you.

It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems.I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"While I agree with most of the reviews written here, I must take issue with them somewhat. First, I also believe that Walt Whitman is one of the finest poets that ever lived and certainly the finest when it comes to being a proud American. Although, he comes from a time in America that was like that of Socrates and Plato in the past, a time when the most important thing in life was not work, or success or career, but the exploration of one's inner thoughts. Were we living in a time when such a thing was permitable rather than the constant search for the almighty dollar, we might see more such poets. But he and his era are long gone. The art of the word is certainly Walt's. I ask you to also purchase a dictionary when you purchase this or any of his volumes, not because it is difficult to read, but because Whitman doesn't always use a word for it's main meaning, often burying a meaning of a word or line in the third or fourth meaning, completely changing the meaning of the poem. It is such fun and exactly what I believe Walt Whitman is meant to be, a journey and a trip to the celebration of life. A celebration that also includes a look at the worst that is us and the best that is us. When the reviewer wrote that his work is a study of a narcissist, I have to disagree. Yes, it begins his work with Song of Myself and it is an epic poem. But while he celebrates Walt, he is truly celebrating all of us as amazing creatures in nature. He celebrates every molecule of us, the amazing capabilities, perfumes and evilness of us. He studies us as though someone would study the amazing ability of a tree to grow or a flower to bloom. We are nature and he recognizes that and it is amazing to him. Clearly, he had bravado and self-love, but in the most non-imposing way. We wishes all of us to realize the miracle that is us. To believe that he is only about himself is to miss the point of Walt. Also, it is important to read the various editions of this volume. He wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass continuously throughout his life adding and deleting poems as he saw them. The best way to see his journey is to read the first edition (complete with his swaggering picture), where he was not listed as the author to the final \\"deathbed edition\\" that is truly a masterpiece and you can see what he learns, what he tries to teach you and how deeply you will be moved by him. One last hint - read \\"Song of Myself\\" outloud. It becomes truly a song about life and read outloud can certainly stir your soul."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"What more can be said about Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;? This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Is this FREE edition abridged?

No rhymes to bore anyone, no meter, simply a transfer of pure mental energy. It took me a while to get into Whitman because I knew him thru a lot of boring teachers who tried to squeeze the very life out of these works and inject them with artificial, completely sanitized \\"meaning\\". This is poetry at its most raw. It does for the written word what Stravinsky did with music. It doesn't need dressing up and it utterly rejects the falsity of good manners. As Whitman joyfully tells us of himself: \\"I am not the least bit civilized!\\" This is wild stuff and it'll kick you sideways if you give it half a chance. Read it and then choose the right moment to sound your own barbaric yawp!"},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"What a lover?! I have fallen in love with Walt Whitman. One such as this writing such passionate things in those times or these...and with such candor. I am so thankful to have read this book. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"If you care for literature at all, even if your interest in it exceeds no further than reading the morning paper, Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; is a must read. He is truly one of the greatest poets, revolutionaries, historians, and Americans to ever live. As a poet, Whitman lures his reader in with work exploding with passion and inexhaustable energy. As a revolutionist, he baisically tore up any rule book to writing, stripping away any limitations, and paving the path for further free, independent thinkers. He was unaffraid to rebel against the narrow-mindedness of his time, making himself a leader as one of the very first poets to ever use &quot;free verse,&quot; a technique rellious on its own. In doing so, this great leader was criticized and looked on disapprovingly for his work during much of his life time, and like many other artists who dare to be unique, his true genius was never fully recognized until after his death. As a historian and as an American, Whitman has taken these works of his and has combined them into the nations most patriotic yet brutally honest text book.It is in writing of himself and his own personal experiences that Whitman imbeds the history of this country, both dark and nationalistic. Through his time working as a volunteer nurse to the wounded and dying soldiers during the Civil War, Whitman writes often of the terror of war, making it one of his most recognizable themes throughout much of his work. He also brings us back to a time in history in which those who believed in equal rights for all, including persons of every race a gender, was considered rebellious; for in such beliefs, Whitman took religions that placed severe restrictions over such things as sexuality, and attacked them. The reason I am so confident in recommending this book to any reader, is that you are given a selection of editions to choose from; the edition you choose for yourself, fitted to your familiarity with the poet. I cannot promise that will fall absolutely in love with this book, every person has their own tastes, however, I can promise that if nothing else, you will walk away from this book with appreciation and understanding the value in reading it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism. Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus. It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality. However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations. In \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship. In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the \\"ship,\\" there will be a lack of order and chaos. \\"Song of Myself\\" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted. All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger. Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul. \\"Song of Myself\\" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall. Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth. Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Since there was some confusion in the comments section as to what volumes were or were not truly the \\"First Edition,\\" I though I'd confirm that the Penguin Classics version entitled \\"Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition\\" is in fact the first, slim, volume of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" published in 1855. This version has Malcom Crowley's introduction, followed by the frontispiece, title page, Whitman's introduction, and then 12 poems. The poems cover 120 pages, making this a slim, compact volume.

He wrote about life. He wrote about the mundane world, and made it look so beautiful. He admired the human form, and praised the wonderful design of the body. His comments on life in America during the middle of the 19th century really carry a romantic outlook. He was passionate about himself, life, and the world around him.

He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well.

Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the \\"Manifest Destiny\\" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.The poems are diverse and upbeat. The language, for the most part, is clear and easy. Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines. Very few poetic devises are used.One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry. But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.Although a classic, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology. None of his poems are memorable. Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.

But Walt Whitman was and still is one of the most influential poets I have ever read. He began life on a farm on Long Island, but times got bad and his family uprooted itself and moved to Brooklyn. Brooklyn at that time was a growing city unto itself and trades were needed. Thus Whitman learned the trade of printer. But his soul led him to a higher calling. He became a jounrnalist and wrote poetry. His early efforts did not amount to anything major. Yet sometimes the unimaginable happens in a man's life. A sudden thrust of inspiration strikes one like a bolt of lightning. Then something new and unique is born out of this inception - a new form of poetry - what is today referred to as free verse. Yes, Whitman is the father of the form, and perhaps one of its greatest practitioners. The beat poets who were to follow in his footsteps never really rose to his great height of mystic revelation. I think that's what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to Whitman's religiosity. For Whitman was the poet of a new world, a new nation, a growing entity that would go on to fulfill an old dream of mankind. That is, the dream of a thoroughly new man, a man who was free from the past, a man who could find his soul was one with the fathomless cosmos. Hence, &quot;Walt Whitman, a cosmos&quot; is a very telling way Whitman has of describing himself to his reader.My favorite poem by Walt Whitman is his &quot;Song of Myself.&quot; It contains the seed of everything he had lived as a human being and every vision he would realize as a mystic of epic proportions. After that, I believe his next great poem was &quot;I Sing The Body Electric.&quot; &quot;Drum Taps&quot; was also quite an interesting addition to &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Also, &quot;When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed&quot; is Whitman at his poetic best.So it is without any reservation that I am highly recommending &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; to all and sundry as a must read. Especially now, in the wake of 9/11 we need to reaffirm what it means to be American, and I know of no better American Visionary to help in this cause then Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I love poetry and Walt Whitman is one of my all time favorites.

He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go. He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay.I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents. They are in my mind, what I remember and imagine of them, increasingly clearly. There is so much more good will, mutual respect and intimacy aware to me now. I even have group therapy with them.I learned a lot about how to do this from carrying on with Walt Whitman!"},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"More as a point of clarification than review: the Oxford World's Classics edition is not the 1855 edition.

And he is the one who too speaks of it at the moment of its great outward expansion and hope, as a historical progress of ever rising ever more sweepingly inclusive cosmic concentrical circles. He is a writer who touches the stars, and above all reaches the sense of the light within us (When I heard the learned Astronomer) He touches upon American tragedy ( O Captain my Captain) and most deeply expresses it ( Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking) He is the one who takes all America as an adventure and feast for his eyes and lines.

It is, alongside the poems of Hart Crane, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Blake, Lawrence, Emily Dickinson and St John Perse, a totally singular experience. I have never read anything like \\"Song Of Myself\\" and \\"The Sleepers\\", and I am certain that you will love them just as much.I do, however, have certain reservations about Malcolm Cowley's introduction. It is well-intentioned enough, but I would like to issue a few words of warning, as it is certainly a very confused affair, one that will no doubt perplex many Whitman neophytes. For Cowley, the task of Whitman interpretation couldn't be simpler, one need only look towards Indian Vedic philosophy and Buddhist scripture for an all-purpose key. While this certainly seems attractive and convenient- a lazy expedient for phlegmatic types- Cowley himself realizes that it is totally incongruous with certain aspects of Whitman:\\"Most of Whitman's doctrines, though by no means all of them, belong to the mainstream of Indian philosophy. In some respects he went against the stream. Unlike most of the Indian sages, for example, he was not a thoroughgoing idealist. He did not believe that the whole world of the senses, of desires, of birth and death, was only maya, illusion, nor did he hold that it was a sort of purgatory; instead he praised the world as real and joyful. He did not despise the body, but proclaimed that it was as miraculous as the soul.\\"Having meandered into a cul-de-sac, Cowley's attempt at escape is characteristically sloppy:\\"...it must be remembered that Indian philosophy or theology is not such a unified structure as it appears to us from a distance. Whitman might have found Indian sages or gurus and even whole sects that agreed with one or another of his heterodoxies (perhaps excepting his belief in material progress). One is tempted to say that instead of being a Christian heretic, he was an Indian rebel and sectarian. Sometimes he seems to be a Mahayana Buddhist...\\"Pedants are like spiders- they love cocooning themselves in their own contradictions. All of the difficulties that Cowley encounters here stem from his insufferable compulsion to categorise, and hence domesticate, Whitman. I take issue with this preposterous statement:\\"One is tempted to say...\\"No, Mr Cowley, YOU are tempted to make these conclusions, any sober reader is willing to meet Whitman on his own terms, to delight in his incomparable vigor. Further on, we find the following:\\"Since the Indian mystical philosophies are elaborate structures, based on conceptions that have been shaped and defined by centuries of discussion, they help to explain Whitman's ideas at points in the first edition whre he seems at first glance to be vague or self-contradictory. There is, for example, his UNUSUAL combination of realism- sometimes brutal realism- and serene optimism.\\"Unusual, perhaps, if you insist on translating the poem into Vedic terms. It is a little depressing that scholars are so blind to the revelatory miracles of Leaves Of Grass. Here was a poet attempting to forge new forms of expression commensurate to his time, a capacious, all-enveloping style that would sing the songs of democracy. To thank him for his troubles, scholars do the only thing they are capable of, dragging Whitman into the malodorous mire of comparison. This line is redolent of Plato, this one reeks of Vimalakirti, this shadowy section can be illuminated with the torch of the Gita, all of it is regurgitated thought, relics coated in new varnish.What makes matters worse is Cowley's admission that Whitman had read none of the cited works in 1852. Yet, the empirical evidence admits no contestation- the symptoms of Whitman's mystical paroxysm are largely identical with prior examples. \\"Leaves Of Grass\\", we are told, is another manifestation of the 'perennial philosophy'- for all of its ornate embellishments and flourishes, it is, in fact, not very revolutionary at all. Once you master the rudiments of said philosophy, the swelling surge of Whitman's writing is easily navigable. Here we see Cowley defeated by his own epistemological suppositions. Cowley's method, after all, is that of a good Platonist. Poetry, for him, marks a poet's gradual emergence from anamnesia, a rapturous remembrance of eternal truths.In actuality, the introduction is not really about \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" at all. It is about the scholar's will to power, his inexorable urge to subordinate every literary text to precedent. In reducing \\"Song Of Myself\\" to yet another incarnation of Hindu absorption, Cowley does a severe injustice to a great American poem. He would have us believe that \\"Song Of Myself\\" is little better than a journal entry in verse, a haphazard approximation of a subjective mystical experience that has been repeated throughout history. To further substantiate his claim, Cowley compares a stanza in \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" to a Vedic text, noting their thematic and stylistic similarities. Does this not consolidate Whitman's unflinching faith in metempsychosis? In \\"Song Of Myself\\", Whitman effects the transmigration of souls, channelling the voice of the Vedas. The complacence and self-contentment of Cowley is, for this reader at least, truly vulgar.I am not disputing the notion that Whitman has a consistent doctrine beneath all of his creative output, but the system must be sought WITHIN his texts and NOT without. This is the thought that courses throughout all of Whitman's writing, that of pure immanence. To those approaching Whitman for the first time, I hope you have the good sense to treat Cowley's introduction with the bemusement that it deserves."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

I don't really enjoy his poetry that much. I value it as important. This specific edition (ISBN: 0140421998) is a recreation of the very first edition of Leaves of Grass. Over the years Whitman added poems and changed some of these so you'd be reading the first draft of some things, so to speak. This is the best edition, in my opinion. It shows Whitman at his freshest and I think he second-guessed himself too much with some of the revisions.

Outward from his home on Brooklyn, Whitman soars out over our great nation, painting a sweeping portrait of mid-nineteenth century America and its diverse inhabitants. Whitman covers a panorama of ideas and themes, from lofty, aloof musings on the nature of man, to piercing depictions of the horrors of war. Gems of wisdom hang from Whitman's web of of verse like dew drops - easy to see but hard to grasp. This is a powerful work, and a never-ending source of beauty. Unfortunately for me, I am not a big fan of free verse, making this work harder for me to enjoy than I had hoped.Which edition do I recommend? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are just interested in getting a taste of Whitman, I would recommend some of the abridged versions. I don't feel that reading all 700+ pages of Whitman's poetry is necessary for anyone but his biggest fans and students. For a complete version, I found the Modern Library edition acceptable, but nothing spectacular. This work has a multitude of editions, and I would recommend actually holding them in your hand before making a decision on which best suits your needs."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book.

The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the \\"strongest/purest\\" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 \\"perfect\\" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with \\"the deathbed edition\\" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions.

Leaves of Grass is a truly inspired work...its words are boundless and fluent, rising in an intoxicating crescendo of naked emotion. \\"I am the poet of the Body; and I am the poet of the Soul.&quot; Throughout Leaves of Grass there is an overwhelming theme of unity...unity of man and nature, of man and man, of man and God.

I became a Whitman disciple. Either version is a good place to start, but the 1855 is the best version of the early poems and a fine introduction to W.W.The 1855 version was ignored for quite a long time in Whitman studies, but started recieving critical attention after Malcolm Cowley worked to revive it in the 1950's. It was his version that used to be available, until recently, as a Penguin Classic.So whats the difference between 1855 and the Deathbed one?Throughout his lifetime, Whitman not only expanded LOG, his only book, with gobs of inferior-- and sometimes truly awful-- poems (especially when he was older) but he also revised many of his early poems for later editions-- revising them almost always for the worse.The 1855 edition is realtively short and reflects the diminutive, obscure quality of the original. The poems are full of Whitman's original fire before he tinkered with them.Bloom, the author of the introduction, is in the estimation of many America's best living literary critic. He profoundly knows and adores Walt Whitman.If you have the slightest interest in reading American Poetry,drop whatever you are reading (unless it is perhaps Dickinson or Emerson) and get this book. It's still America's best. Nothing since has been (and nothing will ever be) better. The only American poets after Whitman who mattered were deep readers of LOG: Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot, John Ashbury. (A Ginsberg, C. Sandberg, and O. Paz resemble him superficially but they are are wonks.)If you are interested later in getting all of Whitman's poems, skip all the in-between editions and get the 'Deathbed' Version, which has many good and important poems like 'When Lilacs Last in The Dooryard Bloomed' and 'As I Ebbed with the Ocean of Life'-- as well as many bad ones, to go with your 1855.The Deathbed Version (Whitman approved it as the final Version of his one book as he lay dying) is probably close to ten times as long as the 1855 edition.But Whitman got it right in 1855."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Giving Walt Whitman only five stars out of five does him an injustice. Walt Whitman is perhaps the finest American poet ever as well as the most quintessentially American poet. His poetry never dates itself. It is as contemporary as if he just wrote it last week. Walt Whitman's poems overflow with life and energy, pulsate with excitement, and contain deep though simply-told truths that rival those of any wise man in history. Much maligned during life and after for the eroticism of his writing, he never let his inhibitions hold back his writing and thus it sparkles with honesty. Walt Whitman was also a great patriot, who loved America in a way modern Americans would do well to emulate. He sought it out on its own terms and recorded what he saw in his poetry. His war poems, written during the American Civil War, are some of the best war poems existing in literature. Whitman knew his subject, having spent much time caring for the wounded soldiers in the hospitals and visiting battlefields. His poems create vivid pictures, richly textured, as real as you read them as if you were seeing the scene yourself. And the dialog he carries on with the reader makes the reader feel that Whitman, if he were still alive, would like nothing more than to sit down and discuss life. He is one of the few poets who manages to establish a rapport with his reader, to anticipate his reader's reactions and talk to each one through the poem. Walt Whitman should be read by any and every literate American.

Being a native of Brooklyn myself I feel a deep connection to him. When I read his work I am instantly transported into his universe, a universe which is the domain of every man. For Walt Whitman was possibly the greatest democrat who ever lived.In his great poem, Song of Myself, his opening lines are: &quot;I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot; This is not only good old American horse sense, it's good science. For everything comes forth from that great source of life the sun, and none can be better for it, only different.Walt was a born visionary. And I surmise that he must have had quite a few mystical experiences before he set out to write his great poems. You can really get a sense of his mystical connection when you read poems like When I Heard The Learned Astronomer or even in Song of Myself when he proclaims: &quot;There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.&quot; Notice the emphasis on the word now. Mystics through the ages have said that God is beyond time, that God is the eternal presence, and that he exists in a timeless eternity sometimes referred to as the eternal now. I believe that's what Walt Whitman is telling us.I could go on and on singing the praises of Walt Whitman. His work is inexhaustable and profound and wise beyond measure. But there are innumerable books written about him. However, I believe to catch the essence of the man you have to read his poems. And if you let him in he will lead you to yourself and you will see the world through fresh eyes .... and you will see how the perennial grass covers only the outer layer of this our miraculous universe."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"He mixes politics, sociology, and sexuality in a single prose.

It has no searchable table of contents or index and I very much needed that. If all you want is to read it from 0% to 100% completion and not skip around, as I need to do, then spend your $.99. I returned mine and for another $2.00 bought the Floating Wolf Quarterly edition which is perfect for an ebook and I give FIVE stars.One other note to the publishers and to Amazon. One buys a book for two reasons. One is for the content, the story or facts that it contains and for that it could be handwritten on construction paper or kleenex. But the second reason is feel, ease of use, convenience and a certain unsayable aesthetic quality. These ebook editions lack severely in the aesthetic area but are wonderful in the convenience category. So, I wish the publishers would spend a little more time perfecting the convenience areas, even in the 99 cent versions. For many these books are what people begin with when they purchase a new e-reader and can lead to bigger sales later. You guys are missing the boat by more than just a few minutes here."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"While I love Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" I wouldn't quite consider this a reproduction of the \\"original\\" edition. The editor has highlighted certain passages in green, and added commentary and exercises at the end of each poem. I suspect lots of folks won't mind this. For me it's cause enough to return the book.I pre-ordered this item because I was intent on finding an edition with the 1855 preface, but without some new person's additions to the classic work. I very much would like to read the work as Whitman presented it, without interjections from an editor or some other new person whose voice for me is an interruption.This editor presents this work as a means for writers to find inspiration for their own work, and attempts to guide or at least aid the reader in that project. For someone like me, for whom writing (and reading) is intensely personal, and who prefers to work directly with the text, without intervention, this is just not the right book."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman is one of the most famous, widely read, and influential poets - one of the few who can truly be said to have revolutionized poetry. Free verse's true originator, he broke free of formal shackles way back in 1855, nearly three quarters of a century before it became standard. He proved that great poetry could be written without traditional trappings - and it has never been the same. Many, including me, think it has gone too far in the other direction, but this is not Whitman's fault; his work is undeniably great, and we have in many was long since suffered weak imitations. There is simply no equaling him, much less replacing him; his work is as essential a part of American literature as Mark Twain's. He is indeed the Twain of verse, to be anachronistic - as monumental, all-important, and epoch-forming as Twain was in prose. Technicalities aside, this had almost as much to do with subject matter; Whitman famously self-proclaimed \\"America has a bard at last!\\" - and so it did. He freed American poetry from European heritage, making truly national art that both defined its era and instantly became timeless, speaking to the heart of all that America and Americans stood and stand for. The great poet of democracy, he preached the gospel of westward expansion, celebrated America's natural beauty, extolled its unique history and exciting new status, championed its values, chronicled the Civil War, dramatized the struggle over slavery and other national debates, and generally held forth about the country's unmatched cosmopolitanism in all areas from ethnicity to landscapes. He also somehow managed to write about sexuality with unprecedented openness and vigor, striking a blow against Victorian prudery that would eventually prove fatal and even laying the foundations for non-heterosexual identity. Accomplishing even one of these deeds would have been truly remarkable; Whitman did them all.Yet he published only one poetry book - 1855's Leaves of Grass, which went through several updates through his 1892 death. He not only continuously added poems but extensively revised older ones, sometimes dropping some and moving others. For example, the original and final versions of his masterpiece Song of Myself are substantially different. Many key poems were there from the start, but some of the most famous and best - including the Civil War and associated Abraham Lincoln ones - came later. None of the many poems added late in life were nearly on par with prior masterpieces, but nearly all were worthwhile. Whitman wanted the 1892 edition to supersede the rest, and editors have nearly always complied; it is by far the most popular and widely available and the one that nearly all readers will want.And what a version it is! - hundreds of poems plus several prose prefaces and a prose afterword over nearly five hundred pages. To have so much greatness in one book - especially from one person - is near-unbelievable; the depth of Whitman's achievement simply staggers. Nearly all the poems are worthy, and many are great; quite a few are pure masterpieces. Included are some of the all-time great poems like \\"Song of Myself,\\" \\"I Sing the Body Electric,\\" \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\\" \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\\" \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\\" \\"By Blue Ontario's Shore,\\" and \\"Passage to India,\\" plus many superb short poems. Anyone even remotely interested in poetry must be familiar with these; there have always been some for whom Whitman just does not click, but even they must be prepared to deal with him, so great is his influence.Great as the 1892 Edition is, it is possible for both hard-cores and casuals to complain. Many of the latter will say that it is simply too imposing - too many poems, too many pages. I certainly would not advise anyone who has read very little or no Whitman to jump right in; it is definitely a lot to take in at once, and the poems are by no means of equal quality or importance. One would be far better off reading a selected edition first, but everyone should come here eventually; indeed, nearly all will want to after the first tantalizing taste. Conversely, diehards have always complained about various aspects, from poems it leaves out to various changes made to included ones. The most important omission in my view is Whitman's original prose introduction, which served as his poetic manifesto. The dedicated will of course want to seek out this and every version of every poem, but their complaints are of interest to very few. The 1892 Edition will satisfy nearly everyone.This is not the most deluxe version; one can find various critical editions with extensive commentary, notes, etc. as well as variorum versions. However, this is one of the most widely available and is very affordable. Taking this into account, it has fairly generous supplemental material: a good basic Introduction, a short glossary and bibliography, and an index of titles and first lines with original and final publication dates. This is the ideal Leaves of Grass for most, but everyone should have it in some form. It is one of very few books truly essential for all. Even those who do not like poetry may well like Whitman, and anyone even remotely interested in American literature, history, or culture must be acquainted Leaves, so thoroughly has it penetrated popular culture and entered the American consciousness. Bookshelves missing this might almost as well be empty."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Choosing the fullest, most complete version of Whitman's text, before the final editing of the deathbed edition, but following the additions made after the Civil War, the Norton Critical is a must have for students of poetry, or literature, and of nature.

Then I had an English teacher that introduced me to what I can only characterize as adult poetry. No more, Joyce Kilmer. Here was something that challenged me intellectually. High on the list of my favorites was Whitman and \\"Leaves of Grass\\".Now, in my 50's I decided to see if I would bring away something different, so I revisited this classic. I can testify that there is much still there; although my tastes in poetry have matured quite a bit. I don't find Whitman quite as \\"shocking\\" in light of the social changes that I've seen since my youth.Still, there is a certain nostalgia that makes Whitman eminantly readable. I imagine that if IBM's Watson composed poetry, it would be a lot like this in form and content.

That's when I found this wonderful book. I haven't seen enough races in my lifetime to dispute the order of selection, but what I can say is that if you want to learn about the greatest American racehorses of the last century, this is the place to start. I have spent a lot of time on the internet and in libraries researching various horses, but I find myself going back to Thoroughbred Champions time and again. My only wish is that somebody in Europe had done a similar book featuring the likes of Seabird 2, Ribot, Mill Reef, Nijinsky 2,Brigadier Gerard, Dancing Brave, Shergar, Hyperion, etc. I don't gamble; I'm mainly interested in the achievements and stories of great horses and I find stories such as those contained in this book a wonderful way to enjoy the sport. If the Seabiscuit movie or the Smarty Jones craze have piqued your interest in these wonderful athletes, then you'll want to get this book and learn about some of the finest racehorses ever to cross under the wire.*** Since writing this review, Stephen Arnott was kind enough to recommend a book by Julian Wilson regarding European horses. I've found the book and it's called \\"The Great Race Horses.\\" It's a perfect companion book to this one. If you can't find it on Amazon, you might have luck, as I did, finding it at amazon.com.uk.

A trivia discussion with a Star Trek fiend? Well, they're pussycats (or maybe Shetland ponies) compared with the folks who argue about the best racehorse ever.This book, from the staff of the BloodHorse, is great material, whether you agree with it or not. It's the top 100 racehorses of the 20th century, at least if they raced in the US at least once, and were flat racers (steeplechasers are usually Thoroughbreds too, but if they came to glory over the jumps, as Man O'War's great son Battleship did, don't look too hard for them here).But the great flat racers are here, from Phar Lap to Shuvee and Dr. Fager to Forego. Their pictures and their pedigrees and the stories about them are all well done, though I wanted more than 2 pages about many of the horses lower on the list.The hotly debated #1 pick was Man O'War, who carried 130 pounds as a 2 year old, ran distances from sprints to 2 miles, was almost never allowed to run all out (racing many times with his head pulled into his chest) and was beaten only by a starter who opened the race when he was standing sideways....well, you can guess where my bias lies.It would be great to line Man O'War, Secretariat, Dr. Fager, Forego, Kelso, Phar Lap and a few others up at Belmont for a mile and a half challenge on a cool, sunny autumn morning. Since we can't do this, we'll just have to hash out our opinions and sort out the facts - and this book is well designed to help us to just that!(oh, and my favorite horse of all time is well down the list at #46 - Majestic Prince - I wept when he limped off the track at Belmont, never to race again, but he's placed about right here since he never carried weight and never raced against older horses)"},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"This is a wonderful summary review of what the Blood-Horse panel decided were the top 100 of the 20th century (even if the century should not include 1900 and should include 2000). Arguments will rage about horses' placings, but that's just natural. (Personally, it's a plus for me that they placed Man O'War above Secretariat - I agree, JohnsonR!) My only real disappointment was that there were no complete past-performances for each horse. I'm a statistics wonk and I love to get my hands on PPs for horses. I am grateful they included at least a recapitulation, both total and season. And in the &quot;Leaders Lists&quot; in the back of the book, I still don't know what they mean by &quot;Most Wins&quot; when all they show is the horse and how many wins there were. I question it because I know that Exterminator, for example, had 50 wins - that is more than Round Table's 43 which is shown as the &quot;highest&quot; on this little chart. That puzzles me to no end! But overall, it's a great book if you want a summary of the horse's life and career, and nice photos on very nice paper!"},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"I've been a racing fan for a long time. I will neither agree nor will I disagree with the book. Something that not too many people know is that Excellor and Ferdinand both ended their lives brutally in the slaughter plants to be butchered and eaten by the rich who can afford horse steaks. Many other thoroughbreds end up in the slaughter plants right here in this country. These are not the old, infirmed, ill or crazy horses but healthy, young horses that could become champions in their own class. Congress has a bill in committee right now to ban this atrocity in our country. The bill is S 1915 to ban horse slaughter in America. If you love racing and the horses, please contact your senators to ask that they co-sponsor and support S 1915.Another book that may be of interest to you is \\"After the Finish Line\\".

Perhaps it should have been alphabetical with an appendix with opinions of the top 100? My quibble with it is lower placing of my favorite horse of all time Damascus. I saw both Damascus and Spectacular Bid run and I thought Damascus was the better of the two. Damascus was a durable racehorse and won at 1 1/2 and 2 miles which the Bid did not do. Not that I don't think Spectacular Bid wasn't great--he was, but I thought Damascus better. Damascus also had sterner competition for his Horse of the Year title in 1967: Dr. Fager and Buckpasser. There was nobody remote close in class to compete with Spectacular Bid for the title in 1980. One of my all time favorite fillies did not even make the list: the ill-fated Dark Mirage (she was first winner of the Triple Crown for fillies and some people thought she had a shot at Horse of the Year in 1968, the same year Dr. Fager and Damascus competed!). I also thought Seattle Slew superior to Dr. Fager. I saw both run and Seattle Slew, I felt was more versatile at all distances not to mention being a Triple Crown winner, though he'd have had a very difficult time grappling with Dr. Fager at a mile or less."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"This a great book.

However, while Man O' War was indeed a great horse...definitely deserving to be in the top five, he was not Secretariat, who, in my opinion, was far and away the choice to be number one. Secretariat set a track record in the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont, and but for a malfunctioning clock, would have done the same in the Preakness. Man O' War, by comparison, didn't even run in the Kentucky Derby.

I wish Blood-Horse would give her more credit."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"A kindly rebuttal of the Secretariat bashing taking place by some reviewers. 16 victories in 21 career starts, record time in all three Triple Crown Races (his Preakness time was properly edited in 1999 representing the record). As for Hawkster who ran 1 1/2 mile in 2:22 2/5 on TURF in 1989 at Santa Anita on what the announcer described as an \\"unusually fast surface\\" (check YouTube), shows the adominable nature of 2:24 in the Belmont. No horse has come within 9 legnths of Secretariat's run in 73' on the dirt. I agree that Secretariat was not the greatest horse in racing history but on that day in 1973 at Belmont Park, he would have obliterated any other horse in the proud history of the sport of kings. Buy the book however and let the debate begin. We have been led to believe that the greatest horses travelled the dusty track in the 1970's, I believe this book challenges that assumption quite well."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"I loved this book.

I think this many times as I look among the one hundred names of racing greats, but it doesn't stop me from loving this compilation.Regardless of ranking, it was fun and entertaining to read again the stories of the immortal legends of the sport, and to learn about the less famous names. Although there was usually no more than two pages per horse (the top 20 do get about four pages each), we get a glimpse into what made these horses great, whether it be a long and glorious career, or a single championship season. As there is so little space, there is very little ground covered on the connections of the horses; it is mostly about them and even then mostly their greatest achievements. At the end of each horse's page, there is a statistics chart with the record of the horse split into their starts/win/loss record per season, as well as seasonal earnings, which was very helpful for me.I would recommend this title to any horse racing fan.

It is also east coast biased.Round Table, who set 16 world or track marks and carried up to 136 pounds was a truly GREAT horse and superior to Secretariat, as were Swaps, Kelso, Northern Dancer, Citation, Dr. Fager and others who ran brilliantly under high imposts, but who didn't have the benefit of a rabid TV press corps of adoring neophytes making them a household name. Unarguably Secretariat had 3 great races, and still holds one remaining world record. He never carried over 126 pounds, though, and was beaten while being given weight. He was, in short, vastly overrated.Noor beat Citation 4 times yet winds up near 70th.

Whitely stated she was the best ever and he had Forgo in his stable. Laurin said she was greater than Secretariat. Remember the headlines she would beat Secretariat in head-to-head competition? I do. I also remember the industry hailing her as the greatest ever. Certainly one would have to go back to Eclipse to match her past performances. The whole industry hung their hopes of saving racing on her. And she brought legends of new fans to the track. Of course that was before the Great Match Race (one has to wonder what would have been so great about #35 vs #97). After that an industry embarassed by what its own greed had done reverted to making Ruffian the scapegoat for her own death as well as that of the industry. They also reverted to their old sexist ways. As a result they have been trying to destroy and belittle the legacy of this great horse (do you see her monument at KHP?). Sad thing is the racing industry never understood what brought her fans to the track. It had nothing to do with gambling (no one would get rich given her odds) but everything thing to do with a love of beauty and an appreciation of sheer perfection. Of course, no one expected the show of tremendous heart, courage and determination she exhibited in the match race. That made her immoral to her fans and proved an added embarassment to the industry. If ever the industry would give Ruffian her just due, they just might see her type of fans return to the tracks (and related sites such as KHP) in legend."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"...editors are idiots. *secret* when the editors voted secretariat was firmly in first place with only one editor left to vote, and he LEFT OFF secretariat as one of the top thoroughbreds of the 20th century so man o'war could take first prize. what a putz! man o'war was great, but charlie hatton, longtime editor of the daily racing form who saw BOTH horses run in person always said that secretariat was the finest racehorse ever ('the pinnacle of achievement in thoroughbred racing, the finest example of the blooded horse'). can't argue with secretariat's 22 pound heart, largest on record."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"If there ever was a horse better than Secretariat, he would have had to spread his wings and fly!!

While most of the horses were and are familiar names to racing fans, some are not so well-known. Each horse is described in brief yet highly detailed biographies, and there are photographs galore.As I said, there will be arguments as to which horses were the best, and the authors note how low the fillies, especially Ruffian, arguably a top 10 horse, ended up on the list. There was also some controversy over Secretariat's ranking, as one of the seven experts did not even list him in the top 10, thus he managed to finish only number two on the list, behind Man O' War (this immediately calls into question the &quot;expertise&quot; of the unidentified panelist).But that's what these lists are for, to provoke discussion and even argument. I found this book endlessly fascinating."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"&quot;Thoroughbred Champions&quot; does a meticulous job of presenting the top one hundred Thoroughbreds who raced in America (at least once) during the 20th century. Each racehorse is pictured with accompanying statistics. Stories flesh out the statistics and try to give us a feeling for the drama inherent in owning, or working with, or following the career of one of these beautiful animals. One of my favorite stories describes Personal Ensign's final race:&quot;Four lengths were all that separated Personal Ensign from a perfect career. With an eight of a mile to go in the 1988 Breeders' Cup distaff, it seemed an impossible amount of ground for the bay filly to close on the leader, Winning Colors. It took about fourteen seconds for that final eighth to be run, but it seemed like an eternity. Personal Ensign closed the gap relentlessly, inching slowly toward Winning Colors, and at the wire, she thrust a desperate nose in front of her younger rival.&quot;I watched that last race of hers on T.V. I was recovering from abdominal surgery at the time, and I think I must have busted a stitch or two trying to 'help' Personal Ensign down that muddy track and over the finish line ahead of her rival (who had already won the 1988 Kentucky Derby).Because these equine champions mean so much to some of us, there has been and will be lots of disagreement over the order in which they were placed on the list. Why, for instance does Easy Goer appear ahead of both Ruffian and Personal Ensign, not to mention Busher, Twilight Tear, and Dahlia? Both Busher and Twilight Tear were voted Horse of the Year---an honor that eluded Easy Goer.Here is the list as compiled by the seven panel members chosen by &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot;:1.

I just received my copy and have been so deeply absorbed in it that the afternoon just flew by on golden hoofs. I've been an enthusiast of thoroughbred racing since, at a very tender age, my dad brought me to the stables at Belmont Park to see a friend who works there. They showed me a huge gray horse and I was so small I looked up into that massive animal's face, felt his warm breath on my face...and fell totally in love. The horse was Native Dancer, the love affair continues though I am now getting closer to retirement age. This wonderful book will take you from one champ to the next and all I could say was &quot;I agree, I agree&quot; as I moved down the list of the top 100. Though I knew most, there were some I did not know and those interested me the most. The list, together with pictures, pedigree and a small writeup on each makes this book a keeper! an encyclopedia of the 100 greatest thoroughbreds!"},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"I was so thrilled to find such a well-written &amp; reserached guide to some of the best TB race-horses of our century!

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"I bought this book a few months ago and am still reading it, so don't be afraid of finishing it quickly! With tons of information about each horse and nice photos too, in color whenever possible, this beautiful coffee-table book will teach you about the history and current records of Thoroughbred racing. The exciting, well-written book really lets you take a peek into one hundred horses' lives; it's not just meaningless words and numbers. I think it's fascinating to place a century's worth of champions next to each other and rate them; finish reading the information and looking at a black-and-white photo for a horse in the early 1900's, turn the page and a clear color photo of a horse who raced just a few years ago appears. I love Thoroughbred racing, and this book recreates the excitement of a historic race, inspiring debates, memories and discussions about the featured equines, as well as informing those new to the sport about those famous names in modern champions' pedigrees."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"Like so many I guess, I seriously got into horse racing after I'd seen the Seabiscuit movie.... I went on reading Hillenbrand's book and from there on, I was helplessly done in. I moved up to Man O' War, from there to Secretariat, and finally I found this book. I was thrilled and still am. While of course virtually every horse's position in these top hundred is arguable, like the editors do acknowledge in the very introduction and as everyone may see for themselves in some fierce reviews of the book right here, I think this is not the real point of this book. I see it as a fantastic collection of all these magnificient champions I guess none of us would want to miss today. Whichever horse is first, second or last, these were all outstanding creatures that had the heart and soul, courage and strength to compete like they did. They lifted everyone up as they soared across the dirt or turf, they made and still make us dream. To have them all together in one book with pedigrees and pictures is awesome.I am way too young (and moreover not american) to have seen the better number of them run, but I keep coming back to this book with the same fascination every time. It sends me dreaming, trying to imagine and of course... wanting more. Like one other reviewer, I think it's a great starting point for anyone who's gotten interested in horse racing. Enjoy !"},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Many people disagree on the placings of different horses, but I think it must have been hard to compare horses from different eras. Books like these were made to provoke discussions, anyway. I like the little charts at the end of the book that name things such as most wins, most starts, etc. One of the main things I like about this book that it contains one photograph (2 photos of numbers 1-20), past performances, and a four generation pedigree of each horse. Before I ordered the book, I suspected that the photos would be tiny and barely visible, but the photos are easy to see.This was a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"This book, compiled by a panel of seven from The Blood-Horse, provides an excellent run-down on 100 of the greatest horses to grace the Thoroughbred racing scene in America during the 1900s. Each horse is honored with a brief biography (the top 20 horses get four pages each, and all the rest get two) that describes his/her history, racing career, and any notable offspring or other key accomplishments in clear and easy-to-read language. In addition, a race record, pedigree, and one or two nice photographs of each is provided.At the back of the book one will find a few more helpful resources. A table of the chosen 100 provides a nice quick-reference to year of birth, owner, breeder, and trainer. There is also a \\"Leaders List\\" with interesting statistics, including horses with the most wins, unbeaten horses, once-beatens, horses with the most starts, Kentucky Derby (and Triple Crown) winners, multimillionaires, geldings, top trainers, top breeders, and the foaling years that produced the most champions.The 100 horses included are ranked as follows:(1) Man O'War; (2) Secretariat; (3) Citation; (4) Kelso; (5) Count Fleet; (6) Dr. Fager; (7) Native Dancer; (8) Forego; (9) Seattle Slew; (10) Spectacular Bid; (11) Tom Fool; (12) Affirmed; (13) War Admiral; (14) Buckpasser; (15) Colin; (16) Damascus; (17) Round Table; (18) Cigar; (19) Bold Ruler; (20) Swaps; (21) Equipoise; (22) Phar Lap; (23) John Henry; (24) Nashua; (25) Seabiscuit; (26) Whirlaway; (27) Alydar; (28) Gallant Fox; (29) Exterminator; (30) Sysonby; (31) Sunday Silence; (32) Skip Away; (33) Assault; (34) Easy Goer; (35) Ruffian; (36) Gallant Man; (37) Discovery; (38) Challedon; (39) Armed; (40) Busher; (41) Stymie; (42) Alysheba; (43) Northern Dancer; (44) Ack Ack; (45) Gallorette; (46) Majestic Prince; (47) Coaltown; (48) Personal Ensign; (49) Sir Barton; (50) Dahlia; (51) Susan's Girl; (52) Twenty Grand; (53) Sword Dancer; (54) Grey Lag; (55) Devil Diver; (56) Zev; (57) Riva Ridge; (58) Slew o' Gold; (59) Twilight Tear; (60) Native Diver; (61) Omaha; (62) Cicada; (63) Silver Charm; (64) Holy Bull; (65) Alsab; (66) Top Flight; (67) Arts and Letters; (68) All Along; (69) Noor; (70) Shuvee; (71) Regret; (72) Go For Wand; (73) Johnstown; (74) Bald Eagle; (75) Hill Prince; (76) Lady's Secret; (77) Two Lea; (78) Eight Thirty; (79) Gallant Bloom; (80) Ta Wee; (81) Affectionately; (82) Miesque; (83) Carry Back; (84) Bimelech; (85) Lure; (86) Fort Marcy; (87) Gamely; (88) Old Rosebud; (89) Bewitch; (90) Davona Dale; (91) Genuine Risk; (92) Sarazen; (93) Sun Beau; (94) Artful; (95) Bayakoa; (96) Exceller; (97) Foolish Pleasure; (98) Beldame; (99) Roamer; (100) Blue LarkspurOf course there will be debate over the rankings. The top three - Man O'War, Secretariat, and Citation (rated in that order) - in particular will fuel heated and unending dispute. But one must take into account that these horses raced in different times, under different conditions. Track surfaces, weight carried, equipment used, living conditions, diet, training methods, quality of the competition, types of races entered, and more all varied greatly. Some were dirt horses and some turf horses. Some were sprinters and some ran longer distances. Some were pacesetters and some were come-from-behind horses. The only way to know for sure which ones were better than others would be to line them all up and race them against each other. But we can't do that. So the rankings given here should be taken rather lightly, and not be the focal point of the book. Rather, it is a nice, concise overview of a group of 100 very good racehorses, and that is all it should be taken for.The book is not a completely comprehensive reference - those looking for in-depth information on one particular horse would need to read additional sources, as the biographies here are just very brief overviews squeezed into a couple pages - but it makes for interesting reading and the statistics and pedigrees given can be quite useful. On the whole I would highly recommend this to any Thoroughbred racing enthusiast."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"Sure there will be some who disagree with some of the rankings, but it's all subjective and those with a differing opinion should realize that. Plus the voting wasn't just a bunch of nobody's, it was the opinion of a respected and knowledgeable panel. To paraphrase what Nack says in the intro, the best thing about the list is that it causes you to think about the candidates and draw your own list. In my opinion, the fillies are shorted a bit. Ruffian at 35? Undefeated Personal Insign #48? Honest Lady at #76 and Miesque at #82, and who could forget Genuine Risk at #91, though she was fouled out being the only filly to take the first two legs of the Triple Crown. I'm of the belief that under Whittingham and Shoemaker, Spectacular Bid may have never lost. Say what you want about going a mile and a half, but he only lost at those distances after stepping on a pin once and a second to the older Affirmed when Bid was not tightened for that race. True, he didn't have competition in the form of other horses, but his competition came from the clock, which he stopped in record times at different distances for all three years of his career. If not for the Belmont accident, he'd be top 5 for sure."},{"Title":"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century","review":"A magnifient collection of interesting data, personal experiences and observations with good photos, written in a fine concise and appealing style!

I wonder why Ferdinand was not included. I love every horse in the book. I found reading about the earlier horses in the 1900s facinating.In conclusion to those who believe horse racing is cruel. What are the consequences of shutting down the industry? First hundreds of current runners, broodmares, studs, foals, fillies & colts in training will be shipped to Canada & Mexico for slaughter. Some of the trucks will be suitable for cattle, sheep, & pigs where an equine has no room to hold up it's head. Some of the horses will end up at slaughter with broken limbs & necks or kicked to death. They will not be fed nor watered all the way to Canada or Mexico. Then the jockeys, the trainers, the race course gate keepers, the concession stand workers, the bartenders, waitresses, ticket takers, gardeners, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, office employees, janitors, & more will be unemployed.

And, if any horse is \\"too low\\" in placement here, based purely on \\"performance figures\\", it's Swaps! No horse has more World Records to his credit! Man O'War, himself had five (5), while Swaps' numbered seven (7)! These aren't just \\"Track records\\" but the fastest \\"any horse\\" had ever run, ANYWHERE, up to that time in history!

The more research you do, the more obvious it becomes. Not only did Swaps set more World, and \\"American Records\\", (so-called since folks in Europe were a little slow to trust time pieces and didn't bother to time their races), than any other horse, but he's also described in the offical race records of the day, as being \\"eased\\" in EVERYONE of his \\"World Record\\" efforts. Setting World Records, on both coasts, mind you, and being \\"eased\\" is just not done, especially carrying 130 lbs.! True, he didn't run in the rest of the triple crown races,(after dusting Mashua in the Derby, it seems there were \\"problem details\\" in entering in the Belmont), but he did return to California and beat a excellent field of \\"Older Horses\\", in early June, which included the previous year's Derby winner, Determine as a 4 yr. old!!... Something that BloodHorse editor Joe Estes said at the time, \\"was beyond all memory, in American Racing\\"! Oh, andthat race was also his first World Record!

And I was dismayed that they voted for the way overrated Secretariat as second place. When he was three, he lost 3 stakes races out of 12 starts with no excuse (a 75% win record). Many horses in the top twenty had better percentages. And Kali, they, too, set speed records (Swaps has several to his record, so does Spectacular Bid). As Ben Jones said \\"Time only counts when you are in jail\\". Contrary to what you wrote, Man o' War broke many speed records in his day. The problem is that speed records are meant to be broken, and they are constantly. Even Secretariat's phenomenal 2:24 in the Belmont has been broken (2:22 and a fraction by a good horse named Hawkster).In my view, Citation should be number one instead of number three for many reasons. It's almost impossible to compare horses from two different eras, but Citation was Man 0' War's equal in many respects. If he had been retired after his third year, he would have had a lifetime record of 29 starts with 27 wins and two excusable seconds. No horse in the book comes close to that. Against older horses (neither Secretariat or Man o' War raced against older horses as many times as Citation did).Well, enough of that. The bios of the horses vary in quality, from average to very good. The photos are wonderful though, some even in color. I agree that the fillies are given short shrift here, and some should be much more highly ranked than they are.But if you are a racing fan, this is a fun book to have.

Better to see an intelligent film like \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" with true multiculturalism, than suffer the authors'stated attitude (on page 96-97) that American life \\"subverted\\" old customs.

It's a must read book!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Personally, I come from the Sherlock Holmes school of detective fiction, but I found The Murder of Roger Ackroyd highly entertaining. What makes the story enjoyable is that there are many extraneous sub-plots that confound the mystery and draw attention away from the actual murder. Each chapter reveals a new twist in the plot which only seems to add to the list of suspects. The most enjoyable aspect of the book is the rather unexpected and unconventional ending. As it turns out, a seemingly minute and overlooked detail turns out to be the case cracker for Hercule Poirot. If I had any complaint about this book, it would be about Poirot himself. Being somewhat biased towards the Sherlock Holmes character, I was somewhat stunned at Poirot's abrasive lack of modesty. Holmes is not modest, but this is because he believes modesty interferes with one's own mental processes. Poirot's seems to use his egocentric attitude to bully his suspects. He claims to know all, but much of this so-called knowledge seems more like guesswork. But as a whole, I liked the novel, because all the cards were on the table and I was capable of putting the pieces together myself (although I did so just a paragraph before the murderer was actually revealed).

I highly recommend this book, despite it's tedious middle."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was one of the best Agatha Christie books I've read so far. The beginning was good and as soon as the murder was committed, I really wanted to know who did it. I read most of the book in one day because I really wanted to get to the ending.

This book had a great solution and you should definitely read it."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book is definetly one of Christie's finest.

That funny little man Poirot is an absolute fav and the way that Ms Christie keeps me guessing right until the very end is amazing, every time she gets me."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I had some difficulty purchasing this book. It had to be purchased on my computer rather than my mobile Kindle. Once I purchased it on my computer and synchronized my mobile Kindle, the book loaded perfectly and no problem was present after that. The book itself was very good and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I am not certain that Agatha Christie was the first to write a novel in the way this one was written, but she certainly did it well! Having Dr. Sheppard write the novel on behalf of Hercule made this a treasure, and the story is revealed one page at a time. (I guess that sounds silly, but sometimes authors do jump around, and Agatha Christie does not).All of the clues are in place, the story is told in completeness, almost, but only Hercule Poirot can untangle the final story and reveal to us what his brain cells have already told him.While the Agatha Christie stories are now dated, if you have not read this particular novel of hers, I do recommend it as one of her best."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I've never been a huge fan of the \\"cozy\\" mystery, but in my rare ventures into that territory, I like to go with Agatha Christie, one of the biggest names in the genre. What little I knew of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was it somehow controversial, which to me was a virtue. Having now read the book, I can see where the controversy was at the time, but really, it is more cutting edge in a way I can't really discuss without spoiling things.It is not, I hope, too much of a spoiler to say that this book has a character named Roger Ackroyd and he is indeed murdered. Besides the normal police, the private investigator Hercule Poirot is called in to investigate. Ackroyd was a wealthy but often miserly man, and his murder brings forth a number of suspects, all with their own motives. The most suspicious in the bunch is his stepson Ralph Paton, who's disappeared shortly after the killing and stands to inherit a lot of money.Of course, in most mysteries, the obvious suspect is rarely the actual culprit. Poirot will slowly piece things together. Narrating the tale, almost as a Watson to the Holmes-like Poirot, is the local doctor, James Sheppard. Sheppard's nosy sister Caroline would serve as a precusor to Miss Marple, Christie's second most memorable character.The most memorable is Poirot, who is featured in nearly half of Christie's 80 books (Marple is in only a dozen or so). Like Sherlock Holmes, he is a brilliant but egotistical man with his share of affectations. And like many detectives of the era (including more hard-boiled sorts like Philip Marlowe), he is essentially an outsider; he will never get really involved in the other characters' lives and at the end of the novel, he will no doubt leave them with genial ease.This is a good book and would serve well as an introduction to both Christie and Poirot. The bits of cleverness you may notice may seem not surprising now, but when this book was released, they were more special. Even if you're not a big cozy mystery fan, this book still serves well for those who want to know the history of the mystery genre."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie (1890-1976) is the grande dame of the English mystery novel.

The murderer may well stymy all of your efforts to discover who is the criminal! If you have never had the immense joy of reading an Agatha Christie novel this book is a good place to begin your journey. Match your little grey cells against those of Poirot!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This mystery is one, if not THE, best Poirot mystery I have read yet. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is up there with Murder on the Orient Express with it's unique plot, red herrings, characters, and the amazing ending.The plot revolves around a suicide of an older woman and the murder of a man by the name of Roger Ackroyd. It is told from the perspective of Dr. Shepperd, the town doctor. The ending of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one-of-a-kind. The culprit was a complete surprise to me. The answer was there all along, so obvious, and yet so concealed. A great mystery overall."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie does it again with lots of twists and turns and a surprise ending. It was enjoyable to listen to the BBC radio drama actors, especially Hercule Poirot. They draw you into the story and keep your \\"little grey cells\\" turning."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I've been a Christie fan since 8th grade and have read them all so many times that I always remember whodunit. Nevertheless, I find them a relaxing and enjoyable read when I'm taking a break from more weighty fiction.This is one of the finest examples of the genre- I still remember being shocked at the murderer the first time I read this book. Hercule Poirot was certainly on his game when he tackled this country house mystery. Though Hastings and Inspector Japp were absent, it was delightful to get a fresh perspective on Poirot from the narrator, a country doctor with an inquisitive sister. Certainly an excellent read for any mystery fan, and an excellent introduction to Christie for the uninitiated."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Read this book for a book club and really enjoyed it. I never realized that Agatha Christie wrote so many mysteries. In fact, I had never read any of her books before this one. I really enjoyed it and would love to read another one of her books as well."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Reading this book felt like playing the board game Clue on the pages -- was it Mr. White in the dining room with the dagger?When Dr. Sheppard's friend Roger Ackroyd is murdered, everyone is a suspect. Hercule Poirot comes on the scene and the reader is drawn along, seeing only what Dr. Sheppard sees and never fully understanding what the miraculous Poirot is about to uncover. Dr. Sheppard's sister, the village gossip is a welcome, light-hearted addition to the story. Blackmail, drug use, neighborhood snoops, mysterious phone calls and betrayal all play a part in this wonderful mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Being a fan of past mystery book I have read, especially &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; by Agatha Christie I had no trouble picking up &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; The plot became a monotonous listing of facts and clues through dialog. It would've been almost impossible to predict the mystery through nearly the entire story with the given information. The end finally picked up and kept me interested, but the rest of the story just wasn't entertaining."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Truely one of the most surprising endings of a mystery book. Even if you're familliar with Christie's writing, this will very likely throw you off your feet.The story itself is a pleasent one, written in Christie's usual light manner. There are the colorful English characters, and all flows well enough, until the ending slaps you in the face like a full sized vegetable marrow. If you've guessed the ending, my hat's off to you. If not, don't feel bad, I've not met the person who has.If you'd like, you can keep your eye out for the clues - they are there; very very subtle, but planted in the book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I have always been one of the few who do not think this is Agatha Christie's best book, ro even among them. The plot in itself is pretty average, many of the characters boring. the murder is not at all original. The only thing which is brilliant (and i do mean. it is the best device i've ever read) is the final and stunning twists at the end. it is the best twist i have ever read, and suspect i will EVER read. So so so good. But then, no book deserves five starts for a simple twist. Apart from the end, this book is pretty average."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"First off, I was indeed surprised at the end. I had the unexpected displeasure of reading this book in bits and pieces over 3 weeks. So the subtle little clues alluded to at the end, in hindsight, I actually questioned at the time, but the time between readings let any questions be forgotten. So when the murderer was revealed I was a little ticked for not remembering these things.Oh, well. It was a very enjoyable read and I suggest it be read over a day or two paying close attention to the night of the murder."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Book reviews and movie reviews are much the same. Two people can read the same book and have totally opposite opinions.If one person loved it and the other hated it, is the book good or bad? Neither. Having said that, I found this not to be one of Agatha's best. No exotic locale, just a stodgy English village. The book itself seemed stodgy and pedantic, not a page-turner, by any means. And the ending......what a disappointment! Frustrating. No fair......."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"It seems almost a truism to say that Agatha Christie's characters are \\"one dimensional\\" and that her dialogue is \\"stilted;\\" BUT her endings are so tricky and so clever she's worth the effort.My opinion is the reverse! I loved this book precisely because the characters were so real and the dialogue so convincing. The ending, though tricky and clever, prevents me from giving this book a 5 star rating: it just didn't ring true; it's simply too difficult to imagine the culprit, whom you've gotten to know, as a sadistic blackmailer and a murderer.A wonderful story nonetheless.Dan C"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This Agatha Christie novel is written from the family doctor perspective, who is called late one evening to examine the death of his friend, Roger Ackroyd. Christie keeps the reader guessing until the very end of the book, with many characters possessing the motive for murder. The plot is also made more difficult by narrowing the time of the murder down to 10 or 15 minutes. Various characters lack alibis for this quarter of an hour, and the famous Hercule Poirot must ferret the truth out with a grand finale gathering of all the suspects (similar to a Thin Man movie). The reader will be surprised by the ending, as the murderer in Christie novels is not usually viewed from this perspective."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The narrator, James Sheppard M.D., tells about the little village of King's Abbot. Widow Ferrars died in her sleep from an overdose of veronal, a drug to induce sleep. Her husband died a year earlier - gossip said he was poisoned. Roger Ackroyd, an immensely rich manufacturer had thoughts of marrying widow Ferrars (they would be richer). Ackroyd was a widower without a child (Chapter 2), and lived in a mansion with relatives and servants. There is a new arrival, a stranger named Hercule Poirot. Conversations tell about the people and personalities. Later Dr. Sheppard visits Roger Ackroyd. A letter from Mrs. Ferrars brings shocking news: she poisoned her husband and was being blackmailed! Dr. Sheppard leaves Ackroyd and returns home. Later a telephone call sends him back to find Ackroyd was murdered! The police are summoned, and Poirot begins his parallel investigation. The chapters tell of the investigative procedure. Everyone connected has something to hide, and Poirot (aided by Dr. Sheppard) finds out what the secrets are.The usual convention is to plant little clues throughout the story so an attentive reader can figure out the mystery before the last chapters. Did you? The first time I read this book I had a hunch, but it seemed crazy. Is the first clue in Chapter 3? Is there another in Chapter 17 or Chapter 24? As the suspects are eliminated who will be left? Were you shocked and surprised at the conclusion? Christie examined the fictional lives of the upper class in a small English village. Do the sins of Ralph and Flora reflect the morals of the aristocracy? Are they like the people in a TV show? Fiction must reflect reality to be believable. Reading this again after forty years I noticed the feminine characteristics of the killer. Was this symbolic for a personality that could not be mentioned?The lifestyles described here were damaged by the Great Depression, and mostly killed off by WW II. Inflation has made the monetary figures far out of date. They had automobiles and telephones, but no radio [electricity?]. The comments about coldness say there was no central heating. Do the marriages without children have some hidden meaning? Or merely a way to simplify the story?There is one problem in this story. How did the killer know beforehand that an alibi was needed for the murder?People who died while being attended by a physician are seldom subject to a post-mortem autopsy. Does this have any affect on this story?"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I have never read an Agatha Christie novel before this, and I must say that she does live up to all the hype and talk I have heard. The book was absolutely fabulous -- with an intriguing and engaging plot, surprising moments, and good insight into the characters and motives. I found myself continually replaying the events of the novel in my head after reading the novel in wonder and awe of how such a murder could take place. I also fell in love with the cute Belgian invesigator, Hercule Poirot -- who in some ways seems to possess a certain instinct and subtlety in his manners which many other detectives seem to lack. The books is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to expose himself to one of the foundations of the mystery genre."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of the best Agatha Christie has ever written. When you finish it, you are just stunned. I had to read it three times before I got over my amazement. I loved ever minute of it. It is a must read."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This 1926 novel, Christie's masterpiece, is a justly celebrated tour de force of misdirection, with Christie walking a highly risky tightrope. It is much to Christie's credit that she is able to play perfectly fair-or, as Poirot says, \`Of facts, I keep nothing to myself. But to everyone his own interpretation of them.' Of course, this being an Agatha Christie-and her masterpiece-the reader's interpretation is certain to be wrong. The solution is Christie' best known, and certainly her most ingenious, use of misdirection and playing on the reader's expectations. As well as being ingenious, it is also emotionally disturbing in a particularly subtle way.The plot is-apparently-quite standard. The book is set in a small village, \\"King's Abbot, ... very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester, nine miles away. We have a large railway station, a small post office, and two rival \`General Stores'. Able-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired military officers. Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the one word, \`gossip'.\\" This is the first depiction of village life-complete with gossip grapevine-in Christie, something that would become central to the long and indifferent series of Miss Marple novels. The squire, Roger Ackroyd, is stabbed to death in the study of his country house-although never stated as such, it is clear that the book is an effective parody of the generic detective story. Hercule Poirot, now in retirement and growing vegetable marrows, but growing disillusioned-\`Can you figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work towards a certain object, may labour and toil to attain a certain kind of leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns for the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself so glad to leave?'-is called upon to investigate the case, assisted by the narrator, Dr. Sheppard, \\"a man of middle age, a doctor, a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this life of ours\\", who, it seems to Poirot, \\"must indeed have been sent from the good God to replace my friend Hastings.\\"Poirot's statement that \\"everyone has something to hide\\" is borne out, as the little Belgian detective unravels a complicated strand of secret marriages, mysterious strangers, blackmail, and three village tragedies. Poirot's detection relies on physical clues, for \\"a tongue is not enough. [The walls] would have to have also eyes and ears. But do not be too sure that these dead things are always dumb. To me they speak sometimes-chairs, tables-they have their message!\\" The clues are chosen with skill, and it would be impossible to improve upon the masterly juggling with times and alibis-relying on the now worn-out Dictaphone gambit (which is more convincing than in THE CANARY MURDER CASE of S.S. Van Dine, published a year later).Finally, Christie does not neglect the humorous side of the story. The tone is witty and malicious, and the characters vivid even for Christie: Miss Sheppard (a prototype for Miss Marple) and Mrs. Ackroyd are both genuinely funny, and the Mah Jong evening, where \\"a good deal of gossip is handed round at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the game in progress\\", is a classic.This, then, is one of Christie's masterpieces-if not THE masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The review below by a guy called daybert reveals the identity of the murderer.And considering this is maybe Christies greatest ending this review should be avoided. The guy also writes like english is his second language and after seeing his other reviews this is not the case so Im assuming some agenda or other.Aside from that this is one of christies finest and essential reading by all mystery fans."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book was probably about the 15th Agatha Christie Novel I had read and since then I have read almost 15 more- but this remains my favorite. This novel truly reflects Christie's ability to decieve the reader and have you on the edge of your seat. I have many times recomended this book to first time Agathe Christie readers, and have only gotten postive feedback. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a true thriller from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is considered by many to be Agatha Christie's best novel while others consider it fatally flawed due to the nature of the solution to the crime. It's impossible to debate the merits of that argument here without giving away the ending, so we'll move on to a more general discussion of the book and its merits as I see them.Poirot \\"retires\\" to a small village and almost immediately is drawn to investigate two deaths. One is due to an overdose of a sleeping drug, which some call accidental and others call suicide. The other is more obviously murder as the victim has been stabbed to death. Poirot, of course, is called upon to use his little gray cells to solve the crimes. As usual, we meet an interesting array of characters and most of them seem to have had a motive to kill Roger Ackroyd but Poirot eliminates them from consideration one-by-one. Until we come to the murderer, that is. I won't give away the solution but it is the person I thought most likely in the beginning and then let myself drift away from for various reasons.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd deserves its status as one of Christie's best novels. The story is well told, as narrated by the town's doctor, and moves along at a good pace. Poirot is as entertaining as ever, and the characters are interesting enough for you to care what happens to them."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I truly believe that if this book were released today, for the first time, it would be a hit. The mystery here is outstanding. This is a book to be enjoyed and savored. The problem is, you will be in such a hurry to figure out who the suspect is, you will race through the book in no time at all.Do yourself a favor and enjoy The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery, by Agatha Christie. It is a 5 star book. It is a true testament to the author's talents that over 80 years later, the novel is being re-released as a hardback. I expect nothing less than a new legion of fans to discover the fun of a Christie novel."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is probably the best of all of Agatha Christie's mysteries, for the delicious plot twists and the truly surpise ending. I found the story funny, tragic and ultimately very moving. I feel the point Christie was trying to make was that no one can escape their destiny in the end, and ultimately your deeds, both good and bad, will catch up with you. I loved the way all the clues are laid out for you, yet the hints are so gentle, that they are almost impossible to catch. I've read other Christie mysteries where I figured out the killer midway, but I was completely stumped on this one! Yet I found the solution plausible and all the characters believeable. To any one who has not yet read any of Christie's works, or doesn't like mysteries, I say try this one - you won't be disappointed. Definitely, one of the best mystery books ever written."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I'm still relatively new to the world of Agatha Christie as The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is only the third book that Dame Agatha wrote that I have read. I've heard that she has been known to reuse plot devices and that sometimes, some of her stories can become repetitive, but if they are all written like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, I would be happy with that. This will easily top my list of favorite books.I don't want to go into too much detail, as I'm always afraid that I'll let something slip that will spoil the end of the story for newcomers to Christie's writing. The book is so complex that I wouldn't even know where to begin. There is a suicide, blackmail, cocaine abuse, secrets and of course, murder. In his usual flair, Hercule Poirot (who happens to be in the right place at the right time) is brought in to investigate. Through the course of the book, suspicion is plainly brought on each of the main characters in the Ackroyd household, and you will never have a clue as to \\"who done it\\" until the very end. Every chapter, I was sure I knew who had committed the murder, yet every time I was wrong. An ingenious book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"It'd be difficult to review this book without the temptation to spoil the plot, but I'll do my best not to. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd must be one of Agatha Christie's most stunning pieces of work. Like many of her Hercule Poirot's mysteries, this book is written from a first-person angle. Only, this time, it isn't Hastings with the pen.In a small village, the narrator, a doctor, joins forces with the already retired Poirot to solve the murder of a wealthy man. A prior death, an odd friendship and a blackmailer are just some of the issues that Poirot have to piece together that eventually leads to a stunning conclusion.While many have branded Christie as cheating for the way this book was written, there's no doubt that the facts were indeed laid out clearly for the readers. Perhaps the plot twist is just a little to shocking to bear, but this doesn't stop this book for being totally enjoyable. A legend of a detective story, this is, and one that you must read if you're a fan of whodunnit."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"When I first reached for the book I didn't expect it to be a controversial read. Six hours later, I was agape, in denial and most certainly scandalized. Without giving away the plot, suffice to say that Dame Agatha had written her ultimate masterpiece when she decided to write &quot;...Roger Ackroyd&quot;.For first-time readers: Don't be fooled by the length of the novel. The clues are there, sprinkled neatly and merrily along with the darned red herrings. You have to read it slowly, as it was with most of her novels.The story: a doctor was called by Roger Ackroyd to discuss an important matter, but before he could divulge it further he was interuppted by the evening post. The matter was left there, and the doctor went home, seeing his host a bit disturbed. When he got home another call came in and announced that Mr Ackroyd was dead. Thus Poirot came into the scene and began nosing around. The solution was truly one of the most surprising in literature history.The novel became the measuring rod for future mystery and detective novels, although its controversy is undeniable. My suggestion is that you ignore the controversy for the moment and concentrate on the story."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Hercule Poirot has lost interest in the dective business since the departure of Hastings to South America. He has retired to a small village to grow vegetable marrows and live a quiet life. He discovers that vegetable marrows do not grow in an orderly manner and that crime does not limit itself to the city.The village is buzzing with gossip about the suicide of a local well to do widow and then is sent reeling by the murder of Roger Ackroyd, the wealthiest man in town. Poirot is drawn into these problems by Ackroyd's niece, Flora and finds himself not only dealing with murder but also with blackmail, petty theft and romance.In Hastings absence the story is told by the local doctor who is also a next door neighbor of Hercule Poirot.When this novel came out in 1926 it was immensely popular and somewhat controversial in that it broke one of the 'rules' for a good dectective novel (and you will have to read the book to find out which one). THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD ranks with AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (AKA TEN LITTLE INDIANS) and MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS as Christie at her most orginal.This story is also significant in that one of the characters, Caroline, the doctor's sister, has been credited by Christie as being the forerunner of Miss Marple. The soon to be familiar Christie theme of small towns as hot beds of intrigues both large and small is seen here for the first time.This book has aged very gracefully, the first time reader of today will probably be just as surprised as the readers of the 1920's were. As always with a Christie the clues are all there fairly laid out for the reader to follow."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is nothing less than excellent. It is fast-paced and never boring. The clues areways intriguing and the mystery is done well. A very likable, though always suspicious, cast of characters rounds out this amazing book. The final plot twist is shocking, but welcome. \\"Murder\\" is one of the best mystery novels I have read. Clearly 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie is not the greatest writer on the face of the earth. Her prose is adequate (at least fast moving, though). However, her imagination and plotting abilities are unbelievable. There are so many surprise plot twists and turns that we see day after day in modern movies and such that she invented.Her THE ABC MURDERS really introduced the serial killer to a wide audience, for example. As did A PALE HORSE. She also spent much time with her archeologist husband in Egypt and the ancient middle-east, and many of her books are full of lovely detail and settings from this part of the world. You'd be hard pressed to find a more delightful writer, who decade after decade came up with one whopper of a surprise ending after another. I've read ALL of her books, and probably only guessed the murderer correctly maybe 10% of the time.THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, a fairly early novel of hers, gave us perhaps THE classic surprise ending to a whodunnit EVER. It's been done since, but never better, except perhaps in Christie's own haunting novel ENDLESS NIGHT. I read this novel twenty years ago, having heard it had a great ending, and I tried like heck to figure it out. But I never dreamed the solution that was presented could be it. WOW! Unless you're a totally jaded reader of whodunnits, this is a must read.Now remember, Christie was practically from the Victorian age. Her books are chaste and not terribly violent or action packed. Lots of talking and looking for clues. Not much chasing or fighting or shooting!! These are sedate, rainy-day reads. But don't think her books are just for fuddy-duddies or &quot;old folks.&quot; I think they are a fascinating slice of social history, and a darn fine brain-teaser. And THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD would be a GREAT introduction to Christie.(Other books of hers I especially recommend, THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES [her very first book], ENDLESS NIGHT, DEATH COMES AS THE END [set in ancient Egypty!!], THE ABC MURDERS &amp; MURDER IN MESOPOTAMIA [set at an archelogical dig and just dripping with authenticity])"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of Agatha Christie's most talked about mysteries with a shocking ending (matched in a sort of frustrating cleverness only by Murder on the Orient Express). I first read this book as a teenager and remember distinctly being angry at the denoument but, on a sober second reading, have grown to appreciate its cleverness. Some readers may feel tricked but that is the glorious point of the book. It wakes up the readers of mystery novels from looking at things in the same way and to remember to keep open to all possibilities. What is especially nice is the way in which the novel still holds up on a second reading. Recommended for the fan of English country house mysteries."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is probably one of Agatha Christie's best books. It has a great ending that always keeps you guessing. Just when you thought you had it all figured out new clues make you change your mind."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie is the world's best-known mystery author, and she is the most widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.In her lifetime she wrote 79 crime mysteries and her books have been translated into more languages than Shakespeare.Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890, and she died in 1979, after a lot of written novels and plays.The plot takes place in a small village, called King's Abbot, and the book features one of Christie's most famous characters, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.Even though Poirot wants to retire after a long career, he becomes involved in a strange and mysterious murder.The victim is Roger Ackroyd, a wealthy man who knew that the woman he loved had poisoned her brutal first husband, and also suspected that someone had been blackmailing her.After she commits suicide he gets a letter where she has written some fatal information. Unfortunately, before he can finish the letter, he gets stabbed to death.This confusing murder, which takes place in a large mansion, causes everyone at the crime scene to become a suspect.Poirot, who is assisted by the village doctor, Dr. Sheppard, have this magical way to collect all the clues he is after. You get really surprised that he finally gets all the clues together and also how he can think of and see all things you do not even have thought of.You read this book mostly through Dr. Sheppard's eyes and he tries to understand all the clues that Poirot gets, but he does not.Hercule Poirot unravels a lot of complicated secrets about all the suspects and you, through that, get to know the characters. You read the book, through clues and reveals, until of course he finds out who the killer is.My personal reaction over this book is that it is very well written. All the clues and all the descriptions are very thought through.I got really surprised and shocked over the ending of the book. Actually I never suspected the person who eventually turns out to be the murderer. The thoughts that Poirot had never entered my mind, and I think this was the thing that made this book good, the astounding end."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"it all depends on how you read AC's books. if you like action and a lot of murders...then i would suggest &quot;and then there were none&quot; or my favorite, &quot;the big four&quot;. this is unusal b/c it is told in first person. i love how AC writes, using psycology, etc. if you do too, you'll like this book. most of it's charm is in the ending...one of the best AC endings on any of her books! all in all, i really enjoyed reading this book and following along w./ the adventures of Hercule Poirot. this is GREAT the first time...but it doesn't keep the suspense effect that is so important to the book after you've read it a few times."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Published in 1926, somewhat before Christie's creative peak in the mid-1930's to mid 1940's, this ranks as one of her best mystery novels. And in fact, it's my favorite Poirot mystery. Murder on the Orient Express tends to steal the spotlight, but in my opinion Ackroyd is better written and much more realistic; more character-driven and less plot-driven.Why is it so highly acclaimed? Any number of reasons. The casual style, the colorful depiction of the villagers, the brilliant (and very funny) mah jongg scene, Poirot's vegetable-marrow-throwing antics, and of course, the extraordinary conclusion. Speaking of which, the usual warnings apply. I haven't revealed the identity of the murderer, but keep in mind that other reviewers haven't been so kind. However, this novel is a classic that can be appreciated even if you already know the ending.If you read only one Christie, make it this one!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book was excellent- it has suspense, plot, and all of Agatha Christie's ingredients for a great mystery! Poirot is super, and the murderer seems that it could be anyone in turn. But for me, the ending was a bit too much."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"...and again I did not foresee in any way the ending of an Agatha Christie story. This story is really interesting, and is one of the few mystery stories that deserves a thorough rereading. I was astounded when the name of the killer was revealed (of course, Poirot once more does the goods). Very highly recommended, both for fans of the genre and for those who are new to this type of story."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book is easy to read, but i was kept busy by the amazing work of Hercule Poirot. I wouldn't say this book was much different to a similar story of hers - Muder At The Vicarage.(Also a great read) But the plot was somewhat different. Brilliant ending... I won't say much more but you'll never guess the muderer! A case think only for the very special &quot;Hurcule Poirot.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is the book that made Agatha Christie famous. The ending created such controversy in 1926 that Christie was almost voted out of the famous London Detection Club (a tight-knit society of British mystery authors). Only the tie-breaking vote of the club president, Dorothy Sayers, kept her in.The ending violated one of the cardinal rules of mystery novels (I won't tell which one), and was Christie's first best-seller. I promise -- you won't be able to guess the identity of the murderer!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I have to admit that though I love Christie novels, I can be pretty tough on them. But this one was really breath-taking. The murderer's identity hits you like a ton of bricks, and Agatha Christie thinks up such a thrilling, original solution to an original book that many writers could only dream of. Don't neccessary judge by what other people may say about it's being boring. They don't like the intriguing &quot;death in the parlor&quot; type books, which is fine, but I can only say one thing- I 've never been less bored in my life!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD is perhaps the best Agatha Christie book I have ever read .Although A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED , THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE were also good books the plot behind THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD was absorbing and intriguing . It is the kind of book a person can read again and again and never get bored."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Having to read this book for my Crime Stories class at my college, I knew that I should read it before it was assigned so as to actually enjoy it and not have the classic case of \\"assigned-book-equals-boring-book\\"-syndrome that too many students have to suffer. I read it about two weeks before it was assigned, and finished it today. Oh my god, that was amazing!Written in a complex (not to mention dated) style, this book is narrated by one James Sheppard, a small-town doctor in Victorian England. He introduces us to the town and its characters (which, I might add, there are a LOT of), and the whole mystery itself. It also features the super detective Hercule Poirot, in his fourth adventure (yes, this is part of a series...fortunately it doesn't seem to involve any of the other books except through vague mentions).As to the mystery, I won't get too into it, it involves the suicide and possible blackmail of a woman, a wealthy man's murder, and...okay, just read it and find out for yourself. It's just so interesting; it's a quick read, and once you put this book down...just...I can't begin to describe it. Let's just say that I could not believe how everything turned out in the end. Read it, and I hope you enjoy it as much."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Our library mystery book discussion group selected this mystery to read and discuss. I had read this mystery as a teenager one summer. I thought as a somewhat sophisticated and seasoned reader I'd find it lacking. Not a bit. It was as much a delight to read as an adult as a teen. When you read Christie you discern why she is the best-selling author of all time except for Euclid who didn't write fiction. If you're looking for one of Christie's best books to introduce yourself to her work, this is classic Christie and a great introduction to her work."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of the definitive Agatha Christie works. Aside from \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\", it is probably her most famous work, most likely because, like with Orient Express, it had a twist ending that was at the time extremely unique. However, for the author, this ended being a twin-edged sword- the novel was originally so controversial that the backlash from the twist almost caused it's creator to be kicked out of the 'Detection Club': a group of famous mystery writers, because of the allegation she didn't play fair.Since there isn't that much to see Dr. Sheppard, the narrator of the book, lives with his gossipy sister Caroline (the precursor to Ms. Marple, according to Christie) in the small English town of King's Abbott. However, the small town quickly becomes victim to a sinister crime- somebody has murdered wealthy socialite Roger Ackroyd. Hercule Poirot (in his 3rd appearance in a Christie work), has retired from private detecting, and is a resident in King's Abbott growing vegetable marrows. The Belgian sleuth is pulled into the case by a relative of the victim. With Dr. Sheppard by his side, Poirot works to unravel the tangled web of deceit that lurks within the victim's large household and associates, in order to uncover the truth.Now, the first problem that plagues this book is that readers that want bloodshed and stimulation, the story is going to drag. A good chunk of the novel is devoted to wrapping up several loose ends and sideplots, which only tangentially pertain to who committed the murder. In addition, this is an incredibly tame murder mystery, with the only death that we read about (which, being the title of the book, is hardly a surprise) occurring early in the novel. Since the mystery is extremely insular (the motive is extremely private, and the other key players are already dead), the tension that is brought with the threat of more murders is never present. Ergo, it is easy for some readers to be rather enthralled by the beginning, but begin lose interest halfway through, if they aren't interested enough in the characters that are trapped in this drama.The other main problem with the novel is that due to the controversy surrounding it, and the fact that its twist was the first of it's kind, makes it so that it's difficult to avoid being spoiled before you read it. Even if the identity of the murderer isn't revealed to you, the mere fact that the story is so controversial, and it's twist so bold for its time, could give the astute reader a big clue where the story is heading, far before our good author wants us to. And honestly, the twist is the only portion of the book that stands out. Christie handles most of the key plot points of \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" (A wealthy family plagued with secrets, blackmail, a secret love affair, etc.) more effectively, and more cleverly, in her later works.Those flaws aside, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd does succeed on several levels. Christie manages to create several extremely interesting and sympathetic characters (the gossipy sister of the narrator, the shadowy butler, the stoic hunter), which manage to keep the reader (or at least me), extremely curious as to how these characters would develop as the story progresses. Also, despite the fact that there isn't that much murdering in the book, there isn't too much dead air per se either- the book takes place over a rather short time frame (like most Agatha Christie works), so there is always some kind of investigating to be done by our protagonists, and even the portions of the book that seem the least significant will probably prove vital by the end. Christie manages to keep the narrative flowing, throwing twist after twist at the reader, (although some of them are rather transparent). If the book demonstrates nothing else, it proves that you don't need a large body count to keep readers entertained.Also, this is truly the book that shows Christie's prowess as a writer. The fact that the end manages to be powerfully hinted at, yet still able to be easily missed by the casual reader, is solely due to the very careful storytelling and wordplay of the author. That she manages to pull off Hercule Poirot's final deduction, without it coming across as a cheat in almost any respect, is pretty remarkable.It is best to go into The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as a blank slate; totally ignoring the hype. Even if you can't do this however, you should still find an entertaining and vibrant mystery that has survived the test of time."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a step outside the traditional framework of a mystery. If you have read Agatha Christie before, you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you have not read Agatha Christie before, I suggest you start with another of her excellent novels first so that you can savor this one all the more."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"If not the best after the beautiful \\"And then there were none\\" , this excellent book is a master piece of action, plot design and fact specialization.Roger Ackroyd is dead, and yet another impossible crime has been manufactured. Agatha in her highest fame.A must have for anyone."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The plot is awesome and it contains a great ending - that I did not see coming. A few things that make Agatha Christie great are: (1) her writing is lean and spare; (2) her characters all have an important role to play; (3) she has a sense of humor; and (4) there are no silly chase scenes or senseless violence. A thoughtfully written mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book is considered by many people to be one of the best mysteries ever published. In my opinion it ranks right up there with Conan-Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles, as a mystery. Agatha Christie relied on the convolutions of unraveling a mystery to motivate and pull a plot, along with a great many red-herrings.In this Mystery she employes one of the cleverest and rather subtle red-herring ever in a mystery.I warmly recomend this mystery. Its well written, well paced and exceptionally clever.The ending will shock you."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Having read most of her books, Agatha Christie still outwits me. Very seldom one can guess the final outcome of her books and this is one of the very typical specimens. Actually, all her books offer surprises and this particular one offers nothing less. I would say it's another masterpiece of hers though the revelation of the real murderer actually saddens my heart.(Yes, very much....)I agree with one of the reviews that say the best books of Agatha Christie are And Then There Were None and The Murder On The Orient Express. (Try The Secret Adversary also).But the reviewer made a mistake by saying The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the first book of Poirot; actually it's not, that should be The Mystery Affair at Styles."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is the best of all the Christie books that I've read. If you haven't read her books, save this one for last. The ending is fantastic. Don't peek."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is one of Christie's best stories. Considering how many mysteries she wrote, her most successful ones are those which turn the conventions of mysteries on their ear. Murder on the Orient Express did this, and so does Roger Ackroyd. The thing is, DON'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BEFOREHAND. People are so up-in-arms over the secret, they keep giving it away.Just read the book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"When a spinster friend of Roger Ackroyd commits suicide, she sends a letter to him revealing she was being blackmailed. He reveals this to his friend Dr James Sheppard, but not the identity of the blackmailer. After Ackroyd is murdered, his niece turns to Dr Sheppard and his neighbor Hercule Poirot to solve the murder and to find her fianc&eacute; who's the prime suspect. Poirot soon finds that everyone connected to the case has something to hide, which creates some confusion at first, but it's not enough to halt Poirot from solving the case. Dame Agatha Christie's remarkable storytelling and innovative structure make this one of her most memorable mysteries."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Florida. I have probably read about 30 Agatha Christie books and there are about 5 or so which stand out as among her best, but it's a debatable point to say which among them is THE best. It really depends on your personal preference. But that is excluding The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. It is her only book which stands head and shoulders above the others. If you have not read Agatha Christie do not make this your first choice...read a couple of her classics first (ABC Murders, Mirror Crack'd, And Then There Were None, Murder in Retrospect,...) and then read this one. By far the best plot and great character development. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Interesting that the last four reviews are so polarized. This was the first of many Christie books that I have read and remains my favourite. It is brilliant and leads to an astounding conclusion. Just saw a terrible A&amp;E adaptation on television tonight. Please read the book instead!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"It is so difficult to write a review of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd without spoilers, however, this is absolutely the best book by one of the finest mystery writers ever. Christie was a master at developing a solid plotline, laying out all the clues for those of us with the gray cells to assimilate them and put them all together. The mystery is one of her earlier ones and is a classic dead body in a room story. Poirot works with Dr. Sheppard, from whose point of view the story is told, to interview all the suspects and at the end puts everything together in a way that leaves us hitting ourselves over the head for not having seen what was right in front of our eyes.There are those who have argued that Christie cheated on the ending, which has a true surprise twist, but I think that her ending is one of the most brilliant plot devices ever used. She absolutely lays everything out, all the clues are there for us to see. This book is a work of genius from a brilliant writer."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie, the doyenne supreme of the English mystery novel, wrote in the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, one of the most stunning examples of the genre.Detective mysteries reached its apotheosis in the first few decades of the 20th century. Edgar Allen Poe is credited with inventing the genre, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with the iconical Sherlock Holmes created the eccentric detective and Dorothy Sayers for her erudite writing and witty portrayal of Lord Peter. But only Agatha Christie managed to create not one but two supremely popular and fascinating detectives, Miss Marple, the sweet and sharp elderly spinster and Hercule Poirot, that finicky, green-eyed retired Belgian sleuth.In 1927, Christie was part of a \\"Detective Writer's Club\\" that included many prominent writers, including Ms. Sayers. They met and wrote to one another and compiled a list of \\"rules\\" for the detective genre. In fact, they collaborated on a book called the \\"Admiral's Club\\", a mediocre result but fascinating for its provenance.Yes, the denouement to the Murder of Roger Ackroyd is surprising, but the Detectives Club, after much discussion claimed that Christie had played fair, and critics should accept that they had been hoodwinked.Don't think about this when you read the book. Enjoy the characters, some flat, but still appealing. The servants with something to hide, the pretty niece, the handsome blackguard adopted son, the stuffed-up Colonel who talks endlessly about his days at the Shanghai Club and one of the most developed characters - the gossipy, autocratic and ultimately kindly spinster sister, Caroline.Enjoy the setting - the English village in the 1920s. The new technologies that seem so quaint to us and yet still prevalent in our own societies. The gossip, the lovers triangles, the class snobbery. There's something so delicious about these closed-door mysteries with characters running around a large home, each with their own secrets. Of course, only Hercule Poirot can illuminate and integrate these secrets to reveal the truth and an unexpected quality of mercy.Hercule Poirot - that lovable prima donna, forever trying to retire, and like Don Corleone, finding himself \\"dragged back in\\". Of course he loves the chase. And like one of the characters said about him, he is never more dangerous then when he's playing the \\"ridiculous mounteback\\".Don't read this first if you've never read Agatha Christie. Read Five Little Pigs, The Murder on the Orient Express, The Body in the Library,Ten Little Indians and other masterpieces. Then you will appreciate the number of ways she managed to outwit us. Read \\"Roger Ackroyd\\" once for fun and twice for a master class in detective ficton writing."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"We adore a surprise, and Agatha Christie \\"The First Lady of Murder\\" obliges. The best-selling fiction writer of all time, (outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare), takes us to the quintessential British village of King's Abbot for a mystery that keeps the reader guessing right up to the end.Miss Christie's detective hero, Hercule Poirot, is a displaced person from the Great War. The eccentric Belgian detective shows all of his endearing quirks in this tale that sent the world of letters into paroxysms of apoplexy. This was Miss Christie's sixth book and the third to feature Poirot, who in his own humble opinion, is the world's greatest detective, and who are we to argue?Poirot's egg-shaped head is filled with \\"little grey cells\\" that he uses to solve the crime, the murder of Roger Ackroyd, the squire of Fernly Park. Poirot is assisted in his detecting by Dr. Sheppard, who takes the place of Poirot's more-familiar sidekick, Hastings - now down Argentine way. Incidentally, Dr. Sheppard's sister Caroline served as the model for Agatha's snoop/sleuth, Miss Marple.Rules, it seems, are made to be tweaked as often as Poirot's mustache, and Miss Christie tweaks one of the rules of the mystery genre, herein, writing so deftly that we love her for it. The plot's devilish twist had been suggested to Agatha by either Lord Mountbatten or her brother-in-law, or both. At the time of its publication, she had all of her peers wishing that they had done it first.In this book, as elsewhere, Miss Christie will have you suspecting everyone before you are done -- everyone EXCEPT the culprit. What a gem, treasure and joy this bit of detecting is. Having stood the test of time, it deserves the praise and the attention of succeeding generations.Read it and prepare to be bowled over!There are plenty more whodunits to sample from Agatha Christie's pen, some featuring Poirot, some featuring her archetypical nosey parker detective, Miss Jane Marple. Others feature a detecting couple (Tuppence and Tommy). And then there are the wonderful Ariadne Oliver -- more than loosely based on Miss Christie herself, and Mr. Satterthwaite, an elf-like old man who looks on life and sees things that others miss, forever going to country house parties where all around him it rains murder and mayhem. He is, of course, based on the author, Henry James. Lesser lights, Harley Quin and Parker Pyne round out the rather remarkable detective creations of Miss C."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I don't think anyone could have predicted the way this ended. I knocked myself on the head several times after realizing the truth. Christie is as michevious as they get. The plot is essentially about a man(Roger) who is murdered and Poirot(who came for a 'vacation') decides to try and solve it. Everyone in the town has a secret they are hiding- but one of them has the worst of all.There should be no contreversy surronding it in my mind. I think it was cleverly thought out.BEST EVER AS OF NOW( I still have a few to read)"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I didn't need a one line summary for this book, just the one word. For whatever reasons, this is the first Christie book I've read. I've seen some of the films made from her work, the best, IMO, being Witness For The Prosecution, directed by Billy Wilder. I had heard that this was a good one to start with, and is it ever. It is not only terrifically plotted, but it has great characters, sparkling dialogue, and it is beautifully written and constructed. I'm not saying anything else other than it's a must-read."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Roger Ackroyd is murdered and you read on as Hercule Poirot tries to discover who did it. I won't spoil the surprising ending but Agatha Christie shows imagination in selecting the villain."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Not quite &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; but certainly one of Christie's outstanding works. This is a must-read for all Poirot fans!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie is noted for great mysteries. This is probably her best. It is a mystery that the reader will never solve without the help of Ms. Christie--even though all the clues are given. It is fun to read the book and then check back to the portions that made the murder so unsolvable. If you haven't read it, do so; if you have read it, do it again."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book is my first Agatha Christie novel, and I must say that it lives fully up to its expectations. Christie weaves a beatiful tale of a murder that can keep anyone guessing. In fact the book had a lasting effect on me, as I kept replaying the events of the murder and the actions of other characters in my head even after I finished the book. It was that mezmerizing!I truly loved the way in which suspicion was cast on almost every character in the book. I began to look rather cautiously at the characters for fear of mentally befriending the wrong person. Christie's magic was so good that I was even beginning to think that everyone ganged up together to murder the poor Mr. Ackroyd. I especially was attracted to the cute little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who seems to possess a certain wizardry and deep intuition when it comes to mysteries and unearthing the truth.The ending is indeed a surprise - as I understand is Christie's trademark. I only wish I read the book twice (both times up until the point of the revealing of the murderer) so as to make a good guess as to who the murderer really was. Oh well, perhaps I'll save that for the next Agatha Christie special."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"What can I say? Since this was the first Agatha Christie book that I had ever read, I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not I would enjoy it. To begin with, I knew nothing about Agatha Christie, and bought this book at the airport because I had a long flight ahead of me, and I needed something to read on the plane. However, as soon as I started reading, I realized that I just couldn't put it down. This book has everything: a widow's suicide, blackmail, deception, the murder of one of the town's most prominent men, mysterious strangers, a detective who claims to know everything, a likely suspect, and a very unlikely murderer. I was truly amazed at the ease with which Christie was able to bring all of the characters together - As it turns out, they all have a lot more to hide than you originally suspect. It's definitely a modern whodunit that will keep you guessing until the very end. For anyone who has never read an Agatha Christie novel before, I suggest that you start with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd - you'll become an instant fan just like I did."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Hello,This was the first book I had read by Agatha Christie, this was suggested to me by my Uncle. Really an excellent one to start with and the best of Agatha Christie she is just too good for murder mysteries. After this book I have never read any other than hers almost all, This book provides you with great descrption on the murder and the characters involved but one will not be able to say who the murderer is till the very end.A MUST FOR ONE WHO LIKES MURDER MYSTERY."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was by no means my first introduction to Hercule Poirot or Agatha Christie. _The Murder of Roger Ackroyd_ is, however, my favorite. As another reviewer mentions, this and _Ten Little Indians_ (_And Then There Were None_) have some of the most startling endings in the Christie canon. I especially enjoy the 1920's/30's Agatha Christie works for their view of the last days of the British Empire.In _Ackroyd_, suspicion is constantly rediverted. You have to be on your toes and track the timeline of the crime very closely. You'll find in this one that Poirot has known all along. This is in contrast to others where Poirot (&quot;I am a thrice imbecile&quot;) is uncertain.Finally, while A&amp;E's adaptations of Poirot are usually quite good, avoid A&amp;E's verion of _Ackroyd_. It can only be told in book form."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"All right so apparentely previous reviewers are descendant directly from &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, otherwise me thinks they are perhaps stretching the truth when they say, &quot;they guessed the murderer early on in the story&quot;.

Order, read, and enjoy. one of the greatest writers of our century."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Sneaky, sneaky Agatha Christie! She took a lot of abuse when this book was first published because of the controversial ending. You're either going to love it or hate it. I say, the rules can't always apply! Agatha broke the &quot;acceptable mystery ending rules&quot; with her two greatest books, And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express, and she REALLY broke them in this, her third greatest masterpiece. Unfortunately, even if you do like the ending, you won't take any pleasure from the discovery of whodunnit."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I can see why she is known as one of the greatest mystery writers of all time. I thought I knew who the murderer was several time...and I was wrong and never saw it coming! Sometimes, when you never saw it coming, there are holes in the explanation and you think the author stretched it a little...not the case with this book! It all made perfect sense, but it would have been almost impossible for the reader to figure it out.Not only is the mystery fantastic, but the characters are round and complex, the writing is superb, and the setting is easy to see in your imagination. It was one of the best books I have read in a while and look forward to reading more of her books!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book, like any Agatha Christie novel, was fantastic! This is one of her books though that the ending of it will never have occured to you even once. I know a lot of her books are like that, but with most you can at least guess close to the mark maybe. This one, though, is just so surprising that, like i said before, the thought of it would have never once occured to you. It caught me completely off guard, I would have never guessed! So if you like a good mystery novel with one of those magnificent surprise endings, this book is completely for you. I recommend it 100%. It was the best Agatha Christie I have read so far, and I have read quite a lot. I'd say it's better than \\"And Then There Were None\\" and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\", and those were my favorites. What I'm trying to say, once again, through all this rambling, is that this truely is an amazing book. I recommend it to all Christie, and mystery, lovers 100%."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha's written is amazing. The whole story is great!

The reason I loved it and it wasn't spoiled for me, is because throughout the remainder of the book (from where I picked up on something) I watched all the little cunning tricks laid out for readers to follow...truly awe inspiring.This is a great Christie to read after reading at least a dozen others of hers..you'll remember why you appreciate her uniqueness. The setting, the timing, the characters, the plot, they are all superb and it amazes me that this was such an early novel of her mystery writing career.

Very powerful ending."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"As a passionate Christie fan, I own and have read all of her books (80+), many of them two or three times. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is longer than most of her books so it has a little \\"filler,\\" as I call it: pages of writing which could be left out without affecting the plot or progression of the book. For example, a long chapter is devoted to a Mah Jong game in which the only plot extender is the divulgence of the discovery of a wedding ring. But ever her \\"fillers\\" are fascinating. The book is about the murder of wealthy country gentleman Roger Ackroyd just as he is about to discover who has been blackmailing his friend and possible future wife, who has left him a letter telling all before committing suicide. Everyone in the house with him at the time of his death is a suspect and clues are abundant, as always. Hercule Poirot has recently moved to the little village of King Abbott and is asked by the victim's neice to find the killer. As usual he sifts through clues and observes the reactions of the suspects and discovers the killer whom he confronts. I love Christie's quaint descriptions of English country life and her dialogue that precisely identifies the characters. She's the master of mystery fiction; more than 2 billion copies of her books have been sold, with good reason. It doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Mr Ferrars died a year ago, and his wife is rumored to have poisoned him. Mrs Ferrars is then found dead from an overdose of sleeping pills. And THEN the wealthiest man in town - Roger Ackroyd - is murdered! The local doctor joins the recently retired Monsieur Poirot as he helps the local police get to the heart of the matter.Filled with suspense, intrigue, and a flock of red herrings, Christie delivers the goods. I read this on a business trip and it completely drew me in.I picked up this particular Agatha Christie novel based on a recommendation in1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, which is fun and beautiful reference (although note that it's about 95% novels)."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Told from the point of view of a country doctor, James Sheppard, the novel opens when a certain Mrs. Ferrars dies. Not long afterwards, Roger Ackroyd is found murdered in his study. The local inspector immediately suspects the butler, Parker, and Ackroyd's stepson also becomes a murder suspect, as Hercule Poirot (who's conveniently retired to a house in the neighborhood) is called in to solve the crime.Written in the great age of crime novels--the 1920s--The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a murder mystery that threatens to puzzle even the most astute crime solver. It doesn't come as much surprise--apparently, Agatha Christie would write each of her novels not knowing who the murderer would be, and then decided at the end who it was. Then, she'd go back and change aspects of the novel accordingly. Its very clear that she did that here. There's some extraneous stuff that could have been left out. But its also clear that Christie is influenced by true crime stories of the past--the Crippen case is mentioned in this novel.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is not by any means one of Christie's best, and the characters, even M. Poirot, seem a little flat. After all, we've seen mysterious strangers, disgruntled family members, and blackmailers before. But this is the book that created the clich&eacute;, \\"the butler did it.\\" The narrator is not without a modicum of wit; he has no patience for the neighborhood's gossiping ladies, including his sister. The beauty of this book, however, comes from the mystery itself--how things play out, and the denouement itself, which is quite shocking. In fact, Christie bends all the rules here, and her ability to deceive the reader--and her indomitable detective, Poirot--is unparalled.I've read many of Christie's other mysteries, so it surprised me when I realized that I hadn't read this one! I generally like her writing, and Murder on the Orient Express is one of my favorite mysteries, but over all, I prefer Miss Marple over Hercule Poirot. But if you want a murder mystery that revolutionized the world of detective fiction, then read The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"one of agatha christies best novels. it was fun to follow and enough clues were given so that i could figure out who the killer was."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I read this years ago at the recommendation of a friend who's something of a mystery fiction buff, and reread it with my family on our vacation this year.

Good read to fill in some time on a cold winters night/day."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Enjoyed this book. Agatha is a whizz at creating mysterious characters and making a vital clue just slip into the background, making it inconsequential to the reader. Everyone has to read at least one Agatha Christie book in their lifetime - and this one might as well be it."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I started reading Agatha Christie about a year or so ago. I had only read three of her Miss Marple novels and this was my first Hercule Poirot novel.I was once again pleasantly surprised and thrilled to find that I found another new detective that I will happily enjoy.The novel is narrated by Dr. James Sheppard who ends up assisting Hercule Poirot in his investigation of the murder of Roger Ackroyd.A widow named Mrs. Ferrars is found dead of what is believed to be an accident. Mrs. Ferrars was seeing Roger Ackroyd who all of the village believed was on the cusp of proposing to her.After her death, Roger Ackroyd comes forward stating that Mrs. Ferrars admitted killing her husband and that she committed suicide. After his revelation Roger Ackroyd is found murdered in his locked study.The mystery novel includes so many suspects that you will find yourself second guessing everyone. Agatha Christie writes so well that you have no idea that all along she is slipping you clues until the very end.I can actually say that when you get to who murdered Roger Ackroyd it will surprise and stun you.As soon as I finished this novel I went right back and read it all over again to see if I could catch the clues that Poriot points to after his unmasking of the murder.Would definitely recommend reading this and all of Agatha Christie's novels!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"OH...MY...GOD. That is probably what you're going to say after having read this book. It is, in my opinion, one the best Hercule Poirot novels.

A must read if you're a fan of mystery novels."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"If you are a fan of Agatha Christie - and especially her Hercule Poirot mysteries - then you owe yourself this treat.It is the most astounding ending of any of his cases. No more info !!!!I want you to find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is the perfect murder mystery. There are an ample number of red herrings. What is wonderful, though, is that all the clues are there for the reader to pick up on. You've got the same facts that Poirot does, and so in theory, you could figure out the solution before he reveals it. I doubt you'll get it more than a few pages before, though, and that is if you get it at all. Then you can just sit back and think through how skillfully Christie laid out all the clues for the reader, but hid them in the most mundane sentences. The ending really is brilliant. So, before you read a review that really gives away the ending, stop reading about it and get the book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"She is a master writer! This book is interesting, with interesting characters and a fascinating plot. Her comments on human nature always get me thinking."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was my third book to read by Agatha Christie, and I must say that this one had the best ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic mystery novels. It is definitely a deal for the price."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I think that because of all the hype about this book, people naturally expect some fantastic ending, and so the ending, when it comes, does not seem so fantastic, as it was expected. However, if read unawares, this is without a doubt one of Christie's best. A novel idea in every way-altough NOT a good idea for someone's first detective book. The plot is developed well, but the secret liasons and affairs were a bit much compared to Christie's usual. A fabulous ending, however, on the whole."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I really expected to be knocked off my feet with the surprise ending everyone talked about. It seems I am the only one who WAS NOT shocked at the end. I think the \\"reveal\\" would have been much more effective if Christie would have told us the murderer's name first and then let Poirot give the evidence. It's not hard at all to figure out who the culprit is as Poirot says \\"the murderer has to be someone who is this, had this, and was here when.....\\". By the time Poirot finally revealed the name, I had no doubt who was guilty. I was totally let down. I wish I hadn't figured it out. This is in no way a bad book. It is as good as everyone says. Yet, so much rides on the \\"reveal\\" so if you don't figure it out, it will make all the difference in the world in your opinion of the book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"To tell the truth I was excited to read this one because I had heard of it a million times and it's one of the classics. But when I read it, I didn't like it nearly as much as I had hoped. I guessed the ending very early on simply because people kept telling me how much of a surprise it was. It was ok but I think the most important part of any book is scenery, so for me this wasn't that great."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"when i took my hands this book,i wouldnt think it was a cool and bewildering book.if you new-starter for A.C ,firstly try this ,later crooked house."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"While I read this book, I found it rather, well, \\"blah.\\" The characters weren't particularily interesting, the murder wasn't anything spectacular, the setting was unoriginal, etc. The writing consisted almost entirely of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really BAD about this book. But it's nothing very special either. Though I must admit, the ending was fairly unpredictable. The problem was that after going over the actions of the murderer before (he/she) was found out, most of them don't make sense. (He/she) did some pretty dumb things, things which no intelligent person who had commited a murder would do. So in general, I would describe this book as \\"decent.\\" That's all. On a side note this is the first Agatha Christie novel I've read. I don't plan on reading another in the near future."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"OK, maybe there is something wrong with me, but I did not like Hercule Poirot. And I thought from time to time that the murderer may in fact be who it turned out to be but I just couldn't see why. And like I said in my review of &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, I don't believe Christie made the motive believable. I got a kick out of Caroline though.I had purchased a third Christie before I read this one, and I exchanged it for something else. I just don't find her stories, or rather, the motives believable."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd byAgatha ChristieA Book Review by Niles BenjaminAs usual, Christie has provided excellent plot and suspense to this story. This is a very good Hercule Poirot novel where he uses his wit and cunning knowledge of the facts to solve the case. This book lacks literary merit, though. It is mostly a suspense book with a surprising ending. She does not use any writing talent to draw you into this book, but uses her ability to create excellent plots to draw you into this book. She uses hard detective fiction to create some very interesting questions in your mind. I think that this is a very good book because you will be challenged by the clues, but will not be terribly amazed by the ending. If you are a hard core detective fiction reader and do not care about literary merit, this will be a very interesting, challenging, and fun book for you to read."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book has a great story line, but the ending is too predictable for me. It was a great disapointment from all the hype."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I am not a dedicated Christie fan. However, for those are interested in puzzle plot mysteries in the cozy tradition, this book is like Hamlet or Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

But reading the first few chapters of this book, I thought wouldn't it be funny if \\"X\\" did it and I was right! I didn't guess out of good deduction, but I did guess correct!Saying that, the ending is unexpected and very sensational, and it is definitely a must read for all mystery and Agatha Christie fans.It is another Hercule Poirot novel and whether you consider him the greatest detective, or, in my opinion, very conceited, it is very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Excellent book for a read on a journey.

Its not her usual type of twist and although I had suspected what the end might be, its how she writes it out and tells the story that remains a surprize."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"So, I recently read Agatha Christie's The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd. If you haven't read it, you should really read it. It is pretty amazing. I was a little put off by the way that the narrator only has a personality that's filled in with very broad strokes. I'm used to detective novels where the narrator has a ness-ness-an essence-that permeates the whole book. In this one the main character, the doctor in a little village in the English countryside, doesn't really put a strong stamp on the novel. And Hercule Poirot, the detective, also doesn't really feel like he leaps off the page (although he is amusing). The most vivid characters (as in the average episode of Law and Order) are the side-characters. The doctor's gossipy sister is a real prize, I loved her. But also the various people around the manner are interesting, albeit archetypical.The real joy of the book is the plotting, though. This book has some of the meticulous plotting I've ever seen. It's like a machine. Once, I heard a writer talk about how the beginning of a novel should be filled with the people and complications that are going to propel the rest of the novel forward.Agatha Christie definitely follows this advice. She doesn't raise just one conundrum, she raises fifteen. How did this guy get murdered if the door was locked? Who murdered him if everyone has an alibi? Who was blackmailing his girlfriend? Who was his son talking to in the forest? Who does this mysterious wedding ring belong to? What's up with the anonymous phone call that alerted the doctor to his death? Who was the man who the doctor met as he was leaving the manor? The mysteries just pile higher and higher into this massive tottering edifice.And they don't get resolved one by one, either. Each time one mystery is answered, it adds two more. And with every suspect who gets eliminated, there's that much more pressure on each of the others. By the end, you feel like anyone can be the murderer. It was fantastic. I've never read anything like it. And I highly recommend it.I think this is a perfect example of why all books don't necessarily need to have all things. The fact that this book had less of the typical joys of the detective novel (setting and personality) allowed me to enjoy its superlative plotting. In this case, I wouldn't say that it's thinness is at all a flaw. In fact, considering all the juggling that Christie is doing, I wonder if it would've even worked at all if the novel had been more filled with voice and details. I suspect that it would've failed.Crossposted from my blog: blotter-paper.com"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"For some years I have heard this novel contains one of the best twists in popular literature. The characterisation was just a little flat and, while the plot was pretty much bullet-proof, there were a couple odd non sequiturs in the text. So perhaps it is not the perfect novel, but it deserves the plaudits none the less. One could say that Christie employed a literary device, perhaps one that this reader was alert to, I even suspect I may once have seen the movie, but the end got me. Highly recommended and enjoyable crime classic."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Frankly I had never heard of \\"The murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" until a few weeks ago. Given it is the most read book by the most read author of all times it deserves more fame. I enjoyed it very much but given the large number of suspects and the complicated plot it is not a book to read when you are tired or distracted. I was very surprised by the ending but, in hindsight, I should have been able to figure it out."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"When a wealthy man is found stabbed to death, the suspects include his adopted son, his greedy sister-in-law, various houseguests and servants, and a mysterious blackmailer. Bereft of his usual aide Hastings, Poirot makes use of the narrator, the town physician.I knew whodunit before I started the book, so it was more a case of \\"but he couldn't have done it\\" than \\"who could have done it?\\" And Christie successfully baffled me through most of the book. Not many of the characters were particularly likable, and it was curiosity about a book that set so many of her readers howling that kept me reading, more than the plot itself. I particularly objected to Christie's use of suicide as a \\"solution\\" to major life problems. Spelling, grammar, and formatting were fine, and the title was certainly relevant to the story."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a brilliantly conceived and written novel. Absolutely gripping from start to finish, and impossible to fathom as each new turn of the tale shifts the reader's perspective on the situation. If you like Agatha Christie you must read this one, a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"We read this in my Classics & Banned Fiction book club. It was my first foray into Christie's world and I was surprised at how thoroughly I enjoyed this mystery novel. Christie is a gifted writer and this one will keep you guessing to the very end."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is probably the best I've read by A.C. and I think the reason is that the story is told in the first person by what I guess is an unreliable narrator. The Doctor's voice and his sister's character are brilliant,shades of Arsenic and Old Lace.Poirot plays a secondary role but this doesn't detract from the story.I guessed at the ending about 3/4 through as the red herrings weren't really serious but was still intrigued to see the final denouement."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is the most controversial mystery novel of the 20th century. It nearly got Agatha Christie kicked out of the Detection Club (an organization of writers who agreed to play fair). It put her on the map. It's her best work - ever.The book is a first person account of a Hercule Poriot mystery, done by Doctor James Sheppard, a country doctor serving his community. He was there from almost the beginning, and his narrative provides a wonderful account of the murder of his friend, Rodger Ackroyd.Rodger Ackroyd's female friend took her own life. She wrote a letter to him before she did so, naming the man who ruined her life - a blackmailer who knew she killed her first husband. Rodger read the letter to Dr. Sheppard, but wouldn't continue when he realized a blackmailer would be exposed because of it. Dr. Sheppard begged him to continue and get the name - to no avail.Ackroyd didn't comply. James Sheppard left and went home, only to get a myserious phone call telling him Rodger had been murdered. Murdered he was - and the letter was missing!Enter Sheppard's neighbor, Hercule Poriot. Dr. Sheppard plays Dr. Watson, following the sleuth around and recording what he finds. From a missing son to a married maid; from the theft of household money.In the end, Poroit invites all the cast to a room where he talks about the case, and says he has a solution - which he will reveal to the police in 24 hours. The only way for an innocent man to be saved was for the real killer to confess one way or another... and even though Dr. Sheppard has all the facts of the case, he can't see how Poriot could put them all together into a surprising solution of the case.In short, if you want a book that will shock you, read this one. Well crafted, with devious plot devices, Christie showed her genius for detective fiction with this book. It was a work of genius because she had the imagination to do something amazingly original. It may have nearly got her kicked out of the Detection Club, but history has sided with her - she was right all along. This is her most classic work of all time."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was the first Christie I ever read - and it's a real masterpiece. The ending is pretty horrifying, but read the book again, and you'll wonder why you didn't notice various things - things the Murderer/Murderess (I'm not saying which it is!)said and did during the novel, that one didn't notice at the time. Extremely good stuff."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is the Agatha Christie novel that had both her competitors and critics crying foul at the solution to the crime--but although the book has its weaknesses, the solution is not one of them. THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD remains one of the most startling novels in the entire murder mystery genre, and it should be very near the top of any murder mystery fan's reading list.Told from the point of view of a village doctor, ACKROYD opens with a suspicious death--and this is followed by the murder of Ackroyd, a wealthy local who learns more about the suspicious death than it is wise to know, and whose death draws Hercule Poirot to investigate. This is not actually one of Christie's more smoothly written novels; most of the characters (excluding Caroline, the village gossip, who is a delight) seem more than a little flat, the narrative drags a bit here and there, and the plot is extremely tricksy... but the conclusion is a stunner, perhaps the single most famous plot twist of Christie's long and revered career. An absolute must read!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This hardcover version of this famous novel is reasonably good except that the binding seems to come apart at around page 115 although the font size of the words seems to be just right for comfortable reading.Now to the novel itself: we get a retired Hercule Poirot agreeing to distract himself from his new hobby of gardening to try and find out who killed a well-known and respected gentlemen, Mr. Roger Ackroyd. The novel is typical Christie but is not the best one that she's written. For that you'd have to read \\"And Then There Were None.\\" Even \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\", \\"Death on the Nile\\" and \\"Something Evil This Way Comes\\" are much, much better overall works but this novel's claim to fame is really the unexpected and previously unused formula for the ending. Otherwise, the rest of the novel is pretty boring as every evidence seems to point to an obvious culprit who, thanks to the brilliant Poirot, is exonerated. If you are a fan of the detective, whodunnit genre, then read this as essential reading for the genre but just know that Agatha Christie has written better novels and if you decide to never ever read another Christie novel, you must at least read \\"And Then There Were None\\" or any of the others listed above."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie is recognized throughout the world as being the \\"Queen of Crime\\". It is undoubtable that this holds true, especially in her ingeniously written, classic mystery novel, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The story is told through the 1st person point of view, so the narrator, James Sheppard ( the local doctor ), is one of the main characters. He introduces all the characters in the small English town of King's Abbot, where the story is set: Mrs. Ferrars, Flora, Ralph Paton, Ursula Bourne, Hector Blunt, Colonel Carter, the formidable Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, and many more.The story begins with the suicide of Mrs. Ferrars, which stirrs confusion; Rumors say that she poisoned her first husband, that someone was blackmailing her, and that she had a secret liaison with Roger Ackroyd. The mystery surrounding her death appalls everyone even more when Roger Ackroyd is brutally stabbed to death a few days later. Hercule Poirot, accompanied by Dr. Sheppard, set out to trace the tracks of a very sharp and devious killer.I found it extremely captivating up to the very end, which I found was the best part of the novel. There are so many twists in the plot, red herrings, clues, and foreshadowing, yet the solution to the crime completely eludes the reader until told. All the characters and their different possible motives, which Agatha Christie carefully presents, are subject to questioning; therefore, at one point or another, I suspected almost everyone to have committed the murder.What I loved most is that I was caught off-guard many times while reading. I have a vague idea in my head and then when I turn the next page, I'm proved wrong. Agatha Christie has an unbelievable imagination and talent that she is able to make such a simple detail become the turning point in the mystery. You are always expecting the opposite of what truly happens,and I think that is what is brilliant about her writing, and especially this novel.In the end, when you are told the conclusion to the story, the shock is so tremendous that it creates a smile on the reader's face. Automatically, you realize how obvious the answer was and how from the very beginning, the cards were layed out on the table face-up, yet you are still incredibly decieved.I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to have an insightful and captivating time trying to unravel the mystery of the death of Roger Ackroyd!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is a wonderful book--one of Agatha Christie's best, and justifiably famous. This was one of the last Christie mysteries I read, and I was mortified to find that I figured out who the murderer was early on. Because of all the hype surrounding this book and its...well, unique elements (I don't want to give anything away), I found the book somewhat spoiled for me. If you haven't read this book, I urge you NOT to read any reviews of it, because they do inadvertantly spoil it."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"As seductive as a sudoku puzzle, with all the facts of a devilish murder laid out for the reader to solve, if only s/he reads carefully enough, this 1926 mystery is still captivating new readers. A contemporary of popular mystery writers Dorothy Sayers and Marjorie Allingham, Christie writes novels which are less character-driven than Sayers's novels and less elitist (and sometimes satirical) than Allingham's. Instead, Christie carves out a niche writing mysteries with unusually clever plots, even if, as in this case, she has to violate the conventions of the mystery/detective genre to make them work.No spoilers. When Hercule Poirot, the French detective who uses his \\"little gray cells,\\" retires and moves to the small rural village of King's Abbott, he quickly learns of the death of Mrs. Ferrars, who, after her husband's mysterious death, had intended to marry Roger Ackroyd. Soon, however, Roger Ackroyd himself is found dead, stabbed in the back in his study.An unusual number of complications make this mystery particularly challenging. The disappearance of Ackroyd's stepson (his major heir) is thought to signal his guilt, but there are others who also have motives. A maid has been dismissed under mysterious circumstances, Ackroyd's sister-in-law has serious debts, a stranger has appeared at Fernly Park at the time of the murder and has then disappeared, and Ackroyd himself has been trying to control his estate by securing the marriage of his niece to his stepson.Details of the mystery are not unique. Christie also uses the attempt of a wealthy man to control his heirs' marriages in _Dead Man's Mirror_, for example, along with the familiar concept of a murderer entering and leaving a locked room via a window. Mysterious strangers are a clich&eacute;, as are dismissed maids who have secrets. Throughout, the characterization extends only as far as is necessary for the plot. Told by Dr. James Sheppard, a friend and frequent visitor of Ackroyd's, the novel is justifiably one of Christie's most famous, however--and its creative conclusion revolutionized mystery writing not only in its time, but forever. Don't miss this one. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"In perhaps, one of the finest of all Hercule Poirot mysteries, Agatha Christie crafts an ingenious plot with nothing less than stunning revelations at the conclusion. Her sheer genius leaves the reader breathless. Set in the small town of Kings Abbot, a retired Hercule Poirot becomes involved in solving the scandalous murder of Roger Ackroyd, the town's richest inhabitant. Unable to stay away from mystery for long, Poirot's interest is piqued and he is easily convinced into joining the investigation. Unlike other stories to follow, this one is narrated by the pleasant voice of Dr. James Sheppard, who chronicles the events and accompanies Poirot in Hastings absence. Clues abound and everyone at Fernly Park is a suspect. Only Poirot seems to understand the meaning of what he sees, not the inspector in charge of the case, the polite Dr. Sheppard or the reader can distinguish the significance or the insignificance of the many clues and converstations laid out in the story. This story in particular, in my opinion ,is a sample of Christie's best writing. The way the the reader is manipulated will be emulated in many novels to follow by other mystery writers. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd comes to a stunning conclusion, while the reader simply shakes their head acknowledging that Poirot is indeed master of the \\"little gray cells.\\""},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"When &lt;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&gt; appeared in 1926, it was Agatha Christie's sixth novel under her real name and the third to feature Hercule Poirot, not counting a collection of short stories about the Belgian sleuth. It also caused a storm of controversy at the Detection Club, of which she was a member, because she broke one of their prime rules of detective fiction writing. (The trouble is, I cannot tell you what rule that was without ruining the solution for you.) But even if you disregard the twist at the end, you still have a thumping good murder yarn that concentrates very closely on Poirot's methods of ignoring nothing and--how I wish many of us were like this--refusing to twist the facts to fit his theories.This novel benefits further from the supremely comic (and believable) character of Caroline Sheppard, the narrator's sister. (This book is in the form of a journal kept like those of Dr. Watson by a participant in the events and therefore is in the first person. This gives Christie the right to keep Poirot's thoughts unknown to us until they are revealed to the center of consciousness.) The other characters, save that of Poirot, of course, are given just enough personality to make the plot work; but this is also expected in Christie's works.If you saw the dramatization of this book on A&amp;E, you will see how badly they bobbled the &quot;surprise ending&quot; and even changed Caroline's character in a totally unnecessary way. It does, however, pare away some of the really extraneous business that Christie added to make her plot more complicated.Nevertheless, here we are dealing with an excellent READING of the entire original work on six cassettes published by Audio Partners. In &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot; which I have already reviewed, Audio Partners has David Suchet reading all the parts, using a different voice for each. Here we have actor Robin Bailey doing the honors and he is quite good. Of course, we might quibble that the character he is really playing, Dr. Sheppard, the writer of the journal, could not be quite so good a mimic; but as a reading, we suspend disbelief and enjoy Bailey's talent.What more to say? A very amusing novel read excellently is all one needs to give this Audio Partners offering a five-star rating."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie wrote mysteries in which the detective is almost never in danger,. There are seldom any car chases, shootouts, fist fights or explosions. There is no bad language or graphic sex. Christie's great talent was in putting together word puzzles. She puts all the clues in front of us and then devotes her considerable talent to confusing and misleading us as to the identity of the murderer. And she does it so wonderfully and so completely that we love her. Go figure. If you are new to the mystery genre, start with another book. This one was written for experienced mystery readers. If you are an avid reader of cozy mysteries, you will love The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This struck me as almost a Christie pastiche; the number of (perfectly-timed) secret liaisons in the gazebo, secret engagements, secret marriages, poisoners, blackmailers, murders, suicide, unacknowledged children, torn scraps of cloth and so on per captia seems high even for Dame Agatha. Still, a fun read.Maybe because I'd heard about how shocking and controversial the ending is, I twigged who the murderer was by about chapter four. Still, it was fun to watch the buildup and conclusion, and we get a fresh (although quite Hastings-like) view of Poirot. Three stars, but then I'm a hard grader! *8)"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Told from the perspective of village doctor, Dr. Sheppard, this mystery has one of the best, most surprising endings. King's Abbot is a quiet village until the elderly Mrs. Ferrar's takes her own life. Her devout friend, Mr. Ackroyd, receives a letter from her explaining that someone has been blackmailing her. Then after the Dr. Sheppard's visit to Ackroyd's mansion, the doctor gets a phone call telling him that Mr. Ackroyd's been murdered in his study. This is the classic, closed-room who-dunnit, with a cast of characters who all have something to hide. By coincidence, living in King's Aboot is the retired, world famous, detective Hercule Poirot, who is asked to solve the murder. Everyone is suspect. Only Poirot, with his little gray cells, is able to deduce what happened. Dr. Sheppard plays Dr. Watson to his Holmes and writes about their exploits. Brilliant!!!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Our library mystery book discussion group selected this mystery to read and discuss. I had read it as a teenager one summer and thought as a somewhat sophisticated and seasoned reader I'd find it lacking. Not a bit. It was as much a delight to read as an adult as a teen. When you read Christie you discern why she is the best-selling author of all time except for Euclid who didn't write fiction. If you're looking for one of Christie's best books to introduce yourself to her work, this is classic Christie and a great introduction to her work."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book is unusual for a number of reasons. It raised a huge debate when it came out. Dorthy Sayers, who in addition to writing fine books herself was a published critic of literature and played an important role in setting out the rules of a murder mystery, came strongly to its defence. Her comments are well worth searching out and reading for yourself.Unlike most novels of its type, it bear rereading.Because I was at one time a professor of English literature and chose to offer a survey course in Detective Fiction, I have read this book many times and enjoyed identifying the many clever clues provided by the author.Christie plays fair with the reader and presents a tale which stands out among the thousands which have been written. I encourage you to experience this unusual and satifying book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I've never read Agatha Christy - embarrassed to say - but I'm glad I did. Obviously it's a bit of a time warp in terms of dialect but after getting used to this, the book is definitely fun to read with a great ending. I should have seen it coming but I think I've been conditioned by Hollywood. Anyway, I don't want to talk much about what happens at the end so enough said.Christy does a great job of keeping you guessing, never really giving you the full picture until the last few chapters. Oh, and it must be said, this is really a quick read and in my opinion should be called a \\"short story.\\" And I swear, the Parker Brothers must've read this short story and immediately created the game Clue - who killed so and so in the parlor!Bottom line: would I recommend it? Yep. It's quick, fun a great change of pace from the novels of today."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"As other readers note, the ending of this book is among the most clever endings to a work of mystery. Being that readers are often guessing throughout the book, the guessing will become dizzying. Though some of Christie's work now seems dated by today's standards, this book certainly stands the test of time.Mrs. Ferrars takes her life after poisoning her husband. This happens before the story begins. Roger Ackroyd does not die until over fifty pages into the book. But who would have motive to kill him? At times, the reader may wonder if the book is even actually about Ackroyd's murder. Using his gray matter, Hercule Poirot leads readers though the investigation via Dr. Shepard's narration. The chain of death is linked and good suspects are easy to find. But as the suspect list dwindles, it seems as though there is nobody left.Though the dialogue is a bit cumbersome at times, this is a short book. It is best read in as little time as possible. Going away from the book for a time may cause the reader to confuse characters. For the ending alone, this book is worth reading even for non-Christie fans."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"If you like detective stories and mysteries, this is as good as it gets. Only Dame Christie's other great work And Then There None (also known as 12 Little Indians) is comparable for unexpected plot twists, great complex characters, and a unique approach to a worn out genre.This Hercule Poirot mystery starts out like all the others. The Lord of the manor is murdered in his home, with several guests nearby, after a long day in which he learns something terrible about the woman he had planned to marry. The usual suspects appear, including the step-son, the widowed sister-in-law, her daughter, the butler, a drug-addled stranger with an American accent. Fortunately for us, Poirot has moved to this English village in his retirement to grow vegetables and is quickly enlisted to the cause.The story is told from the perspective of the town doctor, who is also among the last to see the victim, and a potential suspect himself. The doctor has a gossipy sister who makes his life unbearable; Dame Christie has said she was a precursor to our other favorite detective Miss Marple.Of course, Poirot takes control. He digs up clues including telegrams, furniture out of place, drug paraphanalia, lost engagement rings, patients in lunatic asylums, traveling salesmen, and various boots. Per the formula, we then have the big showdown scene where Poirot presents evidence but does not reveal the criminal, only telling him that the jig is up. No one is whom we expect and the one telling us what is happening is also showing some reticence with parts of the story.At the end, Poirot shows a ruthless streak, letting the criminal know that there are alternative endings, but none involve freedom at least in this world."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Agatha Christie is known for the unusual twists she threw into her mysteries to make solving them especially difficult and gratifying. I have read many of Christie's mysteries and have been able to solve some, but \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" left me completely in the dark. It is a thorougly mystifying and pleasant puzzle featuring her famed detective Hercule Poirot.The novel is narrated by Dr. Sheppard, doctor of the small village of King's Abbot. Mrs. Ferrars, a wealthy widow, has just died due to an overdose of poison. Before her death, however, she sent a letter to her fiance, Roger Ackroyd, confessing that she had been blackmailed about her husband's death and wished him to make the blackmailer pay. But before Ackroyd can follow her wishes, he is stabbed to death and almost every member of his household had a motive for killing him. The list of suspects includes his adopted son, who had incured a great deal of debt that Ackroyd refused to pay and who has not been seen since the murder, and his young niece who had money problems herself due to the extravagance of her and her mother's lifestyle. Dr. Sheppard allies himself with Hercule Poirot, who is meant to be retired in anonymity, and together they take on the case. Poirot immediately employs his little \\"grey cells\\" to solve the puzzling intricacies of the mystery at hand, while Dr. Sheppard functions in the Captain Hastings role of earlier mysteries.\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is a fast-paced delightful read. The solution is entirely fitting but completely baffling to the reader as well. There are a few places where this work shows its age, particularly the chapter dealing with a game of Mah Jong, but otherwise it stands the test of time. This novel would serve as a fine introduction to Christie's work for anyone who is not familiar with her wonderful mysteries."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"First of all, if anyone gives away the ending to this book before you've read it, feel free to commit a murder of your own. I'm sure that \\"they told me who killed Roger Ackroyd\\" would be a viable defense in court, THAT'S how renowned this book is as Agatha Christie's masterwork.Doctor James Sheppard is called to his friend Roger Ackroyd's house under strange circumstances: it would seem Mr Ackroyd has some news to impart. Once there, Sheppard discovers that the village rumors concerning one Mrs Ferrars were indeed true: several years ago she poisoned her husband, and recently confided in Ackroyd (who wished to marry her) that she was being blackmailed for her crime. Now Ackroyd is determined to find the culprit responsible.But before such a thing can occur, Sheppard is called back to the house on the basis of a strange telephone call. Once there, Sheppard and a member of the staff break down Ackroyd's study door to find him dead: stabbed to death in his chair. Suspicion falls particularly hard on Ralph Paton, Ackroyd's stepson, who has seemingly disappeared into thin air after Ackroyd's death. But as is to be expected, there are plenty more suspects to go around: the financially dependant sister-in-law and her daughter, the secretive maid, the proud housekeeper, the shifty valet, the visiting big-game hunter, the anonymous stranger seen entering the grounds on the night of the murder...But it is young Flora Ackroyd (Roger's niece) who enlists the help of Doctor Sheppard's new neighbor: an odd little Belgian who is said to be a retired detective whose only wish is to grow vegetable marrows.Naturally, Poirot cannot resist a good murder mystery, and is soon working alongside the police and Doctor Sheppard in order to track down the killer of Roger Ackroyd. Told in first-person narrative by Sheppard, the doctor takes the position usually held by Hastings (or for an earlier example, Sherlock's Doctor Watson) who is utterly unprepared for Poirot's methods of deduction, and caught entirely unawares - as is the reader - by the solution that he prepositions.\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is a murder mystery that is often described as one of perfect construction, and it's hard to argue with that claim. Everyone in the Ackroyd household as a secret, and although most of them are entirely incidental to the murder itself, each one is presented and revealed in its own time, along with the usual scattering of red herrings along the way. Poirot himself is at the top of his game, stimulating the \\"little grey cells\\" out of retirement and back into what he does best. It is Poirot's methods that make him so famous; relying on psychology just as much as deduction and logic, making seemingly irrelevant remarks and requests, acting insufferably arrogant in the accumulation of knowledge, and yet always secretive and impeccably polite; this is Poirot at his infuriating best.In many ways the plot of the book is analogous to Poirot himself: there is nothing flashy or gory or thrilling about it; in fact it is analytical and methodical; in many ways more like a mathematical equation in which all the expected pieces are in place and whittled down. Yet it is in this very act of presenting a \\"usual\\" murder mystery that Christie catches the reader off-guard. Ultimately, the real question of the book is not: \\"who killed Roger Ackroyd?\\" but \\"did Christie cheat?\\" I think not. One only need pay close attention to the surprisingly acute Caroline Sheppard (the precursor to Miss Marple) to concede that Christie is quite simply smarter than you are.AlongsideAnd Then There Were None, \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is one of Agatha Christie's most important works, as both helped to define certain tropes of the detective novel. In the former's case, the concept of a group of people in an isolated area getting picked off one-by-one. In this case, it is the use of the \\"twist ending,\\" in which the entire premise of the book is turned on its head, forcing an immediate re-read in order to grasp the sheer ingenuity of the tale. This is Christie - and Poirot - and the murderer! - at their most cunning."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Having been gripped for two days by THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, I can say that it is a superbly written novel. It certainly is ingenious the way Agatha Christie conceals the identity of the murderer from the reader until the final chapters. The last chapter of all is chilling. As a narrative and as a mind-puzzle, THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD is a great detective story...possibly one of the greatest ever written."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Yes, this is Agatha Christie's masterpiece. The unusual factor is that the narrator is not the regular Hastings but some local doctor in the village in which the story's based. In &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot; too, the narrator was not Hastings, but a nurse. But this story is absolutely stunning. The climax is the best ever in a Christie story. Yes, no doubt, she's the acknowledged queen of mystery fiction!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"A nice book . The part of Hairdreeser and Vegetable fellow that Poirot played , I thought good.The climax situation is fab.A must read ."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is the first Christie I have ever read, and I should preface this review by saying I'm relatively new to the genre. The plot was great, and while going through the book one will inevitably wonder who committed the crime. But I think the ending is pretty easy to guess around Chapter 23 as the characters gradually reveal what they know, but when it hits you it is quite a shock. Complaints that her writing is not advanced should be ignored in my opinion, I don't like suffocating writing (example, Poe). The detection in my opinion is not great though - Sherlock Holmes actually seemed to figure things out, Poirot seemed to get lucky more often than not. He has ideas that pop into his head, and upon further investigation they prove to be accurate, but he didn't actually deduce all that much. Still, a great read for the plot itself."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is one of the best AC's novels (along with 'And then there were none' and 'Murder on Orient Express'. This is the book in which Poirot makes his first appearence. A must read (and a must keep) for all AC's fans."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I had read most all of Christie's books before I read this one and I still didn't see the ending coming. It's not Shakespeare, but this is a great work of detective fiction and well worth the read. I've read it several times!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is an interesting, and creative book by Agatha Cristie. I consider the Murder of Roger Ackroyd one of her best mystery books. The main character, Hercule Poirot solves the case of the murder of Mr. Ackroyd. With the help of clues, and as Hercule says, &quot;his little gray cells,&quot; he puts the pieces together discovers the most unpredictable murderer. When Cristie reveals the murderer, it leaves you dumbfounded.

However, I do agree with a previous poster who urged that this book not by the first Christie you ever read."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"There will never be another mystery novel so cleverly crafted. There will never be another mystery novel with such a shocking conclusion. There will never be another Agatha Christie. I have read a lot of mystery and detective novels. This is the all-time &quot;Academy Award&quot; winning mystery novel. It simply can't get any better than this (at least in my humble opinion...read it for yourself!)"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I am so glad our bookclub chose this- its my first christie and it won't be my last. It was amazing the subtle way the clues were introduced and how Poirot gets at the truth. I didn't mind all the liasons, for the end was so good, that made all the twists and turns worth it."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was one of the first Christie novels I ever read and I still remeber it well because of the ending. My mouth was open in surprise at &#34;whodoneit&#34;. I almost cried foul but it taught me a valuable lesson I have never forgotten when reading mysteries-do not assume."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Probably the best known book from the Golden Age of Mysteries and the book that made Agatha Christie internationally famous. I'm still knocked out by it even after multiple readings. If Christie had written nothing else, she would still be remembered for this one. So, if by chance you have not read this -- and particularly if you have never heard how the mystery is solved -- order it and read it now!As a side note, I am a big fan of these inexpensive Black Dog editions. I think many of Christie's books stand up under rereadings, so it's nice to have hardback copies. Regrettably, Black Dog appears to have given up before publishing all of Christie's books."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is as innovative as it gets -- Christie at her best. It keeps a reader in full suspense, has numerous compelling and interesting characters, and contains some of the best interactions of all her books. This is certainly a book to read and to admire."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Loved this book, the characters are interesting, and the story moved at a fast pace. I know this was written many years ago, but I could, and will read this several times!!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I've always loved Agatha Christie, but this it the best one yet! I was late for work because I needed to finish the book. No one writes like Dame Agatha!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was my second Agatha Christie novel, after being completely absorbed by And Then There Were None. My new favorite is... I can't say. Both are landmarks of the mystery genre and still talked about to this day, and for me, both were impossible to put down. The early 20th century British prose is a treat, and there's a delight in enjoying stories that so many writers after Christie are influenced by.I never guessed who murdered Roger Ackroyd until Monsieur Poirot was ready to reveal the right clues. The last couple of chapters were a stunning revelation!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie I read. I felt as if I had to read at least one of her books since she's known as the Queen of her genre. And I was blown away. I quickly read a lot more of her books, but this one is still my favorite. It was one of the first books I bought in the Kindle format.It's not a book of action. In fact, the narrator in many ways is just on the sideline watching Poirot. He's a doctor in a small town who yearns to be free of it. Many of the characters have secrets, giving Poirot and the reader a slew of suspects.It's a book I enjoy rereading every so often. Even knowing the answer to the mysteries, I find myself enjoying the characters and all their interactions."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This would be a good starting place for someone unfamiliar with Christie's works. It is one of the Hercule Poirot detective stories; I hadn't read any of them before and therefore can say that it doesn't seem to have a negative effect reading this one out of sequence. (It did make me want to read more of the series though!)The story is set in a small English village where gossip is the favored pasttime and nothing much of significance ever really happens; however, the village inhabitants are stunned when two mysteries unfold at once: one involving blackmail and a suicide, and the other involving murder. Hercule Poirot, who has just moved to the village to retire, is irresistibly pulled into the intrigue and starts to investigate. He is aided by the village doctor, Dr. Sheppard, who narrates the tale.It's been a long time since I was completely absorbed in a mystery, and this delivered that deliciously maddening desire to have to know- right now-- who done it? It's difficult to put it down once started, and the ending was nothing short of nail-biting shock. Christie is a master at keeping the reader guessing and then delivering an emotionally stunning wrap-up of her tale. This one kept me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to read more of her novels."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I have read Ackroyd, Styles, And Then, and Orient. Ackroyd is most definitely the best one. Following Poirot from the Doctor's perspective is fantastically fun, and the ending has a very unique twist which I have never seen, or at least delivered so well, in other books.I'm glad I read Ackroyd last because it left me with the best impression of Christie. I don't think I shall read anymore Christies for fear of ruining that impression."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Some say, if Agatha had never written another book, we'd still be talking about her as one of the greatest mystery writers for this book alone. How true! The story is fast-paced, with the most surprising ending. To be sure, since I have read 20 or so Agatha books, a chapter or two before the revelation I guessed who the murderer is. But this does not take anything away from the book. In fact, I can only imagine what a sensation it must have made when it first came out!Now I want to address one thing: some have accused Agatha of cheating in this book, so did she cheat? My answer is: No. After you have read the book, if you go back and read it again, you will see that she never actually gave you false information (I won't go into the details so as to avoid spoiling the plot). It is like watching the movie \\"Sixth Sense\\", when you watch/read it the second time, then you will hit your head and say \\"Oh, how did I miss that\\". It is your own perception and interpretation that misguide you, not her cheating.If you are starting out reading Agatha books, I highly recommend this book as the one to start with."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"What a great book I picked for my first Agatha. I can't believe how well she twisted the hints in with the story- so that the ending was both shocking and logical. Glad I started my mystery reading with a book so well written."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book was written in 1926, (that means that it is an early christie). Some people who have read it hated it...and the is because of the end. They claim that Mrs Christie didn't respect the common acceoted rules of writing a detective novel...that was when it was just published, but it have some very good reviews, and one even claimed it 2 be the best detective story ever 2 be written. I say that the book is very good, one of the 3 best of all A.C:s 55 full-length novells. Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is probably the best of the mysteries that I have read. The twisting plot, the clues that leave you with a thousand theories. It starts off with the typical mystery of a bribe, death of the person who was bribed, death of the person who was supposedly to know everything about the bribe, and to top it off, a missing relative of the deceased. It might seem simple, but the time-to-time discoveries and conclusions of our little Belgian detective left my mind aghast and confused for hours. Even though Agatha Christie has used such perfect words and descriptions, the little clues won't seem obvious untill the end, which is something like a big blow to the head. It left me saying to myself, &quot;How could I have missed something so clear!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Kept us guessing all the way through - but the little grey cells did it again."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I read this novel years ago, but still it just terrifies me! The ending was so genius, so revolutionary, and so brilliant that it ranks with the best mystery novels of all time!

Even if you are not a mystery fan, you MUST READ THIS. Beware of the ending!!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"PLEASE, IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER IN THE WORLD OF CLASSICAL DETECTIVE-NOVEL, DONT READ IT NOW, OTHER WAY YOU NEVER WIL BE SURPRAISED IN A WAY SO AMAIZING AND DELIGHTFULLY AGAIN BY OTHER NOVELL..

Without his good friend and sidekick he feels he should just go to the country and grow weird vegetables. The niece of poor Roger Ackroyd knows Poirot from his visits to the Ackroyd estate and asks him to find the killer. The good town doctor moves into the Hastings role as the dumb as dirt sidekick and thus the Poirot fun begins."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Although I appreciate the groundbreaking nature of its famous twist ending, it was pretty obvious to me from pretty early on (and I'm not a particularly perceptive or clever mystery reader). I still greatly enjoyed this Poirot outing however and found it a crisper, less convoluted and faster moving read than others in the series. It was refreshing to have the great detective interpreted by someone other than that self-absorbed, semi-lovable imbecile Hastings even if the good doctor was pretty much cut from the same (houndstooth tweed) cloth. Interesting to see the genesis of the Marple character in the doctor's sister (who steals the show) and in that sense, this is a truly seminal Christie novel. Dame Agatha was a pretty witty gal and the mahjong sequence was a great delight.All in all, a very enjoyable whodunit and well worth a read. A lot of issues and story lines are left unresolved at the end, but I suppose they all sort themselves out somehow and, since the killer has been exposed and the murder solved, we and Poirot are outta here. I read the Kindle version (what a bargain) and couldn't put my iPhone down, but I'm a sucker for old-school english drawing room murder mysteries. I'm definitely going to recommend it to my butler unless the colonel has already put him on to it, the old blighter. Good show."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"My husband and I listened to the audio version of this novel on a road trip. About halfway through the narrative, as we tried to figure out a solution to the mystery, my husband suggested one particular character might be the murderer. I scoffed at the idea since it was so unlikely and so outside the standard structure of a mystery. Guess what, he was right. Once again, Ms. Christie has turned the formula on its head and an intriguing story, one that makes you want to go back to the beginning and re-read it, is the result. No wonder this novel is on the list of the 20th Century's best mysteries."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This review applies to the Audible unabridged edition. Robin Bailey reads this story with a hint of villianous egotism inside a sense of humor. As for AG's detection club claiming she didn't play fair with who she designated as the murderer, this is addressed in the film, \\"Murder by Death\\" by Neil Simon. In fact, she did play fair by allowing the reader (listener) to have almost every clue. Murder on the Orient Express is my favorite Christie film, but this audio version is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I have read several of Agatha Christie's novels including: Murder on the Orient Express, And Then There were None and Murder on the Nile. Anyone who has ever read a Christie novel knows they are in for quite a treat when the book's mystery is finally solved. This ending was almost as shocking as Murder on the Orient Express!In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Hercule Poirot is called out from retirement after a man named Roger Ackroyd is found murdered in his own home. As in all the other books, there are numerous suspects including Captain Ralph Paton, a stepson who stood to inherit quite a bit of money. Paton's disappearance after the murder makes him the most obvious suspect in most people's eyes, but not Hercule Poirot! He is convinced the murderer was in the home at the time of the murder. An open window, the sound of the victim arguing and the last time he was seen alive by all the suspects staying in the house give Poirot all he needs to work out the identity of the killer.There are many clues guiding the reader to the murderer, but beware! Many are misleading! Almost everyone in the house could have a reason for murdering Roger Ackroyd. Yet, most clues seem to point to Ralph Paton. This was a really fun read with a SHOCKING ending. Many times I thought I had figured out the identity of the murderer, in fact, at one point I was convinced I knew who did it. I was wrong! If you have never read an Agatha Christie novel, I would start with Murder on the Orient Express, which is her best novel in my opinion. However, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd has an ending just as shocking as the latter. Fabulous mystery!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"The Observer of May 30, 1926, said,No one is more adroit than Miss Christie in the manipulation of false clues and irrelevances and red herrings; and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd makes breathless reading from first to the unexpected last. It is unfortunate that in two important points -- the nature of the solution and the use of the telephone -- Miss Christie has been anticipated by another recent novel: the truth is that this particular field is getting so well ploughed that it is hard to find a virgin patch anywhere. But Miss Christie's story is distinguished from most of its class by its coherence, its reasonableness, and the fact that the characters live and move and have their being: the gossip-loving Caroline would be an acquisition to any novel"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"In my opinion the detective novel \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" by Agatha Christie is one of the best detective novels ever written. The first time, I read this book when I was 13 years old, and I was already fascinated by it. I have always refrained from reading it a second time for a long time, but now, 33 years later, I could not refrain from doing so.And I must confess I did not regret it. To the contrary, when you already know the end of the story you read it from a different point of view. You are not concentrated on the \\"who done it\\" question and, hence, you may come to following interesting conclusions:(1) The story fits perfectly. You do not discover errors, even after the second reading. The reader is not misguided by mysterious events, which lead him into wrong paths and which are lost at the end of the story.(2) The story is thoroughly designed. There are many side events which play a significant role in the whole plot, which contribute to the whole confusion during the investigation of the crime and which unravel themselves one by one with the help of Poirot's perfect analytic mind.(3) The I narrator tells the story with much wit and humour which is due to the position in which he finds himself during the developement of the whole story.(4) There are many hints which might lead you, the reader, directly to the murderer if you only concentrated on your subconcious common sense and read the text carefully.With my knowledge of at least 20 Agatha Christie novels I must say that she has never written a second book like this. But of course, you only write a masterpiece once in your life."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Was telling myself subconsciously (or so I'd like to imagine) that it couldn't have been *that person* who committed the murder (when Poirot was in the midst of his exposition and the facts pointed to just one remaining suspect), but the mind really has a great capacity for denial...so I was really still surprised by the truth.

Recommend it widely :)"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"A great read that will make you shake your head in admiration. With an incredible ending."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite Agatha Christie novels, on the level of Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. There's no exotic locale for this novel, but there is Christie's trademark use of red herrings. There are definitely lots of red herrings, with the usual characters who all have secrets they refuse to divulge, a murder in a closed room, and of course Hercule Poirot. The ending was definitely very shocking, even though I had guessed who the murderer was about 2/3 of the way through the book. It left me with chills down my spine and was definitely one that had me thinking about the story for days. I have to say that modern mystery writers have nothing on Christie. I use to love reading Mary Higgins Clark's books, and after reading Christie's novel I just cannot bring myself to read Clark and James Patterson's books again. Agatha Christie is definitely without peers in her ingenious plots and her crisp, yet suspenseful style of writing. Read this book--you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"\\"...Roger Ackroyd\\" is, like the Orient Express, famous for its conclusion. It has a twist which few readers, if any, could have guessed beforehand. For that alone I'm giving it 4 stars. Not 5 because even though the story is good, I dont think it deserves the full 5 stars.Its a typical English countryside murder which Agatha Christie is famous for. There is something about the English countryside that attracts crime writers to it. Perhaps it is the chilling fact that the genteel and peaceful facade of the country sometimes hides a hypocritical and evil nature of some of its populace. You'd expect this in the cities but not in Warmsley Heath or Meadowbank or wherever. \\"I wouldnt have thought that nice Mrs So and So down the street poisoned her husband. Gosh! The very idea!\\"Well, a woman did poison her husband. Someone found out and is blackmailing her. Roger Ackroyd knows who the blackmailer is. Roger Ackroyd is found dead. Enter Hercule Poirot.This book has been equally praised and criticised. It is praised for its audacity and ingenuity in fooling the reader and criticised for its mediocre style of writing. I do agree that Agatha Christie is not really a good writer per se but she is a good MYSTERY writer. She may be accused of writing poor dialogue and filling her books with one-dimensional characters, but she makes up for it by giving her readers damnably tricky conundrums. I suppose she can be compared to Tom Clancy. Clancy's prose makes the reader roll his/her eyes sometimes but damn it, he can write a battle scene! As can Christie when it comes to a murder mystery.This novel is one of her greatest conjuring tricks and is worth subsequent reads to find out how Christie deceives her readers. The story is straightforward enough but it is the twist in the end that leaves the reader going, \\"Well, I'll be darned...\\""},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I've read several reviews that say something like, &quot;Not the best Agatha.&quot; I would strongly disagree. Of the 80 or so novels writen by Christie, I've probably read about half of them. Not surprisingly, the books that get the most hype were on my list: Murder on the Orient Express, ABC Murders, And Then There Were None, etc. etc. Of the Christie &quot;classics&quot;, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the best. This novel has all the attributes of a great mystery: suspense, vibrant characters, Hercule Poirot, unpredictability, and a jaw dropping ending."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"WOW! That was my conclusion when I read this clever book. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd may not have the glamour of Murder on the Orient Express or Death on the Nile, but it more than makes up for this by the stunning ending. Immensley enjoyable. If you want to try Agatha Christie, try this one."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Only the brilliant mind of Agatha Christie could have thought of this ingenious murder mystery. The facts are all there but who would have guessed. Being British myself this book describes the setting as well as the language of the characters and surroundings to a tee. An emotional ending which leaves one thinking about life in Kings Abbot after....Must read to fill in my missing words.Its appeal still holds even after reading it so many times since its publication in 1926.

He, as always was the best character in all of this excellent story.In England, this is one of Agatha Christie's most famous works because of the shock we all get when Hercule Poirot unveils the murderer of Roger Ackroyd because of who did it. This book is one of Agatha Christie's greatest (In my opinion they are all great) and it makes an excellent read for anyone wanting to read a really, really, really good book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Book Review for The Murder of Roger AckroydAs a first-time Agatha Christy reader, I found this book quite entertaining. The writing was not particularly advanced, but it was not choppy, and was fairly well written. The characters were well defined, and much of the plot revolves around the many characters. One negative point about this book is that there is very little action. As a one time Christy reader, I do not know if all her other books are like this, but I found the pace of this book fairly slow and dull. By far the main attraction of this book is it's rich and detailed setting. From the summer house to the study, the scene of the crime and the area around it are full of rich detail and exact setting. I think that this greatly increases the appeal of the book, but the rest of it is not as strong."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"Possible the best mystery ever written. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"After reading &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, I can see why Agatha Christie is one of the greatest mystery writers to have ever lived. This book is written through the eyes of Dr. James Sheppard, who has been called when his patient, Roger Ackroyd, is murdered. Dr. Sheppard has recently lost a patient named Mrs. Ferrars who was engaged to the deceased. Before her death,she confided some personal information to Dr. Sheppard which gave him an inside track on the identity of the murderer. The victim's adopted son Roger, seems like a likely suspect, so his fiance Flora hires a retired detective, Hercule Poirot, to find the real killer. In his precise and logical way, Poirot does just that, uncovering the truth bit by bit as he interviews the possible suspects. They are all present--the family members who stand to gain financially from Ackroyd's death, the butler, the efficient private secretary, the housekeeper, the parlor maid, and a mysterious stranger. Only one of them is guilty and Poirot works his magic in this cleverly convoluted story. It is amazing to see that this book was written in 1926 and it is just as interesting today as it was almost 80 years ago."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I am an avid Agatha Christie fan and this novel was exceptional! This surpasses Murder on the Orient Express and Ten Little Indians BIGTIME! If you love Agatha Christie's novels, then you MUst read this. The ending is so masterfully written. This book really showcases Christie's genius for character."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This was by no means my first introduction to Hercule Poirot or Agatha Christie. _The Murder of Roger Ackroyd_ is, however, my favorite. As another reviewer mentions, this and _Ten Little Indians_ (_And Then There Were None_) have some of the most startling endings in the Christie canon. I especially enjoy the 1920's/30's Agatha Christie works for their view of the last days of the British Empire.In _Ackroyd_, suspicion is constantly rediverted. You have to be on your toes and track the timeline of the crime very closely. You'll find in this one that Poirot has known all along. This is in contrast to others where Poirot (&quot;I am a thrice imbecile&quot;) is uncertain.Finally, while A&amp;E's adaptations of Poirot are usually quite good, avoid A&amp;E's verion of _Ackroyd_. It can only be told in book form."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I thought this was an interesting and fun to read Agatha Christie, even though it broke many of the rules of British mystery writing. I enjoy Poirot more on film than reading as his character comes through more if you can see him."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This is pure Christie. Many of the elements of the mystery novel are here: the secluded island, the red herrings, suspicious characters, and a terrific build-up of suspense. I didn't know who the culprit was until nearly the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"This book was interesting, and the end actually surprised me which doesn't happen a lot! Also nice to read a book where there isn't a lot of cussing/smut. Would definitely recommend this to friends and even teens."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"So this was the second Agatha Christie book that I read. And I read it immediatly following A Poirot Christmas. As much as I liked this one (probably more than the first), I think that it was a bad idea to read them back-to-back. Roger Ackroyd was very interesting and engaging, but even with that, I still got a little bored by the end. Luckily, she redeemed herself with the ending because it was an awesome twist that I didn't see coming, even though I tried really hard to think of all possibilities and reasons.The sister, Caroline, was a very funny supporting character in this novel. And Poirot seems to never disappoint.So I do highly recommend this book, but I feel like since it was so similar to A Poirot Christmas, that I should have read something else in between.I don't know HOW Christie thinks of such clever twists and turns!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"One of Christie's best mysteries.

The characters in the book as well are solid, especially the doctor's sister. Christie is at her best when describing the characters and it adds to the enjoyment of the book. Poirot is true to his character and while he doesn't necessarily play the main character, he is still at his best."},{"Title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd","review":"I've read two of Agatha Christie's books now, and I won't be reading any more.

There was no real motive provided..., it felt like a trick on the reader. I have found Christie's novels too far-fetched for me.

In the past, however, the techniques used by scientists to interpret this data have not progressed as quickly. This is a book of modern statistical methods for analysis of practical problems in water quality and water resources.The last fifteen years have seen major advances in the fields of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and robust statistical methods. The 'real-life' characteristics of environmental data tend to drive analysis towards the use of these methods. These advances are presented in a practical and relevant format. Alternate methods are compared, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each as applied to environmental data. Techniques for trend analysis and dealing with water below the detection limit are topics covered, which are of great interest to consultants in water-quality and hydrology, scientists in state, provincial and federal water resources, and geological survey agencies.The practising water resources scientist will find the worked examples using actual field data from case studies of environmental problems, of real value. Exercises at the end of each chapter enable the mechanics of the methodological process to be fully understood, with data sets included on diskette for easy use. The result is a book that is both up-to-date and immediately relevant to ongoing work in the environmental and water sciences.ReviewsWater Resources Bulletin, American Water Resources Association, R.H. McCuen, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, October 1992 Statistical Methods in Water Resources is a well organized textbook that should be on the book shelf of everyone who is involved in the analysis of environmental and water quality data.Hydrological Sciences Journal, C.

I'll be sending my students to the U.S.G.S. website because the Elsevier version is out of print.This is an excellent teaching and reference text. It came from the notes of Helsel and Hirsch who taught (are teaching?) a statistical methods class to employees of the U.S.G.S. I know how this process works because I worked for the agency AND was a teacher in the basic hydrodynamics course that Jon Lee, Lewis deLong, and I put on.

The writing is clear and easy to understand. The graphics are good and serve to elucidate important concepts and methods. The examples are plentiful and well worked out. Answers to selected exercises are presented in the appendices.What is missing from the text (and the authors point this out) is basic material on probability and statistics. Users of Helsel and Hirsch will want a supplementary text to treat fundamental matters. The authors assume some basic knowledge which is consistent with both the topic matter and the level of presentation. Again, this is not a criticism of the text, but an observation for consumers of the work.I highly recommend this book to workers in the water resources field who need to apply statistical methods to their datasets. You won't go wrong here and will find much to use in exploring, analyzing, and presenting your results."},{"Title":"Statistical Methods in Water Resources","review":"This is a very useful and well-written book for researchers and practitioners working with water resources. The treatment of statistical methods is clear enough for beginners, and the exercises help ensure that the methods are learned properly.

It's jammed with stories that make it fun to read from beginning to end. Plus you really get a sense of history about this nationally renown university. It starts with Murray Butler's 44 year reign--old, blind, and deaf--and the desparate search for a new dynamic replacement.Was Ike anti-intellectual and anti-academic? Here you see both sides: He refused to honor John Dewey at a 1949 banquet; He was found sitting at his clean desk one day reading a Western novel; yet he spoke eloquently before a history class about the military books that influenced his decisions in Europe during WW2; he made surprise appearances in classes, including an economics course, although he was clearly more fond of Baker Field and the football games.Critics said he vacationed too much, played too much golf and bridge with his buddies, made too many off-campus appearances, and was seldom available to Columbia professors and administrators. But some of that was due to his staff handlers, who shielded him from his Columbia colleagues. Jacobs tells a delightful story of how history professor Robert Livingston Schuyler got around his handlers and met up with the General on his way home for lunch (pp. 125-26).After reading Jacobs' biography, I'm amazed how much Eisenhower accomplished, given his constant interruptions--trips to Washington, NATO leader, and running for President in 1952. Yet he gave a lot of good publicity to Columbia, which was hurting financially after the war, and got involved in many university projects (although he hated fundraising).Jacobs is even handed in reporting on Ike's supporters and detractors. His conclusion is that Ike was ultimately good for Columbia, and Columbia good for Ike even into his presidency; a surprise ending. My only complaint is that you learn very little about his wife Mamie in the book. She's around, but you never know what she's thinking. Otherwise, a mighty enjoyable reading of a little-remembered part of Eisenhower's career."},{"Title":"Topping: Spoken Chamorro REV Ed (Pali Language Texts)","review":"If you are looking for a book on how to speak &quot;perfect&quot; chamorro, then this book is for you.

The aliveness, the freshness, the excitement of spiritual discovery which motivated the author will find mush response in wide circles today.\\"To Edouard Schure in a moment of extra-sensory perception appeared the esoteric light flowing from one mystery center to another, from the mighty Himalayas to ther plateau of Iran, from the heights of Sinai to the summit of Tabor, from the secret sanctuaries of Egypt to the sacred groves of Eleusis and the Jordan. As in a lightning-flash he saw the many divinely Illuminated Ones and recognized that through them all moved the impulse of the eternal, Secret Wisdom. In that instant of cosmic consciousness Schure experienced the continuity of inspiration as historical fact. He discovered the key to the Secret History of man's striving for the spirit in all ages of time. From that recognition he wrote this book.\\"Schure was convinced that the Secret Wisdom not only can enlighten us concerning our own spiritual past, but can provide the insight necessary if we are to share in shaping a constructive future for humanity. Rudolf Steiner considered Schure to be \\"one of the best guides for finding the path to the spirit in our day\\", stating that the ideas expressed in his writings \\"can awaken within every human being a premonition of the solution of the riddles of existence\\".\\"Edouard Schure is a master in depicting for modern readers the engrossing story of man's eternal search for the esoteric knowledge of his origin, evolution and destiny in the light of the eternal spirit.

This 1982 Princeton University Press book provides a history (primarily focused on the period of 1830-1920) of the earliest health reform movements in this country. Unlike many similar histories, the book places these health movements to their broader social context (e.g., the Jacksonian and Progressivism reform movements).Whorton recognizes the religious motivations in some of these health movements, in chapters such as \\"Christian Physiology,\\" where Whorton covers figures such as Reverend Sylvester Graham (now known mostly as a vegetarian and inventor of the \\"graham cracker\\")Whorton's own observations are reserved, but often incisive: e.g., \\"It would be easy to overstate the impact of Grahamism on vegetarianism, as there is a strong temptation to say that before the 1830s the concern of vegetarians was to save animals, and that afterward it was to save people.

Now I assign it for English majors taking their final undergraduate seminar. &quot;The Well Wrought Urn&quot; is a collection of essays on various poems. The essays were published in various journals in the 1940s. Why is the book still read? It is read because these essays are superb examples of literary criticism at its best: insightful, accessible, graceful, witty. It is read because when one reads a poem, then reads Brooks' essay about it, then reads the poem again, one learns a great deal about how to understand poetry and gain from it meaning and pleasure. Brooks' insights aren't the only valid insights into these poems, but they are good ones. It's not that we read these essays to understand these specific poems, but to understand how to approach any poem. There's a lot of interesting literary criticism available in libraries, though far more is not very interesting or graceful. Few essays, however, are more helpful to students as tools for teaching the technique of literary analysis. Of course, Brooks, as a New Critic, is using a style of literary criticism not presently trendy. Still, the technique of discovering insights about poetry is still the same, no matter what the theory one uses.The review below this one is worthwhile, but I would suggest that the author misses the joke. What he takes as condescension is a condescension that includes the readers within the circle of initiates. It doesn't scoff at the reader. Thus, it is meant to help English majors think that they are a sort of blessed priesthood who have been initiated into the secrets of the fellowship. (When I was in grad school, that's what I thought we were.) Of course, this is all somewhat tongue in cheek and meant to be witty.About twelve years ago I had the pleasure of hearing Brooks, then quite elderly (I don't know if he is still alive), present a paper at a conference. I remember him as slim, polite, self-effacing--the essence of the Southern gentleman at his best."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"This book, written nearly a half-century ago, has never been out of print. To read it is to see why. With Cleanth Brooks, who taught at Yale for most of his career, you feel as if you are sitting in a seminar with the most brilliant professor you've ever known, one who is also a true gentleman with extraordinary solicitude for his students/readers. He takes you through the poems line by line and helps you to *see* the artistry of the poet at work. And so sparkling is his prose style that the essays are themselves works of art. This book is especially appropriate for students who are just beginning to appreciate poetry."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"This is the kind of elegantly written criticism that makes one want to take poetry seriously. One finds no rant or cant, no impenetrable jargon. Brooks takes a broad selection of English poems across periods and styles, and analyzes their rhetorical structure. He seeks the essence of poetic thought and offers the notion of \\"paradox\\" as a possible key. The usefulness of extra-poetic ideas is not denied, but he rightly insists that a poem's meaning is not reducible to a simple prose statement. If it is so reducible, then the poem may be judged as true or false by the historian, scientist or philosopher. The book also contains several essays of generalization and the texts of most of the scrutinized works. One of the most satisfying books on the rhetoric of poetry that I've read."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"Cleanth Brooks is a major figure in the history of Literary Criticism. Along with Robert Penn Warren he championed an approach to Literature which involved concentrating on the text itself. The biographical, sociological, historical information is what is by and large ignored. Here in one of his major works Brooks reads in his own way ten of the great poems of English Literary history. One of them from which the title is taken is Gray 's 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' He also reads Yeats 'Among School Children ' Tennyson's 'Tears Idle Tears' Keats \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn' Wordsworth's Intimations Ode, Pope's 'The Rape of the Lock' Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' Donne's 'CanonizationMilton 'L'Allegro' and 'Pensoroso'.To my surprise he does not give a line by line reading. He discourses on the poems. I did not find the discourse at the level of the greatest criticism , but found it occasionally informative. The opening essay 'On Paradox and Poetry' I found convincing. The reading of Wordsworth's 'Intimations Ode' played with the meanings of 'loss ' of the celestial light. The visionary gleam which is the child's before the initiation into the full light of the day. A parallel is made between the development of the child, and the light of the sun. Brooks reads Wordsworth as a deeply symbolic and paradoxical poet. I also enjoyed his reading of Keats 'Ode to a Grecian Urn' where he considers how the famous closing lines regarding 'Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty' relate to the whole of the poem."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"When one compares Understanding Poetry with The Well Wrought Urn, one is struck by an odd pairing of likenesses with differences. Both seek to advance the acceptance of New Critical tenets by listing a number of well-known poems and analyzing each to determine how the poet focuses attention on the organic unity, which requires the reader to consider how that poet integrates a dozen or so manifestations of language and structure all of which coalesce to produce the one \\"correct\\" interpretation. The primary difference does not lie in the many more poems of Understanding Poetry but rather in Brooks' determination to reply to the charges of critics who loudly complained that Brooks had unfairly and unreasonably excluded any reference to disciplines external to the purely literal. For Brooks, these external differences were holdovers from the previous generation's fascination with the historical/biographical school of literary interpretation, a related theory which suggests that facts from the life and times of the poet are crucial in fixing the behind the scenes mixing of form and content as prerequisites to uncovering the meaning. Brooks went to considerable lengths to emphasize that he had no problem with historical/biographical approaches to literature. They had their place in the literary scheme of things but criticism was not one of them. Brooks noted that there was no objective proof that knowing a fact about either the reader or his times revealed anything germane about the text. What historical/biographical criticism did not address were the excellences of a poem. Nor did they explain how the varied elements of New Critical analyses (figurative language, imagery, symbolism, etc) interacted with each other to uncover the meaning.The most striking chapter was \\"The Heresy of Paraphrase.\\" Brooks contended that it was impossible to write a prose paraphrase of a poem such that the paraphrase contained the full power and sweeping imagination of the originating poem. What the paraphrase had were the external trappings of the poem with none of the language that made that poem a poem. Language is a complex unity of a myriad of factors that add up to more than the sum of a poem's parts. If one substitutes the language of a paraphraser for the language of the poet, the result is not unlike comparing lightning to a lightning bug. One simply cannot mistake one for the other. Brooks' anathema toward paraphrase fits well into his schema concerning New Criticism in general. The focus should be on the words of the text not the re-worded words or life or history of either the poet or the critic. That The Well Wrought Urn is still a staple of criticism suggests that even if New Criticism as a distinct theory has long since left center stage as a power player the ability to use its principles of close reading is a telling reminder that a critical eye on a text is a tool that will never go out of style regardless of the inane theory making use of it."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"Although first published over 60 years ago, this book continues to be essential for anyone who wants to understand how to read poetry. The poems examined in the book were written by many different authors over a period of over 300 years. Some of the poets include Marvell, Donne, Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Gray, Wordsworth and T. S. Eliot. The book investigates the differences and the similarities in the poems and finally arrives at a deeper understanding of what poetry is. This is an essential book for anyone interested in significant poetry."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"Never have students and those interested in liberal education needed more to read Brooks' &quot;Urn,&quot; for in clear, readable, and rememberable language Brooks anticipates the neo-nihilism of postmodernism and gives it the lie."},{"Title":"The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (A Harvest Book)","review":"I've been known to bristle: to bristle at condescension; to bristle at unsupportable proclamations of absolutes. Therefore, as I read the rhetoric of a Cleanth Brooks, whom I suppose I must admire since he is a very famous critic, I become very much in touch with the things that irritate me about literary criticism: the assumption that intellectual capacities have been too early stymied in the reader and the vacuous and malingering abstractions of those whose lofty intellects we are suppose to gasp at in awe as those intellects fly free of the boundaries imposed by earth's pull, demonstrated verbosity the apparent key to wingless flight. Of course, it may well be argued that I am insecure and find new ideas (even old ones examined anew) both threatening and difficult to understand. Or it may be that my philosophical underpinnings have been too heavily influenced by the Greeks, who were often irritated at hubris. It may be that my concept of literature is that it is an egalitarian resource for the mind, the accessibility of which offers more hope to the humble human than all the legions of self-help authors combined, and that my bristling is in part motivated by exclusionary rhetoric. Ideas need not pander, but neither do they need to float down from on high. So forgive my bristling, but Brooks's parenthetical rhetoric-\\"The underlying paradox (of which the enthusiastic reader may well be unconscious) is nevertheless thoroughly necessary, even for that reader\\" (4)-early in The Well-Wrought Urn sets off my hubris alarm bells and leaves me, since I have already been condescended to, alert for the unsupportable absolutes that will surely follow. The first one comes clipping fast upon the heels of \\"the enthusiastic reader\\": \\"The calm of the evening obviously means \`worship,' even to the dull-witted and insensitive\\" (5). This an absolute enforced through ridicule at dissent, and so far the only thing of substance Brooks has demonstrated is my simple innocence and the punishment that will follow disagreement; however, dwelling upon Brooks's rhetoric may cause us to miss the argument within it.Therefore, let me leave those bristle-producing elements aside in favor of analyzing the argument, bearing in mind, nonetheless, that Brooks has attempted to hang an ad hominem argument over the head of dissention, much like Dionysius hung the sword above Damocles's head. Let us, however, fear not the snapping horsehair; but neither let us miss the feast for love of our defiance. To wit, writes Brooks: \\"We resent the arrogance implied in judgments which seem to have any tinge of absoluteness about them, and, as a rule, no profession of personal humility on the part of the critic who renders them is sufficient to assuage us\\" (216).True enough, and Brooks anticipates the reaction to his own arrogance and rightly points out that \\"no profession of personal humility\\" can redeem the critic thus perceived. However, it is the dismissive reader who might then miss what otherwise flows from Brooks: a cogent and persuasive bit of work. So we must choose to ignore the ever-present condescension that drips off of Brooks like an overworked sweat and acknowledge that he has provided in The Well Wrought Urn both insightful analyses and well-considered argument.This latter remark may seem a reversal of my intuitive bristling, a step away from my belief that what would follow would be an indefensible absolute. Pshaw. Brooks is, indeed, full of it; that's why he needed to hang the sword. Nonetheless there is a sharp edge to his argument, even if the conclusion fails to pierce with a valid point (Indeed, it is blunted by qualification and contradiction).To the edge then, if not to the point: Brooks's argument has awakened me to a very profound weakness in my own readings, that weakness being an inattention to textual weave, the connectedness of ideas and imagery. Only inconsistently do I concern myself with the details of poetry and, instead, rely on the stuff to wash over me whole, and only here and there do I perceive its intrarelationships.Of course, there is validity to having the aesthetic of a thing wash whole over its admirer. I for one can stand in front of a Renoir, mesmerized, over long, unbroken periods of time, sensing the beauty and, indeed, reveling in it. But I am no art critic, no expert on what I am seeing. I experience only effect. All well and good for an art admirer and all that is required. If, however, I am a student of art, technique suddenly becomes an issue. That is, if I am a good student. I must understand each brushstroke-each part-in relation to the whole. I must understand why the work is good. Were I to forgo that understanding, I would be a poor student indeed.And, in fact, that is what Brooks is saying of poetry and those of us who are students of literature; we must immerse ourselves within the poetry we study and uncover the brushstrokes, the paint daubs, the relationships of colors."},{"Title":"Vespa P/Px 125, 150 & 200 Scooters 1978-2003 (Haynes Manuals)","review":"If you own a old P125X, P200E, or a newer PX150 you should own this service manual even if you don't plan on working on your scooter.

In the land before time (Terminals with Internet and Monsterous E-commerce), you discovered various scholarships to apply for from books, magazines, and the news media. Students (like me) spent hours apon hours in 'scholarship listings' xeroxing every possibility that we would owe the government less after we graduated college.Back when I started college (1998), the 'de facto' standard was this book by Daniel Cassidy. One year, a few of fellow High School students attended colleges out-of-state for free.

The print is readable, and it gives you the basic requirements for each scholarship along with contact information.BUY THIS BOOK EACH YEAR UNTIL YOU GRADUATE!

I've been in the field for some years now and working with Server 2003/AD for about 2 yrs now. I combined my studies with the Sybex book and ExamCram series, all available at excellent prices here on Amazon (I usually get all my new tech books here because of lower costs). I'd highly recommend anyone wanting to pursue this MCSA certification to use all 3 books, it all balances out in the end and you get different perspectives on the same subject matter, some explained in a more layman way than technical. I used a combination of this one and MOAC 70-290 ([...])for my studies (as well as those listed above), actually had to read thru the book twice since it had so much to deal with. Can't stress enough to do the labs, do them all, do the reviews.

This book is full of useful material, and the exercises you are supposed to perform are generally relevant and useful for preparing for the exam.Every objective in the exam is technically covered, but the book does not include some of material that is covered on the test. This is not entirely the book's fault, as some of the test questions bordered on obscure. Still, 85%-90% of the actual test material is covered somewhere in the book. If you read the book carefully and slowly, there is a good chance you will pass the exam.Unfortunately, the problem with this book is NOT detail. This book was extremely dry and was it wasn't very fluid. The material simply did not \\"flow\\" as you were reading it, and the sections were very disjointed... If you look at my review history, you'll see that I've read quite of few technical books that others would consider \\"dry\\"... but this one takes the cake (just edging out the ISC's CISSP book).I also managed to read Sybex's 70-291 book, and also viewed CBT nugget's training video. Sybex's book was more geared toward the fundamentals, and lacked some of the details found in this book. The Sybex book is perfect for starting from the ground up, was fluid and explained itself very well. It was much more pleasant to read than this MS self paced training kit. The Sybex book would be the better book for a beginner, while this book would be better for a seasoned MS Administrator.CBT nuggets was an excellent resource as well. It covered a lot of those little details that are hard to pick up through reading, or that might not be obvious until you perform the actions in a lab environment.About the exam:The MS exams are less straightforward (more tricky) than other exams that I've taken. I hear people often complain that they narrow it down to \\"two possible answers\\", and have trouble choosing between the two. If you encounter this problem, you aren't reading the question carefully enough. Almost every question like this that I saw had a small detail that would eliminate all but one answer. Not one question had two \\"correct\\" answers.The questions are also a bit more wordy than other exams, so if you aren't the most patient person you may have some trouble. Once again, its important that you look over the details.While I can't violate the NDA, I can say that a good portion of the questions fell within the core of the objectives. Most were very routine questions that involve average day to day tasks for an Administrator. About 5%-10% of the questions, however, were only LOOSELY related to the core objectives. For instance, the disaster recovery objective could extend to any service in the active directory. Do you know how to backup/replicate/transfer data from ALL the services that are integrated into active directory? Probably not. I was very lucky to have seen these things before, but they were so obscure I doubt most people have even seen them (let alone know how they work).Also, I have a feeling most people will be unprepared for the automation objections. No one really uses them. Just a wake up call to all of you, they are on the test (its in the objectives!). If you don't know exactly what these automation tools do, you are going to have a hard time. Do you know the format differences, and do you know the functionality differences of LFIDE vs CSVDE vs AD Users and Computers? These tools aren't very automated, so no one really uses them (Much easier to use user data to produce dsadd or dsmod scripts). Learn how to use them.I would definitely set up a lab, or use CBT training videos. Reading alone isn't going to be enough, especially for the simulations.Finally, you NEED practice questions for this test. Its coverage is far too broad, and you need to make sure you have all areas of the objectives down pat. Its easy to have some wrong ideas about permissions, and/or group scopes and not realize it until you are tested. If you have a problem like this (especially in these areas), you aren't going to do well."},{"Title":"MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-290): Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server(TM) 2003 Environment, Second Edition","review":"This product is far superior to the proscribed Microsoft course books that you will get in a classroom setting.

However, there were several subjects that appeared both on the practice test and the actual exam that were never mentioned in the book.If you have an excellent memory and can understand all the topics, especially file/folder permissions, backup, and group scope, this book should be sufficient. If you require a little more reinforcement and can't afford to miss a few oddball questions, better grab a second reference manual or be prepared to dig through TechNet for details on more subjects. Also keep in mind that the new MS tests feature simulations that require you to use a mini virtual version of Server 2003 to work through certain problems.This book is a little light on IIS 6.0, IPSec/SMB (not mentioned at all), and certain details of Terminal Services. The MeasureUp test questions are hit and miss, some of the really huge ones are much more complicated than what you might see on the test, but if you can pass on the practice tests, you can pass 70-290. I didn't even look at the labs, but I hear they can have you bouncing around a lot."},{"Title":"MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-290): Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server(TM) 2003 Environment, Second Edition","review":"This book is a little strange organized(chapters order) and some exercises cannot be completed due to additional configration steps needed that were supposed to be done in prior exercises, but they were omitted.

This book touches on everything that Windows Server 2003 has to offer. However, I would strongly advise using this in conjuction with other study materials if you are planning on taking the 70-290 exam. The practice questions in this book (and on the CD) are very good for real life situations that you will encounter as an administrator, but they are nothing like what you will encounter on the actual exam. I would suggest reading this book cover to cover doing all of the practice labs & questions, and then doing as many free practice questions as you can find online from a reputable source."},{"Title":"MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-290): Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server(TM) 2003 Environment, Second Edition","review":"I took about 3 months reading and studying this book cover-to-cover. There is a lot of information in the book, but it is rather poorly organized, with multiple mistakes/typos, and missing information. This is a \\"Training Kit\\" yet the authors/editors seem to believe the reader should have prior knowledge of certain concepts or terms. I have been working with Windows servers since 1996, having taken the NT 4.0 certification classes, and I found there were many concepts and 'proprietary terms' that were not addressed. I spent a lot of extra time Googling these.Further frustrating were the multiple references to many, many external sources for the in-depth information needed to attain the level of proficiency required for the exam on certain topics.After finishing the instruction part of the book, I randomly opened to the self-testing part of the book. The very first question referenced a topic not covered in the text; I know because I did a thorough search of the included PDF of the text and the answer was not in the search results.Over-all, a typical Microsoft experience, lots of over-sell with little follow-through.

He warns that the reader must have a firm understanding of the first chapter before going on with the rest of the book but this chapter requires reading and rereading to get a half decent understanding.I have 3 college degrees so I am not a dummy but I will admit I am not super smart so maybe it is just me.

It surveys and discusses(in a critical way,unlike many other treatments in vogue today) the theoretical issues surrounding the sociological and anthropological approaches to NT study.On of the book's major strengths is that it has a comprehensive analysis of the social history(including the role of gender in the ancient world) and economic and social structure of Judaism and Christianity in its Greco-Roman context.The authors are familiar with the primary sources and judiciously apply sociological and anthropological methodologies in a critical way,that doesn't distort the sources or fill in the gap where the sources don't speak-a fault with alot of this type of NT analysis.Another major plus is it differentiates, for the sake of analysis,the social world of the Palestian Judaism of Jesus and the urban milieu of the Greco-Roman world where the church made inroads in its mission.In both cases they correctly evaluate the type of current sociological and anthropological theory which will best illuminate the phenomenon under investigation.In all this the texts are the main focus, not the theoretical approaches being used. In my opinion, this book represents what the work of the Context Group(Bruce Malina,et al) could accomplish.I would call this book magisterial in its efforts.It's a must read for serious students of the NT."},{"Title":"The Jesus Movement: A Social History of Its First Century","review":"In The Jesus Movement: A Social History Of Its First Century, Ekkehard W. Stegemann (Professor of New Testament at the University of Basel, Switzerland) and Wolfgang Stegemann (Rector and Professor of New Testament at the Augustana Hochschule in Neuendettelsau, Germany) effectively collaborate to present a vividly depicted, scholarly, and comprehensive history of how the new and fledgling Christian movement developed, expanded, and evolved over the first hundred years of its existence. Of special interest is the roles played by women in the development of Christianity within the patriarchal, Mediterranean cultures. While highly recommended for students of New Testament Studies, this informative, engaging work is wonderfully accessible and written for the non-specialist general reader with an interest on how the Christian communities struggled and created their identities in both rural and urban settings."},{"Title":"The Jesus Movement: A Social History of Its First Century","review":"This item was as ordered; as described; well packed; fast delivery; I would purchase again from this seller."},{"Title":"Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence Ani-Manga Box Set","review":"for starters to put it in a nut shell this is a direct paper print of the movie Ghost in the Shell 2:Innocence, every page contains exact frames from the movie, so if you have seen the movie this ani-manga box set is NOT going to offer you anything new, when it comes to the story...moreover there's a lot of un-translated sound effects...so you will get to read what the characters said in the movie but the stuff as the word BOOM or Clank, is left in Japanese...and there are pages upon pages of landscape shots from the movie that have these sound effects all over them..also there are a good 3 pages or so of credits slides from the move too...and there in Japanese..moreover..the only real value this thing has is collectors value..the box is nicely made and durable ..and the 4 mini-mangas are awesomely printed *very high quality* and have the smoothest covers on the planet...overall this ani-manga is cool but not that cool, without offering anything new to the movie..and short changing the sound-effects..when the main printed dialogue is in English?!?!?!...the product falls short of expatiation for its price..MOREOVER...it also fails recreate the experience that the movie generates....in short if you really wanna experience Ghost In the Shell 2:Innocence, GO WATCH THE MOVIE, only buy this as a supplement if you are a collector of Shell Memorabilia"},{"Title":"Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence Ani-Manga Box Set","review":"I recently came across a great line that describes \\"Innocence\\" to a T: \\"It's an action flick for scholars.\\" Yes. Not that I'm a \\"scholar\\", ahem. But the intellectual musings including the philosophical quoting motifs are the elements that I appreciated most from this movie. That's exactly why the Manga is a must have. There are several moments in the movie where I had to hit pause and think about what I had just seen or read in the sub-titles. There are many frames in the movie that carry tons of symbolism that pass by too quickly, but that can be looked at, like art, in this manga. A prime example being the Tree Image on Aramaki's wall. It wasn't until staring at the pages on the Manga that I realized the potent symbols that lay at the base of the tree.Also, moments between Batou and the Major are particularly poignant and required more time that I was able to absorb from the pages moreso than the movie.Yes, the panels in the Manga are frames extracted from the movie. I don't think I would have wanted it any other way. I didn't buy the Manga to see a recreation of the amazing art. I bought it so that I could absorb the story and the text at a page by page rate.

In Haiti, the writings of Jean Price-Mars were linking Haitian cultural identity with an African lineage laying the groundwork for the Indigeniste Movement. This shift saw a reclamation of non-white and non-western elements of Haitian communal life paired with a rejection of French neo-colonial subjugation. In Cuba, Nicolas Guillen was engaging Afro-Cuban cultural experiences and son rhythm in his work becoming the genesis of the literary movement Negrismo.In Paris, a Clamart salon was the seat of intellectual confluence for the global black community finding American, Caribbean and African writers meeting to exchange dialogue and shared ideals. Sisters Andree, Jane and Paulette Nardal hosted this trans-racial and cosmopolitan cast of characters whose discussions traversed the expanse of humanism, literature, art and the future direction of the diaspora. These first fruitful conversations beget \\"Negro: An Anthology\\" edited by Nancy Cunard which further beget \\"La Revue du monde noir\\" edited by Paulette Nardal. In these two publications was developed the social and political culture which would give rise to Negritude within the black writers and thinkers of the Francophone colonies.The selections included here are rich with the anguish, experience, insight, emotion and intelligence emerging from different points within the black Francophone post-colonial world. The language was a common medium through which each author might interact and compare notes about how their individual culture had grappled with the question and impact of blackness. There was a vastly different cultural continuum which informed a Malagasy author such as Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo than would shape the Haitian author Rene Depestre. The poetry of the latter was born of the constant flux of Haitian revolutionary politics and the mysteries of Voudoun while the writing of the former had its origin in the relative isolation of Madagascar amongst African nations and the unity of the Malagasy tribes in resisting attempts at colonization.These internal conflicts in the cohesive blackness that Negritude sought to invoke would later lead to a splintering amongst adherents and the rise of such offshoots as Creolite and Antillanite. Antillanite sought to draw attention to the unique historical and cultural configuration of the Caribbean which brought together both indigenous and imported elements in crafting a shared identity amongst its inhabitants. Creolite refined this shared identity further to focus its attention specifically upon the French Caribbean. These splits mirrored the search for a common black identity which gave rise to the New Negro Renaissance and Garveyism of the same period in the U.S. along with the conflicting direction of those two movements.The most unfortunate aspect of the anthology is that one cannot reach a cohesive sense of this historical context by examining the introduction of the text and author biographies which precede each chapter. The editor chose to engage only the poetic and prosaic output which flourished within Negritude though as the movement expanded its reach through literary journals, it produced poems, prose, essays and cultural commentary. There was also a failure to adequately address the role women played in the conception and advancement of Negritude although the Nardal sisters amongst others provided a critical intellectual spark in propelling Negritude forward.Even with these shortfalls, I consider this a necessary work in helping members of the diaspora in the U.S. to gain an international perspective of Pan African literary and intellectual insight where we have previously engaged mostly in the study those literary movements originating in the United States. The availability of more comprehensive information about the experience of members of the global black community serves only to strengthen the cultural ties we make with one another. The history of the Negritude movement should inform us that while we may not be able to wrangle all of these prickly personalities into a single, progressive monolith, we can open channels of dialogue and create pathways of exchange that may lead us to mine our own cultural experience even more deeply."},{"Title":"Jewelry making, for schools, tradesmen [and] craftsmen","review":"This book is excellent, I have had trouble putting it down and getting down to some work.

It has identifying captions (a typical one is \\"4 months: the yolk-sac above the embryo\\") but no descriptive narrative otherwise. The pictures are amazing and many from the fetus/embryo section are duplicates of the photos in A Child Is Born. I think this is a great book if you are an admirer of Nilsson's photography or just interested in the human body and human reproduction.A Child Is Born has narrative describing what happens at each stage of fetal development, accompanied by in-utero photos.

While it skewers business as usual in DC, it mostly shies away from partisan politics and keeps from getting overly preachy. Some of the characters are a bit hastily drawn to serve the fast-moving plot, but Huerta and his underdog allies quickly grab your attention and have you rooting for them.

The idea is to build melds (as in regular rummy), but game play is affected by a special set of cards (gavel cards) that allow you to draw extra cards from the deck, score extra points, or allow you to retrieve cards from the discard pile. Each of the Mystery Rummy games uses slightly different mechanics and is based on a different mystery.This is the best of the Mystery Rummy games. It is the most strategically rewarding, offering many opportunities to alter ones position in the game. Also, unlike the rest of the Mystery Rummy games, this game has unique game mechanic which creates tension the longer the game goes on and allows one person to \\"shut out\\" the other players even if that player didn't empty their hand (the normal way for ending the rummy game).Not that the game is difficult to learn, but Ripper is much more complicated than the other games of the series and has many more gavel cards. The complexity creates a wonderful game, but for players looking for something a little less complicated, Mystery Rummy 3 - Jekyll/Hyde offers excellent game play and is much simpler."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper (Mystery Rummy, Case No. 1)","review":"This is a great game. Being similiar to rummy its easy to learn yet different enough to make it even more entertaining. The process of collecting evidence and placing victims with scenes as you build a case against a particular suspect is challenging and fun at the same time. My favorite aspects of the game is the explainations on the cards. These explanations give insight into the Whitechapel Murders which occured in the East End of London during 1888. I found them so interesting I am now reading The Complete History of Jack the Ripper to get the full story. An awesome game all around!"},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper (Mystery Rummy, Case No. 1)","review":"This delightful card game is a perfect combination of mystery and rummy. In the first of three installments of mystery rummy the players attempt to solve the Jack the Ripper murders.Play truly begins when one of the players plays a Victim card, thus signaling the beginning of the Ripper Murders. Each player tries to form melds (three of a kind or more) of evidence cards against various suspects. As the game progresses new victims are found, evidence mounts, and alabis can be provided. When a player gets rid of all the cards in their hand the round is over. The suspect with the most evidence against them (without an alabi) is Jack the Ripper. Cards pertaining to that suspect are doubled in value for all players. But be careful, if all five victims are revealed, it is possible for Jack to escape, leaving all but one player vitually pointless for the round.A little extra strategy is thrown in by allowing a vote during the hand. Each player secretly writes down who they believe will be Jack the Ripper at the end of the hand. Players who are correct score bonus points.This is a great rummy game. It's perfect for a quiet night at home with a loved one, or for a small group at a Halloween party. I highly recommend this game."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper (Mystery Rummy, Case No. 1)","review":"Takes the traditional rummy game and adds a twist. My husband and I play this game a lot and because of the various ways to get points and win, the game is never the same. We really enjoy it and would like to find a way to put another Case No."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper (Mystery Rummy, Case No. 1)","review":"This game can be fun, but it's also pretty dark. If you really think about what you're playing, it can be a little creepy.It's a multi-player game where the object is to either catch Jack the Ripper, or ensure the Ripper's escape. Points vary according to which tactic you employ.Each player creates melds that are specific to Jack the Ripper's victim's: clues, potential murderers and the like - all of these have a certain air of historical accuracy.The rules take a little practice to figure out, but once you get started it's pretty simple. Like other Mystery Rummy games there's a nice bit of strategy involved.Out of all the Mystery R. games, this is my least favorite - maybe just because of the theme."},{"Title":"Napa","review":"Napa is a fine book for anyone interested in wines in general and in the ones produced in Napa Valley in particular. The beginning of the book is really the best part. With a great deal of interesting details, the author recalls the beginning of wine production in the area. Reading the story of the pionners who settled there in the beginning of the century is really fascinating. The description of the lives of great characters such as Gustave Niebaum, Georges de Latour or John Daniel are really well written. The second part of the book is less interesting. It focusses too much on political battles in the late 80's and the author has clearly chosen his camp and shows too much the people that he does not like. It would be great if the author would suppress the last chapters and write about what happened in the 90's. Napa Valley has changed, new producers have emerged and an up-dated version of Napa would be a great gift for all wine lovers."},{"Title":"Napa","review":"Conaway's Napa is subtitled, &quot;The Story of an American Eden.&quot; Conaway has done his research in uncovering the history of the valley and the origin of its now world-class wineries. However, readers who are looking for a romantic evocation of this &quot;American Eden&quot; may be disappointed. Conaway devotes more space to land use issues, corporate politics and social history than to the development of the vintner's art in the Napa. The story is told through a series of short chapters relating to many of the people who have had made an impact on the valley. This provides a detailed history, but the author does little to provide much synthesis for the many narratives. The book begins with the arrival of Jack and Jamie Davies and their renovation of the Shramsberg winery in the early 60's, but the last several chapters deal almost exlusively with the political battles between the big vintners, portrayed as greedy and selfish, and the slow-growth advocates, the story's idealistic heroes. The conflicts between growth versus conservation and art versus commerce do provide some interesting drama and are necessary elements of the story of Napa Valley. But the essence of Napa is wine and the good life, and this story gets lost in the politics of Conaway's version of Napa. Read the book for the interesting history of Napa's wine industry and the wealth of historical detail, but understand that the author is more conerned with how the beauty of Napa can be preserved than with the romance of the vine."},{"Title":"Napa","review":"The author, a free-lance wine writer not widely regarded as a heavyweight, has done a National Enquirer treatment of Napa and its leading wine personalities, reprinting a lot of rumors, quoting a lot of unnamed sources. Never mind. It's a helluva read. Just don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"Napa","review":"It is interesting to read history, whether people or events,and feel as though you were/are there as it is playing out.Napa is a book that takes you on a fast moving trak from theearly days of the wine business in California;the people,the companies,the personalities, mistakes and successesand the politics. These are the stories involving some ofthe worlds famous wines, winemakers and wineries.

From Gene Duffey to the Wineries folks I say this book is right on. Napa is now nothing like what it was then and I live just a little past Calistoga.It was then less corporate and more fun for all. Less people during the week and before the I phone folks talked a lot more to one another and everyone had an opinion based on nothing like the facts.This book brings it all into perspective and worth reading."},{"Title":"Napa","review":"It's almost 20 years since I first devoured this stylish, tell all tale of the incredible struggles of the Napa Valley wine dwellers as they wrestle with changes overtaking their sweet homeland.

Breathtakingly brilliant, seriously suspenseful, and it stands the test of time as today I am once more returning to reread it. An American story, a wine story, a green story - and a must read!DEAR PUBLISHER - PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON KINDLE!!!"},{"Title":"Napa","review":"Especially if you're planning a visit to the California Wine Country, consider spending some time with this book. The story is fascinating and provides an almost personal connection that gives a wonderful context to one's own experience of the place. Footprints of many of the storied poineers can still be found in the Valley today, but one might miss them trusting only a tour book. Conaway is sometimes criticized for his politics shining through the latter part of the book, but (perhaps due to my on sympathies?) I would disagree. There have been dramatic changes in the American wine industry and especially in Napa Valley over the past twenty years, and hearing a well articulated commentary (at least through the first of those watershed years) detracts little from the picture Conaway evokes.

The actual writing style reminded me a bit of the telling of a Native Indian legend, especially at first. I assume the author found that style to be appropriate to the story she was relating. The contrast between native Indian lifestyle and beliefs is well-brought out and shown in contrast to \\"civilization\\" in the mission. Pasquala is caught between two worlds and her struggle for independence is poignant.From the dustjacket: \\"Pasquala loved the mission life. The five years since she and her parents had left the village of their people, the Tulare Indians, had been good and peaceful ones, disturbed only by the demands of her uncle, chief of the tribe, that they return.The days were filled with the mission routine - school and church: festivals and games: a trip into the mountains to gather pinon nuts which almost ended in disaster.Then suddenly Pasquala was caught up in a nightmare of kidnapping, captivity, and death. How her courage and faith sustained her and enabled her to accomplish the near-impossible is the climax to this moving story, based on fact, of a California Indian girl who, in 1824, saved a mission.\\"I found Pasquala's resolve inspiring and appreciated the recounting of everyday mission life. The picture created of life so long ago is of great value. And I particularly enjoyed the recounting of the trip to gather pinon nuts.I recommend this book for grades 2-7 and it would be a fine read-aloud for grades 1-4 or so. It is written in the more innocent style of a few short decades ago and may not appeal as much to some children in grades 6-7 with a more worldly bent. Let me emphasize that this book is a terrific candidate for a read-aloud."},{"Title":"Song of the Brook","review":"Hilda's parents were both loving and hardworking. They set a good example to Hilda.

They write historical fiction, which is my favorite - I learn alot and also am entertained with a wonderful, engaging story.I especially like that they are Christians and their writing reflects Christian beliefs and values.There are three books in the this series called Shiloh Legacy and they are about World War I and the Great Depression of 1929. The stories follow the lives of four men who met fighting in the war, and then on to where the next 10 years takes them. A Thousand Shall Fall is the second book.

In Thoene's book, you can see the woods and streams, smell the woodsmoke and fried chicken and see the gleaming yellow sky just before the tornado. Thoene's descriptions of rural northwest Arkansas are straight from my granny's mouth it seems! The plots are compelling and the characters well developed. I enjoyed learning more about the 1929 Crash and the subsequent problems caused by greedy investors...and the realization that it is just money, after all! I can't wait to begin reading the third Shiloh book....but my household chores are piling up because I couldn't put this book down!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Shall Fall","review":"\\"A Thousand Shall Fall\\" is a historical novel set in September and October of 1929 and leads up to the stock market crash. This novel is the second in the series, but you don't need to have read \\"In My Father's House\\" to understand this one (though it will make it more enjoyable). Reading this novel out of order will partly spoil some events in the previous novel.There were several point of view characters from different parts of America and different stations in life. The characters were interesting, and Birch's family was very engaging. Birch's sons got into a lot of very funny scrapes. However, the storyline with the boy, David, pushed past what I felt was realistic.Since we know the stock market crash is only weeks away and will affect everyone in the book, the suspense was high from beginning to end. There were also some relationship tensions and occasional physical danger to main characters to add suspense.The historical and setting details brought the story alive in my imagination. Most of the historical details were about class differences and how prohibition and the stock market affected society. The book wrapped up very quickly and left a number of loose ends, but they might be answered in the next book in the series.Several of the main characters were Christians. However, there wasn't much religious content until near the very end when they have to decide to trust in God even if they loose everything else.There was no sex. There was no bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable and well-written historical novel."},{"Title":"A Thousand Shall Fall","review":"I had given In My Father's House only 4 stars because I was disappointed in the ending.

Mr. Mosher get off the mundane and maybe useful recipes and dives in to history and historic recipes. I love this book. I flip through it when looking for inspiration. Often I use it for compare and contrast. For example Mr.Mosher is not a huge fan of crystal malts so he often goes in a different direction then is the \\"norm \\". I do wish he had taken more time to write out some of the recipes. Many are written add in , or changes you could make to a previous recipe.

I must admit that I was put off by the title at first. \\"Radical Brewing? I don't want to brew weird stuff, I want to brew good stuff...\\" But after I had a chance to browse thru a copy, I realized there was nothing weird about it. It is radical like Copernicus was radical. It is full of really interesting information that I had not known or barely heard of before. This is a spectrum of brewing, brews, and brewers.How to describe it??Broadly, it is like Designing Great Beers in that it presents the ingredients of brewing, the methods for using them and how various beer styles were developed by using those ingredients.The difference could be described in this way though: If DGB were described as a university course in the main lecture hall on brewing, then Radical Brewing is sitting down with the Prof one-on-one, while he regales with his experiences and pours you samples as he talks. And, if you know Randy, then this description of his book is self-explanatory. It really is a book that you will pick up and read for the fun of it. There are lots of interesting recipes, and his discussion makes you want to try them.A great book to further your homebrewing education.John Palmerauthor of \\"How To Brew\\"www.howtobrew.com"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Wow. Radical, indeed. The etymology is apropos; radical comes from the Latin radix, meaning root. Mosher gets to the root of all sorts of subjects with his witty style and erudition. This guy knows his stuff. If there is any grain or sugar or spice or herb in this world that has ended up in a brewpot, Mosher has probably written about it.At the risk of turning this review section into a lovefest, I agree with the other reviewers. If you've never brewed before, get a good basic text; you can't do better than Palmer's How to Brew, and he's generous enough to put the entire text on line for free perusal--although you'll probably want to go ahead and get a hard copy just for convenience. Others will have their own preferences for a basic brewing book. I started out a couple of decades ago with Papazian's book, and it's fine--but I think Palmer's is a tad better.One theme Mosher stresses is how the homebrewer can afford to use the best ingredients for his brew, something a corporate brewer can't. So what if using Maris Otter malt and lots of noble hops might make that batch cost a few cents more? You can afford it, and can make a brew that no big corporation would ever make.If I were just starting out today, I'd probably spring for Palmer's book and this one by Mosher. Between those two you'd be able to brew virtually any style you want to. Plus, after reading Radical Brewing you'd have more esoteric beer knowledge than any sane person needs. But who ever said that homebrewers were sane?"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Funny thing is, I have read How to Brew and Designing Great Beers, written by two of the other \\"raters\\" of Radical Brewing.If your a beginner looking to get into this hobby, BUY HOW TO BREW TODAY! It is amazing.If you are a hardcore masher that has been doing everything \\"right\\" but still aren't winning those medals that you want, BUY DESIGNING GREAT BEERS TODAY!Somewhere in no way inbetween these books is Radical Brewing. An informative text about beers of old as well as beers that have yet to even find a style guideline. I'm a BJCP judge and trust me, they ain't there. He completely shakes the platform that much of the American craft brewing scene has stood on, calling for the judicious use of adjuncts in many instances, including many exotic sugars that I had never even heard of.The book also delves into the history of each style and how they have been produced throughout the years. Early on, he moves through the Belgian abbey ales. Later he tackles the challenges of Belgium with sections on sour browns, Flemish Reds, Lambics, Wit beers, and Saisons (though he doesn't do the best job of explaining proper fermentation of the saisons). He even does a synopsis of the Gose beer of Germany. I've only seen these beers once!Randy is obviously someone who has taken homebrewing as seriously as anyone could, for about as long as anyone could. His book is entertaining and is a wealth of knowledge (even if I don't agree with EVERYTHING he says) for brewers at all levels. It is not a book that the novice should shy away from, yet it is also one that every advanced homebrewer should already own. And the historical quotes and poems on beer are just awesome. I used a good many of them on the beer menu for my wedding reception. HEHE!Cheers!"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Randy Mosher writes engagingly; but frankly,if you've read books by Korzonas, Palmer, and yeah, Papazian- you have the brewing techniques discussed in Radical Brewing. Where Mr. Mosher excels is his descriptions of ingredients, and quantities. I am delighted by the recipes and can't wait 'til the weekend to brew up one or two (black pepper in beer! Yes!). Overall, I'd say this is a great book for any brewer's library; not a &quot;My First Brew Book&quot;, but certainly should be on your shelf with Mosher's other book. And Palmer, and Korzonas...okay, okay, and Papazian."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I'm enjoying this book immensely. This is my second home brewing book (Papazian was the first, about 15 years ago). Like Papazian, \\"Radical Brewing\\" includes plenty of lore in addition to hard core brewing info. And like Papazian this book has lots of humor in it. But Mosher's book is much more current, in terms of both information and viewpoint. And the humor is sardonic where Papazian's humor tends to be more goofy and quaint.If anything \\"Radical Brewing\\" is slightly less practical than \\"The Joy of Homebrewing.\\" It seems like Mosher focuses on giving the reader inspiration rather than step-by-step instructions, which is very wise considering how individualized each batch of homebrew is. Papazian has a certain recipe mentality, where Mosher is instead setting forth ideas and techniques. Good stuff, particularly for the intermediate or advanced brewer. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I was pretty experienced in basic brewing when I bought this so wanted something a bit more advanced. This was not it. He has a good foundation of beer types, brewing, and beer ingredients and some great recipes too, but very little information that I found useful. I maybe picked up two small ideas from this book.BUY THIS BOOK: If you are interested in the history of beer and beer like beverages. A large part of the book is related to discussing and brewing historical beer like beverages with lots of related recipes.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK: If you don't fall into the above category and have a good understanding of basic brewing. Unfortunately I fall into this category."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I agree with Michael Jackson's assessment that Randy Mosher is a homebrewing genius. I've known Randy for 15 years and learned more from him than any other brewer I know. Now he has put a big chunk of that knowledge into a book that wanders through the history of beer challenging our assumptions about what beer is and how we should go about brewing it. What a fun book! How it makes me want to run into the brewery and start creating new beers. What a genius!"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Radical Brewing is definitely the most enjoyable and inspiring brewing book that I've read. The author presents a nicely balanced mix of history, humor, obscure facts, essential information and awesome recipes. Plenty of parts of this book are enjoyable to read just for their content even if you aren't a brewer.For me it is the authors personal writing style that makes the book great. I would reccomend it to all brewers, whether you've been doing it for 50 years or you've never brewed a drop, this book will inspire you to get off your butt and try something interesting, and to learn more than just the basics of the step-by-step process of brewing.The books attractive visual layout as well as its great content would also make it a reccomendable gift for anyone interested in brewing."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Just the right amount of info for the brewer who already knows the basics, without getting too technical. Great book with no-nonsense techniques and advice that made me laugh aloud more than once."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This book is not for someone who's never brewed but if you've done it a few times, this book will get you hooked. The methods, ingredients, and everything else about this makes you want to try brewing in ways you probably wouldn't imagine otherwise.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a little adventure in their brewing.Update (8/6/2012): So, I've been brewing for many years now and this book has been almost completely worn out. I stand by the statement this is not a \\"how to brew\\" book. It does have a section for that, but it's limited and not particularly thorough (I do recommend Papazian's Complete Joy of HomeBrewing for that). I use this book for interesting ingredients, archaic techniques, and little known beer styles. If you get this book, you will use it all the time. It has an exhaustive list of most grains, hops, adjucts, herbs, etc... that you might ever want to use with at least a few short blurbs about it. If you ever get in a brewing funk, just open this book to a random page and you'll have a new idea in no time."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I have been a homebrewer for over 20 years. Definitely not an adventurous type, sticking to the mainstream brews. After reading this book, I'm going to get a little more radical. Mosher's writing style is fun and engaging. I found myself just wanting to read \\"one more chapter\\" at 2am. He doesn't pretend to give you a step by step cookbook of how to brew--that's been done. He just spins tale after tale, talking history here, techniques there, and beer styles everywhere.My one concern before buying this book was whether it would be dated. Not really. It's still very pertinent, and definitely has a permanent place on my brewshelf. If you're a newbie, go get Palmer or Papazian if you want to learn how to brew. Recommended."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I bought this book and designing great beers at the same time, they are at opposite ends of the spectrum. If you want to sit down and methodically brew till you get a perfect recipe that fits inside style guidelines that will make all the brew judges swoon, then by all means, get designing great beers. But if you want to learn the interesting nature of different beers and ingredient in a fun, informatively, and creatively constructive way then you need this book. I sat down on Saturday to read this book, and I was to the back cover by Sunday.... And I'm one step above illiterate! Bottom line, even if you do want to brew to style, this book will make you a better brewer. Nuff said."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This has been one of the most entertaining books I've read in a while. It covers a lot of brewing history, knowledge and recipes to back it up. It isn't a step by step style book like How to Brew by Palmer but it would be an interesting read regardless of how long you have brewed etc. It is definitely inspiring and has made me more enthusiastic to try some more radical brewing styles. The recreation of old styles makes for an interesting read.This has to be my favourite brewing book."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Don't let the humor fool you; this is a serious brewing text chock full of vital information.If you've ever deigned to brew outside of traditional styles, this book is for you.Yes, experimentation is fun. I love doing it. But what Mosher gives you is many years of experimentation distilled into a useful text so you can avoid some of the pain and frustration of making undrinkable (but creative!) beer."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Five Stars. This book is very informational and fun to read. But first you must know that this is not so much a \\"how to brew\\" book, it is intended to educate and entertain more experienced brewers.I loved the court documents on determining whether or not lager beer is intoxicating."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"The tiny crinkle sound that comes from the book's perfect binding reminds me of the washing shores of the sweet smell of an ocean front. The pages are thick and smattered with brown, black, and gray monochrome printing. It's a dense boxy thing with a glossy cover. As for the writing - it's straight forward, a bit out of date, but will stir passionate creativity and push your brewing in directions that may well scare your friends and family. This is what this here book is all about though, you want to learn things, push your wort. This isn't a starter book, but it is one to get you back hunkered over the flame again."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This is one of my favorite books on beer and brewing. I've read it several times and enjoy it each time. There's a lot of great brewing advice inside for beginner and intermediate brewers and very well written. Mosher breaks down some complex brewing topics into layman's terms and does it in a way that is highly readable and fun. All around great book!"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I bought this book as a gift. It was just the ticket. Informative abouat the basics, but enought to wet your appetitie to try out new beer recipes. Great book."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Very good this book, it contains all kinds of information about the manufacture of beer; besides history and recommendations that can serve me in my manufacture..I it recommend 100 %AttentivlyIvan lopez"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This is the second book recommended to us from a brewer in McCall Idaho.
