I encourage you to read this book, it will inspire you as it did to me!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"\\"It came out of the blue,\\" was the quote Bethany Hamilton used for her book Soul Surfer written by Bethany herself.Bethany is a young 14 year-old who was a victim of a shark attack and got her arm bitten off. In the water though, her belief in Him kept her calm and only put the thought of \\"get to the beach\\". It hard not to not admire how calm she was in hospital knowing her arm was gone and the first thing she asked after her arm surgery, the first thing she asked was \\"when can I surf again?\\"Bethany's style is very interesting the way she uses section breaks in every chapter. On minute she'll be talking about her passion for surfing the next minute she's talking about her father's which keeps everything interesting. She also describes Hawaii so beautifully that you would want to pack your bags and move there! Not only does Bethany describe Hawaii but also her parents. She talks about their past and how they met each other and how they supported Bethany during the tuff times. The main reason Bethany wrote a book though and did an interview with Opera was to share her faith in God and how he lead he thorough all the chaos.I think Bethany also tried to put a lesson in her book and that was to never to lose hope and stop doing what you love. You can tell Bethany had hope for when she got out of the hospital is went back to focusing on surfing (except for all those interviews she had to do). After a while Bethany was able to surf as well as she could with two arms.This book is good for ages 9 and up for gore like themes."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Bethany Hamilton, a regular teen, writes her true story about setting out for a normal day of surfing. However, that normal day turned out to be an unforgettable one. The book, Soul Surfer, will capture your focus as soon as your tingling fingertips flip the first page. As Bethany was lying on her board waiting for a strong wave to come, she turned her head to talk to her friend when all of a sudden BAM her arm was being torn off by a humongous shark. When I read this frantic part of the book, I didn't believe it. I actually had to look over it again. Without notice, the thought of a shark tearing off her arm invaded my mind. Amazingly, she didn't even panic. She quickly told her friend to scurry to the beach and get her to the hospital. Bethany describes this extremely well because she reveals all her thoughts. \\"Please, God, help me. God let me get to the beach.\\"The incredible story is enormously well written because it feels as if you are experiencing the fierce attack. Bethany not only survived this horrifying tragic, but also she left the hospital with only one arm. Before the attack, she was hoping to become a professional surfer and is still pursuing that dream. Why? \\"I try to explain the way I feel about surfing and it's impossible. Only surfers get it...\\" is what she has to say.I found that when the book ended, my thoughts were all mixed up. \\"How could this have happened?\\" were the words slipping from my mouth. I couldn't believe that she had to go through all that suffering. After you read this book, all of the events wash through your brain making your problems seem nothing compared to hers. I know that I could never walk in her shoes."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This is a great read to learn about a girl's amazing strength and humbleness. It also reinforces the understood need for a strong support group. Bethany's support group includes God, Jesus, Mom, Dad, brothers, friends, dog, etc.I did, however, read some words and wording that were probably more from the editor than from Bethany. The problem with that is it raises the question, \\"How much of the book was written by the editor?\\" The greater that number, the less inspiring the book might seem."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"The book the soul surfer is an auto biography about Bethany Hamilton's story.

She is also part of the video groms surf. Her main sponsor is rip curl. Her rip curl watchIs what caused her shark attack because of the glare.I give this book five stars because it is very descriptive and has a very good sequence."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"They say Bethany Hamilton has saltwater in her veins. How else could one explain the passion that drives her to surf? Bethany was a young girl from the town of Kauai, Hawaii. Her passion for surfing was out of this world. She goes on a rigorous journey of recovery after a shark attacked her while she was surfing with her friends. She lost her left arm and had to live her life from a new perspective. Many thought her surfing career was over. Although she was discouraged at first, her heart for this hobby was enough to prevail through the hard times. With the help of her family and friends, she learns to surf again. It took a while but she was ready to compete again. The biggest surf competition in Kauai was here and she was determined to win. No one had faith in her besides her family, and most importantly, her self. She came out, as the champion and her story of how she prevails over a time of hardship become a legend. The author's main thesis in this story is that you should never give up on your dreams no matter what happens. As long as you have the passion, hope, and strength, you can arise through any situation.Bethany's reason for writing this book was to share her story and inspire people to never give up on their dreams. Since Beth was just a small child she has been surfing. It's in her blood, and nothing could tear her apart. She wanted to influence people to never give up. No matter how hard something may be, if its what you want, its worth fighting for.The reason she was able to prevail through her troublesome time was because of how hard she worked to get back into surfing. She tried so hard to keep her dreams alive. Her mom once said to her, \\" you're a Hamilton and we don't give up on our dreams\\" (Hamilton, 106). This was when Beth got discouraged about not being able to do anything. Her mom told her not to give up, and she was one of the main peoples who influenced her to get back on the surfboard. Bethany stated, \\" This is my time to shine. I'm gunna come out on top, no matter what\\" (Hamilton, 189). This was just seconds before she was about to compete in the big Kauai competition. She was telling her self she was going to win because of all the people who were putting her down. The main reason she was able to push through was because of her desire to get what she wants.The author uses good evidence to provide the reader with insight on why she didn't give up. The counter-evidence is that she actually gave up on surfing at first. She got so discouraged that she couldn't accomplish anything with one arm that she wanted to give up on surfing all together. She said,\\" I can't do anything. Everything's harder. School, housework, church, and especially surfing\\" (Hamilton, 64). This is when she was explaining to her church leader how nothing is going right for her. But with her friends and family as her support system, she had the will power to accomplish her dreams.I believe the argument that you should never give up on your dreams is convincing because of all the evidence Beth provides. Beth once stated, \\" I didn't give up, and look how far I've come. If I can do it, then you can too\\" (Hamilton, 205). This was when Beth was talking to a little girl at one of her book signings. The little girl told her how much Beth has influenced her and it really made Beth happy. The argument is Convincing because of the way Beth influenced people to never give up on their dreams.I once read an article in Surfer days Magazine about how a surfer got attacked by a shark when surfing. It explained how after his accident he was afraid to get back on the surfboard. He stopped surfing for the rest of his life even though it was his passion. Beth, on the other hand, didn't give up she was discouraged at first but she pushed through it. These two stories are different because Bethany didn't give up on what she wanted, while the other surfer did. Bethany had the power to push through the hard time.I personally found this book to be very good. It had an inspiring message that influenced me to not give up. Times can get hard, but no matter what, if its what you want, you shouldn't give up. I think any teenager would like this book, or maybe young adults. It relates to teenagers while it also inspires them in everyday life situations. I rate this book a 9 out of 10."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This book changed my life becaue I have Crohn's Disease and Bethany Hamilton tells people that even through the hardest times, God is with us.

The book Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board, by Bethany Hamilton, is an autobiography about a girl who faced that dilemma. This truly inspirational story will have you wondering just what you would do if this happened to you.This book details the journey of a girl named Bethany Hamilton. Bethany is a young surfer training hard to become a professional surfer. The Hamilton family are Christians and Bethany and her two older brothers are home schooled. One sunny day Bethany was surfing with her best friend, Alana. A nine foot shark was attracted to Bethany's shiny watch, and bit off her left arm.Following Bethany as she persevered through a tragedy with determination, challenged me as a person to rely more on God. Her faith is so inspiring. I loved this story and highly recommend it anyone who enjoys inspirational stories.

Harding in His Times","review":"I read this book over 30 years ago and was fascinated with it. It gave a detailed look at one of our most obscure presidents. I've been interested in him ever since. Perhaps the only flaw of the book was the forced omissions of the letters between Mr.Harding and his mistress in Marion, Ohio. This tragic presidency was brought to life with the fascinating writing of Mr. Russell."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"I discovered this book in high school. Required to research a President &quot;off the beaten track,&quot; I chose Harding. Even more so than Richard Nixon, Harding's reputation has been tarnished since his death, and historians have seldom gone back to re-examine the man's life. Francis Russell's book, currently out-of-print, remains a fascinating study of a man who made no bones about being from an obscure hometown, a man who, although a successful newspaper editor, often misused the English language, and (last but not least) someone who had advanced in the rough and tumble world of Ohio politics not through being a shrewd policy-maker or a great statesman, but rather a good-looking public speaker and partygoing back-slapper. He had other faults as well, namely his roving eye regarding the fairer sex. One of the most interesting sections of the book concerns his decade-long affair with a married woman. They wrote many love letters back and forth, but excerpts from these letters were suppressed; dashes (---) appear in Russell's book instead of the expected prose. Perhaps someday these letters will be published, and with them an unexpurgated version of this otherwise wholly satisfactory Presidential biography."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"Harding often makes the list of the worst presidents in US history and this book explores the reasons behind this judgement. Never a statesman, deeply flawed and ultimately tragic, shows what happens when a person whose only qualifications for the job was that he was good natured back slapper above controversy is elected to the presidency. He was from an important state which helped as well, but these should never be considered as qualifcations for the highest office in the land.Harding was scandal prone from his early days. There was a rather nasty rumor that, given the circumstances of the time significant. This was that his family was part African American. In some ways this was the transformation of the old Democratic civil war \\"bloody shirt\\" strategy that dated back to Reconstruction. The Republicans were accused even after they had abandoned Civil Rights (in 1876) of somehow attempting to promote African American interests at the expense of white Americans. This issue continued to pop up throughout Harding's career.Then there are the women. Harding was married to a woman who appears to have been a bit of a shrew. He sought comfort elsewhere and from a variety of sources. His primary mistress was a political liabilty for more than obvious reasons. Carrie Phillips was pro-German and after the end of their affair was a thorn in Harding's flesh. Unfortunately, the letters between the two are surpressed in this book due to the legal efforts of Harding's nephew, George T. Harding. Given Harding's reputation, it is unclear what he was trying to protect by doing so. I suppose, given Harding's questionable fluency in English, the letters might make for a further negative reassessment. After all when one is the second worst president, one has to fight tooth and nail anything that would put one below James Buchanan even a collection of letters which may express certain needs in a less than eloquent manner.There is also Nan Britton, who was kind of the Monica Lewinsky of her day. Fortunately for Harding, this story of their affair and daughter did not come to public notice until after he died.Sex scandals were only part of Harding's presidency. The people he selected for high office were the worst kind of cronies, who saw public service as the means to make a raid on the treasury and public property. The worst of these was the Teapot Dome scandal in which national oil reserves were sold to private companies below what would be considered fair market price (in exchange for bribes). This was not Harding's finest hour, but again luckily he was dead when most of these revelations became public. By then stories of bootlegged liquor in the White House, Little Houses on K Street and stock market tips (which proved to be bad ones) had destroyed Harding's reputation forever. This is why Harding is remembered as one of our worst presidents. Long term relationships with near treasonous mistresses and out-of-wedlock children are really just local colour.Harding's presidency was not quite the disaster it might have been, due to the lack of any great national crisis during his presidency. It is fortunate that this mediocre figure was not in power during a war or economic recession. His role could only have been negative as Russell frequently demonstrates. Theodore Roosevelt privately felt that he had had it too easy during his presidency and that had he lived through more trying times as Lincoln did he might have achieved even greater things. Harding is the inverse, had he been really tested, he might have destroyed the republic in the most amiable of fashions.Though the subject of Russell's book is not an important figute, it does serve as a cautionary tale of what can go wrong in the selection of presidents. In 1920, the Republicans would have been better served by nominating Leonard Wood (an associate of Theodore Roosevelt). Russell is a fan of Wood's who is far a more compelling figure. If anything this proves that the reputation of Harding is beyond all hope."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"Forty two men have occupied the oval office as of this writing, and in my opinion, the Harding administration may be the most interesting of all. There is seduction, intrigue, deceit, and dark corruption.Warren Harding was our last true \\"dark horse\\" candidate. Propped to the forefront by the \\"Ohio Gang\\" of Harry Daugherty, Jesse Smith and others, Harding was a friendly, likable and naive one term senator, with a stentorian voice, and the good looks of a Roman praetorian.His story serves as a cautionary tale, and watching the Obama campaign, serves notice that the campaign process, which Harding skipped, toughens up a candidate for the difficulty of the job ahead.Harding was a very popular president to the day he died (in office), but his decline in the estimation of the American public, and in the historians view, was precipitous.Within weeks of his death, stories of corruption emanating from his cabinet hit the newspaper. Harding was not around to defend himself, or to mitigate the damages.Francis Russell wrote this biography in 1968, and it must be called the definitive biography of the 29th president. Russell thoroughly researched and intimately came to know and understand his subject. He sees Harding as a simple man, who rose to a position that was over his limited abilities.There has been little written of Harding, who until recently has been dismissed by most historians as one of our worst presidents. He was a reluctant leader, and surrounded himself with some poor cabinet members. He also had some first rate minds in his midst, including Herbert Hoover, who was considered a wunderkind before his ill-fated presidency, and Andrew Mellon.John Dean wrote a revisionist biography of Harding, and made a compelling case for re-evaluation. However, Dean's words are forever tainted as many remember his involvement with another ill-fated administration.This is a thoughtful, comprehensive and informative biography for any history buff who wants to learn the significance of the Harding character, and the legacy of his presidency."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"Over the last several years I have read around 30 presidential biographies, usually using Amazon readers as my guide to find the best available book. This is certainly my favorite biography of a failed presidency. Many presidents are \\"in over their heads\\" once they become president. Harding was over his head as a senator , if not before. He was a fairly successful small town newspaper publisher and a gregarious glad-hander. Shadow of Blooming Grove lays out all of the sordid details in a highly readable way, connecting the reader to the times. Covered are the rumors of Harding being a mulatto, his marriage to a difficult woman, Ohio politics (which managed to produce about every other president for 60 years), the smoke filled room convention, the cronyism and party life in Washington D.C. , the almost complete involvement of Harding's cabinet in one shady deal after another, and Harding's affairs and his illegitimate child. Amazingly, Harding remained popular with the people as so little of the scandals made it into the press while he is alive.Reading reviews of other Harding books on Amazon and finding that John Dean tries to rehabilitate Harding's reputation is laughable. Personally, Harding is a disaster. As a president he was incompetent, and his administration was rife with corruption.My edition of Shadow of Blooming Grove has a few quotes and half-pages from Harding's love letters to a mistress censored out due to threats of a lawsuit. Even 40 years after his death, his family tried to hang onto to some decency. The censorship just adds to the fun.I highly recommend Shadow of Blooming Grove, a top ten presidential biography."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"The worst of our presidents? That's the usual judgment, but it's hard to say because nothing of real consequence occurred during Harding's two years in office that would have tested his mettle: calling the Washington Conference in 1921 to limit naval armaments, perhaps his biggest (positive) accomplishment, doesn't exactly go down in history as memorable. His reputation, though, much of it hidden from the public until long after his death, is horrendous. He would rather play poker than do anything else, and he revelled in his own pomposity. He fathered a child out of wedlock as a Senator and had other affairs as well. His presidency was one of the most corrupt in history: many of his cabinet cronies were involved in one scandal after another, the biggest being the Teapot Dome affair, which was all about selling off the government's oil reserve to the highest bidders behind everyone's back. Not much to admire, and Russell pulls no punches in expressing his disdain for his subject. The book is solidly written, though it is overly long, especially where Russell goes into Harding's death (food poisoning?) in California. One of the better Presidential biographies out there, however. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G.

Harding in His Times","review":"I did not plan to read an entire 650 page book on Harding, but Russell writes so well that I could not stop. It is chock full of very specific insights and details.My favorite part was the nomination process at the deadlocked convention. The bosses decided on Harding, then a senator, as a compromise canidate to break the deadlock and get everyone out of the 95 degree Chicago summer heat. But first, they came to Harding and asked a very modern-sounding question: \\"Is there anything in your background that might embarass the Republican Party?\\" Harding was stunned by the question and asked for some time to think about it. At that time, Harding was having 2 affairs. One was 30 years younger than him and just had his baby which she brought to the Chicago convention to meet her dad. The other, the wife of a friend, was being investigated for spying due to her support for Germany in WWI. And, of course, there were persistent rumors that Harding had Black ancestors. After contemplating his catalog of potential embarassments for 10 minutes, Harding returned and confirmed that his past was clean.His campaign ended up sending his married girlfriend (and her husband) on an all-expenses-paid trip to Japan after the reporters saw Harding's wife throw a waste basket at her. And a secret service agent was assigned to the full-time duty of delivering envelopes of cash to the younger one.Harding was not power hungry and really did not want to be President. He was quite happy with his Senate position, his girl friends, and his drinking buddies. But, the policies that he put in place helped create the Roaring Twenties, even though Calvin Coolidge gets more of the credit. I did not know much about Harding but now I see him fondly as a human who found himself in a position that he never really sought."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G.

Harding in His Times","review":"With few exceptions, Warren G Harding is always referred to as America's \\"worst president\\" and this book goes to great depths to find out just exactly why.It's no secret now that Warren G. Harding was the William Jefferson Clinton of his day when it came to an eye for the opposite sex. The difference between the two in this regard (which in no way compares their presidencies) is that in Harding's day, no one talked about it, and if they did, absolutely no one wrote about it.Harding was one of the most notorious (and last) of America's \\"selected\\" Presidents, where party bosses met in \\"smokey back rooms\\" and arrived at reasonable compromises. In fact, the author is sympathetic to the reasoning that Harding never had any aspirations on being President and probably could have cared less if he had lost. (It's hard to say he showed any passion in campaigning for the job)Harding was faced with many obstacles besides an inability to keep his zipper up. He doesn't seem to have made the wisest choice in his choosing of a mate, in fact, according to the author, she appears to be the one who had true aspirations for the presidency.Harding was dogged throughout the campaign by rumors that he was of African-American descent, something that his relatives still seem intent on fighting to this day. What does appear to be true is the fact that the family were devout abolitionists and served on the Underground Railroad.Harding's most prominent flaw seems to be his affability, something that many had assumed at the time to be his dominant strength. His inability to call his friends to task, allowed them to run free with the power of the Federal government.His death will be controversial for years to come, and the author does little to truly answer the question of murder vs. food poisioning, but his presidency remains notorious.

Plants are organized by color of flower blossoms which makes it easier for the everyday hiker who is not familiar with botanical taxonomy. The book includes commons species of cacti, desert trees, shrubs, annuals, and perennials. I particularly enjoy the inclusion of details about medicinal and/or edible uses of the plants by native Americans of the area. My appreciation of our desert plants is greatly enhanced when I understand how the plants have been used -- and can still be used today. I am a 30-year veteran educator, and use information from this book regulary when on nature hikes with students of all ages. The book has only 4 pages of color photos of plants. I would rate the book as 5-star if it had more color-photo pages. Other desert plant I.D. books have more color pages, but are also much more expensive."},{"Title":"Flowers of the Southwest Deserts","review":"I received a 1969 issue (used, as described). It is a national parks publication and is thorough. The illustrations are carefully inked drawings which are informative, but perhaps not quite as nice as photos would be. I would rate it as a valuable reference document worth keeping if you are into this type of botany."},{"Title":"Flowers of the Southwest Deserts","review":"I remember the first edition of this booklet by Natt N. Dodge, which must have come out in the 1950s when I was growing up in Yuma County, Arizona. \\"Flowers of the Southwest Deserts\\" was, I believe, the first in a series that later included \\"Flowers of the Southwest Mesas,\\" \\"Flowers of the Southwest Mountains\\", and similar booklets on the shrubs and trees and mammals. About the year I acquired my first copy, which was dogeared before long, we had a rare heavy winter rain that resulted in the sandy desert near Yuma being covered with a carpet of white evening primrose (not covered in this guide, except by the new addition of a color photo on p. 55!), sand verbena and ajo lilies (both represented). Thus I found the names of two of the most enchanting (if rarely seen) flowering plants of the Sonoran Desert. Despite the limitations of the book, which was published by the Southwest Parks and Monuments Association, it was a great introduction to a flora not easily found in the guidebooks then available. I thus still have a fondness for this little guide, which was first published with no color photos at all. The line drawings were (and still are) very clear.I have a few minor gripes about the most recent edition, mostly having to do with coverage (I think that if they are going to include a photo of the white evening primrose, they should also add a description!), but on the whole this is an excellent and cheap beginning text on the flowering plants of the desert for someone just encountering them for the first time. Many of the most showy species will be identifiable and if the reader's interest is sharpened, there are now many newer books on the subject that will help."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"Many of the reviewers made a point which I will endorse. The author is not a polished author of many years experience so his product is rough. The imaginative bits however are great. Who could imagine using trained dogs to attack infantry and artillery regiments in WWI? He is weak in some areas and strong in others. At least it requires more imagination and creativity than a bard, halfling, thief etc off to save the world or princess by acquiring a magical object. Well done! A good first effort."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"Does any of this sound familiar? Britain, the world's only superpower invades the Boer Republics in South Africa, not because they pose a threat to the global hegemon, but rather under the banner of democratic reform. Most of the world's other great powers castigate Britain and claim that she is only interested in South Africa's mineral wealth. Only a few trusted allies stick by her side. Britain wins a conventional war only to be caught flat-footed by an unexpected and bloody guerilla war that lasts for years. This is what happened in the pages of history. In Night Dog the Boer War is very different. I won't give away plot lines, but suffice it to say that the differences are relevant to America's current quagmire in Iraq. Night Dog is a real page turner. I see in some of the other reviews that a couple militant atheists are offended by references to God. Out of 490 pages there are about two that are overtly religious. If this sort of thing offends you, simply skim through these two pages. The book is worth it."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"This was a sleeper as I only picked up the book because of my love of history, love of England, and love of alternate history in fiction. I was also ignorant of the influence of war dogs in English history and equally so of the Boer Wars. This meant having to check facts on the net to be sure Dave Putnam wasn't putting me on. He was a bit, but it is still one of the best alternate histories I have read to date and I have been reading them for 55 years and using them in my classrooms as a teacher. I particularly like the spiritual aspects, the references to the Christian religion in a positive way, something too many authors of science fiction seem to avoid. The novel is informative and interesting and the characters, both real and fictional, are well done. Great characterizations of Victoria, Cecil Rhodes, Winston Churchill as a very young man, Sir Arthur Canon Doyle, and many others. If the next two are as good I will never be content with Harry Turtledove again, not that he hasn't already slipped in my estimation. Thank you Mr. Putnam for your vision and your ability to share it with your readers."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"Well it wasn't my favorite book, but I did enjoy it. Some reviewers stated that it wasn't well written and that it wasn't alternate history. I have read poorly published books before and this was not one of them. The dialogue was good, and did not stumble (I felt), granted it wasn't a pullizer, but it wasn't trash either. And yes it was Alt. History I don't know how it could have been anything but. Course the develpment of WWI technology in last decade of the 19th cent. Machine guns, yeah, but airplanes, in 1894, that are 10 years more advanced than what the Wright Bro. flew in 1902, eventhough they had divine intervention. So military tech. progressed a little too quickly in this book. The most interesting aspect of this novel was the war dogs. Granted they'd have had more of a place in the Boer War than WWI, as an offensive force, but still Putnam makes them out to be a force to reckoned with."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"After reading this book two words jump to mind: realistic and barbaric. I'm afraid that some of the negative reviewers aren't ready to be immersed into the warlike Britain of the Victorian era. Bull baits are described in graphic detail and extolled, offending modern animal rights advocates. Ruthless real politik foriegn policy is jammed down the world's collective throat, upsetting the tender sensibilities of today's multilateralist liberals. I really enjoyed the Gamekeeper because I let it take me back to another place and time. You'll like it too, if you're not squeamish and ready to take the journey."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"If you are an &quot;alternate history&quot; afficianado, don't miss this excellent new book. It is creative, but also very readable and credible. Marvelous use is made throughout of several canine species, but you don't need to be a dog enthusiast to enjoy it.&quot;Night Dog&quot; is based on quite plausible shifts in the geopolitical, technological, and economic developments which characterized the seminal period between the late Victorian 1800s in England, the Boer War, and the outbreak of World War I. This was an era that in turn cast long shadows over the rest of the 20th Century. This novel features splendid adaptations of well-known historical figures and groups - including an aging Queen Victoria and a youthful Winston Churchill; industrial pioneers such as Hiram Maxim, Henry Ford, and Germany's Herr Daimler (founder of Mercedes/Benz); plus the famous Zulu nation of Africa - which is cast in a truly unique role.Comparatively, Putnam's writing style attractively combines Harry Turtledove's depth and Harry Harrison's pace, with an intriguing bit of religious mysticism blended in.This is the first book in a trilogy. I'm looking forward eagerly to reading the ensuing volumes."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"I just finished reading my copy. I feel this is a very well written novel. It was entertaining, while still sticking closely to historical events of the time.

Mr. Putnam, keep up the good work.Greg SouzaPS I hope there will be a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog is a combination of a Jack London novel with an alternate history/military narrative a la Harry Turtledove. Dave Putnam takes us to the last decade of the 19th century and inside a Britain preparing to fight a war in South Africa. Through cajolery and sheer determination, engaging characters like the cantankerous Fred Greystone provide the British Army with packs of fearsome war dogs before the fighting begins. Anyone that has chaffed under the restrictions of a stifling bureaucracy will cheer Greystone's mission of returning his native land to the freedom and earthiness of an earlier time. Battle sequences with highly trained bulldogs are well crafted, realistic, and chilling; yet the reader is transported into an alternate time and place, an alternate history that could have been: if only. Whether you are a history buff and are familiar with the outcome of the Boer War, or a dog lover that enjoys an action packed military novel, this story line will prove engaging and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"Working dog lovers-enthusiasts and historical buffs will love this book. If you enjoy the History channel (especially the shows on WWI & WWII) you will love this book! Dave does a great job of blending historical facts with great fiction to produce a book that keeps you guessing to what is going to happen next. Somehow you become entranced in the rewriting of history and Dave's descriptive ability makes you think you are living this story. Can't wait to get my hands on the next book!"},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"This book may very well contain the finest last 300 pages in the history of writing, but unless you have a tremendous ability to set aside the absurd you may never see them. While the premise of a military using specially trained dogs in conjunction with infantry troopers is fascinating, the ham-handed dialog, horrible non-sequitors and amateurish prose make getting to the meat of the story very difficult indeed.Early on, you are introduced to Banner, the titular Gamekeeper who through turns of fate set in motion by Satan (yup...Satan) ends up rescuing the last, full blooded bulldog in all of England-Lockjaw. Early on, Banner realizes that Lockjaw is something special...not only is he a brute that has to have his taste of 'man blood', but he understands spoken English (beyond sit,stay,heel,etc) and has reasoning skills beyond most middle managers. To backup his views of Lockjaws special nature, Banner is visited by god in a dream...not necessarily the god you're used to mind, but the black hole at the center of the galaxy who has special 'feelings' for mankind and is really the god that every religion has every followed. This 'god' tells Banner that the bulldog is special and that Satan has been trying to destroy all bulldogs so that god's gift to man is lost. He also tells Banner that the bulldog is critical to changing history or Britain will be forced to fight war after war in the coming century--starting with the Boer war in South Africa. Banner is fed a stream of vignettes of various battles and events that follow the history we're familiar with--although at some point, Britain's future history and that of the US begins to jumble together into a hodgepodge. Banner and his new wife and her grandfather (Lockjaws breeder) begin their god given task of saving the bulldogs and Britain.If anything positive can be said of this book, it is that the author shares his love of the bulldog breed with his readers. The author obviously has a great affinity for the breed that shows throughout the book.Gamekeeper's Night Dog is published by Bulldog Press and I'm sad to say that the quality of the book and it's writing are probably at a second tier publisher because none of the larger publishers would want it. Your book buying money will be better spent reading almost any Turtledove, S.M Stirling or any of the other first rate alternate history authors who don't have to stoop to a blackhole being god and similar literary shortcuts for their history changing impetus."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"As a fan of Alt History, I am used to the bizarre, but this book was too much.

Later I became a history buff and loved Michener-type historical novels. Mr. Putnam to my great delight has managed to combine my two favorite subjects in a sweeping novel that interrelates the former might and soul of Britain with the decline of Britain's symbol of courage, the Bulldog, in an elegant and thoughtful way. There is more than enough information to suit history lovers, and the dogs are formidable and awe inspiring. What an enjoyable book!!"},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"Amazon recommended this book to me and having read the description of the content and the praise in some of the comments about it this seemed justified. Even if I had some doubts its basic idea, namely that the Boer War was an event that defined the beginning of the decline of the British Empire, is one I share. Being also a fan of alt history I ordered the book and started to read. I got as far as page 132 before I decided to quit.Since I neither own a bulldog nor ever aspire to do so I guess I was disqualified from enjoying it. Because this book is NOT alt history but should rather be qualified as fantasy. God makes an appearance and tells us that a) the Jews are His chosen people and b) that bulldogs are his chosen dogs.Sometimes amazon lures you into buying trash."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"In fairness, the book has a truly wonderful premise, and as an avowed fan of 'alternative history' i was drawn to it immediately. The basic idea behind the trilogy of which this is the initial offering, is that some of the advancements in military technology which were instituted in the early 20th Century, are instead discovered and implemented - primarily by Great Britain - during the latter half of the 1800's, which leads to a wholly unique 'new world order'. Coupled with this, the 'British Bulldog' is bred for absolute fierceness, courage and tenacity, and used in fighting packs alongside the line soldiers. It all sounds quite brilliant.To be fair, Mr. Putnam does a bang-up job from page one of 'getting inside the heads' of the dogs in question and so makes canine motivations and thought processes seem quite natural and understandable to the reader.Unfortunately, the knack doesn't follow through to his human characters who are at best two-dimensional and at worst totally unbelievable and lacking credence.For example, the main protagonist is initially portrayed - quite adequately - as a gamekeeper in Victorian England. However, same person somehow is inexplicably able to cope with and engage in mystic psychic communications with a black-hole- cum-diety, recieve and comprehend the fantastical visions of future wars bestowed upon him without so much as a hiccough about his sanity; acquire tactical understandings of a vietnam conflict and the use of F4 Phantom jets (remember that even Zeppelin's are a huge leap into the future at the time point in question); to then become in turn, a master geopolitical strategist and military thinker, ersatz diplomat and global adventurer, even accept the roles of munitions developer and fledgeling airframe designer.............frankly, it's beyond any stretch to set all of these attributes onto the one set of shoulders, - never mind the nagging problem of 'class vs. advancement' in as stratified a society as the author describes. If this were the only such 'hero extension' i could try and overcome it, but the same type of treatment is given to many other characters - all without elucidation or justification- in the book, and it just gets old.Also, i'm traditional enough to believe a novel should have a beginning, a middle and an end. Well, this book does too! It has a handful of each strewn in random order between the covers.Perhaps it's a question of expectations,- i really wanted to enjoy 'The Gamekeeper's Night Dog' - and despite every effort totally failed. However -maybe others can, - after all, the Publisher has had sufficient success to print the two companion volumes, so obviously my impressions cannot be definitive. I can think of no other explanation for the trilogy's success than there must be many people who enjoy \\"dogs\\". Therefore i reccomend it if you do too."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"To enjoy this novel, one must be able to suspend disbelief and accept a worldview that is not based upon straight scientific cause and effect. Thus, this novel differs from alternative histories of Turtledove or Stirling (where other than the \\"divergence event\\", reality is postulated to follow all the \\"rules\\" of the universe as we know them). In many ways, this book reminds me of the style of an old Norman Spinrad novel, the \\"Iron Dream\\" in which Spinrad imagines, what if Adolf Hitler had emigrated to America and became a science fiction author in the 30's? The book then takes a point of view that is not entirely rational. Similarly, The Gamekeeper's Night Dog is written from the point of view of someone that is not quite rational. For example, the author explains in great detail why it is better to wipe out thousands of Boers in a battle than to see the Boer nation suffer in concentration camps. What makes this book compelling is the incredible detail about wardogs and Bulldogs and the sense of fanaticism that permeates the novel."},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"It sometimes is hard, both as a SF and an alternAtive history buff, to separate the two. This book, especially as a first novel, is wonderful. I do not claim to know anything about English history of the bulldog (and I will look into this over the next few months), but this book is very convincing. The Boer War as postulated is a hard version of the the basic idea of democracies doing pre-emptive war (Dubya not withstanding). The author truly reflects a level of understanding of &quot;those&quot; conflicts as they existed and interacted in our world. The &quot;history&quot; is believable, the wars fit the technology of the time and/or how it could have been &quot;advanced&quot; - though who knows (other than experts), how the rulers really thought and acted). In reality, and with all consideration, the bases of the novel seem real and possible. (Please ignore the specifics of the characters as portrayed in the book for this comment.) If you like an upper class view of history (with very real workers and peasants portrayed - and are interested in something of Winston Churchill's life options), this is a great upper class (or very yuppie) version of late 19th century history. This novel is worth every penny and it fits in with anything Turtledove, Drake and Sterling (among others) have postulated as alternative history in the last few years (though I can go back to the thirties for &quot;better&quot;). (I will not state any of the novel's specifics herein.) Let us just say - that as postulated - an alternative 1890's - the story line is plausible, substantive and believable. There are not as many as precise and worked through as this one (other than the bulldog premise) - and I so say after 40+ years of reading SF). (You may or may not believe my thoughts, dear readers). Thank you !!!"},{"Title":"The Gamekeeper's Night Dog (Gamekeeper Series, Book 1)","review":"I have been remiss in not getting a review of this book done sooner.

Every other alternate history novel that I've ever read simply takes a path of divergence, with no explanation offered. History takes a different path, but why? It is refreshing to find a science fiction author not afraid to tackle the ghost in the machine.

Never mind that she goes into great detail on the 'what to do' and 'what not to do', I actually found the chapter on dealing with this emotional rollercoaster I've been on to be the most helpful. It helps to have an author point out that yes your child's life will never be the same, and that it's probably harder on you than it is on them. It helps that she's been there, and isn't just some doctor spouting out their take on it. It helps that she went through all these things and is able to say 'You know what, just deal with it and get on with your life - I did it, and so can you'.She writes with a lot of humor, making it a fast, easy read.Besides all this, the information at the back of the book is a treasure -lists of websites, phone numbers, and organizations that are invaluable to any novice celiac parent."},{"Title":"Kids with Celiac Disease : A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children","review":"I STRONGLY recommend that you do not pick up this book unless you are already certain that you or a blood relative has been diagnosed BY A DOCTOR as having celiac disease.There are a lot of good tips and information in this book for families who have celiac.

Well, I'm an actual patient, and a teen at that. This book was given to me when I was diagnosed a few years ago, and it hasn't steered me wrong yet. I take it with when going places overnight, if I need to double check things, and I have most of the lists in it memorized, I've read them over so much. It really was a life saver, because I had no idea what I was doing before I got this. And, since I'm not attached to a parent at the hip anymore, the diet ultimately falls into my hands alone. So, if you have a kid with Celiac, I highly recommend this book. It covers all the basics, like what to watch out for, what's okay, and it has suggestions for replacements for the bad stuff. It also has a few very good tips that make sure the one(s) with celiac don't feel like freaks. Having been there, I must say that that is a very good thing. A \\"Special Diet\\" tends to do some serious damage to a childs' self esteem in the grade school years(High school years are a bit mean, too).All in all, I say that if you or a loved one is newly diagnosed, you should really do your best to get your hands on a copy of this book.

This book not only addresses many of the medical questions you may have about celiac disease, but also the social, emotional, and day-to-day problems and concerns that are now factors in the lives of those with celiac disease. It will answer questions you may have now, and questions you don't even know you've got yet. The writer has a child with celiac disease, so she knows what daily challenges there are. She's been in the trenches. The book is so user friendly too. It's a great resource guide. I spent a lot of time jumping around looking up answers and gathering ideas before I even sat down and read it straight through. I can't urge anyone enough . . . buy this book. It is worth it's weight in gold."},{"Title":"Kids with Celiac Disease : A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children","review":"I recently bought this book because of a recent diagnosis.

Bravo Danna Korn"},{"Title":"Kids with Celiac Disease : A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children","review":"Like most parents, we were pretty shell-shocked by my 5 yr old son's diagnosis. I spent hours on the Internet researching Celiac Disease. Problem was, most of the information was geared towards adults. My initial response was less concerned with what he could eat and more concerned with how am I going to make sure he feels \\"normal\\"? What will I pack for lunch at school? How can I send him to school without something happening? How will I deal with the 5 birthday parties he has in the next month? Danna Korn's book answered all of those questions and the other 1000 I forgot to think of. This book is a life saver. My son started Kindergarten 3 days ago and I feel like all is well. I read it cover to cover in one night. As parents of celiac kids, we are not alone. Danna Korn helps you see that."},{"Title":"Kids with Celiac Disease : A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children","review":"Danna Korn's Kids With Celiac Disease: A Family Guide To Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children is an ideal, &quot;parent friendly&quot;, and practical guide for families with children and teens afflicted with celiac disease, a genetic autoimmune condition which causes symptoms of chronic diarrhea, irritable-bowel distress, anemia, and bloating. Such children must have a gluten free diet. Kids With Celiac Disease will also help families cope with post-diagnosis transitions and show how lifestyle changes can lead to happy and healthy lives for such children and their families. Of special value is the guidance concerning menu planning, grocery shopping, food preparation strategies, and whether or not it is necessary for the entire family to have a gluten-free diet. There's even a section on junk food! If you have a child with celiac disease, you need to sit down and read Danna Korn's Kids With Celiac Disease from first page to last.

My son and I have Celiac and he also has a milk allergy. Being that I live in Japan with the US Military, it was that much more difficult. I read this book cover to cover TWICE and still pull it out monthly or so to see if I'm right or just to verify some little fact.I supplied it to my son's daycare director and both she and his primary caregivers and the kitchen staff read it to ensure that they were feeding him properly. Had I not done so, they said they wouldn't have known some of the items he couldn't have and just what condition he had.I also let our developmental pediatrician on base know that this book was available because many of the families on our base that have autistic children follow the diet, and it has helped them immensely.All in all a great buy!!"},{"Title":"Kids with Celiac Disease : A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children","review":"I bought this book to educate myself on celiac disease.

In the meantime, we have eliminated gluten from her diet.I learned so much about the disease from this book and am more prepared in the event that our daughter is diagnosed. I was extremely stressed about about the possibility, but this book has eased my fears.I would recommend this book to anyone with children suffering from celiac disease.

I love his great crime novels: Little Caesar, High Sierra, Asphalt Jungle. When I stumbled upon this title, I thought, oh, this is going to be good. Unfortunately, it's not. It chronicles the game from the perspective of an anonymous, contrarian, supposedly wise ex-ballplayer. But the wisdom here seems very ill-considered, at times downright wrongheaded 40 years down the road. The whole take seems dated and tired. It's just no good -- and a real disappointment coming from Burnett."},{"Title":"The Routledge Companion to Feminism and Postfeminism (Routledge Companions)","review":"The Routledge Companion series is a Godsend to students looking to get a solid overview of a particular field. I've enjoyed the Companion to Postmodernism and recommended to many friends. The RC Feminism and Postfeminism is a great addition to the series. Each area of feminism receives a nice essay detailing its thought and discourse while pointing readers to great primary and secondary sources. Since Amazon is nice enough to provide a table of contents, I won't duplicate that info here, but I urge you to check it out.The historical and cultural essays are not so much thesis oriented as they are descriptive of the concepts and context. The authors don't critique the ideas, but they do present opposing views while explaining both sides. I found most to be extremely impartial.Part II is a great cross-indexed dictionary of terms and names with short summaries, perfect for reminding yourself, say, who theorized on \\"ecriture feminine\\" or what Camille Paglia thinks of prostitution. The dictionary part is something I referred to frequently while getting familiar with feminist thought.Naturally, this is an introduction and you'll eventually want to dig deeper, reading more specific writing. This is not the \\"only book on feminism you'll ever need\\", if indeed such a thing is even possible. It IS a great place to start with great recommendations for further reading. If you're new to feminism, check this out. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death by Envy: The Evil Eye and Envy in the Christian Tradition","review":"Having recently finished a first reading of this work, I find myself somewhat awestruck by the amount of information packed into this relatively small book, which is a most welcome addition to my library. The footnotes and bibliography alone are worth the price. I would dare say that this is one of the most intensely researched works I have read in many years, and much of it sparked many &quot;mind-maps&quot; into correlative research (my highlighter went dry on this one!).

In this excellent book, the battle itself covers only a few pages. The bulk of the book describes the people and societies of the Mediterranean in the mid-16th C., and the historical currents in which they moved. Beeching takes up the tale nearly three decades before Lepanto, with the reign of the Holy Roman emperor Charles V and the birth of the Catholic commander, Don John of Austria, the emperor's bastard son and half-brother of King Philip II of Spain. Don John's life reads like a romance, and the events in the 16th C. have some amusing parallels with current events.Beeching covers the Ottoman politics even more thoroughly than European relations. He doesn't talk much about white founts falling and dim drums throbbing, but otherwise Chesterton's coloring of the actors was if anything not as vivid as real life. And Don John can fairly be called Europe's last knight and last troubadour.BackgroundAlmost to the end, neither Spain nor Venice wanted to join the other in the Holy League, Venice in particular being tempted by clever hints from Constantinople that some accommodation was possible. Only the persistence of Pope Pius V and the undeniable threat from Turkey persuaded the rivals to cooperate. In the preceding years, the Turks had taken Cyprus from Venice and and Tunis from Spain. Major efforts against the Knoghts of St. John on Malta and against the Holy Roman Empire on the frontier in Hungary had been repulsed. Besides the major Turkish campaigns, the Western Mediterranean was under persistent attack by Turkish-backed corsairs, who raided shipping and coast for treasure and slaves. Having moved its fleet--the largest in the world--to the forward base at Lepanto, the Turks were in a position to achieve their goal of taking possession of Italy (just across the Adriatic from Lepanto and largely divided between Spanish holdings and the Papal states) and dominating the Western Mediterranean as they did the East.ParallelsThe degeneration of Islam into sterility was well advanced by the 16th C. Here Beeching describes how Turkey was dependent upon naval technology developed by the Venetians:\\"The Turkish Arsenal of Kasim Pasha, on the Galata shore beyond the Golden Horn, with its \`hundred vaulted arches, each long enough for a galley to be built under cover', was one of the two great manufacturing centres in the known world. The building of war galleys for the Sultan was carried on there principally by renegades who had served their time as shipwrights in Venice or Naples. The methods of construction in daily use at the Arsenal of Kasim Pasha were sedulously copied - just as the Turkish fleet itself had been copied, detail by detail - from Venice. The world's other great industrial centre at that time, where all those methods had been invented and perfected, was the Arsenal at Venice.\\"England, under the Protestant Elizabeth, of course had no part in the Holy League, although her Catholic half-brother (another of Henry's bastards) commanded three ships. France not only refused to join the coalition of the willing (ahem), but tried to sabotage it, for familiar reasons. When the Pope appealed to him in a personal letter,\\"King Charles IX of France sent a cold, brief and negative reply. To offset this, the Knights of Malta - so many of whom were Frenchmen - were in the League heart and soul.Geographically France of all the Mediterranean powers was the least menaced by Turkish aggression, and had seized the opportunity of trading with some of the markets in the Levant temporarily lost to Venice. The Sultan's principal European enemies-Spain and the [Holy Roman] Empire-were the two of France's neighbours which she thought of as standing in the way of her territorial expansion. The Spanish ambassador in Paris sent a warning to King Philip that \`here in France, everyone is doing his best to prevent the League from taking place. I would not be surprised if next year they do not offer Toulon to the Turks.'\\"As the Duke of Alva told King Phillip of Spain, the French \\"would be happy to lose one eye, if we lost two.\\" Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose.After the battle, \\"The response of the nominally Catholic King of France to the great victory was secretly to offer [Turkish Grand Vizier] Sokolli a firm alliance against Spain...\\"In besieged Leyden, Dutch Calvinists there who followed the Prince of Orange wore little brass crescents in their caps. But though excommunicated by the old Pope as a heretic and treated by him as a usurper, Elizabeth of England showed greater political penetration. For her, Lepanto was not so much a victory for Spain or the Pope as a triumph for all Christendom - a guarantee that the values upon which Western Europe had been established would survive. To show exactly what she thought, the Church of England which she had established by law was ordered to hold services of thanksgiving.\\"The French and Dutch also sold supplies to the Sultan for rebuilding his fleet. Venice signed a disadvantageous treaty with Constantinople and agreed to pay tribute in return for being allowed to resume its Eastern trade. In fact, the tribute was far less than the cost of maintaining its fleet on a war footing. Turkey, too, was short of cash. The ships of its rebuilt fleet were too gimcrack to face the Western galleys. And Spain could not afford to send its fleet to sea; it was literally bankrupt."},{"Title":"The Galleys at Lepanto","review":"Lepanto was one of the most important battles in European history. Jack Beeching tells the story of the Battle of Lepanto through the life story of Don Juan as he is popularly known. Be it putting down a rebellion of Muslims, leading the Holy League at sea against the Ottoman fleet, or fighting for his half-brother the King of Spain, Don Juan's life becomes the focus point for life in the 16th century.Beeching writes in a clear style that flows immaculately. His insight at various times is astounding. Unfortunately, I do have one complaint, while there is a good bibliography in the back, Beeching left out source attributions for all of his quotes. I know this is not an important point for most readers, but for those interested reading further on the topic it would be quite helpful."},{"Title":"The Galleys at Lepanto","review":"Cervantes is remembered as the author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the father of the novel. The accomplishment of which he was most proud was his service at the Battle of Lepanto. He felt, as do many historians, that the battle saved Europe from conquest by the Turks. The battle may not have been quite as decisive as all that, but European history would have been quite different had the Spanish lost.This book gives a readable account of this turning point in history, as well as a rousing account of, not only the battle itself, but the Seige of Malta, which served as a prelude to the battle.That Lepanto was the high water mark of Spanish naval accomplishment is all the more remarkable in that it preceded by only a few years the debacle of the Invincible Armada."},{"Title":"The Galleys at Lepanto","review":"Cervantes is remembered as the author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the father of the novel.

It provides a background of the Arab Military machine in the 1500's and a portrayal of the world back then. It is also fast paced and exciting (at least to me) and provided a lot of details about politics as well as the ships. I can't imagine why Hollywood doesn't make a major motion picture out of it: it'd be better than 90% of the films they do produce."},{"Title":"The Galleys at Lepanto","review":"Passable as a novel, worthless from an historical point of view.An example of blunder from chapter 12, \\"In battle\\". The author writes: \\"Mahomet Scirocco (commander of the Turkish right wing) himself was killed in the hand-to-hand fighting. His body, floating face downwards in the sea running red with blood, was recognized by his gorgeous apparel. Venetian soldiers promptly chopped off his head and raised it on high - the dismal sight took the heart out of the Turks.\\"In actual fact Mahomet Scirocco, severely wounded, was taken prisoner by the Venetians and died four days later; the Turks, in spite of the Christian superior firepower, battled to the end with their usual heart and rage."},{"Title":"Single Family Housing: The Private Domain","review":"While this book's fragmented, multiple-quote format can at times obscure the overall threads of the content, it's a very good overview of what is being discussed pertaining to issues of building and domesticity across the world right now. The overall organization of the book through an analogy with physical structure (exo-, endo-, etc.) puts an interesting spin on the collections of writing and architects' quotations that make up each chapter. Overall, I'd highly recommend Single-Family Housing, especially if you're interested in the connections between domestic architecture and the changing forms of today's society."},{"Title":"Meteor","review":"&quot;The Meteor&quot; is not one of D&uuml;rrenmatt's top books, but it definitely is a milestone in D&uuml;rrenmatt corpus. The play shows the Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt of late 40s - 50s moving into a much compositely integrated theatre theory and performance aspects. Something he repeatedly spoke of in his PROBLEMS OF THE THEATER.The play deals with the Biblical Lazarus state of mind - that of non-dying. The protagonist Wolfgang Schwitter is in many ways biographical of D&uuml;rrenmatt himself as much as Friedrich Korbes of INCIDENT AT TWILIGHT was. A nobel prize winner (which the author never was, but was fashionable of talking about), a controversial writer, an artist who started his life as a painter and found to his horror that he could only draw caricatures and turned to playwriting, Schwitter much like D&uuml;rrenmatt later became a fiction writer. The play deals with his wish to die but inability to die. The play is an absolute theatre craftsman's delight. The possibilities that open out for any techie who wants to experiment with lights, sets, props - are enormous. Also a challenge.The play begins with Schwitter entering the atelier of Nyffenschwander, an impoverished artist who is painting nudes of his wife to eke out living, and is occupying currently the studio that Schwitter occupied when he himself had no money. The couple are surprised. Schwitter is supposedly dead. The papers are full of it. The television and radio are streaming the news. But Schwitter is alive. The rest of the play is a riot. D&uuml;rrenmatt's mastery of the absurd, the grotesque and love for the comedy of confrontation and dance of death is at its crescendo. While every character that comes into contact with Schwitter die or is killed or run into misfortune (including his own son who wants Schwitter to die in order to inherit the legacy), Schwitter rants and desperately does a Lear in self-pity, wanting to die. But death would not come to him. In the course of the play, D&uuml;rrenmatt does not spare a single institution - Real estate agents, medical estate, Mafia, Politicians, Journalists, Literary critics, Church, Salvation Army, Artists and not the least - the civilisation's most ancient institution - prostitution.It is ironic and perhaps the capping point in the work that D&uuml;rrenmatt subtly answers the charges of the feminists and women critics who had taken cudgels against him for his treatment or the mis-treatment of female characters in his works, by having Schwitter lambast and launch in to a tirade against the monstrosity of the world, and how he himself could empathise with the Madame Frau Nomsen. Alas, to realise that while he was talking, Nomsen is dead. And the Salvation army enters.... I leave the rest to you.Whoever tries to dissuade you from reading this work - do not pay attention. Read for yourselves and then decide. I guess, for theatre artists - actors, lighting designers, set designers, directors - this is definitely a challenging work of art."},{"Title":"Catherine of Siena","review":"This is the best biography of my favorite saint, at least the best I've ever found...even more inspiring, I think, than Raymond of Capua's...though I love that one too.

This book is well researched and clearly proves that their was a thriving gay culture in San Francisco well before the Stonewall uprising in New York. The idea that San Francisco was able to sustain a gay community based upon its \\"wide open\\" ideology and its status as a shipping port and military base also helped further cement this position as a gay bulwark in America. The only problem I had with this book, is that it covers alot of minutia which makes it somewhat of a laborious read and I found myself skipping ahead.

The artwork is fun and colorful, but the story was lacking. The snowmen leave their yards at dark and convene for a night of revelry. The \\"snowmen mothers\\" however get to serve them ice-cold cocoa. That's it ladies, no fun for the snow girls, just serve and smile... in frumpy hats no less.I would have liked this book better if it were perhaps only about the boys, or if the gender roles were not grossly cliche. My child and I could have then just imagined the horde as girls if we felt inclined. But since the author decided to highlight the gender roles of snow folk, our attentions were then drawn to the stark differences, and ultimately the lame presentation of female participation. We kept expecting the ladies to make another appearance and whoop it up with the fellas later in the story, but they never did.I'm certainly not anti-male. Our library has a lovely assortment of books with both traditional and whimsical boy protagonists. It's just that I prefer to give my child the benefit of seeing women, mothers, girls, sisters portrayed in strong and creative ways that reflect the rich variety of skills and interests of females today (even if they are minor characters). It is not my intention to bash homemaker mothers either, I myself am one.

Author Caralyn Buehner and her husband Mark Buehner (the book's illustrator) woke one morning to find that the snowman they'd created the night before had surreptitiously moved several yards closer to their front door. Inspired by their snow creature's apparent desire to move around and about, the Buehners started speculating on the eventide activities of snowmen in general. The result is the lovely and ludicrous \\"Snowmen At Night\\".As the young boy narrator tells it, one day he made a snowman with coal eyes and mouth and a carrot nose. The next day he returned to his fine creation only to find it looking all saggy baggy. This causes the boy to speculate, \\"What do snowmen do at night?\\". The answer is clear. Snowmen like to go to the park drinking ice-cold cocoa made by (and here it gets a little odd) \\"snowman mothers\\". Hm. Then they start to participate in their own very particular games. These include races, skating on the frozen ponds, making snow angels, and having fabulous snow fights. There's even some big time sledding down monstrous (but not too scary) hills. Towards the end, you really can't blame the snowmen if they've lost an eye here or a mitten there. Maybe they look a little bit worse for wear by the morning's light, but rest assured that they've definitely had a good time while you slept.It's difficult for a person of my generation to read a snowman book and not instantly think of old \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" cartoons. The snowmen pictured here are actually not too different from the ones pictured in Bill Watterson's strips, but they're significantly less scary. I think you'll instantly gravitate to this book the minute you see the cover. On the top half stand the serene smiling snowmen in the bright noonday sun. On the bottom half they're cavorting in a kind of makeshift conga line. Kids will warm to the idea of snowmen (something they themselves have created) having lives entirely of their own. It doesn't hurt any that the guys definitely seem to be having the time of their lives. Caralyn's text is well complimented by Mark's illustrations too. There's even been the extra added element of hidden shapes for kids to find in the pictures. If readers look carefully they might be able to spot a cat, a rabbit, a Santa face, and more. I appreciated that these images never once drew inordinate attention to themselves or distracted from the pictures. That is the mark of an expert illustrator.The back flap of the book shows a photograph of the rogue snowman that inspired this book in the first place. The book isn't the most original in the world and its illustrations aren't going to blow you away with either their wit or their artistic merits but it's certainly a great wintertime tale. There are five million books about toys coming to life at night, so why not snowmen too? If you want a picture book that takes away the sting of snowmen melting, I suggest you definitely check out and read the jaunty flouncy \\"Snowmen At Night\\" and read it to your loved ones. It's a book with pep in its step."},{"Title":"Snowmen at Night","review":"This book is definitely not just for children. Adults will enjoy sharing this with their kids.

The noise level and the limited amount of time the Guardsmen had to converse amongst themselves were two of the reasons I doubted the enlisted men could have decided to shoot the students.From there I re-examined a similar question: \\"Could an order to fire been issued by one of the commanding officers on the scene?\\" Drawing on new testimony produced by the trials, including some pretty damning grand jury transcripts that were read into the record but never shown to the jurors, I weighed the claims made by various eyewitnesses to the shootings. Some of the witnesses suggested the order to fire was given by Sergeant Myron J. Pryor, who, according to two former soldier eyewitnesses, allegedly tapped the three or four Guardsmen closest to him and pointed to designated targets. Others thought they saw Major Harry Jones make a motioning signal before the Guardsmen turned and fired. Jones was basically directing traffic with a baton that, in violation of Guard regulations, was not standard Guard equipment.Even though there were more witnesses against Jones, and Jones was less than forthcoming under oath, I pointed out several reasons to give him the benefit (such as one Guardsman's story that Jones was angry at the shooters). The accusations against Pryor made much more sense to me, and I hinted that he was the most likely candidate to have given a localized order to fire.Secondly, I was taken aback by Grin's claim that I used a diagram that was not to scale and which gave a distorted picture of the scene. His claim makes no sense. The diagram was originally published in the Akron Beacon Journal and it accurately reconstructs the Guardsmen's movements and the distances between the victims and the firing line. The Guardsmen are all pointed in the right direction, and the buildings are all basically in the right places, so I have no idea why Grin (whoever he is) would make such a vague, fuzzy and unsubstantiated claim.What irritated me the most, though, was Grin's suggestion that my decision to reprint the Beacon Journal's diagram somehow raises a question about the overall reliability of my research. Even if there was any merit to Grin's argument, to jump from a diagram to a sweeping claim about the overall reliability of my book is a non sequitur. It is also utter, utter nonsense.One of the things I am most proud of is that in the 16 years since my book was published, no one--not a single journalist, scholar, or groupie--has been able to identify any errors of fact (either significant or nitpicking).People may disagree with the conclusions I reached, but no one can honestly say I misquoted anyone, got basic facts wrong, or was less than conscientious with the material at hand."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"Alright, we all know that it was the national guardsmen, but who gave the fatal order to fire?! This is one of the best books on the subject, and believe me, I've been looking at them all recently. Michener's book was comprehensive, but may have come out too soon. Davies' book was too conspiracy minded, but did move the case onto the front burner. Aided by the longer view of history and time to reflect, study and learn, this book gives adequate coverage of all time periods... pre-riot, attitudes, facts, photos, aftermath, trials, settlements, and probable motives and suspects. I found Gordon's writing very accessable, a mixture of human emotion and factual account, challenging testimony and statement in the light of subsequent testimony and further research. By far, the most comprehensive look at what happened and why... and pulls no punches when it lays out who was at fault and why. I tend to agree with his conclusions, though author Gordon admits that we will never truely know until one or more of the National Guardsmen steps forward and tells his/their story. And that will narrow the field of suspects even more. Perhaps that is why they agreed among themselves not to speak. They don't have to.... only time, (and these books) will tell!One or two concerns with this book: The map on the inside cover has a differing location of the various victims than other books. In fact, photographs SHOW different figures laying or falling in different spots. (In fact, many of the books differ between themselves on where the four fell. I don't understand how and why this happened yet....)I also enjoyed Davis' book alot, as it has SO MANY photos.. I find I flip back and forth to Davis' book to cross check things.As with other books that were published earlier, the Kent State story continues to unfold... see other reviewers for further developments that have happened since publication. Perhaps another edition with updates and corrections is in order:**This book is criticized by some \\"who were there,\\" as it does not promote their agenda. (But then everyone has attempted to spin May Fourth to their advantage.) If there are factual errors, I did not spot them on the first reading. I enjoyed this book, despite the criticism. But, perhaps the best view is gained by reading MANY authors and MANY points of view. That's why I continue to seek them out...and to question their points of view with people who were on campus then. Inquire, reflect, learn.I know I did. And I'm still searching out others...."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"Yesterday I picked up this book at the Kent State bookstore as I finished out the semester. I had seen this one before, and it looked good. Even though I haven't completely finished the book yet, I can say already that it is something special. Gordon presents many facts, interviews, and testimonials that make you wonder if there really was a conspiracy at Kent State. I don't think it's false information that he's giving. Alot of it makes you wonder what happened. At the beginning of the book however, Gordon bad-mouths Kent State for not commemorating the 4 students that were killed. Yes, they did dedicate a memorial to the &quot;event&quot; of May 4th, but since being published in 1995, the university has dedicated a number of memorials to the 4 students, including blocking off 4 parking spaces where the students were shot. All in all, this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"Mr. Gordon's book is a highly-detailed and fascinating recap of this tragic incident. I hope he continues to update it should new information appear! The book is a well-written investigative analysis, although not void of the human element, especially the sad plight of the grieving parents. I might recommend one read it with a good novel on the subject: Silent Bell, by Gary Drake, which deals heavily with the human element as its a story about a couple who broke up the day of the shootings and meet up again at the 25th Anniveray. Both books complement each other."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"For those of us of a certain age, the shootings at Kent State in 1970 were shocking and very personal. They changed our lives, though we weren't always sure how or why. But we reacted as though the bullets fired that day were aimed at ourselves, not at students half a country away. Over the years, as we have grown older, many of us have evolved beyond our radical mindsets, partly by working through the anger, rage and fear we felt about Kent State. We may have once accepted the myth that the protesters were idyllic peaceniks wearing love beads and singing Kumbaya while being gunned down. But as William Gordon demonstrates in \\"Four Dead in Ohio,\\" the truth is not as simple as that. Students (or someone) burned down the campus ROTC building, prompting a jumpy (repressive? opportunistic?) Governor Rhodes to call in the National Guard. Some students were enraged and hurled abusive language and gestures (as well as stones) to tell the Guard they were not welcome on campus. The violence on May 4 was in some way a sad circus -- complete with volleying tear gas canisters, rock-throwing from distances that would have challenged major league ballplayers, edgy radicals turning tail from the Guard, black flags, headbands, soldiers walking into a fenced-in enclosure, and then a very unfunny barrage of shots inexplicably aimed not at a pack of nearby students but against a sparse crowd milling in a distant parking lot. Given the sheer number of players and motivations, mysteries and questions were sure to emerge. Given the polarized viewpoints of the participants (not to mention the propensity of the human mind under stress to screw things up) the potential for misunderstanding and distrust are profound.Gordon's book tackles the impossible task of making sense of the action on May 1-4 and the confused, frustrating legal aftermath. Central to his exposition is an attempt to determine whether conspiracy lay behind the tragedy. The 60s being the 60s (that decade being said to have ended officially on May 4, 1970) it was inevitable that many took it as gospel that all was not as it seemed -- that larger forces were at work in the country, and that nothing happened by accident. Kent State has proven to be a particularly thick porridge of dark speculation. For instance, some witnesses reported seeing the soldiers in a \\"huddle\\" on the football field minutes before the fatal volley. But did a huddle occur? If it did, did soldiers use it to plan their fatal attack? Or was the huddle merely a witness's interpretation of a bunch of soldiers standing close to each other? Why did the Guard, clearly in control of every element of the day, suddenly turn and fire on faraway students? Were they ordered -- either verbally of non-verbally? If so, who gave the order and why? What made the soldiers gaze with interest toward the Prentice Hall lot where so many later fell? Finally, was there a wider conspiracy to disrupt student protests against the war involving governmental actors even higher up than the governor of Ohio? Did Nixon's FBI provide an \\"agents provacateurs\\" to initiate the shooting? And why was the Justice Department so reluctant to convene a grand jury to consider charges against the Guardsmen, exasperating victims and their parents?Sadly, most of these questions will never be definitively answered. Some actors, like Sergeant Myron Pryor -- notoriously seen pointing his 45 toward the students as the shooting commenced -- denied any culpability, ludicrously claiming not to have fired his weapon at all. Other Guardsmen pled the Fifth Amendment, leaving a gap in the record of what happened. Motivations and memories were lost and befuddled in the swirl of tear gas and adrenaline. Nixon's interest in the case, if any, cannot be shown to have involved nefarious scheming against the peace movement; it may well have been more related to placating his political base (sadly, the majority of Americans at the time) who thought the Guard was in the right. The court cases that followed the shooting were hampered by stonewalling federal officials, judges ruling against lawyers who ticked them off, politicians trying to keep their electorates happy, defense lawyers being allowed to put the victims on trial, and victims' lawyers trying to make names for themselves at the expense of winning their court cases. In short, a bloody, yet very human, mess.Perhaps a result of his own long trek from the land of conspiracies, Gordon leaves some important questions unasked and some hum-drum alternatives unexplored. Why, for instance, did the Guard fire on distant student in the Prentice Hall lot rather than at the thicker knot of students and onlookers on the nearby Taylor Hall veranda? Also, what might have prompted their sudden turn and attack, if not an order? Gordon does not explore the possibility that a rock thrown by a student might have hit a departing and jumpy Guardsman, prompting him and those around him into a knee-jerk and fatal overreaction. Several students and victims, including one who taunted the guardsmen on the playing field, and who subsequently became a vocal supporter of keeping May 4 alive, were in easy rock throwing range of the top of Blanket Hill. But this obvious question -- which would fit the Guardsmen's usually-dismissed testimony about being under siege-- was not raised. Also, though Gordon criticizes the Guard for deploying gas masks without corrective lenses for those needing them, he does not much discuss what it might be like for a soldier to be forced to see the world through this barrier. Without having to condone their actions or state of mind, we still have a long way to go to humanize the Guardsmen.I found Gordon's survey approach to the topic to be an impediment to the book's readability. As an investigator with a longtime interest in the case and evident sympathy for the students, he needed to provide more primary material. The American public is ready, I think, to be exposed to eyewitness accounts from both sides and to come to its own conclusions. In this vein, the most interesting part of the book is the end notes, which included the transcript of Gordon's 1982 interview with Nixon's notorious chief domestic advisor, John Ehrlichman. That interview, more than anything Gordon could have written, made it pretty clear to me that Nixon was as shocked and surprised about the shootings as anyone else. Gordon uses the notes section to discuss (and dismiss) most of the crazier conspiracy theories about May 4, such as whether an ambulance was on site prior to the shootings, an ominous sign that the killings had been planned. Gordon shows that the Guard, needing a way to address students, commandeered the ambulance for its PA system. Such material should have been included in the body of the text. \\"Four Dead in Ohio\\" features relatively few photos, though unlike those in \\"The Truth About Kent State\\" by Peter Davies, they are of high quality. This lack is not usually a problem, as the included photos tell most of what the reader needs to know. Yet at least once, Gordon refers to a photo that is not include in the book. And a few more photos of the long distances between Guardsmen and students would have made the case more aptly than Gordon's insistence or biased eyewitness testimony. The book includes a couple of maps -- one from a newspaper and the other from the FBI are generally accurate (with mistakes pointed out by the author) and help ground the reader in the topography of the Commons, Taylor Hall, the football field and Prentice Hall parking lot. A topographical map (or better yet an aerial shot) with labels would have more objective.The shootings at Kent are tragic and invite reexamination. Gordon's book leads me to reject the idea of a grand scheme to kill college students. Gordon documents more than enough bumbling, posturing, reckless and venal behavior to have accounted for ten Kent States. But in spite of the book's shortcomings, it does help the reader identify the questions that still remain unanswered. And it makes it clear how the lack of candor on the part of the Guardsmen -- not to mention the heightened and continuing paranoia of some former students -- has made it difficult to determine exactly what happened that day. The truth, if and when it eventually comes out, will undoubtedly be far more mundane than even the tamest of conspiracy theories, yet more troubling than the dismissive pose of those who blame the students for their own deaths. Until a fuller telling is possible, Gordon's book, by mercifully shying away from the wilder theories, and by explaining away many peripheral conspiracy possibilities, helps readers narrow their attention onto the serious remaining mysteries of that day, on which death stalked an American college campus in the form of the young gunning down the young."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"The author did a very good job putting together what had happenened at Kent State on May 4, 1970, but did not follow thru with the probable cause of the Guard's necessity to shoot, which was the illegal gun drawn and fired near the \\"pines\\" by FBI and Campus Security informant, Terry Norman, and visually witnessesed by several students and heard by Guardsmen. The admission by Norman, of firing the gun. to the NBC film crew (from Cleveland) and to the National Guard media coordinator who was with them was ignored.The fact that J. Edgar Hoover, himself, publicly lied in denying any prior Bureau association with Norman - was later confirmed by his successor - should tell us something!The author could not believe Norman's guilt because he voluntarilyreturned to Kent a few weeks after the shootings for an abreviated summer class. It should be noted, however, that Norman then immediately was taken out of school and placed in Washington D.C. on a police assignment which sometimes happens to agents and informants that have run into problems. Other than the critical omissions - the book is well done."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"I am a Kent State alum, and have always been interested to learn more on this subject because of this. I graduated in 2004, so I was obviously not on campus during this time, so May 4th to me was simply a day I didn't have classes after noon. After reading this book, that day means something a little more than previously mentioned. This book is packed full of useful information to understand the events more clearly. It is biased because the author had a part to play in the chain of events, though it was a small one in the grander scheme of things. It was interesting to see his point of view, though, being part of the events himself. I can understand why he thought the way he did at the time, because he let us entirely in his thought process through his writing. Each thought, or conspiracy theory mentioned, had a clear chain of evidence to show why he felt the theory plausible or not. I did like how he wasn't buying into all of the theories, only the ones with a large amount of substantial evidence. A few of the ideas were mentioned repeatedly, which made me consider them all the more than others. This was the first book about the events that I have read, but it will surely not be the last. If you'd like to learn about some intriguing peculiarities from one of America's darkest days, this is a book for you. If you already were familiar with the events, this book could shed some light on some questions you may have yourself. This is meticulously covered, and is worth a look for anyone interested in May 4th, or anyone looking to consider a good conspiracy theory. The title says it all, and you would be shocked to see who has been linked to why the events took place to begin with."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"\\"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State?\\" Don't expect a definitive answer to the question in the title of William Gordon's book, which should come as no surprise to those still asking these types of questions.Instead Gordon's book provides an excellent objective summary of what happened on May 4th, good detail about subsequent investigations and litigation, and a decent exploration of possible cover-ups with speculation as to motives.There is not much to support a real conspiracy regarding the shooting itself, mostly just suspicion stemming from the efforts of local, state, and federal authorities to vindicate the guardsmen involved. Gordon's logical analysis of the situation, along with information released under the Freedom of Information Act, supports the idea that this was more a desire to cater to the conservative political base than to hide facts about a government conspiracy.Gordon's most interesting points are not about the shootings or the subsequent investigations, but about the degree to which the action was condoned (and even applauded) by older Americans. His most memorable statement being that the killings were \\"the most popular murders ever committed in the United States\\".Many years later Gordon examines the situation from a distanced perspective. The most likely scenario is that a handful of guardsmen and their NCO had agreed at some point during their time on campus to act on their frustrations if a good opportunity arose. After a bungled and especially embarrassing sweep across campus they found themselves bringing up the rear of the formation. When they reached the top of a hill they stopped, turned, and fired a volley into the parking lot 300-400 feet away. A payback scare for the students who had been \\"disrespecting\\" them during the 40 hours they had been on campus; or just a demonstration that they had live ammunition.There had been rocks thrown and tear gas fired during this time, extreme for a crowd control situation but tame by civil disturbance standards. 200 miles east at Watkins Glen (NY) it is an annual tradition for bands of drunken motor racing fans to burn random cars. For years the Sheriff and his special posse have spent entire evenings tear gassing and battling these crowds without a single shot being fired. Of course few (if any) of the deputies had mega-hatred for the race fans; and unlike the KSU students even the most drunken spectator knew that the guns of the deputies were loaded.While the shots were probably just intended to scare, there is also a possibility that those who hatched up this idea intended to shoot students and just wanted other shooters to cover their actions (no one is telling). It is also possible that some of the troops walking just ahead of this group and unaware of the plan were spooked by the first shots and turned and fired directly into the crowd hitting students.There were 67 shots fired over a 13 second period, an extremely long time for this sort of situation. Although in photos the firing line looks organized, the targeted locations were extremely varied with enough cars and pavement hit to support the idea that the intent of many (but obviously not all) was to just scare the students. As Gordon points out (and the many photos illustrate) there is little logic to the notion that those who fired felt particularly threatened at the moment of the shooting, if anything they had reached a commanding position far safer than their previous location. In fact there was a detached company of guardsmen much closer to the targeted students (they were deployed a few yards from the students on the parking lot side of Taylor Hall) who looked on with amazement during the shooting.Allison Krause (a teenage girl) was shot in the \\"back\\" three times from a range of 340 feet. Hard to spin that as self-defense. Does anything more need to be said about the amount of hate that was on the firing line that day?I had several minor issues with the book. On page 32 Gordon reprints a Knight Newspaper drawing (made shortly after the shootings) of the area of campus where the shootings occurred, complete with arrows and labels tracing movement and location of the participants. This diagram is neither in scale nor properly oriented, and gives a confusing (warped and compressed) view of the scene. On page 54 is a chart made by the FBI of the same area. The FBI chart is to scale and properly oriented, and illustrates the significant distortions of the newspaper drawing. The only possible value of the newspaper drawing is that it may explain why some newspaper readers supported the actions of the guardsmen (the compressed scale makes its look like the students are just a few feet from the guardsmen), but Gordon does not explore this possibility. So why even include it?Related to this are several references to the left flank of the firing line when Gordon apparently means the \\"right\\" - military unit alignments \\"should always\\" be be described from the unit's point of view (like a football formation). Finally, his description of the maneuvers on the football practice field appear to suffer from similar right-left confusion.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."},{"Title":"Four Dead in Ohio: Was There a Conspiracy at Kent State","review":"I have read a number of articles from the time on Kent State and decided to read this book to see what happened afterward. I am not as strong of an advocate of the research that went into this book as the other reviewers here.The author clearly did a lot of research and includes dates, names, places, but it seems like a white wash to me (that is my opinion). A handful of national guardsmen do not get called out to deal with a simple protest, yet that seems to be the implication. Also, there were always rumors of a student with a gun and that would explain the shootings easily but the author tries to play that off with multiple explinations as to why this person could not have caused the shootings first by implying he was not really there because his role was only later established (but it was reported immediately so what does it matter if it was only later established by interviews with other people later) then he says he \\"gave\\" the gun up. So why would he show up at a violent confrontation with the national guard, pull out a gun, then peacefully \\"give\\" it up? If you read this book with a tiny bit of suspicion then you start to see a lot of holes in the story as painted by the author. A lot of the \\"facts\\" are also based on vague \\"eye witnesses\\" who are not named and often only come forward immediately after an article comes out in the paper. That makes it sound like they are anti-government hippies who only surface with a story after they have been briefed on what to say to make the natioanl guard look bad. The whole thing smacked of self serving interpretations but that just may be me.Unfortunately I am not an expert in history, only an armchair historian, so I cannot completely refute the claims but I found other reviews not on amazon which also question his facts.My advice is, read more than one source and be skeptical. People who write books like this often have agendas that are not obvious."},{"Title":"Broken Bread","review":"The second chapter (sermon) in this book alone is work the price of the book.

In fact, I keep an extra copy around, that I keep lending to people. I eagerly await the author's next book.In addition to being a really enjoyable read, the book does have a message -- one that not everyone will appreciate. A person of strong faith and a sense of humor, will be able to smile at the fun the author pokes at religion. Those with little faith, and no funnybone would attack it.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"First off, I don't give five stars. Except here. And its not because this is the finest piece of literature I have ever read. It's just a very good, very funny book with a great deal of heart.Scepticism, Inc. is a look at the ways in which religion makes people act and manifests itself in society. Through farcical extremes, Fowler puts religion and human nature under a microscope. And its funny...and true.It's very hard to review something like this without giving away the magic. It's not for everyone - those with strict religious beliefs might not appreciate the fun Fowler pokes, but for those with open minds (or even those with closed minds with good senses of humor), Scepticism Inc is worth the read."},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"This book is an excellent first attempt and should be received joyfully by those with an open mind. Both my criticism and appraisal would be that it is reads like Douglas Adams, but a poorer version. Perhaps it was stretched out longer than necessary, perhaps the ending could have had a little more thought, Who knows?One gets the impression that this book was written on the back of a dumping because 'people matter more than truth' but then, does this really matter?Sometimes the book reads as the rambling thoughts of a confused philosophy student, which i suppose is better than being the rambling thoughts of a Media &amp; Cultural Studies student.Anybody who can link something as ridiculous as a shopping trolley to something as ridiculous as religion deserves to be read. Concepts such as 'metaphysical betting shops' and 'popecorn' bring a smile to one's face and at the end of the day, surely this is what life is all about... Who knows?"},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"It's true: this book is funny (unless you are fervently religious in which case you will probably find not to be funny). It is also annoying, repetitious and single minded. Bo Fowler is a creative writing instructor and this book comes off as an over-long experiment in creative writing. While I like the satirical premise of the \\"metaphysical betting shops\\" I found the deliberately choppy and repetitious style to be very irritating. This book would have made a nice essay or short story but instead we get a stretched out novel which tries way too hard to be oh so clever with too few ideas. Contrary to what one reviewer wrote, I would say this is a tough book to read-not because of its subject matter but because of its ultra choppy style."},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"I guess I am not surprised at the range of ratings from the reviewers of this book. It's appreciation will depend on the reader's sense of humor and open mindedness. The various descriptions of satire, parable, rant, etc. don't do justice to what is an inventive lampooning of hypocrisy.Do not read this book if you are unwilling to openly face the behavior of the world's religions. Fowler takes on all of them.What's not to like about a shopping cart seeking the meaning to life? This is a very funny book with a deep message."},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"For someone brought up in a Christian home like myself, this book clearly has the potential to easily offend the devout and the hypersensitive. Having a very independent spirit myself, however, the book tagged my curiosity. Chronicled in the pages of this Bo Fowler novel is the adult life of agnostic Edgar Malroy, who reasons that you should believe enough in your religious standpoint to bet money on its absolute truth. Edgar rakes in ungodly amounts of cash (no pun intended) on this idea as several decide that betting on their faith is the best way to profess it.However, just as many are opposed to the idea, including a shapely Christian woman named Sophia whom Edgar falls deeply and madly in love despite proclaiming her the nuttiest of all nuts. The indubitable success of Scepticism, Inc. causes an enormous holy war involving all the world's religions to start, and all the while, an automated shopping cart looks for God and answers at the top of Mt. Everest.Attacking mostly Catholicism and Christianity, Fowler holds no punches on any religion or denomination, which is no doubt much to the dismay of the more conservative followers of any religion who pick this book up. If you appreciate the blatant satire, however, you will find a book that, with two parts consisting of 50 chapters each, surprisingly comes off as easily digestible rather than choppy and is quite funny. However, the book doesn't start winding down until very far in, meaning it has to contrive itself and settle for a rather unpleasant and unsatisfactory ending. The biggest laughs come from the intense disagreements and battles between the two Popes - yes, you read that right - and the musings of the shopping cart as he talks with Edgar Malroy. If the book offends you, you shouldn't compromise yourself by finishing it in the first place. Only if your most metaphysical fancies are tickled should you explore it more deeply."},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"First of all, let me assure you that this is, in fact, a very funny, and quite well written parable. And yes, it is a parable. A satirical parable, an quirky parable, and a parable that is more than a bit odd, but a parable none the less. It's also very enjoyable.Now, if I may get on my soapbox for a moment, I want to also note that it is also a science-fiction story. I mention this because the publisher seems to have gone to pains to avoid placing it in the science-fiction section. How else would you describe a book whose purported author is a sentient shopping cart sending a transmission back to Earth 80,000 in the future?My guess is that they wanted to appeal to literatti -- and anyone who considers themselves a member of that self-selected group of high-minded individuals is going to turn their nose up at the first whiff of SF. Sure, they let Vonnegut slip by, but that's only because the science-fictional elements in his books were deliberately (one hopes) campy and self-effacing. How often did KV describe is unaltered-ego, Kilgore Trout, as a bad writer?The downside is that many people who read SF are never going to notice this great little story because it will be sitting on a shelf that a lot of them never look at, while the people who do purvey the &quot;General Fiction&quot; racks will, more likely than not, give it a miss after a cursory glance at the first few pages. More the pity.Much the same thing happened with another notable (albeit somewhat less laudible) book, &quot;Resume with Monsters&quot;, which clearly belonged in the Horror section of the bookstore but which was, never the less, shelved in that vast expanse of uncatagorized titles.I guess the lesson is that a lot of publishers have a low opinion of genre fiction readers, beliving them to be interested in cliches and stories whose plots could be written on the wrapper of a pack of bubble-gum, so they attempt to steer literate examples of genre fiction away from the very readers that such fiction is most likely to appeal to. The consequence is that, because genre fiction is perceived as being distinct from literature, it ends up getting cumulatively dumbed-down, while those examples of works that deserve to be called literature is fed to an audience that's primed to reject them on the basis of similar sentiments. In short, such works are the victim of a self-fufilling, self-purpetuating philosophy that ends of hurting everyone in the long run.Okay, enough of the soapbox. It's a very good, very fun story, and if you don't have any prejudices against science-fiction or &quot;literate&quot; works, and you don't mind a plot that is simultaneously strange and theologically controversial, I imagine that you would probably enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"I enjoyed Scepticism Inc., but thought it fell a long way short of the lofty (but nonetheless unremarkable) ambitions expressed in its author's note. I didn't get the joke about Ceramic Art, and if all Bo Fowler wanted to say was \\"People matter more than the Truth\\" he could have picked any number of more effective ways of saying it (a six word poem, for example).The central premise around which Fowler constructs his tale - a wise guy profiteering out of silly people putting hard money on improvable things - is a nice idea for a short story, or a joke, but it can't sustain the sort of close examination it gets in a full novel. Some of the surrounding surrealism (such as the narrator being an artificially intelligent shopping trolley who climbs Mt. Everest) had no obvious point, other than the sight gag. And how I laughed.Fowler's beef is with religion. It's definitely fair game, but it seems to me to be an easy enough target for satire without the need for this level of absurdity, and that undermines the force of the (otherwise sensible, if Philosophy 101-derived) criticisms Fowler wants to make. As a result Scepticim Inc. won't rescue anyone from under the spell of fundamentalism, and it won't do more than prove a few belly-laughs for the already saved.The humour is a little self-satisfied, though there are some nice lines - the best (like \\"there's a Messiah born every minute\\") did actually make me laugh out loud - but Fowler tends to beat his darlings to death, and so even though it's a short and easy read, you have the sense it could profitably have been much shorter still, without losing anything of significant value. Still, a nice try for a first novel from a guy who did a creative writing course at University.In fact, that pretty much sums it up.Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"Scepticism Inc.","review":"Fowler's bio says he intends to write 100 books and then die. I certainly hope he achieves the first half of his goal! For those who appreciate Kurt Vonnegut's musings, Fowler is a must. His writing style and sense of humor are clearly reminiscent of Vonnegut's, but with a bit more of an optimistic slant. In addition to the humor in his writing (which is sharp and laugh-out-loud funny), Fowler has a knack for making his readers stop and think about the world around them and their role in it (to, &quot;put their money where their metaphysics are,&quot; as one of the book's protagonists would say) -- without being at all preachy or over-bearing.

Part 2 decends further into a mockery of all things religious, and the author starts pontificating about how atheism is so much better than religion. Not agnosticism, but atheism.

I was initially satisfied with the Japanese tapes but then I listened to Pimsleur's Chinese tapes. Listening to those, I realized that there is far less of a systematized approach to the Pimsleur system than I had originally thought.Japanese III is asking listeners to compose/repeat simple five word sentences. Furthermore there is insufficient reinforcement of some of the materials used in earlier sections. For example in Japanese II listeners learn how to use the rather complex phrase for asking someone to hand over something. However, after this expression is introduced in a few of the Japanese II tapes, it disappears into oblivion.What particularly surprised this listener was that the sentences which students are expected to compose in the basic Pimsleur Chinese I tapes are far longer and more complex than the sentences which students are asked to compose in intermediate/advanced Japanese III. This reviewer feels that the Chinese phrases are too complex and the Japanese phrases are too simplistic. Thus Pimsleur is inconsistent.I had greater expectations from Pimsleur. I still find that their stuff is the best audio material that is available but it is this reviewer's opinion that they do less than they claim to do. If you need to learn Japanese in a hurry, however; they will be a valuable help."},{"Title":"Japanese III","review":"Ok. Even Pimsleur III won't get you very far, is expensive as hell, and is somewhat cumbersome to work with. So the rest of this review will be about how in hell did I get to giving it five stars. There are several ways to go about when wanting to learn a language in an audio-only manner. You can get the &quot;Learn in your car&quot; from Penton Overseas. You can get the audio-only course from Living Language. Or you can take Pimsleur. From the lot, Pimsleur would be the ONLY decent answer for the utter beginner, and Pimsleur III will give the best stability with the language for beginner to intermediate level with the other options, you will find yourself replaying the tapes a couple of times. Does any language course that is a self learning course worth this kind of money? No. That's why we have the next paragraph.Money. First of all, by all means get it used. It is an audio course that I recommend going through only once. So if you're lucky enough to find a CD version used, it will be exactly the same (of course - assuming that the seller is decent enough to sell unscratched CD-s). As for used audio cassettes, well, as much as we want to hear the correct pronounciation, we have to remember - this is not Mozart, it is only recorded speech. However even if you don't find it used, you can buy it, and after completing the course, sell it as used. As this is suitable for first time learning, and is too much for review purposes (perhaps the other audio-only courses will be better for review).One last thing. Usability. I'll talk technology, but it's essential here. When I bought the heavy package, the first thing I've done was to move it to MP3. So then I had the entire audio collection on a single CD. In such a way you take a single disc to your car, play it with a mobile MP3 player, and stock the valuable course in your closet for backup. In that way, when you finish with the course, the originals stay in a good enough state to be sold as used. However, if you won't convert to MP3, the need to each time take another cassette/CD to your car would be a serious drawback, since storing the entire course in your car doesn't sound as a sensible alternative to me.To wrap it up, buy it, MP3 it, learn it, sell it."},{"Title":"Japanese III","review":"This is an excellent language CD course, and most likely the best there is. I won't echo what has already been said by other positive reviews here. Allow me to address some of the concerns brought up by other reviewers.Is it too expensive? If you shop around a little to get a good price, and then consider the nice buy-back program, the actual price is not bad at all. In fact it is actually cheaper than many similar products out there.Are the speakers Japanese? In Japanese 1 and part of 2, there is a woman who constantly pronounces \\"g\\" as \\"ng\\" (a soft g, as they say). This is slightly unusual, but not incorrect, according to Japanese friends. There is one \\"guest\\" speaker who has a really funny, perhaps false, deep voice. His visit is very brief; maybe 1 minute total. With the possible exception of \\"deep voice\\", the speakers are most certainly Japanese.Although I gave it 5 stars, this course is not perfect. My complaints areA couple words were introduced abruptly, saying they'd already been covered when they hadn't.No vocabulary list, although Pimsleur Spanish has one. I had to make my own.More frequent than usual use of the word \\"ee\\" in place of \\"hai\\"At times overly honorific (polite)A few words are not the most commonly used nowHowever, these are all minor problems. It's well worth the money for any beginner."},{"Title":"Japanese III","review":"I turned to Pimsleur because I did not have a computer for Rosetta Stone at the time I had the money for this product. For a person with a discerning ear, a bit of intelligence this can be a wonderful product. Each lesson starts with a conversation in Japanese between two speakers. This conversation is usually composed of words and phrases from previous lessons, and new words that you will learn on the current lesson. After 3-4 times on each lesson (over two-three days) I usually feel confident enough to move on. The program says you need to get 80% of the material correct before you move on, but the more repetitions you give yourself, the more you will retain lessons that you complete.I've read several reviews of this product where advice is given to pause the recording between questions to remove the stress and give yourself more time to answer. I disagree with this strategy for a a few reasons: They give you adequate time to respond at a natural speed, it tests in real time your retention and in real life people don't wait for 15 second tracts of time while you formulate a response. Just repeat the lesson if you are not successful. Cue it to the difficult spots for some targeted practice on the difficult sections.Another strategy to use Pimsleur to its fullest is to pull the conversations from past levels onto a single track with the lesson numbers spoken. That way if they bring up a word/phrase that you have covered but you want to go back and learn it, you have a reference. Also at the end of 3 levels of this audio course it is just plain cool to hear all of that spoken Japanese without English interruptions that you can understand.Language is a long journey, and Pimsleur is a step, but you will by no means be able to hold conversations with natives, because you usually only learn how to say things a single way.

So consider this one part of your learning package. Other important parts include Native Japanese audio/video, writing, and reading practice.

For example, the announcer gives the following prompt in English; \\"The coffee of that coffee shop is delicious\\". Not only is that sentence grammatically awkward, it doesn't match the grammar of the correct translation in Japanese. The correct response in Japanese is simply, \\"That coffee shop's coffee is delicious\\". There is no reason why the prompt cannot match this. I really wish Pimsleur cleaned up these inconsistencies for a more productive and less frustrating learning experience."},{"Title":"Japanese III","review":"I say no more.

In this one, Taran, who has always wondered about his parentage, leaves Caer Dallben on a quest to find out who he truly is. Only Gurgi goes with him, though the two do meet up with an old friend or two eventually. Taran learns where he may be able to find the answers he seeks, and sets off to do so, but finds himself entangled in a number of complications along the way that teach him valuable lessons about the meaning of life, and his place in it. It's good stuff, as usual, though the book eventually takes on an episodic feel that none of the others has; get into a situation, learn a lesson, get into another situation, etc. There's no overlap, which is kind of odd, and made like the book less than those that came before it; still, if you've journeyed this far with Taran and Gurgi, you certainly shouldn't stop now. ***"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"A friend of my father's brought me a box full of used books when I was 9 or 10.

Don't get me wrong though, I liked it, just not as much as the others. I thought it moved slower than the others, and also Eilonwy was left out of the book, and she was always the highlight for me. Anyway, the basic plot of the book was that Taran at last cannot stand not knowing who his parants were, so he goes on a personal quest to try discover his identity. He hopes to find out he is from noble birth because then he can marry Eilonwy, but what he finds isn't exactly what he thought... So, in general this was a great book that asks the ultimate moral question and deals with the truth that it isn't who your parants are the make you you.

He is no longer satisfied with being an Assistant Pig-Keeper (well, he never was, but he's less so than ever), because he is completely head-over-heels in love with Princess Eilonwy (well, who wouldn't be?), and he hopes that his parents were of high enough lineage to make him worthy of her. What he discovers, however, is something poets and storytellers have been telling us for centuries--true nobility is in how you act, not in who your parents are. Finally Taran discovers his father--or is it his father? Since being a shepherd is not much better than being an Assistant Pig-Keeper (probably worse, since the pig was the oracular pig Hen Wen), Taran would just as soon that he wasn't. But if Taran (and hopefully the reader) has learned anything by this point in the series, it is that if you want to be and not merely appear a hero, you have to accept reality as it is, and not just as you want it to be.This is not as exciting as some of the others in the series, but is an indispensable prelude to the magnificent finale, _The High King_."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"The series turns more serious with this volume, as Taran begins to search out his place in the world, trying to find a family and a calling.

The worth of a man doesn't hinge on his rank; both a good king and a good commoner have something to give to the world, and who's to say one is more important than the other. In this book Taran goes out in search of his past, hoping to find he is of noble birth in order to ask for the hand of the Lady Eilonwy.

I have, at times, been as proud and as stubborn as Taran. Like him, I have gained skill in many areas that have still failed to satisfy me. And like him, I have desperately yearned for things beyond my reach. Who says this is just a children's book?"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"One of the great joys of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles series is the steady progression from lighthearted children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a lifetime of journeys, learning from them as they went.This is very much front and center in \\"Taran Wanderer,\\" a sad, lonely tale of Taran's quest to find out who he truly is. While appropriate for all ages and sure to be enjoyed by young readers, older readers will find the harrowing decisions Taran has to make gripping and heart-wrenching.Because Alexander draws his stories from ancient myth and legend, the themes and situations here will feel familiar, like stories you've read many times before. Yet that never comes across in a tiresome way. It's a story that operates in a welcome comfort zone, nice in a time when so many books try so hard to be different solely for the sake of being different. The story told in \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a timeless tale because of its familiarity and will engage readers for many years to come.The focus here is more strongly on Taran than in any other volume, though the rest of the cast of characters returns: Eilonwy the stereotypical spoiled princess, Gurgi the crazed Gollum-like creature, and Fflewddur Fflam the hapless bard who is prone to exaggeration. Others from the past also rear their heads.The pacing in this, the fourth of five books, is more deliberate. Some would say slow, but this being the type of story it is, that would be an unfair description. Rather, it lingers in Taran's quest and Taran's sadness and uncertainty.\\"Taran Wanderer\\" and the rest of the Prydain Chronicles are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"With all respect to Ms. Rowling, this is one of the best Fantasy Series.

And someday, my own children."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran Wanderer, is the third book of the Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander. So far this is the best one of the series. The first two book were great, but this is even better. The main character, a boy named Taran, is looking for the truth and he learns that the truth can play with you. It's a very unusual book, you won't find many like this.Taran Wanderer is an amazing fantasy adventure book. It's got magic, enchantment, a few funny parts, and suspense. It has a grumpy dwarf named Doli. Doli is the kind of person who always turns up at the exact right moment. Taran is an adventurous boy who tries to gather wisdom and friends wherever he can find them. He goes on several quests. My favorite part is chapter eight, when Taran meets the magician, Morda. It's scary and has an unusual ending.I read this book in less than a week. It just took me captive! I don't want to give away the plot, because I don't want to spoil it. You should read it for yourself.

One obvious difference is that Eilonwy does not appear in the book (except in the thoughts of the other characters). Another is that this book does not contribute to the ongoing battle between Taran and his friends and the forces of Arawn of Annuvin. This book is Taran's adventure of self-discovery, as he traverses the land of Prydain in search of his roots, a search which takes him from the Marshes of Morva, through the kindom of Smoit, and on to the land of the Free Commots."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I read many Newbery Award winners as a child, and none has affected me as much as &quot;Taran Wanderer,&quot; the penultimate book in Lloyd Alexander's &quot;Pyrdain&quot; series. I was fortunate enough to have found the book at age 12, and the protagonist's coming of age experience paralleled my own coming of age as a reader. Although the first three installments in the &quot;Pyrdain Chronicles&quot; are beautifully written children's fantasies that teach important life lessons, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; possesses a maturity and complexity making it the jewel of the series. No longer seeking magical cauldrons and oracular pigs, Taran embarks upon a vague quest for self discovery that finds him engaging in lackluster tasks such as weaving and pottery-making that rarely appear in a children's fantasy. While &quot;Wanderer&quot; still contains the requisite evil wizards, talking crows, and magic harps, somehow Pyrdain has become a less black-and-white world. After reading &quot;Taran Wanderer,&quot; both Taran and myself were no longer children, and the action-packed finale of the &quot;High King,&quot; despite being wildly entertaining, could not recapture the innocence of the earlier books. The work introduced me to an adult world demanding diffuclt choices and temperance, a world which sadly replaced the delightful child's land where a magic sword could vanquish evil. However, despite this sacrifice, Taran's journey is one worth making, and Lloyd Alexander gracefully introduces his young readers into an adult world surrounded by a subtler type of magic. Ten years later as a computer science graduate student, I can honestly say that the impact of &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; has not faded."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I have read these books before when I was a lot younger, and recently I decided to read them again, after I bought the set for Christmas.

A wonderful book about the journey to find 'self'."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"In many ways, this forth book in Lloyd Alexander's \\"The Chronicles of Prydain,\\" is the odd one out. It is the only story that does not pit our characters against the forces of supernatural evil (well, except in one small instance). It is the only installment in which Princess Elionwy is completely absent. It is the only story that has no clear destination in its quest narrative. Even the title is a little different, lacking the usual \\"The\\" before the noun.Rather than pitting the forces of good against evil, \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is about the journey of self-discovery, making it a much steadier-paced, introspective book. Although some readers may feel that it's less exciting than the preceding books, discerning children will find many hidden rewards here. The core of this series has always been the growth of Taran from a somewhat foolish, hapless boy into a man, and with each consecutive book he learns a little more about himself and the world around him. \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is the book in which Taran fully steps into manhood.With the intention to ask Princess Elionwy to marry him when she returns from her training on the Isle of Mona, Taran desires to learn more about his heritage. Having never known his parents, he harbours a secret wish that he has noble-blood in his veins, and on gaining Dallben's permission, he sets out to discover the identity of his parents and find his place in the world. His only companion is the faithful Gurgi; not-quite-a-man, not-quite-an-animal, and best described as a benevolent version of Gollum.On his travels he learns of the mysterious Mirror of Llunet which is said to show the true self of anyone who stares into it. With this as his somewhat vague goal, Taran heads out into the world. What follows is not so much a single overarching story, but a series of encounters and problems in which Taran has to solve with his wit, compassion, bravery, common sense, and only occasionally his physical strength. From feuding lords to evil wizards, lawless mercenaries to the lessons of forge, loom and potter's wheel, each life experience leads him closer to who he really is.Yet Alexander also finds time to add commentary on the human condition, and it his greatest achievement that he manages to do so (not just here, but in his other books) that it is done subtly and wisely, rather than just by slapping a moral on the end of every sentence. Taran comes up against the amorality of an outlaw, the injustice of a warlord, the arrogance of a wizard, and the simple dishonesty of a shepherd, and yet never relinquishes his own integrity, even as he faces fear, shame, and bitter disappointment.But it's not all doom and gloom: there's plenty of room for humour, wonder and hope, usually obtained in the presence of Taran's beloved companions: faithful Gurgi, the wandering bard Fflewdur Fflam (who carries a harp who snaps a string every time he tells a lie), the grouchy dwarf Doli and the mischievous talking-crow Kaw (my own favourite!)Another aspect worthy of note is that Prydain itself (based on the myths and legends of Wales) is explored in more detail than in previous books. Whilst we've previously dealt with castles and princes, warlords and enchanters, we now get a look into the more humble - and more important - inhabitants of this imaginary world. The reader learns much from the simplest of folk, including kindness to animals, respect to elders, the beauty of nature, and the simple pleasures of good food and a warm hearth.However, some of the \\"special features\\" of the book are a little disappointing: specifically, an incomplete pronunciation guide and a truly hideous map of Prydain that looks as though it was drawn by a three-year old (seriously, the rivers look like random scribbles). Yet the current edition of the series has new cover-art by the gifted David Wyatt, so if there was ever a time to invest in the complete collection, now is it.\\"Taran Wanderer\\" is enlightening, bittersweet, joyful, thought-provoking and timeless. At its conclusion, all the pieces are in place for the final installment in this series:The High King (The Chronicles of Prydain), a book which is as close to perfection as you'll ever get in children's literature. Seriously."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"A nice fit between the fairy tale innocence of Lewis' Narnia and the epic saga of Tolkien's Middle-earth. Fun to read, with some good morals woven into it."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Of the five splendid books in the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander, my favorite is the fourth, TARAN WANDERER.The previous three books: THE BOOK OF THREE, THE BLACK CAULDRON and THE CASTLE OF LLYR are superb fantasy for children. They share a common theme that nothing comes without work or sacrifice and show that glory is less fine than friendship. The final book, THE HIGH KING, picks up this theme again as the struggle between good and evil is played out to the end.Just as its title is different TARAN WANDERER is different. Here our young hero, the orphan boy Taran, is growing from a boy to a man. Suddenly he is aware of the gap in rank between himself and his childhood friend Princess Eilonwy; suddenly he knows he loves her but can never marry her unless he has land or rank to offer in turn. So he leaves the only home he has known, the farm of the enchanter Dallben and sets out on a quest to discover the truth of his origins. Was he high-born or low?This book is different. Always before when Taran set out with his friends to find some magical item, he would find the unexpected. While some chapters might be grim the quest was always lighthearted and the comrades always entertaining. Here Taran sets out not knowing what he is looking for and he finds the commonplace. The challenge that Taran faces is one that most adults are familiar with: one can search for Truth, but it is not always to be found. Disappointment is part of life and must be faced. Taran's search takes him from the magical marshes of Morva to the rude hut of a shepherd, from evil sorcerer's stronghold to the campfires of a bandit gang. He searches the length and breadth of Prydain and does not find his parents. He does discover the common people of Prydain, how they live and work and love and comes to the realization that nobility is not necessarily found in marble halls.I have loved this book since I first read it more than forty years ago; I love it still. Great fantasy for all ages and all times. A real classic, as are all the books of Prydain. If you have not yet visited this magical kingdom loosely based on Welsh mythology, you have missed a real treat."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I have been a fan of the Prydain series since I first read them in junior high long, long ago. At the time, had you asked me which book was my favorite, I would have said The Black Cauldron. My least favorite would have been Taran Wanderer. But as I grew older and reread the series several times at different stages in my life, I found myself developing a fondness for Taran Wanderer and today I would say it is my favorite of the series.I cannot say for certain, but when I read the book, I get the feeling that it is not really written for independent readers and early teens. They will, of course, find much to enjoy in it between the memorable characters and the occasional action scene. But I feel that it is a book best enjoyed by those who have already embarked on their own quest in search of who they truly are. Until a person has walked that line between youthful innocence and adult responsibility, the nuances of this book are not fully revealed. At least they weren't for me. But now that I have grown up and had to discover who I am, this particular story has a poignancy that it lacked when I was twelve years old. It was a good book then but it is a better book now and its greatest strength is that it is a book that has meaning and substance no matter how old the reader may be."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This is the 4th book in a series called &quot;The Prydain Chronicles.&quot; This book is about Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper, and his quest for himself.

When he goes to see the Witches in the Marches of Morva they send him on a wild goose chase to seek the Mirror of Llunet. On the way he gets himself into crazy situations and he finds creative solutions for complicated problems.I really liked this book because it's easy to read when it is really late and you are very tired. There aren't a lot of hard words so you don't have to think, and you can just read for the fun of it. I also liked this book because I liked the way he creatively dealed with his and others problems. I never would of thought of some of his solutions.I would definately read this book and the other three books before this one in the series because they are classic children's literature.

Especially an inner child with a love for adventure!"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out to find out exactly who he is.

The problem now is that he doesn't believe that his bloodlines are worthy of her. She is a princess after all, and he is but a lowly assistant pig keeper, a orphan that does not know where he really came from. So he sets of with the ever faithful Gurgi as his companion in a quest to find out who he is.We are visited by several old friends from previous books in the series and introduced to a handful of new bad guys. I have to say the bad guys are getting better - or more badder? - as the series progresses and more and more inventive plans are needed to foil their plots.Taran learns much about himself through his journey and learns some very important lessons along the way, with one of the most important being about who he really is. I loved the sorcerer, Morda. It seems all of man's faults are wrapped up quite nicely in one little package. Fflewddur returns with Llyan, such a wonderful friend that manages to save the day at least once. Kaw, the pesky crow shows us that help comes from the least likely places. And of course the faithful Gurgi, the best friend Taran could ever have is along for the ride.I think this will have to be my favorite so far in the series. With just one more left, The High King, I can't wait to see how everything ends.4/5"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"In my opinion, this was the best book in the series by far. I liked how there were kind of different parts to the book - first starting with the three \\"hags\\", then moving on to Doli and his problem, and so on. It was almost like a storybook with different stories in it. I especially liked the part where he was staying at that guy's house.( I forget his name. It was Llonio, I beleive.) This book does not have a lot of action, but I like it because it gives us a chance to get to know Taran better."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran Wanderer is the fourth book in Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. The book is a tale of Taran's journey to find his identity. He hopes to find that he is of noble blood, and thus worthy to ask for the Princess Eilonwy's hand in marriage. With only the perpetually anxious, yet always faithful almost-but-not-quite-human creature Gurgi as his companion, Taran sets off across the length of Prydain in search of answers. Along the way he meets old friends from the earlier books who join him on his quest: Fflewddur Fflam, the bard-king with a habit of embellishing his own bravery and accomplishment; Doli, the bad tempered, yet dutiful dwarf, and Kaw, the talking crow.The friends face many adventures, including a search for lost cattle, battles with a group of bandits, and an escape from an enchanter who has the power to turn men into animals. However, the greatest conflicts that Taran faces are within himself. In a variety of ways, Taran is offered the noble name that would make it easy to marry the princess, but at a cost of losing her respect. In the end, Taran learns more about his true identity than he ever hoped, but in a most unexpected fashion.The book is even more skillfully written than the three previous in the series. Every scene in the book ties tightly together. It makes for an exciting tale and a compelling presentation of the themes that recur throughout the Chronicles. Among these are: that the most valuable things in life are easily overlooked, that a useful and productive peace is more glorious than victory in battle, and that sometimes, the key to finding oneself is to be willing to sacrifice everything."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Things slowed down a bit here from his last book. I would have liked to see more of the conflict with Morda...it just seemed to get resolved too easily. No Eilonwy, either, but I guess she would have hindered the story that Mr. Alexander was trying to tell here. It was more a story of growth for Taran. We'll see what happens in Book 5, The High King."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I just gave this book to my little brother who is addicted to Harry Potter. I wanted him to read older books that have similar styles. This collection was a winner. He read the entire series in 1 month. Its great to see an 11 yr old love reading so much."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain, along with Lord of the Rings, was my introduction to literature and the beginning of my love of reading. I first read Taran Wanderer when I was about 8 years old, and it was by far my favorite. It was about growing up, being a kid, trying to reach adulthood, all in a fast paced fantasy adventure.I have probably read the book fifteen to twenty times since then, and I learn more about myself and what is important to me every time I read it. Forget Narnia, I think this is the best children's book and series I have ever read. I plan to read it to my own children in the future, and I recommend it to any adult now. A superb book."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran Wanderer is also a good book. It was slow at times, but I was always wondering what would come next. Taran sets out on a quest to find out who he is really, and who his parents were. Eilonwy, sadly, is not in this book. This book is much more serious than the others. The highlights of this book are: Two quarreling Cantrev Lords, an evil sorcerer, a man who claims to be Taran's father, and a ruthless wandering rouge named Dorath.I enjoyed this quest thoroughly and suggest you give it a try."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"We're about half way through the book. So far, the first half of the book my wife and I weren't as impressed as we were with the previous books in the series. However, the book is beginning to pick up a bit, and I'm sure we'll ultimately be happy we read it so that we can watch Taran grow."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This was the best and perhaps the most slow books of the series but I absolutely loved it? Who IS Taran?"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This was a good book. But the begining was not very good. It was basicly about going from kingdom to kingdom. The main charcter is Taran. He is a very interesting charcter. He starts on a quest to find his parantage. And he goes through mountains, castles, swamps and even caves. The biggest conflict comes into place when he meets Dorath. Dorath is a meen charcter who is part of a group of \\"hired swords\\". He treis to convince Taran to hire them but he doesnt so he becomes a enemy of Taran. He challenges Taran for his sword and a few other items that dont matter. But he wins and take sthe sword for his own. Taran has a grudge on him until he fights him again and defeats him by breaking his sword. Taran also faces a wizard who turned his freinfd Dolly in to a frog. Taran defeats the wizard and he turns Dolly back into a dwarf."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"The Prydain series takes a turn for the introspective with this particular book in the series. Throughout the series our hero, Taran, has been sort of an everyboy. He's never physically described in the books, a fact I've always ascribed to the notion that the guys reading the books can picture him as themselves. Up until \\"Taran Wanderer\\", the boy's been alternately foolish and brave. In this particular adventure, however, author Lloyd Alexander decides to do an old fashioned boy-learning-to-be-a-man storyline. Though the writing is fairly fine, in the end this stands as probably one of the weaker books in the Prydain series.As the book opens, we see Taran attempting to come to grips with two things. On the one hand, he has decided that he loves Eilonwy. On the other hand, he wants to know who he parents are. Unfortunately for the reader, Eilonwy remains in this story only as a pretty memory in Taran's mind. She never actually appears in the narrative. That leaves the parentage quest. Taran has decided that he is probably descended from noble lineage. Now, you might think this to be a pretty egotistical idea on Taran's part. But when you consider that roughly 50% of the people Taran comes into contact with in his adventures are either kings, princesses, or princes, it's not that crazy a notion. This series is rife with royalty. Setting off away from his beloved Caer Dalben with the faithful Gurgi in tow, Taran goes to find his destiny. What he finds instead is who he is as a person.As I mentioned before, Eilonwy is missing from this book, and this is a serious failing. With Taran lovestruck and doe-eyed, the girl's caustic wit and good sense are sorely lacking. We get plenty of adorable Gurgi and funny Fflewddur and even a bit of Dolbi, but Eilonwy's space cannot be filled. The fact of the matter is, she always used to temper Taran's melodramatic musings and monologues. With her gone, Taran launches into huge bouts of self-pity and depression without respite. Other small flaws concern the finish of the tale. Though the ending is meant to give the reader an important, rather than easy, finale, it comes off as slightly disappointing. That's the problem with a book that's supposed to be \\"meaningful\\". If you haven't a good sense of humor and ability to laugh at yourself, what good are you to the reader? Taran's so doggone EARNEST all the time. You just wanna slap the little guy and tell him to lighten up. I'm sure Eilonwy would. If she were around.Though the action and swashbuckling abound in this tale, it's not the same. I was disappointed in this particular installment. I'm certain it has its admirers, and certainly it's a fine book. The fact that it doesn't live up to its fellow books in the series doesn't mean it isn't worthy reading. Just don't expect to be blown away."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Pig boy has status envy and the horn.So, not thinking he can do a princess he goes off instead, and has some magical animal stuff happen again, this time, in the form of a cow.

Magic potions, friend saving and wizard waxing are also to be found here."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Loydd Alexander is a wonderful writer, however this book is by far the worst in the series. The main charactor Tarran looks for his realatives to find if he is of noble birth. All in all this book was strange and had little plot developement and action."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"There will be some who will turn away from this book because they feel from the description that it's \\"another of those sci-fi books.\\" It's not. Based loosely on Welsh legends, Taran Wanderer is a book for young minds and young hearts, no matter how old they may be chronologically. Like many of us, Taran wanders through life, searching for who he really is. Unlike many of us, in this book, he actually finds out. If you are a wanderer, seize this series of books. Read the first three, just to get to this one, and then read The High King to see how it all turns out. Learn from this book.....and wander no more."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"In this volume Taran decides to search for his heritage. Taran finds his way hard due to his desire to have noble blood (in order to marry Eilonwy who is, after all, a princess). He has to face his fears, prejudices and the prejudices of others before he finds the truth. Of course, truth is relative and Taran doesn't get a totally satisfying answer.My favorite part of this book are Taran's interactions with the Free Commots, people at ease with themselves and each other, who allow Taran to be whoever/whatever he wants to be.In Wanderer, Taran becomes a man, leaving behind most of his more childish ways. He finally returns home to Caer Dallben just in time to join in the final push against Arawn."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This is the best of the Prydain Chronicles. It clearly shows how Taran matures from a stubborn boy into a thoughtful, courageous young man. The lessons he learns are full of truth for all people, but the book never preaches. It is full of common sense, humor, and good writing, and has plenty of action and mystery to counterbalance Taran's soul-searching. It is on a par with epics such as the Fellowship of the Ring. Read it."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"The purpose of this book (hopefully I'm not giving away too much of the story here) is basically to further develop the main protagonist's (that'd Taran of Caer Dallben) character before sending him off to the grand finale in the 5th and last book of the series (The High King). I believe I read somewhere that this was actually written AFTER Lloyd Alexander finished a complete draft of The High King, and then he wrote this because he decided Taran's character needed some more development. This story takes longer to get through than any other, which is not a big deal for me today, but the first time I read this series when I was maybe 13 (which is really a LOT closer to the audience I suspect Lloyd Alexander had in mind when he wrote the Chronicles of Prydain series), it felt really long. Anyway, aside from the relative length (which is both a good and bad thing), this book has the same strengths and weaknesses as all the series: The weakness is the plot is a bit contrived compared to the very best fantasy novels I've ever read (Tolkien), though I've certainly read fantasy books with bigger plot holes as well, and the plot here is probably tighter than in any of the other books in this series. In contrast, even though these are relatively short books that were probably aimed for kids in middle school, the main characters have depth, staying power, and evolve through each book, and there are basic moral themes present throughout every book (for example power leads to temptation and corruption) that seem even more relevant to me now nearly 20 years after I had to read &#34;The Book of Three&#34; in school. Highly recommended for anyone in the target audience, and still a decent (if short) read for an adult."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I think this is probably my favorite book in the Prydain series. It is the book in which Taran grows from a boy to a man, in a much more real sense than in any of the prior novels. The sequence at the end when he journeys through the Free Commots are some of my favorite passages in fantasy literature, because of the real attraction you can feel Taran feels to the various crafts."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I've have loved the Chronicles of Prydain series since I was a kid in the 1980s. All the books are wonderful, but Taran Wanderer has always been my favorite. It has a different tone than the other books. In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out on his own to discover what he should do with his life. There is something noble, profound, and a little lonely, about this kid wandering around on his own, with only his horse and Gurgi, trying to figure out what type of man he should become. This book is more thoughtful and moving than the other books, and sets the scene for the big finale in The High King."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"The fourth book in the Chronicles of Prydain finds the hero Taran in a state of frustration. In the last book, he discovered his love for Eilonwy. She is now far away on the island of Mona learning to be a princess. He'd like to marry her but he does not know who his parents are. He fears he will be unworthy of her hand if he is lowly born. He sets off to discover whether he has noble or peasant blood in his veins. Thus Taran, assistant pig-keeper, is transformed into Taran Wanderer. He soon finds out that the Mirror of Llunet (forgotten somewhere in the Cantrevs countryside) reveals one's true identity. He hopes to discover a royal origin so he can marry the princess. But he will have many adventures on his way.The book moves at a brisk pace from adventure to adventure, slowly building up Taran's character as he learns much more about the world he lives in and consequently about himself. The descriptions are delightful even if some of the names seem unpronounceable. The ending is satisfying except for one hanging plot thread which I hope is resolved in the final book, The High King. I was going to read something else in between but now I'm continuing on to the next volume."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This was still a very good story because it is involved with the famous classic Chronicles of Prydain, but the main reason why I did not like this as much as the other books mainly was like the reason for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In the story line, there was just too much traveling for one person to contain, as Taran looks around the entire realm to find out who he really is and who his parents were. This was altogether a good story, but not as much action to keep me in suspense. But I still recommend this if you can tolerate long traveling chapters."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"The book was written in the late sixties for children to be read (that is: not to be interpreted by film makers). The language is very well suited for this purpose.I read the 5 books that make up the Chronicles of Prydain in the late seventies, then read then to my sons in the late eighties, then had then in my elementary class in the nineties. If all the children had to mark these Lloyd Alexanden works, I'm sure they would give it top marks - so much so, that one of the five got 'lost' in my class: Taran Wanderer.Now I've got Taran back, and the book is still very readable. The quest is as big as any other fantasy book, but the humour that shines through is greater, the moods more subtle. Alexander once said (Author's note in The Castle of Llyr) that \\"The nature of fantasy allows happenings which reveal most clearly our own frailties and our own strengths. The inhabitants of Prydain are fantasy figures: I hope they are also human\\".If you measure how real people are by the times they crop up in idle chit-chat in your family, Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur Fflam are as alive now as they were when I started reading their story to my sons 30 years ago.I suggest you and your (grand)children enjoy all five books:- The Book of Three- The Black Cauldron- The Castlde of Llyr- Taram Wanderer- The High King"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This is my favorite book in The Prydain Chronicles! Alexander dedicates it to \\"For Wanderers still journeying, for Wanderers still at rest.\\" More than any of the other books, this one makes me think of The Wizard of Oz with its routine introduction of new characters and settings. In this way, Alexander has found an ideal way to introduce readers to the varied landscapes of Prydain. Herein, you cannot help but fail to appreciate Alexander's ease in handling descriptions.Cantrev Cadiffor: \\"The countryside had long since changed from gray moors to green meadows and pleasantly wooded lands with farmholds nestled in the clearings.\\"Caer Cadarn: \\"Unlike the palisaded strongholds of the cantrev lords, Smoit's castle was a fortress with halls of hewn stone and iron-studded gates thick enough to withstand all attack.\\"Hill Cantrevs: \\" The farmstead Taran saw to be a stumble down cottage, whose walls of stone, delved from the surrounding fields, had partly fallen away.... In the midst of the high summits, hemmed in closely by thorny brush and scrub, the farm stood lorn and desolate.\\"Free Commots: \\"This was the land of the free commots, of cottages clustering in loose circles, rimmed by cultivating fields and pastures.\\"The place Taran most seeks however is the Mirror of Llunet, which can be found in the Llawgadarn. The significance of Its description, which I won't reveal here, lies in what it reveals to Taran.Like Dorothy, who in The Wizard of Oz seeks a way home, Taran wanders in search of his identity. Taran hopes to find that he is of a royal lineage, so that he might propose to Eilonwy whom he deeply loves. While seeking his lineage, he learns many truths:* The secret of luck is to sharpen one's wit to use what falls into one's hands.* Life is a forge. Metal is worthless till it's shaped and tempered.* One's lives and days intertwine; Wise is he who can see the pattern.* Nothing is ever lost, but comes back in one shape or another.The most important truth, which I won't reveal here, lies in what the Mirror of Llunet tells Taran about his parentage. When upon meeting the herdsman Craddoc, Taran learns that he might have finally found his father. What will his reaction reveal about Taran as a person? To find out, you must travel along with Taran on his journey in Taran Wanderer."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This is a replacement. I don't remember if it was used or new when it arrived. Lloyd Alexander books get snapped up and passed around in our house. It doesn't look new any more."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"\\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a bit of a different take for Lloyd Alexander as he continues the \\"Chronicles of Prydain.\\" Unlike the action stories featured in earlier volumes, Alexander presents a story more focused on character growth and familiar faces from the previous books either do not appear or play a much smaller role in this book. Taran grows a great deal in this story and Alexander shows more of the land of Prydain than he does in the earlier books--including a touching look at farmers and other people looking to etch out a living even in the shadow of epic conflict. It's an angle often overlooked by fantasy writers. There is much wisdom here and Alexander does a wonderful job of making his points in a subtle manner. It's certainly different than the other books in the series--and some readers, especially younger ones may grow weary of it. Nonetheless, this is book is ideal for most young fantasy readers."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Besides being one of the best children's books ever, this book is also part of a great 5 book series. I read this book aloud to all my children, now that my children are adults reading this series is almost a requirement for their spouses in order to be part of our family! A requirement their spouses fulfilled with pleasure, I might add. Besides the basis in Welsh mythology, I feel that the theme of the series is Taran's search for identity as he slowly learns, with mistakes along the way, what it means to be an adult of value in the world. Though Eilonwy isn't in this book, she is a good, strong role model for girls throughout this series as well and does have \\"her own\\" book in The Castle of Llyr. I cannot recommend this book, or the Chronicles of Prydain series, enough."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Finally, books I remember enjoying as a kid that still stand up to re-reading as an adult!They are sometimes described as coming-of-age stories, and that is true in the best sense of the term. Alexander is deeply concerned with growing up, and he examines many of its central, deepest, and most profound aspects, such as discovering one's personal identity, and responsibility. Each book in the series looks at these themes in different ways and builds on them a little more. My favorite in the series, Taran Wanderer (which I had expected to enjoy the least), deals with these issues so simply and directly that it acquires an almost allegorical quality. He teaches many important life lessons that are every bit as relevant to us grown-ups as to young adolescents just beginning to struggle with these issues. And he does so through engaging stories and a memorable cast of characters. From now on, whenever I find myself in a situation that tests my courage or integrity, all I have to do is think to myself, \\"A Fflam never falters!\\"Some people like to complain about the supposed similarities between these books and those of Tolkein, but apart from some basic structural features stemming from their common mythological roots, there really isn't a lot of similarity in the details. Even in the most obviously similar part---the ending---what is really interesting is how it differs. I can't say much without giving it away, but let's just say that Alexander, to his credit, ultimately says almost the exact opposite of Tolkein. No, Alexander's fantasy world isn't as complex and well-developed as Tolkein's, but these books were written for a younger audience, and let's face it, nobody can stand up to a comparison with Tolkein as far as that goes. I think if people, of whatever age, take these books on their own terms, they will find them to be a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Like many of the best children's authors, Lloyd Alexander created a fictional universe to teach his readers how to understand and live in the real world. His Prydain books are fantasy for kids, but full of the introspection of a thoughtful adult. All the books have nice moments, but some of the best writing in the series comes in the second half of TARAN WANDERER (the fourth book). Taran, an orphan who wants to be a hero, wanders through Prydain (based on medieval Wales) to find information about his parentage and meets an aging shepherd who is struggling on an unproductive mountain farm. The shepherd claims he is Taran's father, hoping that Taran will stay and work, which he does. When the shepherd dies, he reveals that he is not his father. Taran is first happy, then ashamed for wanting to be free and for being embarrassed to claim the poor working man as his father. Taran decides he is not worthy to return home and journeys on through poor counties, meeting a blacksmith who offers to apprentice him (I know I'm over-explaining why I love this book, but hear me out). After toiling at the smithy, he meets a weaver and, thinking that weaving is woman's work and probably easier, offers to work for her. After a month of cleaning wool and operating a loom, he knows better. Then there's an interlude where he stays with a fisherman, who tells him that life is a river and you have to be ready to grab things when they come to you (very true). Finally, in a moving chapter, he meets a famous potter and asks to learn his trade. The potter tells him he can learn the craft but maybe not the art, and Taran eventually learns he is right. Then robbers who have been pursuing Taran (and who represent the destructive element in all societies) kill the potter and burn the county where Taran is living, so he leads them away and finally reaches his destination, a pool which is supposedly magic and will answer the question of who he is. He looks in the pool and sees himself, changed by the people he has met and the work he's learned to do. The robber stomps in the pool and kicks the water out, but Taran has found what he wanted to know."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This one stands apart from the other books in the series, as it has far less action and far more character development.I read it something like 12 years ago and still remember most of the plot!"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"So, in the last book, we had one person get taught their station in life, in this one, we have another go searching for their station in life.

I look forward to one day sharing these tales with my children."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"While most of the Chronicles of Prydain follow the traditional fantasy style of epic adventure, the fourth book, Taran Wanderer, takes a journey into the realm of self-discovery instead. The result is not only another amazing entry in Lloyd Alexander's classic series, but also one of the best fantasy novels ever written.Taran Wanderer again follows the journey of the assistant pig-keeper Taran as he seeks to find his place in the world. Except for Gurgi, most of his adventuring companions are absent for this journey. Fflewdur Fflam and Doli only make short appearances, and Eilonwy is absent entirely - indeed, it is because of the distant princess that Taran undertakes his latest adventure in the first place. The lack of a slarge supporting case allows Taran to really grow as he seeks his true parentage and learns that it takes more than swordplay to make a man.Taran Wanderer does not have one epic storyline to tie the book together, but instead is a series of minor adventures that each help Taran learn more about himself. While Taran has matured bit by bit throughout the series, this book is the one that will finally turn him into a man. His adventure is humorous at times and heartbreaking at others. Overall, this novel represents one of the best character-driven narratives in the entire fantasy genre. Whether you are familiar with the Chronicles of Prydain or not, you should definitely give this story a read."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"A friend loaned me her copies of this series.

I had long since lost the books and had forgotten that they even existed. And then one day I saw &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; on sale for 25 cents at a Garage Sale. Right away my mind jumped back to my youth. Needless, to say I bought the book as well as the complete set. Now that I am an adult I am amazed at how inspiring the books are. There is so much behind the words written in these books and I am grateful that I took the time to re-read them 15 years later! I think the idea of Taran searching for his history is reflective of many things in the lives of all people - young and old! There is a magic to these pages that I hope will not become a rarity in books written by todays authors. Alexander doesn't write books, he creates visions. I'm just glad that he decided to share his visions with many others."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran Wanderer, the fourth book of the Prydain chronicles, is, in my opinion, the best book in a wonderful series.All four books focus on the character of Taran of Caer Dallben, an orphan who is raised by a wizard (Dallben). The plot of Taran Wanderer focuses on Taran's quest to find out who his parents were. Taran hopes that he will find that he has the &quot;noble&quot; blood that he believes would give him the right to ask the Princess Eilonwy to wed him.Needless to say, he does not have an easy time, wandering the length and breadth of Prydain searching for parents he does not know, who can barely remember him.The book's joy, however, does not lie only in its plot, but also in the development that Taran undergoes through the course of the book. In Taran Wanderer, more than any other book, Taran grows into manhood. The trials he passes through temper and shape him, as he journeys through both familiar and strange lands. His experiences teach him lessons, but he learns even more from the people he meets.Make no mistake. This is not a pure novel of character. Taran travels from one end of Prydain to the other, meeting kings and wizards, and also farmers and tradesmen. Along the way, he has many adventures and faces many hardships. As said earlier though, the solid plot is not the highlight of this book. The characters are. The myriad of people Taran meets in his travels provides a welcome break from the pattern of the other Prydain chronicles, where almost everyone seems to be either a king, a bard, or a magician (or some combination of the three). After so many books walking the heights, Taran finally returns to earth.For those who have read the earlier books, you will see many familiar faces, including faithful Gurgi, the (not quite) bard Fflewddur Fflam, King Smoit, and even three old friends from the Marshes of Morva. You'll also be intrigued by new characters, some of whom have had hidden influences on characters you already know. And through it all, the beautiful tapestry of plot that Lloyd Alexander has woven will captivate you.Taran Wanderer is a great book. I recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"This book is definitely the most unique of all the Prydain Chronicles. Instead of urgent quests to find magical pigs, destroy evil cauldrons or rescue a beautiful princess--with good constantly pitted against the forces of evil--this volume is instead focused on Taran finding out about himself.Instead of a quest resolved in a matter of weeks or months, this story covers a couple of years, years in which Taran travels from one end of Prydain to the other, first in search of his parents and then in search of his own place in the race of men.His motivation lies in a desire to be worthy of the Princess Eilonwy's hand in marriage; she's absent from the story, still on the Isle of Mona, so Taran's only constant companion is the loyal creature Gurgi.Old friends Fflewddur and Doli make brief appearances, though the bulk of Taran's time is spent meeting new people: the old farmer Aeddan and his wife, who fight for survival on a land impoverished by the Death-Lord Arawn; Goryon and Gast, petty lords whose bark is worse than their bite; Morda, the enchanter who despises the race of men in its entirety; the outlaw Dorath and his men; the shepherd Craddoc; and the people of the Free Commots: Llonio the lucky, Hevydd the smith, Dwyvach the weaver, Annlaw the potter, and Llassar the farm boy.The lessons Taran learns in his travels aren't always obvious or profound for the casual reader, and the limited amount of swords, sorcery and peril may be unusual for some. However, the transition Taran makes into manhood is handled convincingly and realistically with each step he takes."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran, who we met as a boy in The Book of Three and whose splendid adventures we breathlessly followed in The Black Cauldron and The Castle of Llyr, decides to find himself and his past in the fourth marvelous Prydain Chronicle by gifted storyweaver Lloyd Alexander. An orphan raised by the wise Dallben, he has none of the history and connections that come from parents and family. Now, he off alone to find some answers - hopefully noble ones - so he can be \\"worthy\\" of his royal love.If you're like me, you didn't love Taran automatically - he could occasionally be sullen, petty, and prickly during his \\"growing up\\" phases in Books 1 to 3 (necessitating Eilonwy's great put-downs and quips). Continuing his growth, Taran Wanderer marks his first journey into adulthood. This is the one where my respect for this character solidified and I really began to care for him. This is the least \\"heroic\\" of the books, and yet, I believe this is one where Taran is most admirable.He explores the land he has been fighting for by connecting to the common people as well as kings and wizards. We are introduced to more excellent characters (besides some old ones) and a deeper understanding of Prydain with the intricate ties that bind all of them together. On a quest for the Mirror of Llunet, Taran roams old and new territory from the Marshes to the Free Commots doing everything from making pottery to facing off against kingly challenges. The change is how he sees the world, with its ugliness and beauty, as he searches for his place in it. Along the way, he learns about himself: humbly, intelligently, honestly, and courageously.As it closely builds on the last book in particular, and is in general an evolution of his maturity, reading the books in order is strongly recommended. (Considering how wonderful the others are, this is no chore.) It's a relatively quiet book compared to the rousing chases of the previous ones, but Taran Wanderer is ultimately more powerful and moving."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran Wanderer was not given the Newbery Award like it's successor The High King; nor was it awarded a Newbery Honor medal such as it's predecessor The Black Cauldron. However, Taran Wanderer is the most complete book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Lloyd Alexander deftly tells the tale of Taran's quest to find his parentage in hopes of being decendant from noble blood. Gurgi, Taran's faithful sidekick journeys with him through far off parts of Prydain. Along the way, old friends and faces reappear such as Fflewwder Fflamm the bard/king, Doli of the fair folk, Kaw his hijinxing bird, Llyan the giant cat who Fflewwder now rides as his mount and King Smoit whose army rescued Taran and his companions at the end of The Black Cauldron. Taran's journey to find himself takes him to a number of different trades such as metallurgy, weaving, farming and pottery. He also meets his fair share of adventure and enchantment along the way. At 254 pages Taran Wanderer is the longest book in the series but it reads the fastest because there is so much action and uncertainty in what Taran will finally find out about himself. The Chronicles of Prydain still stand as some of the greatest fantasy stories ever written and Taran Wanderer is the BEST book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Unlike many of the older readers reviewing the Prydain chronicle, I have never stopped reading them. The series was almost permanently taken out in my name from the childrens' library in town for about five years, from second or third grade on. Finally I broke down and bought paperback copies of all five, which are now dogeared and mangled, the biding broken. Not from mistreatment; from my sheer love of the books. These are the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of books for me; I've read them countless, countless times.While all five books are excellent in their own personal way, Taran Wanderer, I believe, is my favorite. It didn't used to be; as a child I liked The High King, which was admittedly more action packed. I think the switch came around adolescence; Taran Wanderer was then less a boring filler between books and more a boy's journey to adulthood and to find himself. Somewhere along the line I began to appreciate this for what it was, and what the other books, though infinitely wonderful, were not. There is subtle poignancy in Taran's friendship with Gurgi, mediation between Gast and Goryon, attempts to peaceably deal with Dorath, and most of all his finding of value and nobility in even the common folk of the Free Commots, where he proves to himself that he doesn't necessarily have to be a hero to be a man.You don't have to have gone through adolescence to appreciate the beauty of this book. Maybe not the most action-packed of the Prydain chronicles, or the most climactic, but so much more than filler: literary wonder."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"I read it at six. I read it at sixteen. I read it at twenty-six. I read it at home. I read it wandering. At all times and all places, I have identified with Taran Wanderer more than any other literary character. I'm not excluding Shakespeare, the classics or modern novels.Taran is a boy trying to become a human (it applies to girls just as much.) This is the beginning of all great mythology, as the late Joseph Campbell would have agreed. This boy travels through a world of magic swords, undead warriors and medieval villages. It is an escape. Or is it? Taran deals with truth, the true worth of himself and others, the search for meaning in a career and in life, the excitement and high price of violence and love. I AM Taran in 1997, as much as he is in an imaginary world. I bet a lot of you are, too.Alexander never talks down to you, whether you are young or old. It is fun and meaningful. This fourth book of a wonderful five-book series is an excellent encapsulation of the entire series. This is not a book for adults or children. It is a book for people. A great one."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"Taran Wanderer is perhaps the most personal of all the Prydain Chronicles, as the story focuses on Taran searching for his lineage. Taran is an orphan, raised by the wizard Dallben, and he wondered for a long time who his parents really were. Now he has an intense urge to find out if he is of noble line, because he wants to marry Eilonwy, enchantress and princess of Llyr. Of course he didn't tell her his feelings, as he is not sure that he worthy to ask and also because Eilonwy is not in Prydain throughout the story of Taran Wanderer. As a result, this Chronicle has a distinct feel from the other Chronicles. Taran roams around Prydain, looking for clues and having his own personal adventures, and the book really shows that he is clever and intelligent. There's a part that ties the third Chronicle in very good with this one. Taran finds out many different things about himself, but what he set out to look for yields surpising results. A good book, but a bit slower than the others in the series. It has many life lessons though, and it's still interesting despite not having large battles; it has personel encounters and small skirmishes. However, Lloyd Alexander more than makes up for that in the last Chronicle, The High King."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"In essence, the entirety of the Prydain Chronicles is a journey, Taran's journey from boyhood to manhood. Well, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; traversed a mile of the journey with a single bound.After &quot;Castle of Llyr,&quot; we know that Taran is pretty obviously bonkers-in-love with Eilonwy, but since he's an Assistant Pig-Keeper and a Princess, he doesn't plan to ask her until he can discern who he is, in terms of rank and birth (she'd probably think he was nuts to think this, and make some amusing comparison, but she sadly doesn't appear in person in this one--warning to Eilonwy fans).Taran first travels to the Marsh of Morva to ask for advice, then sets out on his journey with Gurgi, who shows the levels of his faithfulness in this story. He comes face-to-face with amorality, selfishness, greed, and various other human failings. But Taran manages to handle them all with grace and wisdom...... until he meets a crippled shepherd who might just be his father.After he meets the shepherd, Taran's journey becomes far more mature. He is forced to face his own failings and his own beliefs about whether he would be worthy for Eilonwy, as he tries to change his life. Is Taran a prince? Or a prince among men? And which matters more?Such favorites as King Smoit (a personal fave of mine--his last scene with Taran is wonderful), Doli of the Fair Folk, and Fflewddur Fflam appear in this book, but it's really Taran's story, with a good dose of Gurgi thrown in.This takes all but one step toward adulthood--the last step is taken in &quot;High King.&quot; Taran is one of the most unique and sometimes haunted heroes in fantasy literature, for children or adults. His journey of self-discovery is amazing, truly amazing.Why this book never won a Newbery is beyond me--it doesn't have a lot of swords clashing or involved battles. It's a journey of the heart, and possibly one of the finest books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer: The Prydain Chronicles, Book 4","review":"As a child, the Chronicles of Prydain were among my favourite books. One summer, between 5th and 6th grade, I read each book of the series over and over again, perhaps 8 times each...except for this one. Taran Wanderer, I could only read once. Although I love all the books in the series, this is the one that has bore a hole in my heart.At the age of 11, when I read these books, I felt much pressure to grow up and become \\"a young lady,\\" but I wanted to remain a child forever. Reading of Taran's powerful and painful transformation from a young person to a bonafide adult was \\"proof\\" for me that life beyond childhood was abhorent.Over the years, I had no choice but to grow up, and the memory of Taran's journey always guided me."},{"Title":"Architects of the Web: 1,000 Days that Built the Future of Business","review":"This book is a revisionist history which attempts to give the credit for the development of the web to businessmen, and almost completely ignores the people who actually designed the architecture of the web. Even Tim Berners-Lee gets only a token mention; and Ted Nelson, who invented hypertext, multimedia and &quot;linking&quot;, is completely ignored.The first chapter tries to credit Netscape with the invention of the web, and pretends that they lead the development of HTML. The truth, of course, is that Netscape has never managed to fully implement any of the HTML standards, let alone improve on them. Most of the HTML &quot;improvements&quot; thought of as Netscape's were defined in HTML 3.0 long before Netscape implemented them via gratuitously incompatible tags.As the book goes on it gets even worse. CNET and HotWired as architects of the web? Yeah, right, and I suppose the Psychic Friends Network invented the telephone? I'll be generous, and assume that this book happened because some poor soul started believing the nonsense Internet companies put out in their press releases. The alternative is that it's a deliberate attempt to re-write history. Unfortunately, judging from the 'professional' reviews there must be plenty of suckers who actually do think CNET and WIRED magazine invented the web.

Written as if Microsoft is a dark malevolent force (which is how it is obviously perceived from the other side), this book goes too far in trying to canonize the newcomers. While many recent books have been written from the &quot; MS is great&quot; side, this counter view can be interesting, but takes many cheap shots. The hardest part of reading this is the horrible editing. You realize that you are noticing constant typos, grammar and layout problems as you go.In many cases, it looks like a quick spell check was done on dictated text as same sounding words show up totally out of context in their other spelling.

But it's actually more compelling to read in light of all that has transpired since."},{"Title":"Architects of the Web: 1,000 Days that Built the Future of Business","review":"Robert Reid dives into the history that created the web as we know it today, for the internet in 1994 and even earlier was nothing like what it has grown to become. Little things that we take for granted were months of turmoil and hard work for these architects.Reid highlights eight of the main people that were responsible for the internet's creation:1. Marc Andreessen2. Rob Glaser3. Kim Polese4. Mark Pesce5. Ariel Poler6. Jerry Yang7. Andrew Anker8. Halsey MinorGiving each one of these people their own chapter, he also follows the company (or companies) that they worked for during the 1,000 days and sometimes the years before. Although it took hundreds if not thousands of people, from hackers to marketers to create the web, it is these people that had the first ideas on what the internet could do as a product and technology.Within his narrative Reid tells of the rise and what could be fall of many of these companies, for it was written in 1997, shortly after the events in the book actually took place. This leaves many endings to each chapter very vague on what happens and what the technologies could become. In many of his hypotheses he seems to be telling of the technologies that we have today.In Marc Andreessen's chapter it goes over the rise of the Netscape browser. He first started making browsers at NCSA, there he created Mosaic which was very crash prone yet it was still the best browser that anyone had created at the time. Soon he found himself creating Netscape Communication Corporation where they made a browser (Netscape) that was 1000 times faster than the first even though it was less than a year since the first browser. But sadly it was Microsoft that slowly made its way into the browser world and used its OS domination to make Internet Explorer \\"freer\\" than Netscape, but not necessarily better.Another great example that Reid goes over is Jerry Yang who was one of the co-founders of Yahoo with Dave Filo. The two of them alone created the system for Yahoo searches which innovated themselves from other people by not using \\"spiders\\" (spiders being automated programs that scan websites to see the content and thus make it so searches will go to the site) but instead using categories to search for websites on the internet. They used this very simple and very different type of searching to get hundreds of thousands of people to visit their site and then get advertisers to pay for banners which had been first used by [...] only months before.[...] was the baby of Andrew Anker, who did not create it but was the CEO of the internet side of this company. It was the sister company of Wired Magazine, which was created some years before. Although they were \\"sister\\" companies that actually did not share articles, as both used information to invite people to their website or their magazine, they were both very anti-shovelware. Shovelware is the action of taking some kind of product and bringing it to another medium. These and many other examples showed the true amount of work that people had to go through to make computers and the internet into the mega media that it is today.This book is crammed with information on these people and many others that had a huge impact in the internet. Though it is very informative it does become too much information at some points and a very slow read as a result of the technicality of the subject matter. This may be due to the fact that in these 1,000 days so much had happened in this area that there was really no other way of writing and showing this technical information.In conclusion this was a great read that had tons of knowledge despite being obsolete at this point, technologically speaking."},{"Title":"Architects of the Web: 1,000 Days that Built the Future of Business","review":"Reid wrote a book that covered many of the industries luminaries including Jerry Yang and Marc Andreessen and other forgotten people like Mark Pesce who dreamed too far ahead of the kerb.The book dates better than business potraits because it allows insight into the creators of some of the webs cornerstones like Java and Yahoo! before the corporate comms people managed to use a PR backhoe loader to dump in excessive messaging, spin and massaging the annals of history."},{"Title":"Architects of the Web: 1,000 Days that Built the Future of Business","review":"You learn about the web; what it is and where itmight be going.

Yuri Rabbinski, Henryk Nielsen, Ari Luotenon, Roy Fielding and so on.Not only does the book ignore these people the ommission is delinerate.

And yet I had to because this is one entertaining read about an equally entertaining subject.First here is a word about the book. If you enjoy the use of arcane expressions (tergiversation is an examples), liberal use of French and Latin, and unexplained abbreviations (CIGS (Chief of the Imperial General Staff ) is an example) this book will entertain you mightily. I found myself storming my dictionary and the Internet for help with the vernacular. It had many colorful expressions like 'This stork had Style.' It made the read a great deal longer than I am used to for 250ish pages. I didn't mind it terribly because I enjoyed the book. I could have enjoyed it the same without the speculation about the lurid details of his failed marriage, his disappearance from his duties during a WW1 battle and desire to see his ladies attired 'just so'.Finally about BLH. He was a military historian and strategist that rose from the ashes of the Great War. He was an innovator (guilty of a bit of measurable theft). He wrote biographies of military leaders that had an ulterior purpose that lent to a biased rendering of the biography (see my review of Scipio Africanus). He had the ear of the highest levels of the British Military and a few devotees among the Nazi generals. He was a warrior that came to despise war. Later biographers implied that he was unwilling to recognize the &quot;naked reality of evil&quot; after he published flattering accounts of his meetings with Nazi generals. In that way he reminds me of current public figures that would treat organized terrorism as a law enforcement problem to be resolved judicially."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers","review":"I lived in Waco when these murders happened.

The writing itself is excellent and the details are outstanding. Truman Simons must certainly be the most dedicated investigator to ever work a murder scene and his dogged dedication alone resulted in finding the murderers and punishing them accordingly. The book was especially intriguing with psychics, one that told the police many &quot;sightings&quot; she had that were right on the mark most of the time. This book is so well written that the pain the victim's families felt from losing their children will haunt you for a long time. I promise this is one crime book that you will read repeatedly.

The final chapter summarizes the main points of each prior chapter. Given the variety of subjects and classroom dynamics that professors work with, McGlynn does an admirable job of offering a variety of suggestions on any given topic. That way, even if certain suggestions aren't very applicable to a given professor's situation, others are more likely to be. My guess is that chapters one and four will be most beneficial to all teachers regardless of their subject matter or classroom size.Now, for a few of the shortcomings. First, although there is likely some merit to the section, \\"The Chilly Classroom Climate\\" in chapter three, I think she gets a bit too politically correct here. For better or worse, students and professors alike will always have their biases which will affect the learning environment. Fortunately, as McGlynn herself notes, the suggestions she gives are more about enhancing the learning environment for all students than they are about accommodating \\"outsider\\" groups. Also, some of the \\"get to know you\\" exercises in chapter two strike me as a bit goofy for certain classes. For example, if you're teaching a calculus or astronomy class, does it really matter that you find out who in the class likes chocolate, is Jewish, has a twin, was born outside the U.S., etc? Probably not. However, if one is teaching a sociology or social psychology class, this might be helpful. In short, the generality of the book is at the same time one of its main strengths and one of its (rather excusable) weaknesses.Successful Beginnings for College Teaching is by no means the last word on how to be a good teacher, but I doubt the author ever intended it to be. On the other hand, it offers useful suggestions on a variety of relevant topics. As such, it makes a good primer for young professors and a good refresher (or maybe even a renovator) for \\"old pros\\"."},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"I'm sorry that this book wasn't available when I first started teaching. This book is such a valuable resource and guide to making all the right moves in preparing for and meeting students for the first time. Faculty in colleges are often isolated, and practical issues are rarely discussed, so &quot;Successful Beginnings&quot; goes a long way to rectify that situation. There is such a nice balance between theory and practical suggestions that experienced faculty will also find this book immediately helpful. Most importantly, Professor McGlynn takes readers beyond the beginnngs of courses to proven methods of effective classroom teaching and course management. She has a wonderful section on concluding courses in meaningful ways, and I plan to use some of her techniques myself at the end of this semester.If I were an administrator at a college, I would make sure that I got this book into the hands of every new faculty member, full-time or adjunct!"},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"I loved this book and felt so energized to get into my classroom and start using some of the wonderful techniques I learned from the book.

She provides great information for breaking the ice the first day and then for ways to get the students to be active and engaged in class throughout the semester. Experienced and new teachers will get so much out of this book!"},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"Last night I taught my first-ever college class and used two of the several techniques from the book. Particularly, I used one of the name games to remember the students names, and after just one class I have every name committed to memory. I also used one of the student bonding excercies -- the \\"things in common\\" game -- and it actually worked too well. The class went from being distant to very wound-up, but it was all good."},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"Angela Provitera McGlynn's book \\"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching: Engaging Your Students from the First Day\\" is a useful resource for any question that a college professor or instructor could have about the first week of class. Provitera McGlynn has pulled together tips and research from many sources in order to provide the reader with the information they need to create a safe space for the learner and a positive work environment for the instructor. She has sections on diversity, the \\"impostor's syndrome,\\" classroom management, ice breakers, how to conduct class discussions, dealing with incivility, promoting study skills, receiving feedback, and even how to finish the semester strong! In addition to providing lots of information, it's all presented in a convenient, easy-to-read format that was written with the busy academic in mind.The only drawback to this book is that some of the ideas are not substantiated with cited research, although when this is the case it likely wouldn't be hard to find a citation backing up the suggestion. I'm also a little disappointed with how hurriedly some topics were treated (e.g., some types of incivility get just a page), but in a slim paperback that sort of thing is to be expected. Certainly, both of these drawbacks are minor compared to all the benefits that the book offers."},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"I am finding this book very useful as a new instructor! Easy to read and useable info. Author seems very knowledgeable."},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"I was amazed at how much good advice McGlynn packed into such a short book! I read it in one sitting, and constantly found myself saying, &quot;yes, that's right,&quot; or &quot;ok, I'll try that.&quot; She not only describes techniques that work for creating a more active learning environment in the classroom, but also (implicitly) explains why they work. To be sure, this is not an &quot;academic book&quot; in the sense of being top heavy with citations and references.Instead, it is a useful book, written in a very personal, easy-going style. I felt as if I were having a conversation with her, rather than being lectured to. And, of course, that's the kind of classroom she's helping you create, if you follow her advice."},{"Title":"Successful Beginnings for College Teaching (Teaching Techniques/Strategies Series, V. 2)","review":"Since this was a requirment for school, can't comment on content.

He takes each word separately; givesa brief historical description; adds a few excerptsfrom where the word was used; and polishes it offwith a lovely line illustration (printed in green ink whichmakes for a perfect contrast to the black ink ofthe text) to give a visual referent to sharpen thereader's focus. I've seen other books similarto this (&lt;Curious Words&gt; is an example) butthey usually give you long lists or unnecessaryvariations and such, that frankly are tiresometo read. Not so with &lt;Forgotten Words&gt;, which hasbeen delivered with perfection. Anotherstrong point about Kacirk is thathe is a humble man who doesn'ttry to wow you with clever anecdotes and provocativestatements, a tendency which mars the workof Bill Bryson, in his &lt;Mother Tongue&gt; book.This one is superbly laid out, and a joy tothumb through (but do it slowly -- quality before quantity)and should provide no end of joy and satisfaction."},{"Title":"Forgotten English","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend/writer. I don't believe she was sure about the book at first but, has since told me that it is not only interesting and fun reading but has also become a source for new (old) words. I looked through it before I gave it and I found it to be intersting and also easy to read. I'd recommend it for writers looking for odd words or even for those wishing to &quot;expand&quot; their vocabulary. Keep in mind, however, that it is NOT set up like a thesaurus."},{"Title":"Forgotten English","review":"Forgotten English is a great asset to the mind and library of any well-read english student, teacher, or any to whom words, language, literature and history are of interest. It gives incredible insight to many works of literature, such as Shakespeare, popular classics and many more obscure texts. The author, Mr. Kacirk, uses a wealth of information from a world of resources. Every entry to this not-quite-dictionary-style, indexed book is very informative, as well as thoughtful and interesting. Overall, Forgotten English provides a great read. You will find yourself returning to this book many times in the years to come.

After only 30 minutes of reading I purchased a 2nd copy for a family member --didn't want to keep this treasure a secret! Entertaining and educational. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Forgotten English","review":"The English language has great diversity, perhaps nowhere as strong and colourful as across the spread of North America, the largest geographic landmass of English-speaking predominance in the world. Like any living language, the 'standard' is not always the one used in everyday speech and communication. The written language itself has differing standards, all at variance in one form or another from the spoken word. Because of this, much of the language gets lost over time. One of the things that makes novelists like Mark Twain memorable is that they captured elements of the informal language, the spoken language, in their text pages - something fairly rarely done, but something that can resonate with the readers.Jeffrey Kacirk states in his introduction that it is this lost and vanishing element of the language that he concentrates upon for this book - not a surprise, really, given that the title of this book is 'Forgotten English'. Part of Kacirk's interest came from his upbringing, in which he lived in several different regions of the country, each geographically and linguistically distinct. Kacirk's introduction traces the development of the language in certain ways, including the fact that what are often considered 'Americanisms' often originated in the British Isles, falling out of use there but thriving in North America. With the advent of modern media (talking motion pictures, radio and television), the re-introduction of American speech patterns as both commonplace and acceptable has occurred, with occasional bumps.The phrases Kacirk has accumulated here include pieces that contain the flavour of life in North America. 'Often containing an abundance of metaphor, simile, and common sense, these distillations of practical experience are easily bandied about by those whose education has not displaced their native intelligence.' These have a tendency to be blended over time into the mainstream, if they survive at all, particularly in an ever more homogeneous media environment. However, language as a living entity continues to grow in wild patches here and there, and Kacirk's collection helps to show some of the more interesting patches in the garden of the English language.This book is one of several Kacirk has written (another good one is 'Informal English'), all of which illustrate the diversity and vitality of the English language."},{"Title":"Forgotten English","review":"I bought this book to give as a gift to an English teacher, having previously purchased a copy for myself (also a retired English teacher) after seeing it in someone's home."},{"Title":"Forgotten English","review":"For word-lovers especially!

Sadly there is not one person in my acquaintance who would understand why I loved this book, and I don't really understand it myself, except to say that I am fascinated by language and ancient words in particular.

It was such a great hit that I went out and bought two more for other members of the family."},{"Title":"Forgotten English","review":"I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a book full of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day."},{"Title":"Letters from Chickadee Hill","review":"This book is for anyone who finds spirituality in Nature.

To me, I had to be in the mood to read it because im not into science fiction. This book is about a man with a whole bunch of tatoos all over him. These tattoos aren't the regular tattoos the ones you see on people. These ones move and have a story to tell. There were eighteen stories on his body that have morals to life.My favorite quote in the book was from the story \\"The Last Night Of The World,\\" \\"What would you do if you knew that this was the last night of the world?\\" This quote was my favorite because it made me excited of what the next story was going to be about. I also think about the end of the world on my own time, so this quote caught my interest. It also made me wonder what if i knew it was the last night of the world, making me want to answer the question and think about it.I think this book should be required reading. This book isn't that bad if you give it a try. It also teaches students morals in the stories. When you read this book your mind also gets to exercise with the kinds of stories in it."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is a book full of interesting short stories. Each story is a continuation into a new story, which keeps the reader wanting more. Ray Bradbury has a large variety of topics in which he covers in his short stories &quot; The Other Foot&quot; and &quot;The Man&quot; are short stories that talked about racism and hints around religion, respectively. &quot;The Other Foot&quot; talks about the inequality of black people and how the Lord saw to it that the other race suffered in the end. &quot;The Man&quot; talks about a higher being where the moral is there is always something or someone better than you.The Illustrated Man should be required reading in schools because every story had a moral behind it. And people need to know what good morals really are. This book is good reading for schools because it carries different spectrums of the world, and it can also help kids with their imagination and thinking what can become of the world in the future. This book talks about religion, racism, the future, and etc. Children and teens should know, hear, and see different things of the world today. And all the stories are well set up where you can follow and you are able to learn something from it."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I had to read The Illustrated Man for English class over the summer, and I think it's pretty good for science-fiction. The stories teach a lot of useful lessons that make you question how well you are living your life. There are stories about the end of the world and men going out into space.I think this book is good for required reading because of the lessons it teaches. They really are useful and simple to apply to your everyday life."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is an interesting book to say the least. Throughout the entire compilation of 18 short stories Ray Bradbury constantly shows the reader that we as people are capable of good and evil. As humans we have wants and needs, the way we express these emotions are what define us.No matter what decade, past or present, Ray Bradbury continuously portrays individuals in the book as humans and nothing more. We are capable of chaos and destruction however, as long as we can hate we can love and care. These actions are shown in The Illustrated Man by gigantic wars or by an unselfish act to please the person or persons we love most.Like a moth to the flame, I have repeatedly returned to The Illustrated Man for academic aide, as well as personal interest. As a student I would deem this book as memorable but not as material that is capable of being completely reread. Personally I think this book would make an excellent learning tool in school as a book that would be required to be read."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a science fiction novel that I have currently read. It is one of the most unique and creative science fiction stories ever written. This novel contains eighteen different stories each filled with action and a world far beyond our own.

I found it very interestng and stimulating to read and I was on the verge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next more then once. I had five stories that I absolutely loved but all eighteen were amazing.Now you may think summer is a time to relax and escape the tortures and stress of homework and school and I don't blame you. I was just like that and couldn't believe it when I was asked to read a story over my summer vacation. But, since this was an assigned and mandatory assignment I did it anyway. Now, after finishing the novel, I must say I am glad I pushed myself to read a book that really wasn't that long after all. It was something I enjoyed and would do again if I had to. So, I would agree that this should be a required piece of reading for all who are interested. After all, it's not a lot to read and you never know if you may like it or not.

Do you find yourself always wondering what the future will or could be like? If you answered yes to either of these questions The Illustrated Man is the book for you! The story starts off in a park in Wisconsin and we are first introduced to the &#8220;illustrated man&#8221;. His body is covered in beautifully detailed illustrations that we&#8217;re put on him by a witch. Because of the witch&#8217;s evil powers the man&#8217;s tattoos have the ability to see the future.One of my favorite quotes from the book (which was actually a question) had to be: &#8220;What would you do if you knew that this was the last night of the world?&#8221; When I read that line I honestly stopped and thought, what would I do? There we&#8217;re many other things that happened throughout the book that made you stop and think as well, but you&#8217;ll just have to read the book and find them for yourself!I definitely believe that this book should be required reading, especially for kids of my age. Why? Mainly because it gets us thinking about things we wouldn&#8217;t normally have thought about. Things like the quote I mentioned above. It&#8217;s not a pleasant thought for many people, but it&#8217;s interesting to wander outside your normal thoughts. This book should also be required reading because, well just because it&#8217;s a really good book.

I thought the stories were quite interesting but a little too childish, but as I kept reading on i thought it had good morals and good hooks to keep you reading. It could also could widen your imagination. You could also make a picture of what might happen in the future by reading this book. Most of the stories are taking place in the future and informs you about these great machines.I think Ray Bradbury did a brilliant job on a unigue story format by taking a story and making the reader find out and keep reading. My favorite story was the \\"The Rocket Man\\" because i really enjoyed the story and I couldnt put it down. I definetly would recommend for you to read this book because you would enjoy like I did.

Because it is not just one continous story, the plot is always changing dramatically.At the end of each story you are usually left hanging as to what ends up happening exactly, leaving you with vague ideas and room to use your imagination, keep you thinking, and hungry for more.As thrilling as the book was however, I found it increadably disconcerting. Many othe the stories were frightening, involving death in various ways, and people filled with such uncertainty to the point of doubting their own existence.Such as in the story 'No Particular Night or Morning' where the character Hitchcockthinks that if he can't see something then it can't exist.Despite how the book made me feel it has some good morals that can be learned from and used in life. The Illustrated Man makes readers think and consider how life may be if we take things for granted, and don't take care of what we have.

On its surface, its a collection of stories that relate to the tattoos on a wandering man. As his new companion looks on, the tattoos come to life and each of them has a powerful story to share.The overall idea for this collection is perfect, and it really works to tie all of the stories together. But the real gems are the stories themselves. In a few short pages Bradbury uses each story to reveal timeless truths about religion, God, race, fear, the future, and much more. The first story, The Veldt, is a haunting tale that highlights the dangers of technology. Written fifty years ago, it is nothing short of prophetic and it perfect for our times.There are a couple of stories that are slower than the rest, but only because the are compared to the other brilliant stories contained in the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This collection of classic sci-fi stories from Ray Bradbury is a little dated, with rocket ships and Martians and a 1950s sensibility (and sex roles). There's no real unifying theme, despite the \\"illustrated man\\" who bears each tale as a tattoo on his body. Most of the stories are dark and more psychological than speculative fiction, Martians and spaceships notwithstanding. Don't expect any of the usual \\"twist\\" endings common to short stories from this time period, but if you're familiar with Bradbury's other work, you'll see his themes reflected here.I found the book moderately enjoyable, but it's not the best introduction to Bradbury, and it's not great sci-fi.

It is from on e of the staories from the ILlustrated Man called \\" The Exiles,\\" which are also one of my favorite stories.

The one other story i like the best is called, \\"Zero Hour\\" because it is about an invasion by alens so that's why i liked it. If you want to find out more about the future, rockets, planets, or space this is the book for you. The different stoies in here are mostly abou the future and outer space.

Also in some stories they were teaching you things whether it was history or something now.

It was too much science fiction, and that's not my preference when it comes to books. One thing this book did have that i liked a lot was that it had some very good morrals, that we could all learn from. My favorite quote from the book was in the epilogue,\\"I stood there in the moonlight,afraid that the windor the stars might move and wake the monstrous gallary at my feet.\\" That quote was my favorite because it shows suspence and fear.Which I kind of liked.I wouln't reacommend this book to any of my friends unless they were really into space, technology, and the future. Basically if they really weren't into science fiction like me it wouldn't be a good book for them. But i do kind of think that this book should be required for students to read because one thing this book shows is how much us humans rely on technology and how its become a big factor in about all of our lives. Which can have a bad outcome.

I am glad I read it this summer. There is a mix of action suspense and history in the book. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. The only thing holding it back from a perfect 10 is that it wasn't consistent. There would be a very good, high-paced, action or suspense story followed by a story that was, sad to say, boring. None the less, the overall book was great and it showed a sense of imagination to let your mind travel.Though The Illustrated Man was a good book, it wouldn't be necessary to read in schools. It isn't a classic and I wouldn't put in the ranks of To Kill a Moking Bird by Harper Lee or I know Why th Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angeleu. Plus, the book focuses on too many different subjects."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This is a collection of 18 short stories, loosely tied together by the premise of The Illustrated Man, a man whose tattoos move and shift to tell the stories. Some of these stories were published in various magazines between the fall of 1947 and 1951; others first appeared in this collection. This book was ranked 10th on the Astounding Analog All-Time Poll in 1952, and was tied for 22nd on the same poll in 1956. It was ranked 33 on the 1999 Locus All-Time Poll for collections. It was also nominated for the 1952 International Fantasy Award for fiction.Almost all of the stories in this collection are outstanding. There is a wide variety of stories, some are horror, some are fantasy, and some are science fiction. He can create settings like no other author, as the feelings and emotions of the pieces are what set him apart from the rest. This collection stands the test of time."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The most obvious feature that sets this short story collection apart is the morbidity and darkness of it. Almost every story is about something gone horribly wrong. You don't see that too often, I think authors are afraid to write that kind of story, but Bradbury does it well, and has a good way to present the stories (via the illustrated man) that explains why they're morbid.I think two or three were feel good stories. Many revolve around rockets and invaders from Mars, which is completely representative of that wonderful time before the Russians became our big enemy."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I've read Illustrated Man for sophomore Honor summer project. I've taken too much time finished this book. As for me it was not that interesting book because I thought it has more logical and imagination involves. And I realize myself that I didn't get used to imagine and free mind. This book made me tough to understand fully. I mean some portion of story is totally touchable, but other few parts are just screw me to concentrated and understand as well. Actually before I've enjoyed this book deals with rocket is not my line. Because I didn't really care about the happen occur way far from earth. But on my second thought, rocket ship and space are totally cool and attractive even though everything consists of imagination.Mainly, there's really engrossing chapter from the book which is \\"The Rocket Man\\". I select it for best touchable and agreeable part, because it describes dedicate love of family. Also it tells readers that how family worth to their life is. Each single person in family means infinite much. The thing they spent time together and sharing their precious thought randomly depend weather their life is happy or lonesome. I've remembered the last page of this book says that \\"And, for along while, the only days we ever went out to walk we're the days when it was raining and there was no sun.\\"(Ray 111). Every peaces of words they talk totally sorrow and all the action they express how much the family deeply love dad therefore they choose not to go outside when the sun is shining. The reason they dislike to contact with sun is dad passed away from the sun and it reminds them for dad.Lastly I decide to recommend this book should be requiring read from my point. Because I think it is such a special and critical book. Even I had hard time to understand this book for somewhat, however it's worth while to read. For example the reader should get emotional feeling because they never seen engrossing happen from real life. There's different people have variety opinion of this book. But they've experienced how can they bring up their imagination and variation."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Overall The Illustrated Man was an interesting book. It kept me in with fantastic details of the setting. Such as in the story called \\"The Veldt\\" where Bradbury described the smells and colors of the environment. Also when i came to the end of a story i ended up thinking about it for long periods of time even after im done reading for the day. For example like in the story called \\"The Rocket Man\\". This story made me think, is space so amazing that a man would be somewhat addicted to it and basically leave his family behind for it.Actually i do have a favorite quote. Its from the story called \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and it goes \\"Did all dying people feel this way, as if they had never lived?\\". It made realize what it would be like to drift in space all alone in space knowing that your going to die and only to be thinking about how complete your life was.Well the book was good for summer reading but i think it would be even better if it was read during the school year because some parts of the book was very confusing and seems like it would be better if a teacher was there for help.by Arnel R."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I thought this book was pretty good, since it was the first sci-fi book I actually read in my life.There were some chapters I liked because of the imagery that Ray Bradbury put into his book.For example I saw the parents getting eaten by the lions in the veldt. I also saw the men getting sliced and diced by \\"The City\\". A very detailed scene was in \\"The fox and the forest\\", where Mr. Simms was ran over by Williams's car.My favorite quote came from the chapter \\"The fox and the forest\\", and it was \\" The rabbits may hide this forest, said a voice, but a fox can always find them\\". I like this qoute because the tone of the qoute being said give a mood that the person might be a serial killer. I would only require this book for reading in the summer, because it is not a book with a big plot to follow, which makes it easier for a kid to follow along. Something wierd went wrong with my book because I found a couple mistakes, or at least I thought they were mistakes. But other than that I thought it was a great book to follow along since it had mini stories that tied into a big story."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, is an astonishing novel that retains many meaningful messages. The novel is divided by eighteen short stories that each has totally different characters, conflicts, and solutions. I really enjoyed the way Bradbury creates each ending of the story with an ironic and unexpected idea. The stories are apparently different but throughout the reading, I discovered that these stories have one thing in common; it is a mystery. The most of the stories have a topic related to mystery, and I like most of them because they have mysterious flows and reasonable answers.Among these amazing stories, I love \\"The Other Foot\\" and \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" In \\"The Other Foot,\\" Willie Johnson once said, \\"The time for being fools is over. We got to be something else except fools.\\" This quote teaches me that there is no better thing as a help to people who are desperate with our help. Helping others could be tiresome and annoying at first however that little help can be a big effect to people in desperate.Although there are some stories that I don't agree, like \\"The Long Rain\\" and \\"The Exiles,\\" The Illustrated Man should be required reading because after reading people will have an opportunity to come up with their new ideas based on their point of view. The science fiction could be a difficult reading, but I believe that most of people will agree with the novel.Lydia (So Young) ChoiGahr High School"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, is a collection of eighteen short stories that are coalesced into a single, brilliant novel, which I deem as a classical thriller. The novel begins when a man encounters a mysterious stranger, whom he later discovers is \\"Illustrated.\\" Woven onto the stranger's body are arcane designs that create magical stories which foretell the future. Although many of the stories are not affiliated in any way, they all brandish an underlying innuendo of an upcoming nuclear holocaust or some sort of world destruction.Although I did not take pleasure in some of the stories in the novel because of its visionary fallacies of an Armageddon, I believe The Illustrated Man was one of the best, thought-provoking books that I have read, so far. \\"There's a Truth in [everything]. All parts of the Big Truth. On a certain day they'll all fit together like pieces of a jigsaw.\\" As you can see, this novel by Ray Bradbury also conveys a sure regard to faith and all of its glory in the stories of \\"The Man\\" and \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" leading us to believe that although the future brings anguish and devastation, there is a route to salvation.Even though this novel was extremely awe-inspiring in my opinion, I think that The Illustrated Man should not be a required reading. Many students would not benefit from reading a novel that possesses such a sinister outlook on the future of the world. It may even corrupt a naive child's mind, spreading the cancer of infectious thoughts about world destruction and constant suspicion. However, I still regard Ray Bradbury as an eccentric, yet dignified genius who is genuinely unsurpassed in his title of the \\"greatest science fiction writer\\" and The Illustrated Man as a timeless classic."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This is the sort of direction I like to see the genre going, relatively simple story line exploring the the inner workings of humans in a futuristic setting. The events that occur in Bradbury's stories, although fiction, seem more real because such things could happen in a future where technology has advanced so much.I generally enjoyed all of 18 of the short stories. All of them unique and slightly morbid. Personally, I love stories with a bit of morbidness and depression, it gives it more of a gritty realism of how life really is. I found that \\"Marionettes Inc.\\" was my favorite story. This is the kind of story I like, where humans start becoming dependent on human-like cyborgs or \\"dolls\\" because they are convenient, obedient, and life-like. Then everything seems to fall apart as the AI wants to be human itself or it has become too human for it to be of any help to the owner.My favorite quote from one of the stories, \\"Fire Balloons,\\" is \\"Can't you recognize the human in the inhuman?\\" and then \\"I'd much rahter recognize the inhuman in the human.\\" Personally, I believe it sums up what the novel is all about. The Illustrated Man deals with human relations with one another, technology, and other forms of being; how they can help one another, but most of the time destroy.I most highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of science fiction and even if you are not. Its extraordinarily well written and provides compelling short stories making you wish there was more then just a few pages. I wouldn't say it was depressing, but some may find it not too their liking because of the untimely end of most of the characters. Nonetheless, it is highly recommendable and broadens horizons because that's what true science fiction does. I am most definitely checking out Ray Bradbury's other works and The Illustrated Man movie!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is probably the greatest book I've ever read! It's a woderful blend of reality of then and of the future yet to come. It starts out with a man that meets the illustrated man and is told the story of how the illustations came to be. The illustrated man is litteraly illustrated with tatoos,and at night the tatoos would move, speak and play out stories of the future.Then the man stays and watches the stories come together and alive. The stories are so incredible i could hardly put the book down.This book made me think of things in a whole different way. Seeing how people then thought of things then that are nothing now or what he believes will and still can happen is a real eye-opener. I would most deffinetly reccomend this book to anyone thats looking for a good story."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Perfect to read right before sleep. Or at an Airport, waiting for your flight. I picked up this edition up at my schools store. It was two weeks later that I finally had the opportunity to read into the prologue. I didn't have much time, but found the reading easy, and loveable. I quickly devored the first short story. That of a holodeck dream room, which aloof children close themselves away in secret from their parents. I must tell you of my day afterwards. I was in class, during an important lecture. I must confess that the story played around in my mind, the descriptions had brought on images;clear and meaningful. After finishing my laborous day, I quickly fell into the pocket sized book, found my dog-eared page and read another short story. And another. Every story left me fascinated, In fact, I finished the book before the night. I remember looking online for all of Ray Bradbury's works. I had fallen in deep interests with the man. He had, in a short interval of roughly twenty pages apeice, puzzled together a fabulous, demensional exhistance of fiction that I had enjoyed, and would continue to enjoy. I've read this book over and over again. I've read it in semenar, I've recommended it to everyone I know. I hope you find this book.-jeff"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This group of highly imaginative tales, written in 1948-51, do nothing if not illustrate that 1) it's extremely difficult to predict the future and 2) no matter how much we struggle against it, we probably are doomed to reflect our own times and cultural environment. Over half a century after Ray Bradbury wrote these entertaining stories, we have a lot of answers to questions about the (then) future thanks to hindsight. Bradbury's characters still smoke like chimneys, they still use clunky mid-20th century machines for the most part---lugging electrical equipment and card tables across the light years in their bronze spaceships. There's only the vaguest hint of a computer (\\"The City\\") and then of the giant, controlling variety. Above all, there is no vision of the infinitely varied America of today---the space explorers in these stories are nearly all white Anglosaxons who speak and behave as white people did in the early 1950s. The cultural oppositions and arguments in the stories are those of mid-century America. While it is true that Bradbury writes of human nature it is also true that the nature he describes is as we saw it half a century ago.However, Bradbury covers a wide range of topics: child psychology; machine vs. man; imagination and emotion vs. cold science; religion; time travel, and race relations. Some of the stories are unbelievably poignant. In fact, I would say that poignancy---the ability to bring out that quality without being sappy or twee---is Bradbury's strongest suit. If you don't like science fiction, this book probably isn't for you, but it certainly has made its mark on American culture, with 47 printings through 1990. One story, \\"The Exiles\\", probably laid the basis for his later \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". Bradbury wrote many stories which featured the \\"wrap-around-comfort, totally mechanized houses\\" that appear in several works in this volume. How many Hollywood movies of the last 15 years owe a debt to \\"The Fox and the Forest\\", a story of people escaping through time from a bad future to a quieter or more prosperous present ? THE ILLUSTRATED MAN is a minor American classic in a perennially shortchanged genre, science fiction. The dated technology and cultural styles may seem primitive today, but even they add a dimension of telling us about the times in which they were written as well as about the future as they saw it then."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I really really enjoyed this book, it is one of my favourites. The stories inside were very shocking and unique and thought provoking too. It is not your normal futuristic book about the future with its gadgets and high technology and robots that seem impossible, this is a creative but rather realistic book too. I especially enjoyed &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; as it was rather touching and sad and after reading that, I highlighted a phrase inside about some people having only dreams when they die and they die unhappily, while others have real memories, so they are able to die without regrets.All in all, I think this book is fantastic, a must-read!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Conceptually, The Illustrated Man is brilliant from the get-go, including its novel premise of 18 stories as told through the moving tattoos on a man's body; in addition to weaving intricate webs, the Illustrated Man's body art predicts the future.And, oh, what stories are told. As a science fiction writer, it is no surprise that the majority of Bradbury's stories have to do with space and the future (heck, all of space was in the future when these stories were written in the early 50s). Additionally, the majority of the tales are pretty bleak, dealing with dark themes of revenge, futile searches for paradise, and Armageddon. However, save for their near-universal excellence, thought-provocation, and prescience, the similarities end there.Among them: Mars is colonized by black people who have left Earth's prejudices, and await with apprehension the arrival of a white-piloted rocket ship from their former homeland; another planet's soldiers attack Earth and are surprised at the warm welcome they receive, only to learn that they can be conquered by Earth's lousy diet, sedentary ways, and shallow culture as easily as by the planet's military; an assembly of priests travels to Mars to learn about Martian sins, so as to spread God's word and earn converts of the Red plant; an entire city is built with the concept of vengeance in mind, by its citizens who were to perish before being able to exact that revenge themselves; the authors of classic tales of horror, whose works are banned on Earth, are themselves exiled to Mars and only kept alive by the few remaining copies not burned for censorship.There are a couple of lame ducks herein, but even those are salvaged by the beauty of Bradbury's writing. His metaphors and descriptive devices flow from the pages and grant a macabre beauty to even the most desolate of landscapes."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Sometimes it's hard to remember that Ray Bradbury approaches the art of the short story in a very unconventional way. His collections of short stories are often tied together by common sub-themes or settings, although each story could also stand on its own. Such is the case here, though the running theme to the Illustrated Man collection is mostly an abstraction. Apparently the stories here are told by a man's haunted tattoos, but don't worry about that too much. The true theme holding this group of stories together is examinations of human nature and mankind's place in the universe. Bradbury's frequent use of Mars (and occasionally other planets) as a setting, with the obligatory spaceships and technology, is merely his method of creating alternate realities to bring human nature into bold relief.Bradbury's classic examinations of the dark and melancholy side of humanity are well represented here as always, with his trademark poetic writing style and underlying sense of creeping dread. The classic virtual reality tale &quot;The Veldt&quot; is found here, with the typical misuse-of-technology theme presented in an unexpectedly haunting fashion. More evidence that the stock sci-fi themes are merely a thin backdrop can be seen in &quot;The Other Foot,&quot; a chilling examination of race relations; or &quot;The Rocket,&quot; which deals with the yearning of regular people to reach beyond the confines of Earth. Other winning stories include &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;The Long Rain&quot; which are haunting tales of how human nature can still undermine the greatest achievements of cold technology. So don't concern yourself with the typical sci-fi backdrop, and get in tune with what Ray Bradbury is really talking about."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This is one of those &quot;must own&quot; books that you always hear about, in a hundred years this and a handful of other Bradbury books will be considering classics of American literature. Basically a collection of about a guy who has all this illustrations on his body that shows the stories to an unnamed observer. Personally I have no idea why he bothered with the Illustrated Man concept, the stories stand on their own just fine, though it does give him the opportunity to give a great sucker punch ending. And the concept is basically ignored after the second story but hey when the stuff is this good who am I to complain? The stories themselves, like I said are all excellent, some more than others but it's mostly the distinction between &quot;real good&quot; and &quot;really really really good&quot;. The highlights are the opening &quot;The Veldt&quot; which is classic Bradbury and some story about some guys on Venus who are going crazy from getting rained on and a few others. Most of his stories are science-fictional, often revolving in one way or another around rockets but Bradbury deals less with actual science and more about fantasy and dreams, leading to some real good touching moments, above all his stories are about people, they just happened to be set in the future on Mars. Some are sentimental, some are creepy, some are funny but all are good. And it's quick reading, so you have no excuse.

And when the moon is risen and the tales are told, the dark marks may tell the most horrifying story of all.Bradbury isn't for everyone, and several of his stories aren't for the squeamish. This collection of short stories is mostly tame, and as uneven in quality as most short-story collections. \\"The Veldt\\" and \\"Zero Hour\\" are brilliantly-stirred blends of sci-fi and gothic horror, while \\"The Man\\" and \\"The Fire Balloons\\" are dull and meandering improvisations on religious themes. Among Bradbury's most intriguing stories are the psychological dramas of \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World,\\" balanced by the tedious moralizing of \\"The Other Foot\\" (a story which probably had much greater punch in the years before desegregation).\\"The Illustrated Man\\" is a product of its time, and is streaked through with the dialogue, assumptions, fears, and expectations of the mid-20th century. Some of the themes Bradbury explores still resonate, but he never rises to the timeless transcendence of a Dickens, a Hugo, or an Austen. However, as one of the most popular and devilishly clever American novelists of the 20th century, his short stories here collected deserve a look.

I will continue to read this wonderful little book. Like most of Bradbury's work, one can never get bored reading his stories. His stories are at times terrible, dark and they are beautiful, fascinating and in many ways a portal to the future. They are also a wonderful escape from the now.The Illustrated Man is more a short story collection woven together by a central theme. The theme is The Illustrated Man. I agree with many other persons that it is important to realize he is illustrated, not tattooed. And how did he get the illustrations? A witch did the illustrations. He has been on the road searching for her ever since she put them on every inch of his flesh. When he finds her, he plans to kill her. Why? The illustrations are magical and move on his body. They are magic. If you look at theme for a period, they will tell you a story.The Illustrated Man moves through 18 stories. \\"The Veldt\\" is my favorite story. \\"The Veldt\\" is one of the best short stories ever written. I also enjoyed \\"The Long Rain\\" (about rain of Venus) and \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" (about an artificial intelligence body double being used where a man can go out on the town, but the double ultimately taking the man's place and wife). There are so many great stories ranging from Sci-Fi to mild horror. It is a great book I would recommend for all middle school age and older.Read and Reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"While the cover of the paperback that I read states that Bradbury is \\"The World's Greatest Living Science Fiction Writer\\", I respectfully disagree. Science fiction is so broad a field that there is significant overlap with horror and fantasy. I would without question call Bradbury the best author ever in the field of horrific science fiction. For, while his stories are generally based on a scientific theme, the real power is in the horrific aspects of the events.When I was young, my favorite short story was \\"The Veldt\\", the first one in this collection of Bradbury's best short stories. A modern house contains what we would now call a holodeck, and instead of the children conjuring up delightful images, they are interested only in a scene of the African veldt, where lions pursue and devour their prey. Complete with the smell, sound and heat of the plains, the parents of the children are concerned that it is unhealthy. The parents try to do something to stop it, but they end up being consumed by the lions conjured up by the room.Most of the other stories deal with the same theme, technology gone wrong. Atomic and biological warfare appears in many of the stories. However, the best part of all the stories is the tension and the unusual endings, often based on the frailties of human psychology. The intertwining of science fiction and horror makes these stories unique and I see a lot of similarities between Bradbury and Stephen King. In this area, he is better than King."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I highly recommend this book to any fan of Ray Bradbury's work, or to anyone who wishes to introduce his classic works into their library. He is a passionate visionary that writes not only about sci-fi, but his colorful writing style encapsulates the sometimes ineffable feelings that each and every one of us have had about every possible situation in life, and dare I say, in death. I always feel like a kid again when I read his books, I am taken away to warm, sunny Saturdays when I was still in awe of the newness of life. I can hardly force myself to read the works of others as I am convinced that no one can do with words the magic that Ray Bradbury has done."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Some people I know have had real trouble 'getting' Bradbury's work. The bulk of his best work was written in the 50's and 60's. Some concepts in this book are simply outdated. However, in every story is study of a concept that never has and never will be out-dated, The Human Condition. 'The Man', 'Kaliedascope' and 'The Long Rain' are my personal favorites. Potential readers must also understand that Bradbury is not a science fiction writer. A lot of his stories have science fiction themes and backgrounds, but Fantasy is a better way to describe his work. From hard core fantasy, such as what you will find in this book, to subtle fantasy, such as 'Dandelion Wine' you will find the most important element of Bradbury's work is EMOTION. This man is a true one of a kind Artist. I also recommend: Something Wicked this Way Comes, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, Fahrenheit 451 and any of his other earlier short story collections.

Also, there are some controversial goings-on in this novel. In one short story titled \\"The Man\\", it seems as though a traveler would stop by towns and heal people.

Narrator Scott Brick's light touch makes the tales all the more devastating--from \\"The Veldt\\" to its chilling bookend \\"Zero Hour\\" (with it's horrific, tossed-off line, \\"Mom, I'll be sure you won't be hurt much, really!\\") These stories while nominally science fiction, can also be considered horror stories, especially when considered with the \\"Illustrated Man\\" framing device. (This audio edition comes with the full, final story of the Man which doesn't appear in earlier editions. It also has Bradbury's 1997 preface.) Anyway, these stories are very much likeThe October Country; I would only listen to these CD's with all the lights on."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is a glorious masterpiece. Ray Bradbury, in a particularly twisted bit of insight, set out to analyize what was then his background and culture of modern times, then tear it asunder with the withering majesty of the extraordinary. Is it any wonder that EC Comics in the 1950s greedily set out to gobble up anything Bradbury oriented?The Illustrated Man is what should be called 'a linked-story story collection/novel,' some complicated mish-mosh of related themes and on-going narratives, a sort of The Crypt Keeper, yet with deeper insight, setting up the tales. Many of the stories are just marvelous--\\"The Veldt,\\" \\"Kaleidscope,\\" \\"The Other Foot\\" for a study of an issue many people hold desperately tight to the chest. The majesterial masterpieces: \\"The Long Rain,\\" \\"The Last Night of the World.\\" \\"The Exiles,\\" \\"The Concrete Mixer,\\" \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" \\"Zero Hour,\\" \\"The Rocket.\\" Even \\"The Illustrated Man\\"--still, in essence, a gimmick with an appropriate, semi-chilling end--even this narrative has its terrifying moments.Ray Bradbury, in this as well as several other of his books, serves as a chilling prophet of the future and as a vicious but ultimately good-natured guy laughing at death and destruction and having a hell of a time.

I really like the way the author brings thye stories to life from a man that is tattooed everywhere. It was very different from other novels, hiow the stories come off of a man that has illustrations on him.My favorite quote in the book was,\\" Eighteen Illustrations, eighteen tales. I counted them one by one. Primarily my eyes focused upon a scene, a large house with two people in it. I saw a flight of vultures on a blazing flesh sky. I saw yellow lions, and I heard voices. The illustrations quivered and came to life.....\\" This is my favorite quote because it is in the prologue and captures you for the stories.I think this book should be read because it is very creative.

This book is a sci-fic book, with about 18 short stories in one novel.This book is about a man who has tattoos all over his body, which represents to a particular short story in the book. This novel basically is about a man thinking and imagining what is going to happen in the future.Well in this entire book i had many quotes that i liked a lot, but one that caught my eye on the most was the short story called The Exiles, and the quote was \\"Death Real Death for all of us\\". I really liked this quote because it showed that not only one but all of us have an end to life.I recommend this novel to those people who like mystery and exciting stories at the same time.

While reading The Illustrated Man, I could always visualize everything that was going on and the mood was always set. This is one of those books that will have you reading throughout the night. I was astounded how well Ray Bradbury was able to create a mood within very few pages. Not once throughout the book did I feel lost or unwilling to finish a certain story. Each one had their own atmosphere, and each kept me reading until I was finished. Although there were not direct quotes that stood out to me, I really liked the story \\"No Particular Night or Morning.\\"I believe that this novel should be on the required reading list. Besides the fact that it is one of the greatest Science Fiction novels I have ever read, it also helps the reader think in new ways. Many of the stories have the reader thinking about choices in life they have made.

If my response must fit your specifications, I won't review any more ever again. Goodbye."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"A couple spoilers here, but only when needed to explain why I rated the way I did.The stories in this book are not related at all. In the beginning Ray Bradbury tries to make you think all the tattoos on some guy are all inter-related. After about the 3rd story, Ray Bradbury apparently forgets about the Illustrated Man and makes no mention of him again and it's just story after story until the very end when he's given a few more sentences. That doesn't take away from the book though. I like short story collections. I don't know why he felt the need to half-@$$ an attempt at making a cohesive novel out of a collection of previously published short stories. Anyway...The first story really caught me and set my expectations too high. The first story is the best and it's really downhill from there. Most of the stories are so bad I wanted to give the book a 1 star rating, but there are a few gems that kept me from doing so.\\"The Veldt\\" - Set in a future world where a family has a 3D nursery that will fully immerse their children in a world of their choosing. The parents begin to worry when the children begin spending too much time on the African Veldt. 5/5\\"Kaleidoscope\\" - A ship malfunction sends astronauts hurling through space. 4/5\\"The Other Foot\\" - Total Crock. Mars is solely inhabited by black people. White astronauts land and the blacks think about doing their own version of reverse-Jim Crow laws but decide to live in total peace and harmony and rainbows and unicorns and glurg and everyone gets along and things are wonderful because they are so much better people than white people. Total crock and blantantly polical. Shame on you Ray Bradbury. This story almost made me throw the book away. 0/5\\"The Highway\\" - Another political story about the industrialization of native lands. This one was better than the last, but still a bad story. 1/5\\"The Man\\" - Astronauts land on a planet in perfect peace and harmony. Because Jesus lives there. Seriously. 0/5\\"The Long Rain\\" - Astronauts stranded on Venus and it's constant rain. They are searching for \\"Sun Domes\\" to get out of the rain and into some artifical sunlight. Very good. 4/5\\"The Rocket Man\\" - An astronaut fights with the desire to maintain his career (and be gone for months at a time) or have a normal family life. Great story. 5/5\\"The Fire Balloons\\" - Priests take a missionary trip to Mars. Seriously. 1/5\\"The Last Night of the World\\" - The world is going to end tomorrow. With this knowledge a couple goes through their normal daily routine. 3/5\\"The Exiles\\" - Books are being burned on Earth. The characters of those books live on Mars. Seriously, Ray Bradbury is hung up on astronauts and Mars. 2/5\\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" - Two astronauts. One of them going insane. 2/5\\"The Fox and the Forest\\" - A couple travel back to 1938 Mexico to avoid the post-apocolyptic world in which they live. A nice break from all the astronaut and Mars stories. 3/5\\"The Visitor\\" - And back to astronauts and Mars. Mars is used as a colony for diseased people. One day a man arrives with the ability to transfer thoughts and provide the illusion of being in another much more comfortable place. 4/5\\"The Concrete Mixer\\" - The Martian army is preparing to invade Earth but are welcomed by movie directors who want them to act. What? 1/5\\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" - A man buys a robot wife because he is tired of his own. Pretty interesting. 3/5\\"The City\\" - Astronauts land on a seemingly uninhabited planet. I won't ruin it. I'll let the story ruin itself. 1/5\\"Zero Hour\\" - Children are playing a game called \\"Invasion\\". But it's real and they are helping Aliens take over Earth. Seriously. 1/5\\"The Rocket\\" - A poor man has finally saved up enough money to send only one member of his family into space. 3/5"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"A man meets another man who has \\"pictures\\" all over his body.

Unfortunately, the moving pictures tell stories so disturbing he doesn't like to go out in public. The first man spends an entire night watching the pictures in the firelight and the collected stories in this book are what he sees. A good description of these tales would be \\"science fiction nightmares.\\" They go a step beyond even cautionary tales to the greatest fears man has of aliens, technology, and space travel.Usually, when I review a short story collection I go through and say something about each one, but I feel that this is more of a cohesive whole than other collections, that I would be repeating myself quite a lot, and also not wanting to overdose on spoilers. These are also a little shorter than most short stories, but not quite short-shorts.

What drove me to this book originally was the film based on the collection in 1969 with Rod Steiger. It dramatized three of the stories and fleshed out the framing device of how the illustrated man became illustrated. I knew it wasn't a great film, even at the age of thirteen. However, it did capture a mood and it led me to check out the collection. This was my first introduction to the work of Ray Bradbury. I was fourteen and this was the most literate fiction I had read up to that point aside from required school reading of certain classics.Upon re-reading it, I found that I had no recollection of reading many of these at all so it was as if I were reading them for the first time. The premise is intriguing--a former carnival man turned hobo is cursed with a body full of tattoos which he insists are called skin illustrations that come to life as people watch them become dramatized. People are disturbed and see their fates; he loses another job and is disliked as the \`bearer' of the disturbing images. This is merely a lead-in to the collection of stories. The concept of paintings coming to life or telling stories wasn't new when Bradbury wrote this book and it continued with the premise of Rod Serling's anthology TV series Night Gallery (his earlier series Twilight Zone was also very similar to Bradbury).Many of the stories deal with travel to Mars and could be seen as additional episodes in the saga of The Martian Chronicles. \\"The Other Foot\\" is a more successful treatment of the black/white racial relations modified by Martian colonization than \\"Way in the Middle of the Air,\\" which was included in the original Martian Chronicles. In contrast to many of the Martian Chronicles stories in which the Earthlings migrated to Mars and modified the landscape and a dying civilization to meet their needs, in \\"The Concrete Mixer\\" Martians invade Earth only to be corrupted by a homogenized, crass, materialistic culture.Other stories in the collection deal with the unprepared for terrors of space travel and the unexpected challenges of navigating alien landscapes. \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" deal with humans becoming miniscule flotsam in the vast and infinite void. \\"The Long Rains\\" tells of men trying to survive and retain their sanity in a Venusian world of perpetual rain.Many of the stories depict scenarios of virtual reality or manipulation of reality in some sense. One of the most well-known is \\"The Veldt,\\" which tells of a playroom for children that becomes a bit too sophisticated when the children are given too much control of it and facilitates the darkest tendencies of their fantasies. \\"The City\\" tells of an automated city on an alien planet setting a trap for visitors from an Earth it recalls destroyed its civilization.There are many brilliant fantasies in this collection and others that have not aged as well since the time in which they were written. Upon reflection I think Bradbury could have expanded the theme of these stories as illustrations and paced them a bit more effectively. The collection begins with some of the darker stories such as \\"The Veldt,\\" \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"The Long Rains\\" but then the stories acquire a lighter tone, ending with the ode to the imagination \\"The Rocket Man.\\" On the heels of this optimistic story, the sardonic and sinister epilogue is a bit jarring. The tone is not evenly sustained or modulated throughout the collection. Perhaps if Bradbury had chosen to revise this book as he later did with Martian Chronicles he might have rectified this imbalance. Nonetheless, these stories survive as expressions of a prolific and bold imagination and also serve as potent emblems of the post-World War II era."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The way that Bradbury uses words is astounding.

Before anyone else did it, he probably did it. He set the standards by which all else is still judged. And The Illustrated Man is supposed to be among his best works.Only I didn't like it. I liked the set up-- the man covered in tattoos that come to life (so to speak), with each one a short story in the book. But too many (the vast majority) were too depressing without any offer of hope. Granted, Bradbury was writing these stories in the wake of World War II, so he had good cause to be pessimistic. But every story seems to be a case of meeting a character we like/dislike, something really bad happens to them, the end. No hope for even a positive outcome.\\"The Veldt\\" starts it off. And it is one of the great classics. And I like the story, despite the horror of it. But it's followed by story after story where things end just as badly.One very interesting exception (and there are a few exceptions in the book), is \\"The Other Foot.\\" Written before most people were even thinking about Civil Rights, it's about a thriving community on Mars comprised of black people who escaped oppression on Earth. Now, rockets with white people are set to arrive, and everyone is determined to treat them exactly as they themselves were treated on Earth-- separate drinking fountains, back of the bus, and interestingly, a minimum wage-- while others are already making nooses... only, it doesn't end up in bloodshed, and it is the rare bit of hope in the book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I have found over the years that Bradbury is a better novel writer than a short story writer. He seems to need several hundred pages to really work out a story, rather than a few dozen.If you have exhausted your list of all the Bradbury novels, then it is time to start reading his short story collections such as this one."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a below average piece of dull 50's writing from an overrated writer. Ray Bradbury includes in all his short stories, his hidden sanctimonious Christian ethics. He spreads his tedious message in little spurts here and there.

The children use the high-tech simulation nursery to create the predatorial environment of the African veldt. When the parents threaten to take it away, the children lock their parents inside where they are mauled and killed by the \\"harmless\\" machine-generated lions of the nursery.\\"Kaleidoscope\\" -- A bitter astronaut feels he has accomplished nothing worthwhile in his life as he and the rest of his crew fall irrevocably to their demise in outer space because of a malfunction in their ship. The story illustrates the collapse of the sanity and logic of the crew members as they face their death. Ultimately, the lamenting narrator is incinerated in the atmosphere of the Earth and appears as a shooting star to a child after wishing that his life would at least be worth something for someone else.\\"The Other Foot\\" -- Mars has been colonized solely by black people. When they learn that a rocket is coming from Earth with white travelers, they institute a Jim Crow system of racial segregation in which white people are to be considered second-class citizens, in retaliation for the history of wrongs perpetrated on their race by white people. When the rocket lands, the traveler tells them that most of the Earth has been destroyed in a war and asks for their help. The people realize that discrimination is harmful in all its forms, and reverse their planned segregation.\\"The Highway\\" -- A simple-minded family living by a highway in rural Mexico go on living their normal, idyllic lives as the highway fills with people fleeing a nuclear war. The story ends with some travellers they help telling them about the nuclear war, and how the world is ending. After the travelers leave, the confused resident briefly wonders what \\"the world\\" is, and then continues with his life.\\"The Man\\" -- A group of space explorers land on a planet to find the population living in a healthy state of bliss. Upon investigation, they discover that an enigmatic visitor came to them. Further description leads the two spacemen to believe that this man is Jesus (though he is never named, leaving room for other religious personas). One decides to spend the rest of his days on the planet, living and rejoicing in the wake of the man's glory. The other continues in his spaceship, \\"chasing 'him' always a step behind, never fast enough to catch up to him, constantly trying to achieve the unachievable.\\" Other members of the crew decide to stay on the planet to learn from the contented citizens, and are rewarded by the discovery that \\"he\\" is still on the planet.\\"The Long Rain\\" -- A group of astronauts are stranded on Venus, where it rains continually and heavily. The travelers make their way across the Venusian landscape to find a \\"sun dome\\", a shelter with a large artificial light source. However, the first sun dome they find has been destroyed by the Venusians. Searching for another sun dome, the characters, one by one, are driven to madness and suicide by the unrelenting rhythm of the rain. At the end of the story, only one sane astronaut remains, and manages to find a functional sun dome.\\"The Rocket Man\\" -- An astronaut's job keeps him away from home for long stretches of time, so he has little time with his wife and son, only visiting them for a period of three days at a time. The story is told from the perspective of the son, who holds an interest in becoming an astronaut too. However, his father explains to him that while the stars are beautiful, what he really wants is to be with his family. Sensing that his wife is unhappy with him being at home so little, the father makes a promise to the son that he will be quitting his job after his next mission to spend more time with them. At the end of the story, the son and his mother learn that his ship fell into the sun, and from then on, they do not venture outside during the day in remembrance of him.\\"The Fire Balloons\\" -- A priest travels to Mars to act as a missionary to Martians. Once there, he discovers that the natives are actually entities of pure energy. Since they lack corporeal form, they are unable to commit sin, and thus do not need redemption. Another message Bradbury conveys through this short story is that the vision of God is the same as that of his worshippers.\\"The Last Night of the World\\" -- In this story, the entire planet awakens to the knowledge that the world is going to end that very evening. Nonetheless, they go through their normal routines of going to work, eating, brushing their teeth, and falling asleep, knowing and accepting the fact that they will not wake up. This is in strong contrast to the looting and riots typically expected in this situation.\\"The Exiles\\" -- Numerous works of literature are banned and burned on Earth. The fictional characters of these books are portrayed as real-life entities who live in a refuge on Mars. However, they are vulnerable, as when all the books on a character are destroyed, the character itself vanishes permanently. When the group of characters learn that some people are coming for them, they stage a counterattack, but are foiled by the astronauts who burn the last remaining books from Earth, unknowingly annihilating the entire colony.\\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" -- Two men in a spaceship are having a discussion about how empty and cold space is. The first man is a little bit insane and keeps asking questions about how there is nothing sure in space and there is no night or morning. He refuses to believe anything about reality without sufficient evidence and soon becomes skeptical of everything he cannot directly experience. He said that he doesn't believe in stars because they are too far away. The second man is wandering about the ship when he learns that someone has left the ship, and it is the first man. The first man is still talking to himself and has killed himself by letting himself fly freely through space.\\"The Fox and the Forest\\" -- A couple from the future tires of the war in their modern lives, so they go on a vacation to the more serene past in an attempt to escape with the help of a company called \\"Travel in Time, Inc.\\" They go to Mexico in 1938, but are pursued by a government agent who forces them to come back to 2155.\\"The Visitor\\" -- This story takes place on Mars, which is used as a quarantine for people with deadly illnesses. One day, the planet is visited by a young man of eighteen who has the ability to perform thought transference and telepathy. The exiles on the planet are thrilled with his ability and a violent fight breaks out over who will get to spend the most time with their visitor. In the struggle, the young man is killed and the escape he provided is lost forever. Because of the man's abilities, it is possible that he caused the men to hallucinate his injury, or even the entire struggle, and escaped when they believed him to be dead. The facts that he encouraged the fighting and seemed calm and amused throughout the story points to this outcome. Regardless, he is dead to the people of Mars.\\"The Concrete Mixer\\" - A reluctant Martian soldier is forced to join the army as they prepare to invade Earth. However, when they arrive, they are welcomed by a world at peace, full of people who are curious rather than aggressive. The protagonist meets a movie director, and it becomes clear that the people of Earth have planned to exploit the Martians for financial gain. He tries to escape back to Mars, but is run over by a car and killed.\\"Marionettes, Inc.\\"-A man attempts to escape his marriage by replacing himself with a robot to fool his wife into thinking he hasn't left and tells a friend about it. The man comes back and tells the robot to go back into the box, and the robot disobeys him saying he has fallen in love with the wife. The robot then proceeds to put the man in the box and goes to visit the wife. Later, the friend discovers that his wife has left and that he has been living with a robot version of her.\\"The City\\" -- A rocket expedition from Earth lands on an uncharted planet to be greeted by a seemingly empty City. As the humans begin to explore, they realize that the City is not as empty as it seems. The City was waiting for the arrival of humans; the contingency plan of a long dead civilization, put in place to take revenge upon Humanity after their culture was wiped out with biological weapons by humans long before recorded history. Once the City captures and kills the human astronauts, the humans' corpses are used as automatons to finalize The City's creators' revenge; a biological attack on the Earth.\\"Zero Hour\\" -- Children across the country are deeply involved in an exciting game they call 'Invasion'. Their parents think it's cute until it turns out that the invasion is real and aliens are using the children to help them get control of Earth.\\"The Rocket\\" -- Fiorello Bodoni, a poor junkyard owner, has managed to save $3,000 to fulfill his lifelong dream of sending one member of his family on a trip to outer space. The family, however, finds it impossible to choose who will go because those left behind will inevitably envy the chosen one for the rest of their lives. Bodoni instead uses the money to build a replica rocket from an old mock-up, and sets up a 3D theater inside the cabin and convinces the children they are actually going through space."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I've read many of the 1 star reviews of this book. And I repeatedly told them that to enjoy any science fiction, you must suspend their disbelief. The reader must judge the truth of what happens within the scope of the world created by the author, not by the world as we know it.Sure there are always going to be opinions and I take that for granted.Keeping in mind that Ray Bradbury has an uncanny way of introducing and writing his works, and his works bieng VERY odd. YOu find some brutal truth in this book, it's a difficult analogy to distinguish, but as you read the book, you see that he is showing us what we, humans, are really like, and not the side that we are exceptionally proud about.Agreeing with the other reviews, it is one of he \\"must-have\\" books, though not really considered a classic, it should be. It is not one of those books that transports you places like high fantasy. It's one of those books that you have to read and accept what is happening, then think alot about it.I thought it was an exceptional peice of work of Science Fiction i've ever read and I enjoyed it very much, even having to face the fact that there's a bad side to us, and you can't avoid it.Can you believe this is coming from a 14 year old? Well you better!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"There seems to be one misconception running through a lot of these reviews. The misconception is that The Illustrated Man should be viewed as a novel. It IS NOT a novel. I repeat: NOT A NOVEL. The Illustrated Man is an excellent work of literature, but it is a collection of loose stories. Even those who say that the stories have a loose theme are not stressing the point enough, it seems. The stories are barely tied together at all.The stories themselves are superb, and classic Bradbury. Among the best are The Veldt, about technology and what can go wrong with it; Zero Hour, about an innocent game that may not be so innocent; Marionettes, INC., a classic sci-fi story also about the misuse of technology; The Long Rain, a psychological roller coaster through the future of mankind; and No Particular Night or Morning, a wonderful philosophical story about space and what it can do to a man's mind.Again, you should view these stories as ones in a short story collection, not a full novel. But they are essential Bradbury and essential science fiction, like most of his works of literature."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"One hot summer day, our narrator meets the Illustrated Man. When the man strips off his stifling long sleeves, he reveals the Illustrations, which decorate every inch of his bare skin. But, as he warns the narrator, they are more than Illustrations: at night, they come to life, change, and spell out stories. That night, the narrator watches these stories--and each becomes a short story in Bradbury's collection. From living houses to ever-raining Venus to the Martian invasion of the commercialized Earth, these often-harrowing science fiction stories range on all topics and all skill levels. Some of the stories are incredible and haunting; others are bulky or uninspired. It is a mixed bag and not as good as some of Bradbury's other collections, but the framing of the Illustrated Man and the golden nuggets sprinkled within make it an imaginative and worthwhile read. Tentatively recommended.It is particularly difficult to review short story collections because quality can and does vary from story to story, making it hard to summarize and judge the book as a whole. The median quality of this book is not exceptional, and it is not my favorite of Bradbury's short story collections (that would be The Machineries of Joy and The Martian Chronicles, which is not quite a short story collection but is close). The reason for this is simple: some of the stories are uninspiring--neither harrowing or scientific, they're vaguely satirical but without cutting witticism, making them instead simply bland. These uninspiring short stories drag down the overall quality of the book.Some of the other stories, however, and the framing of the Illustrated Man, are simply brilliant. For me, these include The Veldt, The Man, The Long Rain, The Rocket Man, and Zero Hour, and make up about half of the stories in the book. They range from incredible concepts to haunting ideas to wistful, more personal stories, and are all written in Bradbury's clear, precise, honest prose.I recommend The Illustrated Man on the basis of these outstanding stories. As a whole, the collection is a bit wanting, but taken individually, there are definitely some stories worth reading. Fans of Bradbury's writing will especially enjoy this book, and the short-story format makes it accessible to all readers. And when it is good--it is very, very good."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Great to revisit Ray's works read when I was a teen in the 60's. An alternative perspective is what I need to be reminded of."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The book is a good read with the short stories and the relevance to today's world is striking is some of those stories. The stories are mainly from the late 40's and early 50's and show a haunting look at what could be. There are, however, some stories that do drag and really don't hold the readers attention, but, thankfully, these stories are few and far between.Overall, the book is a great read and has excellent re-reading potential."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors, has a definitive flair for writing short stories like nobody else can. They are colorful and imaginative, with a certain spookyness flecking many of them. The Illustrated Man is my favorite collection of his stories. Each one is brilliantly written and unique."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The book \\"The Illustrated Man\\", by Ray Bradbury is a book of many lessons and themes. \\"The Illustrated Man consists of many shorts stories, each having their own theme. Most of the stories take place in the future and shows the reader a glimpse of how the future can be. Yes I recommend this book because we can relate the book to our life.\\"The Illustrated Man\\" does not just predict our future, but also shows what can happen because of human nature such as greediness and selfishness. It shows that these actions may lead to the death of loved ones or yourself. An example in the book is in the story, \\"The Veldt\\", when the two children Peter and Wendy do not want their parents to take away the nursery room so they tricked them to go inside and the parents were murdered by lions. Therefore, these are the reasons why I recommend this book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I think that the book The Illustrated Man is a fun book to read. It has many interesting short stories prognosticate things about the future. The author Ray Bradbury uses many descriptive words, that describe sorrow, happiness and suspense. By reading each story, the reader gets the sense that he/she is part of the story and not just a person reading a normal story book. The story begins with the narrator meeting the illustrated man. The illustrated man reveals to him the truth of his illustrated images, telling him that each colorful picture tells a story. Unable to hold his curiosity, the narrator watches it move.Stories about the future were told on his back, they were stories that taught people to watch for their actions because it might lead them to a destructive future. Each story has it's unique meaning and significance. They are great lessons to be learn. The book is not only fun to read but it is also warnseveryone reading it to becareful for each step that we take in our life. Every little step can change not only your future but the future of others too."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man leads the reader into the premises of the past's perspective of the future. As expected, Ray Bradbury created a quilt of 18 dark and chilling yet delightful stories that leaves the reader astonished and wondering how close this forecast of the future really is to the present world. This novel begins with a man meeting an \\"illustrated\\" man. This \\"illustrated\\" man has magical future-telling stories woven into his body. Bradbury creates captivating and vivid images that leaves an imprint in the reader's mind and thoughts.In the beginning, I was hesitant about reading this book because I do not find science-fiction stories to be enjoyable. Instead, I found a book that I deem to be engaging and pleasant to read. This book contained no particular quotes that stood out to me, but the ironic story \\"Marionettes Inc.\\" made me think about the possible problems and situations that are able to appear with the increase of technology. Though The Illustrated Man was an overall enjoyable book, I do not look too fondly to the menacing outlook of the future created by Bradbury. I believe that the Illustrated Man should not be required to be read. Thought this book contains many lessons that are required to be learned, it may create thoughts of depression and uninterrupted distrust."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"\\"Listen, Keep your ears clean, smell the smells of a rocket. Feel. Remember. So when you return you will talk of it all the rest of your lives.\\" The Illustrated Man should be required reading. Author Bradbury, Ray well organized eighteen tales, fill with life questions and answers. Although most of the stories were not carrying a person along, however it gave an astonished notion to people. The way he forecasted the future was closely related to the present world. It was also startled that he had thought of this concept and idea before 55 years ago. After finishing the novel, it made me surprise of the prodigy idea and richness words of Bradbury.I have an opinion that The Illustrated Man should be all state required books for all teens. I think it brings new views of teens about the coming generation."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Bradbury reigns as the quintessential craftsman of sci fi literature in the 50's. This anthology represents stories which were published in several periodicals, mostly set in the distant future. The locale ranges from Earth to Mars and Venus, or just anywhere out in space. We witness Invasions from both points of view: Earth being invaded and Earth men as the invaders. He presents different ways Earth men use the planets, as well as the concept of Christianity in alien worlds. Some tales deal with time travel and a few would make wonderful \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes.The introductory tale, which provides the name for the anthology as a whole, is grimly completed in a brief Epilogue. A traveler in what might be a Depression era encounters a strange man along the dusty road and offers to share his supper with him. He winds up spending the night in the open with this weirdly decorated man, who admits that he is shunned even by carnivals-where freaks are usually welcomed. His entire body is covered with colorful and bizarre tattoos--which he has spent a lifetime trying to remove. What is the curse of these odd illustrations, which cause normal men to send him away or rush off screaming in horror?This is Vintage Bradbury, who inspired a generation of sci fi writers. His fantastic imagination and knowledge of human behavior combine to produce entertaining trips to realms of fantasy and science fiction. After the odd sightings and rumors regarding Roswell in the late 1940's, America was poised on the frontier of space exploration. Thus Bradbury's anthology and an armchair provided readers with their own rocket ship to the skies. Although these tales precede the term \\"Astronaut,\\" this author will effortlessly launch you into astral realms of fancy and the inner sanctum of the human soul. Fortunately the innate qualities that make us Human are still present even in the 22nd century."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"These are stories that go beyond &quot;science fiction.&quot; The technology aspects are part of the canvas, but these stories are powerful because Bradbury paints with emotion and metaphor. He builds more empathy with characters in a few short words than other authors do in an entire novel, and his descriptions return us to a time when we were young, and simple objects filled us with awe and wonder.There is something here for everyone. Read them for yourself. Read them for your children. This short book is a celebration of the art of storytelling."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"i read this book in 4 days! it's a truely moving book! it's honestly one of the best books i have ever read. ray bradbury really pinpoints the human condition in this masterful collection of short stories! i would read this book over and over again. i deffinatly reccomend it for anyone that is a fan of brabury's work or even a fan of science fiction. i have reccomended this book to everyone i know, and you would be seriously missing out if you never read it."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The book I am reviewing is The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury.

He also claims that she said that each tattoo tells a story about the future. The man soon finds that this is true, seeing stories about space travel and the end of the world.

These stories are like a video that show what's going to happen in the future. Some of these events were horrific and some were quiet humorous but they all told of the events that were to come.I didn't like the book much it was confusing and it was always changing settings and characters. I also disliked how every story left you in a cliffhanger. I also didn't like the fact that the book didn't have a definite climax which in my opinion is essential to a good book. I happen to like fiction books but the illustrated man was just bizarre. I don't really qualify this book as a novel. It's more like and anthology of fictional stories. I don't think it should be required reading because like I said before it's more of an anthology.Even though I didn't like the book I do have to admit that it did have some outstanding features such as its extensive use of imadry and imagination. When I read the book I would get lost in it. It was as if I was rite there in the story and it was very good w/ the imagination.My two favorite stories were \\"The Long Rain\\" and \\"Marionettes Inc.\\"The reason I liked the long rain is because it has such a great sensory details that really actually made me feel I was on Venus with the crew. I liked Marionettes INC. because it was the only story that I found comical.In conclusion I believe that The Illustrated Man should not be required reading. Nevertheless I still recommend it to people."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Perhaps one of the most interesting books I have ever read, The Illustrated Man is the captivating story describing eighteen illustrations inhibited on a man's body. Each of these eighteen tales are so interesting that you won't want to put the book down, and that is an honest opinion. I was hesitant at first about enjoying this book, mainly because I have never read a science fiction novel before, but the use of science is almost unnoticeable. To explain, a lesson seems to be just as easily and commonly learned on unknown Mars as it is on our familiar Earth. For those science-shy readers like myself, the first tale might seem odd since it involves futuristic machines; but as the story progresses, a living city on Venus is nothing new or weird to read about.You would not have to ask twice if I recommend this book. I definitely believe The Illustrated Man should be required reading as well for the reason that it opens your eyes to distinct styles of writing. Many books have become classics due to their captivating storylines, lovable characters, suspenseful climaxes, and breath-taking endings, but this book should be considered a classic for its uniqueness alone.In conclusion, reading can take you anywhere, and Ray Bradbury definitely proves it."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man was a journey into the future. It gave us ideas on what the world would soon become. It dealt with real life issues such as, war, nuclear bombs, and death. It explained to us that the way we are living now will soon cause the world to be a far worse place then it should be.Ray Bradbury brought its reader to places other than earth. He brought us to Venus, Mars, and put us in the middle of a meteor shower. His imagination reached new heights that many authors are not capable of reaching.The Illustrated Man was a sensational read that encouraged your mind to think pass the boundaries of logic and into fantasies. Ray Bradbury wrote in a way that gave the illustrated man life. You could see the stories unfold and take place. You could see the parents die in \\"The Veldt\\" and feel the constant rain hit you on Venus in \\"The Long Rain\\". That is why The Illustrated Man should be required reading because it worked your mind in a way that was educational and interesting.by: Jade Green"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The book The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is about a man who has 18 different \\"illustrations\\" tattooed on his body.

My favorite story was \\"Marionettes Inc\\". It was my favorite story because it kept you guessing throughout the whole story. The ending was unexpected and shocking. When I read the last page of the short story it made me want to know what would happen next! I was wishing Mr. Bradbury had done a \\"Marionettes Inc. 2\\"! I definitely enjoyed every second of the story. Personally I think it was one of the most attention grasping stories out of the 18 stories.I do not think this book should be required to read for school because it is not a genre that everyone is interested in. At times the stories were interesting and made you want to turn the pages to find out what would happen next to the characters. But, honestly at times I felt like there was too much death. It seemed like all the stories would display negativity, gruesome deaths, and OUTER SPACE!! The majority of the short stories were about Mars and aliens.

One quote that I liked was \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Don't start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\"(p.106) I liked that quote because I can relate to it.Some of the stories that stood out to me that i liked were \\"The Veldt\\", \\"The Other Foot\\", and \\"The Rocket Man\\". Those stories had interesting conflicts and showed the nature of human kind.

It is full of fantasy stories, and some are even depressing. I didn't really enjoy it because it's not in range of my interest. Also, the format of the book is short story, and i'd rather stick to a novel with only one story.The thing I liked about this book is the different morals in each stories. I don't favor any quotes in the book, but i like one moral of a story, and that is to live life to the fullest. I would recommend this book to be read in school because not everyone reads a book like this, and it's a good experience for students to read different kinds of books. Maybe they'll end up liking it and it can motivate them to read more of these fantasy stories."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book definitely had some interesting ideas about space and the future. Some of the ideas were really futuristic and I wondered if they could really happen, but the stories had main points that were obvious through the storyline. I loved how Bradbury used these futuristic stories to bring out important issues like racism and greed. In \\"The Other Foot\\" he showed how carried away people can get with technology; they started killing the other and basically destroyed Earth. He also showed that we can always get over our differences when the blacks showed compassion to the white man.My favorite story would probably be \\"The Fire Balloons\\" because the aliens turned out to be good and the Fathers had planned to minister to them, but had an important lesson taught to them instead. I wonder if that's really what aliens look like, or if they exist. If they did exist,would we look like them when we landed on their planet? Would they be violent or nice?I liked the way Bradbury wrote the book with individual stories, because he made you think about the meaning of each story. If he had used chapters that related to each other, we would think less about different ideas and think more about the same idea. This book made me want to read his other books. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is about man with illustrations all over his body that move and each one tells a story which make up the eighteen chapters in the book.

The character developments were captivating and so were the conflicts.I thought that this novel is one of the most intriguing science fiction books I have read. Although I didn't like or agree with some stories like \\"the Last Night of The World\\" because who would actually not panic and have a normal day with their family knowing that they are going to die with in 24 hours. \\"The Fire Balloons\\" was ridiculous because that the priests thought they have to preach Christianity to Martians but what if they don't believe in it and what if they have their own religions and the priests should not have the right convert the Martians. The Martians should have the right to choose to believe Christianity.Although I am a huge fan of science fiction I honestly think that this book should not be on the required reading list because I found this book mundane and I felt Bradbury had to many stories about Martians."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The book, The Illustrated Man is an exquisite and unique novel written by Ray Bradbury.

They talked about the future and I was skeptical about this at first because with all that technology it could make life so much easier and people wouldn't be able to experience the mistakes that they need in order to live their lives to the fullest.

It got me thinking if I actually lived today to the fullest. There would be SO many things that I would not get to fulfill and so many things that I wasn't able to tell so many people. I think I liked it the most because it actually got me wondering.I think that this book should be required reading because it contains alot of morals on life.

Most times I don't read it all the way through but it doesn't matter. It's really really really good. Don't pass it by. BUY IT. really"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I can't believe I have never read Ray Bradbury before. \\"The Illustrated Man\\" is a collection of eighteen short stories tied together with a linking theme. The stories are linked by the actual Illustrated Man, who has designs scrawled all over his body that represent tales beyond your imagination. Although Bradbury is famous for his eerie ways of writing, many of these stories are thought-provoking and heartbreaking, but are still filled with science fiction wonder. The tales range from scary (\\"Marionettes Inc.\\") to downright depressing (\\"The Long Rain\\"). The book is amazingly addicting, and is perfect for science fiction and fantasy readers."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is my second favorite book by Ray Bradbury (Martian Chronicles being the first). I have read it countless times and will continue to do so. I could never get bored with it or anything Bradbury has written for the simple fact that reading his stories is a chance to see something terrible and dark and yet fascinating and beautiful. Getting kinda zen there. Bradbury does that to you. The Illustrated Man, like The Martian Chronicles, is more a short story collection woven together by a central theme. Here we have The Illustrated Man...not tattooed, but illustrated. The illustrations were done by a witch and he has been on the road searching for her ever since she put them on evey inch of his flesh. And when he finds her...he's going to kill her. Why? Because the illustrations move, they are magic, and if you watch for any length of time, they'll tell you a story.\\"The Veldt\\" is probably my favorite here, as is \\"The Long Rain.\\" \\"The Other Foot.\\" \\"The Highway.\\" \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" So many great stories ranging from Sci-Fi to horror to whatever it is that Bradbury weaves for us.Dig it!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Not that Bradbury's work needs any more reviewing, but this is one of my favorite short story collections. While the stories themselves are fantastic as always, the narrative which ties together the book is the most intriguing story of them all. The end of this book always makes me shiver, just a little, a power no other author has over his craft and readers.Second only to Fahrenheit 451, this book should be in classrooms, libraries, and homes everywhere."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This fine collection of short stories is my favorite by Bradbury. Bradbury writes humanistic stories with a poet's heart, using the sci-fi genre to place people into circumstances not otherwise possible in the here and now. By putting people into alien surroundings, Bradbury can render the human essence - sometimes noble and other times ignoble. Each of the stories comes alive in turn and exhibits a different aspect of humanity."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This work from the greatest writer of science fiction's golden age contains legendary stories end to end. Set on the earth of the past, present and future, as well on a host of foreign worlds in the most distant reaches of space, Bradbury offers up a full range of tales from scary musings about mortality and human destiny, to fantastic glimpses into the reality that might lie ahead. Bradbury's imagination caresses the written word and gives his creations a power that won't be found anyplace else. The Illustrated Man is a life-affirming vote of confidence that (for good or for ill) other ages of man are yet to come."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a great science fiction book. I like this book because it takes you away into stories that can relate to your own life. You can largely relate to this book even though it is sci-fi.Brad Bury deeply describes the imagery and details of this book to make the stories connect with you in a way other books might not. I also like this book because it has a futuristic touch to it and it kinda foreshowdows our own future.If you are into sci-fi books, i strongly recomend you reading this book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This beautifully written science fiction book, written by Ray Bradbury, holds within it's mysterious covers, eighteen short stories. Each one that will capture and captivate it's reader. Fantasies that touches upon a person's wildest dreams, each story that sensually appeals to the senses. Not every one of them ends in a happy ever after, which makes it feel so much more real than even the best written fantasy books.Now personally, I dislike this book. No, I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE it. Such negativity! Such antagonistic thinking! At times while reading this, I had to put the book down while wearing a face of disgust. A favorite quotation? None. I was too involved with glaring at it to pick one out. The ONLY story that actually pleased me was \\"The Other Foot\\". It was one of the few stories that really spoke out to me. I rather read novels than the short stories that end on a bad note. It's as if the story is building up to a climax then suddenly stops only to skip on to another story to simply annoy me. I prefer books that give off a feel of optimism and cheerfulness with a good ending rather than finishing off so quickly as if it impatient to go on to another story.The Illustrated Man should not be required reading. Half the time, it talks about the impending doom of Earth. Great...we all know that the end of Earth is inevitable but MUST the author continue poking and prodding the gruesome idea of it? He even comes up with ways of how the Earth will end. There is the nuclear war, a WWIII, an atom war...OH LOOKY! There's even one where Earth just \`ends' for no reason at all. I prefer to read things that makes me laugh until I am out of breath and leaves me a happy feeling. Perhaps I'm being a bit cynical of it but this is how I feel about this book. Yet I am not trying to discourage people to read this lovely book. A large part of it revolves around celestial bodies and outer space. Feel free to read if you're a person who prefers short stories and scientific stories that deals with space, martians, and space, this book was probably made just for you."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"If you are not a die-hard Bradbury fan do not waste your time with this book. It is pretty much a campy (ie. rockets, space, mars, etc.) collection of space stories. There are a few stories here with interesting views and/or concepts, but for the most part it's a poorly written, redundant, and slow paced book.If you are going to read Bradbury for the first time or are new to his writing I would recommend \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man was not a interesting book to read. It never appealed to me. Maybe I am biased because I never liked science-fiction, but not only that, this book was the pinnacle of confusion. I had to read a story from the book twice just to get the point of a story.Even though i disliked this book, I did like quotes from the book. My favorite quote of this book is, \\"More than food or a woman or amything, I just want Earth.\\" This quote shows that people need Earth. Living on Earth is blessing and people don't know that.Despite me not liking the book, this book should be read. You learn many things from the book. It had many points and can be used to teach many things in life. Although this book had good points, it did not have thing that captivates you to read a book. It took be a month to read this because the book was not interesting."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is good for those in the psychological part of the work force. It is good for everyone else too, since it has several stories with in it, on top of a main one."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"If you have dreams of going beyond in outer space, and if you are a big historian, this is the book for you. I gave this book three stars because it wasn't the best book I have ever read but it wasn't the worst. This book has eighteen small science fiction stories. This book was very confusing but fascinating. If you are not able to understand the stories in the beginning chances are you will eventually understand them in the end. This book is framed by the tale of a man who made fun of a witch from the future. The witch put eighteen illustrations on him, and if you stand next to the illustrated man your life is like a open book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustraded was a good book, and reminded me of Farenheit 451. Which was also a good book that Ray Bradbury wrote. The book is mostly about space, time-travel and robots. It was exciting and also boring at times. Overall I think he could have made some of the stories a bit more excitng."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"&quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; consists of some of Ray Bradbury's many short-science-fiction-stories. While the first couple of stories may interest you, you will later find yourself bored by repeated subjects, settings, and characters.Ray Bradbury tends to write excessively about space, so if you are a space fanatic, this is the book for you. Otherwise, you will soon realize Bradbury's style, and constantly you will find yourself knowing what will happen on the next page.Bradbury's imagination and vivid descriptions are at times interesting, however. At times his writing style can get to be irritating. True potential, but not a thoughtfully put-together collection of Bradbury's works."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book, personally, I think, is very interesting, to say the least. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Sci-fi because thats basically what it is. Every chapter contains a new story, so it reads more like a collection of short stories that have nothing to do with each other, when if fact they all do, because they are all on the Illustrated man.Though I found some stories to be a bit confusing, and slightly frustrating, (since some I still didn't understand when finished.)All in all though the book was very catching, i.e. I couldn't put it down because the plot lines were very original and you never knew what to expect."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I know this is brief, but I just wanted to send out a quick survey on what people thought there favorite story was. Personally, mine was The Veldt. It's one of the stories that is truly scary, not just in shock value, but in how it stays with you. Especially when you see how much more advanced all the different video game consoles are getting. If you have friends, neighbors,brothers, sister, sons, daughters, or all of the above who enjoy nothing more than to sit down for hours inside the world of the game; than you are sure to find a good scare in The Veldt.P.S. I only gave this one start to attract the attention of other people like me who enjoy reading all the one star reviews to their favorite books. :)"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I don't mean to offend Ray Bradbury, but I didn't understand half of this book. I mean, some of the stories are quite unique, but once I read on and on about the other stories, I got so confused and bored. I didn't like this book much."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when i had to read Farenheit 451 for a summer assignment in my freshman accelerated english class.

Theire is so much imagination in this story that it is impossible for any lover of good stories not to be drawn into them. Probably one of the last great sci-fi writers. The last descent science-fiction book was probably in the mid-70s. Another shame: I can find about fifty diffrent Star Wars books and Star Trek manuals in my bookstore, but only one Bradbury book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This is a really nice version of an *excellent* book. Other editions I've seen have teensy, tiny little print. But this \\"Flamingo Modern Classic\\" version is very readable!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man arrived in excellent condition and was everything I could have hoped for."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Bradbury is a good story teller, though a lot more compelling in a earlier time when one is young. Some of the stories are first rate because they deal with the timeless themes of human nature. The Veldt (the first story in the collection) is the best in the book and I was moved as well by \\"The Rocket Man\\", a story about grief and loss beautiful in its simplicity. Also, the device of the Illustrated Man still works on a second read and is a stroke of inspiration.Some of the stories are not good literature from a writing or character development perspective, but are extremely clever and fun -- neat ideas that would make (or have made) great Twilight Zone stories. My favorite is the time traveler story.One story (No Particular Night or Morning) is deeply philosophical in nature. The character portrayal is not convincing but the philocophical idea of space travelers who are compelled to question their own existence is about as good and interesting an exposition of a philsophical issue as you'll ever find.Many stories are clunkers, I'm afraid -- the situations are usually interesting but the characters are wooden and not believable.Also fascinating is how science ficition ages with time. The vision of the future tells us more about the past than anything else. No one seems to have foreseen cell phones, the internet, and the communications/information revolution (although Arthur C. Clarke in Childhood's End comes close). You can harldy fault Bradbury for this, but it's interesting how the futurists simply extrapolate their current world into the future -- i.e., brute machines are the rage in 1950, so they imagine even better, more brutish machines in the future.For all his limitations as a writer, Bradbury has written some classic stories that I would include in a literary anthology for this period. I therefore recommend that you read or re-read this book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I think it was first my 8th grade teacher Mrs. Forenza who introducted me to Ray Bradbury when we studied the story \\"The Veldt\\"... then it was my father who opened his bookshelves and gave me his entire collection of Ray Bradbury when I asked him if he ever heard of him.The Illustrated Man is my favorite out of all of Ray Bradbury's books. I still cannot believe that this novel was written during the 1950's. He is quite prophetic in the stories... and my favorite one that I now committed to memory...The VeldtThank you dad, thank you Mrs. Forenza..."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury was a very unique novel. It is not like any other book. The short stories can relate to our life because it talks about selfishness, greed, and racism. I enjoyed reading this novel even though it was science fiction. This book contains a lot of imagery and scenery, which made this novel exciting. I liked this book because I read a lot of unexpected things, which made it more interesting.My favorite quote was from the chapter, \\" The Veldt.\\" \\"Children are carpets, they should be stepped on occasionally.\\" This quote is true because parents who let their children get their own way, may become spoiled. If parents let their children take advantage of them, it will become a habit and they can get out of control. Children should be taught at a young age and should be raised properly.I think this book should be required reading because there were many themes in the novel we all can learn from. Ray Bradbury's novel is filled with his imagination, which can take you on an adventure."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Illustrated Man. I especially liked reading The Veldt.The way Ray Bradbury described the nursery was amazing.I could imagine myself in it, with the vulture's shadow on the floor while it flies above.I think that he should write another story like it.I also liked reading The Other Foot.It was interesting to read what a colored person would do if the shoe was on the other foot. I think it makes people see that there really isn't a difference in people of different races and colors.It also shows that when you hold a grudge, it hurts yourself more then it hurts anyone else.I agree with Gandhi when he said \\"An eye only ends up making the whole world blind\\" Its true, because in they end, getting back at someone doesn't help you be a better person."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Ray Bradbury's book The Illustrated Man, was an intriguing and suspenseful book. Each short story was interesting in many ways. Although I didn't have a favorite quote, I did have 3 favorite short stories that I enjoyed reading. They were \\"The Veldt,\\" \\"The Rocket Man,\\" and \\"The Man.\\"What I enjoyed reading the most was the Prologue, because it gave you an idea of who this Illustrated Man is and since Ray Bradubury's writing style is very descriptive and detailed I could picture what this man looked like. It also gives you an explanation why The Illustrated Man's is called the Illustrated Man."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and I must say The Illustrated Man is one of the greatest books I have truly ever read. It is about an odd man, with tattoos all over his body, but there's a catch; each tattoo pertains to a tale forecasting the future. Ray Bradbury's creativity, imagination, and unique style of writing took me to a whole new realm. The suspense in this book leaves you hanging in thin air, pondering and allowing yourself to use your own imagination. Each story has its share of excitement, morals, and ethics portraying human nature & society. Though a science fiction, this book gives a new sense of realism. Bradbury's stories teach us that anything is possible to happen in the future, but we as human beings have greater control over it. This fascinating novel shows how we can bring destruction and death to the brighter side of life.Some stories were better than others, but that's in my perspective. One of my favorite stories would have to be \\"Kaleidoscope.\\" It makes you wonder, when you're faced with death eye to eye, what will you think of the life you lived then?I highly recommend this book, especially for school. In comparison to other books we are assigned to read, this one is very different and can spark your interest very easily; it deals with the complexity of the human mind. This book will surely captivate you as it did to me."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"&quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; is the ultimate culmination of mystery, suspense, action, intrigue, and science fiction. The book grabbed me from the moment I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was gripping and inventive at the same time, the fact that the novel was a collection of short stories tied together by one character gives sort of a fourth person perspective. There is a morbid, almost mean spirited side to the stories, but that only adds to the philosophical and intellectual value of the book. All science fiction readers would love this novel."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"It is a good book ,but it is dark and violent. In the story &quot;The Visitor&quot; Saul learns that if many people fight over one thing it ends up wrong.Saul says &quot;We did not want to kill we killed.&quot; I learned that to much of one thing can drive people insane. The book has good ideas , but makes them dark."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I was NOT forced to read this wonderful book, and I was NOT &quot;pulled away from video games and TV&quot; to read it (that &quot;stereotype&quot; offends me). I enjoyed this book because it had some ideas that I have never thought about before (no, not all 13 year olds are idiots who can't think deeply), such as ZERO HOUR. Some stories were neat because you could see what people thought the future would be like. It is a window into the darker side of technology and mankind, and is NOT RESTRICTED TO STEREOTYPICAL ADULTS-KIDS CAN READ IT TOO."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I have read the book for an assignment in honors English class. I am a high school student and I would like to ask a question to those &quot;children&quot; who suppossedly read the book. How old are you? Most of you who wrote reviews didn't deserve to put your crude comments in whereas you should not have read the book unless you were mature enough to read it. I thought that it was a pretty good book. It may not be one of his best, but it was good enough! I liked &quot;The Other Foot&quot; because it made me realize how much racist criticism there is in the world and it was great to read how they built a new sense of community =)"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Not only is the writing style cinematically vivid and descriptive, the content and ideas are the most creative, intriguing tales I have ever been lucky enough to read.When I got near the end of the book, I would check the table of contents after each story just to make sure there were a few more... eventually, there weren't any more, so now I'm here on Amazon looking for more stories of his.Those people who reviewed these stories as being 'very stupid'... you are entitled to your own opinion, but I can barely believe you even read the book.Thank you."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"this is one of the best books by bradbury ever written. r.i.p. ray bradbury your in a more peaceful place. not the dystopia we live in now.may you have a great journey."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"As a newly-minted high school reading teacher, my introductory book to spoon-feed to the young'ns was Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. It was a really good one to start with, as it had a fairly simple and uncomplicated storyline, a small cast of characters, and fairly well-defined themes and literary techniques. Therefore, teaching it to students who weren't native speakers (but whose English was really good nonetheless) was a good experience.I hadn't read a whole lot of Bradbury prior to that, and really fell in love with the book. F451 was a great read, and something I'll review here once I've let it settle down a bit in my head. After all, I've spent the last couple of months teasing every shred of meaning I could out of it, and that's not the kind of review I write here, now is it? Reading the book gave me a new interest in reading Bradbury, so I picked up a couple of short story collections and started to make my way through them. While I was talking to my department head about it, she recommended that I read The Illustrated Man, a copy of which she just so happened to have sitting around.The Illustrated Man is a collection of eighteen short stories, more or less unrelated, but brought together under the larger, over-arching story of the Illustrated Man himself. Our narrator, you see, meets a large man on the road. The guy is covered with tattoos, of the highest quality. Their colors are vivid, their details are lifelike, and the man says that, at night, the tattoos come alive. They tell stories, if you watch them long enough. And if you watch them too long, you may see your own future as well....Well, the narrator decides to watch as the Illustrated Man sleeps, and what he sees are the stories that are presented in this volume.By and large, the stories are unconnected to each other, which means we can go from a strange future where one family's house takes care of all their material needs to a poor farmer who manages to avoid the end of the world by being in one of his own. Still, there are a few thematic threads that run through the book that are interesting to look at.One of these themes is the way we relate to technology. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the first tale of the book, \\"The Veldt.\\" In this story, we meet a family who are completely dependent on their house. It's a technological miracle, where everything is completely automatic. The thought of actually cooking a meal is tantamount to barbarism, and their idea of taking a vacation means just shutting down the more obsequious functions of the house. One of these is the children's nursery. Akin to the holodeck, this room can replicate any environment that the users want. The children's fascination with the savagery of the African savanna worries their parents, though, and the threat of having the room shut down eventually becomes more than the children - or the house - can tolerate.In \\"The Concrete Mixer,\\" a Martian invasion force finds themselves overcome by the technology of Earth. Not the military technology, mind you, but the mindless, brain-destroying technology of leisure. Faced with TV and radio, casinos and bars, drive-in movies and fast food, the Martians discover that Earth is far more dangerous than they had ever expected. In \\"Marionettes, Inc,\\" Bradbury weaves a tale worthy of Philip K. Dick, telling about a very special service that will create an exact android duplicate of yourself. This robot will do all the tedious things in your life, such as go to work, do chores and tolerate your spouse. But what if the perfect robot duplicates are too perfect, and decide that they don't really want to do the drudgery anymore? In \\"The City,\\" a self-aware metropolis wakes up after twenty thousand years with the arrival of human astronauts - and immediately begins planning its revenge on those who left it so long ago.Another recurring theme in this collection is that of seeking happiness, through one means or another, and only occasionally finding it. In these stories, characters are looking for something that will make their lives worthwhile, or at the very least a little bit better. In \\"The Long Rain,\\" a group of explorers on Venus want just one thing - to get out of the eternal, unceasing rain that pummels the planet. The Sun Domes are their only shelter, if they can find one before they die or go mad. In \\"No Particular Night or Morning,\\" an astronaut searches for the only thing he can be absolutely sure of in this universe - nothingness.In \\"The Man,\\" a group of interstellar explorers are looking for a being, who may or may not be Jesus Christ, going from planet to planet and always finding themselves just a little bit too late. In \\"The Rocket,\\" a poor junkyard owner wants more than anything to fulfill his dream of showing his children outer space, and manages to do it in a slightly roundabout way. And in \\"Rocket Man,\\" a father tries to find what he really wants - to live among the stars or to stay with his family on Earth, and ultimately realizes that he wants - but cannot have - both.The stories in here are all pretty good, and there were a few I want to touch on in more detail. The one that I took the most notes on was \\"The Other Foot,\\" a tale of Mars and the shocking reversal of racial discrimination. In this story, Mars has been colonized by Black exiles from the United States, sent off-planet in an ultimate act of segregation. After decades of eking out an existence on that harsh planet, they learn that a rocket from Earth - probably containing a white astronaut - is on its way. The community reacts in a knee-jerk fashion, preparing a new apartheid on Mars - re-creating the worst of Jim Crow, only in reverse. When the rocket touches down and announces that nuclear war has destroyed everything the colonists had known and loved about Earth, and that white Americans had come to Mars to beg for the help of its citizens, the mob has a change of heart and decides to let bygones be bygones.As much as I hate post-modernism, I couldn't shut off my critic's voice while reading this story. I wondered if a story about Black oppression written by a white author must automatically be racist in nature, and I wondered if Bradbury's suggestion that Black colonists on Mars would, as a first reaction, try to re-create the worst conditions they had endured on Earth might not be rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of Black culture. Then the Intellectual Machine That Eats Itself (i.e. Postmodernism) began to ask if perhaps these thoughts were rooted in my own unacknowledged racism, at which point I had to just finish the damn story and move on. It's a question that probably wasn't asked fifty years ago, though, which makes the story an interesting one to revisit in our slightly more enlightened age.Another story that I really enjoyed was \\"The Exiles,\\" which has also been titled \\"The Mad Wizards of Mars.\\" In this tale, the great writes of fiction - and their works - are living (where else?) on Mars. There you can find Edgar Allan Poe and Ambrose Bierce living with Charles Dickens and Shakespeare. They're on Mars because Earth has been systematically destroying their works, and thus depriving them of immortality. When a rocket arrives from Earth carrying the last load of books to be destroyed, the fictionauts launch a last-ditch attempt to save themselves. With Poe leading their armies, they pour all of their power into stopping the rocket. Shakespeare's witches fling curses at the astronauts, and Poe summons all the armies of fiction to defend their existence.It's a story that you can tell Bradbury had a lot of fun writing, and is full of wonderful references to the authors he loves. Just the image of Edgar Allan Poe screaming defiance at the air is one that I will treasure every time I read the tale.What's really wonderful about this collection is that it's aged well. Published in 1951, it does suffer from some of the mid-century sci-fi tropes of the day, and modern writers would never be allowed to get away with something like a rainy Venus or humanity calmly accepting the end of the world. But they're still great stories, and well worth the read. So go read 'em.------------------------------------------------------\\"I am a frightened and an angry man. I am a god, Mr. Dickens, even as you are a god, even as we all are gods, and our inventions - our people, if you wish - have not only been threatened, but banished and burned, torn up and censored, ruined and done away with. The worlds we created are falling into ruin.Even gods must fight!\\"- Edgar Allan Poe, \\"The Exiles\\" (Ray Bradbury)------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"'The Illustrated Man' is a collection of futuristic stories by Ray Bradbury. Although the stories stand by themselves, most are set in the near future when Mars is colonized by humans. The stories typically have a humanistic/social angle rather than much in the way of action, although a couple fit decidedly in the horror genre. It is these futuristic horror stories that were most enjoyable.Bottom line: a hit and miss collection of early science fiction stories that, I suppose, might be best left to Ray Bradbury fans. Weak recommendation."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This was the first Bradbury I've ever read, and was much better than that horrible show on cable. Essentially, this is an anthology loosely linked by a wrap-around story involving the titular \\"Illustrated Man\\". A carnival worker laid up by a broken limb, he decided to get fully tatooed in order to get another job. Unfortunately, the artist who turns our hero into a walking canvas is something of a witch. It's peak season for carnivals when, on a later summer afternoon, he meets our narrator...... and there doesn't seem to be a carnival in America that will hire him. His tattoos become living stories when stared at by customers. With spaceships, monsters and other oddities covering every inch of his body, he has become an unwitting page on which Bradbury writes his awesome stories. (None of the fictitious carnival-goers care for the stories since, we're told by the Illustrated Man himself, they all end with the viewer's horrible death). As night falls, the illustrations come alive, and the narrator comes to see tales of:- astronauts forced to confront their doom as they drift in space after their spaceship suddenly explodes (years later, this would be parodied in the movie \\"DarkStar\\".)- a living city built by a race of aliens annihilated by Earthlings and unwittingly discovered by exploring humans;- Human explorers seeking their outpost on Venus where it never stops raining (this was a strangely prophetic take on Vietnam, right down to references to congressional funding for additional outposts)- A mother and son driven to desperation by the occupational hazards of the husband's/father's job as a rocket pilot;- A community of African Americans driven to colonize Mars in an effort to escape earthbound prosecutions now confronts survivors of Earth's last great war;- Tourists who are really refugees from an oppressive future and will do anything to keep from having to back (or forth I guess);- A family in a future age in which artificial intelligence and virtual reality affect almost every aspect of their daily existence (\\"The Veldt\\"; this cautionary and visionary tale of AI and VR run amok seems to have provided the basis for far too many episodes of ST:TNG, none of which have come close to matching its subversive quality.)And other tales of exotic aliens, distant planets, rocket ships and the end of the world. This is what science fiction sounds like when your characters can't mask what's going on with meaningless techno-babble."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I was introduced to this book in middle school and have loved it and recommended it to many people since then, mainly because of the rich storytelling and beautifully crafted imagery that only Ray Bradbury could create. Admittedly, it can be just a little confusing in some places, but there are very few classics that can be read in one sitting and completely understood. One of the best stories, and my personal favorite, is &quot;The Veldt&quot; because virtual reality is no longer the sci-fi topic it was when this story was written. This makes the story all the more chilling, especially considering all the time kids spend in front of the computer and tv! All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read, and I would recommend it to just about anyone over the age of 12 or 13."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Bradbury, like Jules Verne, uses his fiction as a telescope to look far into the future. Then, to remind us of the human element, his words become a microscope, looking deep into our minds and souls. \\"The Illustrated Man\\" combines these tools with chilling effectiveness.Although Bradbury penned these tales over fifty years ago, they still ring with cautionary truth. The prologue and epilogue work as bookends, holding in eighteen stories of apocalyptic and visionary wisdom. Through the moving and shifting tattoos on the illustrated man's back, we see glimpses of the future, full of technology, greed, strife, and the human propensity for selfishness. Collectively, these tales remind us that our relationships will always supercede our computers and rockets. When these elements lose perspective, danger lurks in every corner.Although some of the stories seem dated, \\"The Illustrated Man\\" educates while it entertains. Bradbury is a master of his craft, and this is a masterpiece of science fiction."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"\\"The Illustrated Man\\" is a collection of short stories that are loosely tied together as tattoos on the body of the Illustrated Man. The title character gives the impression that the stories told by his illustrations are so horrid that he cannot retain employment. But as the tales begin, the Illustrated Man becomes silent. As a result, the frame of the short stories never seems complete.The focus of most of the stories is space travel which may disappoint some readers as the theme does not seem to fulfill the horror that is promised. Still, there are several quality tales among this batch. \\"The Long Rain\\" is a realistic telling of a hike to safety on the planet Venus. \\"The Veldt\\" is a tale of a children's toy of virtual reality gone mad. \\"Marionettes, Inc\\" shows characters replacing themselves with robotic counterparts to vacation from their marriage. The final story, \\"The Rocket,\\" is the heart-warming tale of the group. A father creates a trip to space for his children in the adventure.As an early work of Bradbury, it is certainly not among his best. I was disappointed that the Illustrated Man was only used to frame the short stories. I would have loved to have seen parts of his story spread among this short story collection. In this format, it seems a good idea was lost."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of those rare science fiction authors who writes to provoke rather than simply entertain. His short stories, like his novels, are always deeper than they might seem at first glance, and require careful reading if you are going to get the most out of them. Happy endings are supplied only when called for, and for mood, there are few better writers anywhere.The Illustrated Man may just have the finest way of connecting otherwise disparate short stories together that has ever been thought of. We have all seen those who have tattoos, and many of them, if you ask, have stories behind each of their decorations. But what if the stories are real? The setting, therefore, is not a place but a person, a body, a human canvas.The stories themselves are of high quality. Some, like \\"The Long Rain,\\" still resonate; who among us hasn't been caught in a storm that never seems to end? The emerging madness of the characters is haunting, even if the Venus we know today is not the Venus of the story.Other stories are topical for the time of the book and are interesting for that reason. \\"The Other Foot,\\" for example, deals with racial segregation reversed on a future Mars. But of course, the issue of race remains a challenge for Americans even today, and so the story is still relevant.Other works of note include \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" which raises the question of the nature of sin: must it be physical? And the ideas found in \\"The Exiles,\\" about the degree to which fictional characters actually exist (later revisited in fascinating form by Joanne Greenberg in a story from her collectionWith the Snow Queen), raise questions about what it means to be real at all.This is a collection well worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Very interesting book. Never gets dull, as it is really a series of very short stories almost all of them concerning the nature of God.Bradbury comes out strongly against both religious people who are inflexible in their definition of God AND atheists. As an agnostic, I was actually a little irritated with parts of it, but you know, it would be hypocritical of me to expect Christians to take it, but not accept a little bit of criticism myself. So, just read it with a very open mind and a lot of curiosity about the world, and you'll love it."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is simply a must read for anyone who loves sci-fi. The book is divided up into smaller chapters--\\"stories\\" that are represented in each tatoo on the illustrated man. It is one of Bradbury's best books as is a classic."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a wonderful but slightly confusing novel. Ray Bradbury made the future seem so advanced, but then again very dangerous. In other words, human behavior has not changed very much according to this book. War is not a thing of the past. In fact, it's worse than ever. Our creations will end up getting the best of us and when it comes down to human life, there will be no such thing.As I read some of these intriguing short stories, it reminded me of current and past events. Death, death, and a little more death can be seen everywhere. Whether it is from old age, disease, or in some cases, nuclear warheads: death will always be our shadow. Human nature is inevitable and nothing we build will ever change our ways of living. Some one will always get greedy, someone will always want a little more.My honest opinion about whether or not this book should be required to read (this may sound childish) is no. When I think of summer vacation, I don't think of work. My sugarcoated opinion however slightly differs. I still do not think that it should be required to read because reading a book about mankind's tedious path to doom, to me, foreshadows upcoming events in my English class. Do not get me wrong, the book has its moments, but it's just not the thing I want to read during or before school."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is one of those books that can not be put down. It takes you to those far away places (such as Venus) that you've always dreamed about. You always wonder &quot;where next&quot; and you don't want this book to end. Once this book is opened you believe that the television is on but the words are forming all the pictures. I love how Bradbury put all these wonderful short stories together and only wish that someone would make another collection of other short stories so that the worlds teenagers and adults would have literature that they accually want to read."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is so beautiful. Ray Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as &quot;The Veldt,&quot; wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or &quot;Kaleidoscope,&quot; a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Wow! This book was inspiring, dazzling, brilliant, and all of the above. This was most definitely the best science fiction literature I've read in my memory. I enjoyed each of the different stories equally. It combines everything from astrophysics to imaginative fantasy. It shows how amazing the author Ray Bradbury truly is. I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I have never been more bewildered or sadened or even happy all in one sitting of reading this great novel. You are put on a journey to Mars and then through the mind until the only other place to go is the heart. Bradbury keeps you guessing as to what the next story could possibly be and how could it end. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I had to read this book as a summer assignment in my upcoming English II Honors class. The book started when a man meets The Illustrated Man and they have a talk about the illustrations on his body. The man begins to watch as the illustrations come to life and 18 stories come to pass as well as the mans own future.I found this book interesting but way too morbid. About 90% of the people in this book died horrible deaths. I was inclined to one particular story in \\"The Illustrated Man\\" called The Exiles, where my favorite quote \\"I find our situation amusing.\\" by Mr. Bierce is found. Other than that I found it to be not of my particular taste. The basis of the book where almost every story had to deal somewhat with space was good. I would probably recommend this to people who find space travel very interesting or who are very interested in science fiction.I don't believe that this book should be assigned to students to read because it's just a little bit too morbid and alot of people don't want to read about constant death."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This Book has a really interesting and unique style to it telling 18 fascinating stories through the art work painted upon a man. The stories told deal with many things generally regarding science fiction. Many of his stories are very strange and memorable but they tend to lean toward a grim side. More then a few of his stories tend to be a little depressing.Overall I have to say that Ray Bradbury did a great job bringing the stories to life and expressing each of the characters vividly to my mind. Also his vivid description of many of the settings could make imagine myself there and doing the things he described. Each one of his stories told of characters experiences and he told them in his own way. The stories pretained to many things many of which included Sci-Fi aspects. The stories dealt with many different things from the last minutes of a rockets crews life, the attempt of some clergymen to bring god to people who always had him or a destroyed civilizations final revenge upon it's destroyers.There are a few stories I felt did not live up to his others but since his writing is so broad many people are likely to have enjoyed the few I didn't. Even though this is a fact it did little to lessen the overall experience this book presents to it's readers.My Assessment is that this book is a good title to be required reading because it gives the reader a unique form of literature to experience and broaden their horizons. I say that this book is a great book especially for you Sci-Fi fans this is a great pick. The reason I only gave this a four was because although the book was great I can't help but compare it to other books particularly science fiction and I gave it a score accordingly. The score may not be a five but I would suggest to people who want to read an interesting book to pick this one up."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man, written by Ray Bradbury, is an extraordinary book that teaches many lessons and morals of life. In my opinion of this novel, I give more praise than criticism. I loved how the author ends each story with a sense of compassion for one of the characters or a sense of mystery, wondering what had happened next to that character. The stories I liked in particular are \\"The Rocket Man\\" and \\"Marionettes INC.\\"I chose \\"The Rocket Man\\" because of its sense of compassion for two of the main characters, its description of the outer depths of space and how the conclusion makes the reader reflect this story to your life. My favorite quote from this short story is when the rocket man's son asks him what's it like in space and the rocket man replies, \\"It's the best thing in a lifetime of best things.\\" This story teaches me that there is no place like home. Sure you may want to run away from it all, but in the end you will find yourself wanting to retrace your steps to place that you once had called home.As for \\"Marionettes INC,\\" I loved how the author creates the conclusion of suspicion between the each of the spouses and leaves you guessing what had happened to each of the characters. This story teaches me that robots or marionettes eventually evolve. (I learned that through watching the movie I, Robot.) Because these forms of technology will eventually evolve, humans must be careful of technology destroying the human race.I personally would recommend this book for other readers to read this book whether or not you are interested in scientific fiction because no matter what, this book teaches us all lessons of life that cannot be taken for granted.- Noelle EvangelistaGahr High School English Honors"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"PERSONALY i liked the book. The things that cought my interest was the storys iside of another story. Just fromthe storysi read Bradbury has a unique originality to hisstorys and that uniqueness is rare too come across.In this particular book Bradbury was genous when he wrote this book. aech story had a moral to to it. Some of the morals where life lessons. How he contructed each scene and setting wereamazing.reading The Illustrated Man is greate way to vocabulayand imagination. One of the quates that I liked the best was Sual walked along the shore of the dead sea. In other words it means Sual walked along a field of dead or dying bodies.I would recomend this to others because of the format or waythe book was written."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Illustrated Man. I especially liked reading The Veld. The way Ray Bradbury described the nursery was amazing. I could imagine myself in it, with the vulture's shadow on the floor while it flies above. I think that he should write another story like it. I also liked reading The Other Foot. It was interesting to read what a colored person would do if the shoe was on the other foot. I think it makes people see that there really isn't a difference in people of different races and colors. It also shows that when you hold a grudge, it hurts yourself more thn it hurts anyone else. I agree with Gandhi when he said \\"An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind\\" Its true, because in the end, getting back at someone doesn't help you be a better person."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I gave the book 3 stars because I didn't really like hte book. It really didn't grab my interest. I also got lost a couple of times. I didn't know how to coprehend some of the thing that the novel was saying. The reason i didn't give the book 1 or 2 stars because i did like two chapter of the book. The veldt and the other foot I thought that the veldt was cool because the house did everything for the children and i thought that was cool. I also thought that the other foot was cool too because I liked how the blacks let the whites live with them on mars."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated man had a lot of great stories that people would like, if they are intrested in stories that are helpful to people. My favirote story is the Long Rain it showed a lot about following your dreams as they follow you. He's trying to tell everybody how life is.I gave this book a four because, it shows how humanity will change for the better worest. I would recommend this book to all the agges 11 and up."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I like the story because it was very interesting and i like how they made the nursery look like they was in Africa. What I also like about this book is the way Ray Bradley put his imagination together and make a very funny and crazy book about these people life and how hard it was to live on mars and New York etc..What i dislike about the veldt is that the kids killed their parents because their parents felt that they was paying more attention to the technology and they respect it more then their parents so that is why they took it away but other then that the book was real fun to read."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The story, Illustrated man was a very interesting book. Telling many tories in one story. Thamt makes the book very unique. I suggest taht everyone reads this book. This book inspired me to read more fiction books. Since I never read to read these kinds of books. This book is also good for all ages.The book will be good for you fiction book lovers out there. He writes so much two word descriptions. Which enables you to picture the story as if you were there. It makes me feel like im making my own movie and my mind while I read this novel. Bradbury is now of of my all time favorite authors."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated man is a book containing eighteen stories, which will completely change the way that you perceive things. This book is unlike any other book I have ever read. It combines problems that we face today and problems that we may face in the future. The book showed me that more people are losing faith in god everyday and are starting to lie, cheat, and steal more often. All eighteen stories contained vivid descriptions, which made the stories very easy to visualize.Each story had its own unique perspective to how everything works, and left you asking questions like how do you know that something exists when you can't see it. Even though you know that it does, there is still no proof that you can keep with you.The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, was a spectacular book, especially for those interested in science fiction novels. This book truly was the greatest science fiction novel that I have ever read. I think this book should be recommended reading, not just because this book is truly awe-inspiring but also because it can help people all around the world think in new ways."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is filled with fascinating stories and morals that we all can learn from. Ray Bradbury has put much thought into his stories' themes such as love, hate, anger, regret, and most of all, hope. I was caught inside the author's descriptions as i read endlessly through the book. Even though the multiple stories are short, every character has personally bonded with me.There are many quotes in the book which would move every reader personally. In my opinion, one quote stood out among the others. \\"Love will fly if held too lightly, love will die if held too tightly.\\" At first, the quote was hard to believe, but as I read on in the story, I believed more and more in what the author wished to tell the readers.As a person that has taken this book closely to heart, I highly suggest this book to be a required reading item in schools. The morals that are taught in this novel should be wide-spread across the globe and throughout time."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I believe this book is a really great book because not only did i find the stories interesting, but they taught me lessons as well. I could relate to some of the stories in this book and reading this gave me a chance to reflect upon myself. There were stories filled with mystery, suspense, adventure, hardship, romance, and thrills. There were also heart warming stories and stories that would make you think. When I began reading the book, I thought it would be boring and dull just like some other books I read and would fall asleep reading it. The more stories I read, the more interested I became and was drawn to the book. I didn't want to put it down and that is why I finished the book in only one day.My favorite quote in the story was \\"There were differences between memories and dreams.He had only dreams of what he wanted to do, while Lespere had memories of things done and accomplished. And this knowledge began to pull Hollis apart, with a slow quivering precision.\\" This was my favorite quote because it tells you that you should live life to the fullest so that in the end you can die happy knowing what you have accomplished than die dreaming like you have been doing for all the years you lived, unsatisfied with your life.The Illustrated Man is a book that I would highly recommend everyone to read. This book consists of many stories each with its own theme and own moral. Though the whole book revolves around fantasy and science fiction, the overall meaning of each story can strongly relate to what we had to go through in the pass, what we're going through now, and what we may go through in the future. For example, the story Kaleidoscope showed us that the decisions you made in the past can greatly affect the way you think and act towards others, and that in the end all you will have are either dreams of what you wished you did or memories of what you actually accomplished doing. The story The Long Rain showed us that you have to stay strong during tough situations and never give up in order to reach what you truly desire. This is why I believe this book is a great book to read and is why I would recommend it to other people young and old."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is one of the most intriging and wonderful books I have ever read. It reveals the many different aspects of humans, both good and bad. The book is pure imagination, but at the same time, there is much reality in the book. Although some stories are dark and pessimistic, one dominant theme throughout the book is human understanding. All of the stories were spectacular, but in my opinion \\"The Kaleidoscope\\" was the greatest story of all of them. Floating in space with nothing but your crew's voices, waiting for your death to come is an awesome background.This book should be a required reading. It has so much material that could be used during discussions and many themes to choose for essay topics."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I really liked The Illustrated Man. I thought it was a really interesting book full of surprises and suspense. I really liked how the author used irony in the chapters. Although I did enjoy reading the book, I felt that the author used many feelings of sadness or depression. For example, most of the stories ended with the characters dying or not having a happy ending. My favorite quotation from the book came from the chapter Marionettes Inc.. It was a quote that Smith stated from an old poem; \\"Love will fly if held too tightly, love will die if held too tightly.\\" I really liked that quote because when I thought about it and how it related to the story, I realized how true it was.I think that this book should be required reading for incoming Sophomores. This book is very unique and teaches some really good life lessons. It also keeps you interested and want to keep reading to find out what happens next. I really enjoyed this book because when it was getting towards the end of each chapter, I would think that I had the ending all figured out, but then the author surprises me with a totally different ending than what I expected. I especially liked that at the end of the book when the author talked about the Illustrated Man choking the other man to death. It was a very interesting book that should be required."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"If you are into suspense and you are looking for a good thrill that will keep you reading, you should read, \\"The Illustrated Man\\".

I rated this book with four stars because of my personal opinions. I think this book is great to be required reading because you get to learn more about the short story structures and the styles that the author used. For example, using multiple points of view and changing narrators to give impact on the whole story. The way that the author described his ideas through the illustrations or tattoo in this book was great and fascinating. To me, it was fun to read all different kinds of short stories which mainly focuses on similar topic and that you get to learn great lessons, which relates to your life.But there were some parts that I really disliked about. Because the book was written in short stories, it was difficult to find the turning points or the actual conflict of the book, but it was still noticeable about the main idea of the book, which the author wanted the readers to find out. The book has a lot of unique stories that teaches you a lot of lessons.This book is great and I recommend this book to be required reading."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury was a pretty good book.

There's no doubt about it, The Illustrated Man is one of the best best books I've ever read.I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and I think it was a great book to end the summer with. It is perfect school material for teens everywere. And the best part, it's only 186 pages long. People who can't deal with 500 page stories, this book is a must."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The book, The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, is one of the most interesting Sci-Fi books I have read. Bradbury truly had a vision, to send man into the far parts of space. And he helped us capture that image. Showing what it may be like on the planet Mars, or Venus. At the same time, he wrote a lot of fictional stuff. Like, robots doing our daily chores for us, or just doing stuff that we can normally do ourselves. He has captured life taken over by machines.Who would have thought, that this book would have been such a life teacher. It has many quotes that we may hear in our everyday lives. One of my favorites in this book, talks about how we wish to be in places. When we are there, we want to be somewhere else. On page 71, the Rocket Man is talking to his son. He told his son not to become a rocket man. \\"I mean it,\\" he said. \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Don't start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\" I love that line, because I tend to do that sometimes. Especially, if you're a Christian. We can get hooked to this world instead of heaven. That's why this line could fit me.I think this is a good book to read. There are so many short stories, and many more quotations that could teach us about our own life. It's a good book for Sci-Fi fans, and for those who just like adventure with a moral in it. I recommend this book to everyone to pick up and read. I also gave the book a four out of five. Check it out at your local library, or better yet. Buy it here at Amazon.com, keep it and read it forever."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated man by Ray Bradbury. The novel was a brilliant novel which focused on a man who got tattoos all over his back . The tattoos moved and told there own story, and each one had its own story to tell. It focused on technology , rockets, and the future.The stories in the book that I enjoyed where The Veldt, The long rain , and Kaleidoscope. I enjoyed these stories because to me they had allot of adventure in them. These stories in particular, in my opinion , make you wonder about allot about things on different planets , and in different places.A favorite quote of mine was \\"This is Christ, in all his glory\\" from \\"Fire balloons\\". I liked this quote because it gives out hope. It gave hope to the men in the story. This quote gave them the courage to expand there ideas to others. It could also give hope to us readers.I believe that the book should be required for reading because it has many morals to the story. It is a science fiction book , and complicating to understand and times, but its worth the reading. Many lessons can be learned .

The tattoos that the illustrated man has tell eighteen stories about war, death, and new technology the future will have.In my opinion, every single story tells me a moral that I can use in my life. I never liked the idea of future technology because it may make people's life easier however, at the end; it creates hates, death, and war. I may be wrong; however, those events might happen for real.There was this one amazing quote that made me think a little bit more than others. That quote is \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Do not start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\" from \\"The Rocket Man.\\" It tells me that he does love his family and thinks they are very special to him but not as much as the rocket, he travels together. When he is with his rocket, he misses his family and when he is with his family, he misses his rocket, the air of the space. It is just like when you are with this one thing, you get tired of someday, and eventually you go to another thing and later on, you miss the old one, and maybe goes back and forth.I strongly disliked this book because it is mostly about death, miserable life, and war however, I strongly recommend this book to others because by reading this book, they won't make mistakes in the future."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury is an intriguing novel about a man who has tattoos all over his body. The tattoos are not ordinary tattoos. These tattoos are unique. The tattoos have the ability to move. Not only do they move, they foretell the future as well. The novel contains eighteen short stories regarding what the future holds. These stories are flooded with war, death, and new technology the future will bring.Each story is holds a moral or lesson that we could all use in our daily lives.

Don't let it get hold of you.\\" I agree with this quotation because when I am at home, I want to be somewhere else. When I am somewhere else, I want to be at home.I recommend this novel to people who like reading about science fiction and futuristic novels. The book is not always easy so you would have to read some stuff over. Once you get what you are reading, the book becomes really great and interesting.

At first I thought this novel would be boring and difficult to interpret but I was wrong. This novel was in fact alot more enjoyable and easier to read than I had expected. Although, I must admit, some of the short stories were indeed boring because it was either hard to understand what was going on or it just didn't hold my interest.\\"What would you do if you knew this was the last night of the world?\\" Pg. 90 This was my favorite quote because when I read it, it made me stop and think. What would I do? There would be alot that I would want to do and alot of things I would want to tell others. I like this quote best because it held my interest the most.When reading this novel, I highly suggest there be no distractions around because it is easy to get lost. Also I had to and suggest to really focus on what's happening because there may be some stories that may not hold your attention as much and cause your mind to drift.

The Illustrated Man also introduces many charactersthat are hard to remember.This book should be required reading for several reasons. First, the book is full of great imaginative descriptions.

His illustrations turn into reality and bring a new meaning into life.This imaginative book really gave me a different feeling on the future and how it will turn out to be. Some stories had astonishing endings which really surprised me. It was really hard to decide which one of the stories was my favorite one for I liked them all, but the one that really awakened me was \\"The Other Foot.\\"This book is full of surprises and suspense. Being an advocate of Ray Bradbury, I would not only recommend this book, but all of his piece of writing."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury. A MUST READ BOOK! This book is filled with so much imagination, creative characters and unique plots, that you will find yourself in a whole new world.The book consists of 18 short stories, each different, but tied together to form one amazing novel. The stories are told under a night sky by tattoos on the body of an Illustrated Man. These stories are so unique and interesting you will not be able to put the book down.These stories in particular, The Veldt, Marionettes Inc, and Zero Hour make you wonder where technology and the world will be in the years to come. These stories made me wonder if there really is life on Mars, or if it really does rain on Venus.This novel is one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read and should definitely be put on the must read list!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Even though I am usually not the type to read sci-fi stories I can honestly say I enjoyed The Illustrated Man, it gave me a different perspective of what the future might turn out to be and what we might have to reconsider in order to sustains the human race. The author, Ray Bradbury combined eighteen various stories, which might had had a morbid conclusion but left a clear message to be learned and probably live up to. The eighteen stories focused on space travel and the changing human mentality aided by the growing technology. The stories played on a man whose skin served as a screen for the illustrations and their stories.Out of the eighteen stories I read it would be hard to just pick one favorite story. \\"Zero Hour\\" and \\"The Fire Balloons\\" I found to be a little bit more realistic in some ways, while giving an enchanting spell of suspense. Ray Bradbury has an excellent way with words, leaving many phrases worth quoting. One of my favorite quotes was \\"And what happens next is up to all of us,\\" from \\"The Other Foot.\\"Sometimes books are not really worth reading, but I personally believe that The Illustrated Man is not one of them. The book has many life lessons that some of us need to learn and shows us that being nave may turn out to be a problem. It is also an excellent opportunity to try different genres that you are not accustomed to read."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"If you like stories about space, about the future, or about faith, then i suggest that you read this novel. This novel is a recollection of 18 stories that each have different characters, settings, and morals. Apparently, these stories are drawn on the illustrated man. After I finished reading, I liked it and i disliked it at the same time. However, I believe that this book should not be in our school's required reading.I liked this book because some of the stories had morals that would help us in life. The story \\"The Other Foot,\\" reminded us of a cliche saying about how we live our lives. \\"Treat others the way you want to be treated,\\" is the quote that I was reminded of as I read this story. What I liked about this story is that compassion and kindness was shown in the end.I'm not going to spoil the ending of that story, so that's all im going to say. There was a quote in this story that made me believe that there will actually be peace without prejudice on earth one day. The following is the quote:\\"The Lord's let us come through, a few here and a few there. And what happens next is up to all of us. The time for being fools is over. We got to be something else except fools. I knew that when he talked,=. I knew then that now the white man's as lonely as we've always been. He's got no home now, just like we didn't have one for so long. Now everything's even. We can start all over again, on the same level.\\"I disliked this book as well because some of the stories in the novel had made no effect on me. Basically what I'm trying to say is that when I read them, they made no sense what-so-ever. Like the story, \\"The Veldt.\\" It had an eerie ending that had me baffled in what the story was trying to say. Depressing ending?yes. Well, for those who understood it.I wish this book had a main plot and main characters, but if this novel did have just one story, then it would have lost its significance."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a great book showing much of man's human experiences and struggles. Within this book are miniaturized stories showing either a lesson or a unique event that we could learn from. The author did well on explanining each conflict. He showed very imaginative struggles that would end in either a strange or calming manner.I think this material is required reading since it's complex stories create very imaginative yet vivid stories. It's decription of time, space, and the future feel so real. It's many themes relate to human experiences, which makes it easy to understand. I would reccomend this book to be either bought or borrowed."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"In \\"The Illustrated Man\\", Ray Bradbury collected 18 splendid tales of science fiction, fantasy and horror, whose literary quality demonstrated that he was as brilliant a prose stylist and storyteller as his celebrated predecessors Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft. Though some of these stories may seem a bit dated now, more than fifty years after they were written, their vivid imagination, and excellent prose are still quite spellbinding. One of his finest tales is the chilling \\"The Veldt\\" which opens this collection, putting a radical new twist on disputes between parents and their children. Another classic is \\"The Fire Balloons\\", which is a riveting tale of how some Christian clergymen find their faith renewed on the planet Mars. The most frightening tale is unquestionably, \\"The City\\", describing the fateful encounter by explorers from Earth who have stumbled upon a deserted, yet pristine-looking, city. In these tales Bradbury has exploited the themes and metaphors of science fiction and fantasy so that these have been universal, and frankly, quite accessible to a wider readership than those who are interested mainly in these genres. I regard Bradbury as among our finest short story writers in any genre writing in English; \\"The Illustrated Man\\" elegantly proves my point."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"If science fiction intrests you, then The Illustrted Man, by Ray Bradbury is the perfect book for you. It tells stories of space, rockets, and futursitic concepts. It makes you think \\"what if\\" and uses very detailed desrciptions. I felt that this was an excellent book. Not only did all 18 stories intrest me, but I also learned many life lessons. There is something to learn or remember in each of the stories, no matter how random, or how short.I also feel that this should be a required book for the above reasons. This book is something that could help anyone that reads it. For instance, im not a science fiction person, at all. But to my surprise, I was able to learn a lot from this book. My favorite quote from the book would have to be \\"My word is my proof,\\" said the mayor. I love this quote because it talks about God and how the people in one town had faith and believed in him and were able to get healed, while another man stood there looking for physical proof and because he couldnt find any, wasn't able to believe that he was there."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"If your into science ficton books, then The Illustrated Man is the perfect book for you. Ray Bradbury did an excellent job in creating visual scenes and bringing characters and creatures to life. I personally enjoyed this book through and through and it was an interesting ride from the beginning to end. This book actually surprised me. You know the saying, dont judge a book by it\`s cover? Well that is exactly what I did with this book. From the cover to the introduction, it did not seem to be the type of book that I would be interested in and want to keep reading, but I was wrong. It turned out to be intriguing and it captivated my mind and made me wanting to come back for more.My personal favorite story of the entire book was the first chapter, The Veldt. In the beginning I did not understand the whole story, but after finishing it, I realized it caught my eye and made me wonder. It made me think on a whole differnet level than I was used to and opened my mind to various thoughts. I also have a favorite quote from The Concrete Mixer;\\"War is a bad thing, but peace can be a living horror.\\" I particularly liked this quote because it summed up the whole idea of war that the author was trying to portray throughout the entire book.I do recommend that this book be a required reading based on the fact that most of my friends that have read this book found it interesting and fun to read. Now how many books can you say that about? This was a fun book to read and I am sure others will feel the same way."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The Illustrated Man is an exemplary novel. It contains mixtures of everything-starting with irony to imaginations then to very descriptive and vivid scenes. Every tale expresses its own sense of character and reveals to me what the author depicted. I felt pure bliss when I read each and every anecdote because the descriptions were so enthralling and alluring. The novel was enchanting and I was able to paint every vision as keen and vibrant as the inks that permanently stained the body.The entire novel held an immense amount of powerful passages. Out of those provocative quotations, my all-time favorite one was: '...the pungent odor of Jupiter on a returning father's clothing.\\" Even though I read this phrase over numerous of times, I can never grow tired of reading it. Every time I read it, I experience a new sensation-each time the picture gets more vivid and vivid. Bradbury describes everything ardently and keenly; it gives the readers a yearning to read more.In the world, there are plethora of breathtaking novels and books. Nevertheless, there is not a novel as exhilarating as The Illustrated man. As I mentioned above, each and e very part of the book is filled with endless descriptions that capture the readers' attention throughout the whole book. Once you commence to read this novel, you will incessantly thirst and crave for more. I recommend this invigorating novel to everyone."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I like reading science fiction, but I have to say that the Illustrated man is one of the most bizarre books I've ever read and it's a good book because of it. The ideas are very new, but have basic concepts behind them such as the effects of hatered and greed among others. It was also an easy book to read. The scentences were very direct and not long, drown out and flowery, which also made reading it a pleasure. The dialoge is for the most part very realistic which helps draw the reader into the story. There are many good characters, but so many seem the same that it's a bit dificult to distinguish between all of them once your done reading the book. Only a few really stick out. Some stories are better than others, but ultimately they're all very well written and flow smoothly. I really liked the irony in every story. The only promlem is that after some stories there's such a jerk right into the next one that you sort of have to take a few minutes to digest one story before moving on to the next.Ultimately this is a very good book as well as a very intriguing one. It really makes you think and see things from a diferent perspective. I had no particularly favorite quotes, but I think that everyone should read the book, if only to get a different perspective. It ties right into real life and even though the stories are far fetched many seem really realistic. It's a good book with good morales and a diferent view."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I must start off by saying that I don't usually read science fiction books because they are too unreal for me to believe. Reading \\"The Illustrated Man\\" helped me to change my perspective. At first, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy reading a book that was around fifty years old, but as I began to read the first short story, that all changed. The beginning of this book proved to me that it wasn't as unrealistic as I thought it would be. I could visualize the characters and the location of the story by all of the well-written descriptions. I was also glad to know that this wasn't a novel like most books are these days, but a series of short stories instead. If I don't happen to be enjoying one of the short stories, it helps me to know that if I finish it, there is a whole new story to be read that will interest me later on.My overall opinion on this book is that it really makes you think and ask questions. For example, \\"The Highway\\" has a very confusing ending that makes you wonder what the author of the book is trying to say. Nonetheless, I enjoyed getting the opportunity to read a book that has so many short stories taking place in the future or in space on different planets other than Earth. It makes you realize how people in the 1950's thought what the future would be like in forty years. Some of the short stories even take place one hundred years from now! All of the diffenent stories and locations make this book one of the most interesting books I have ever read.In conclusion, I feel that this book should be required reading because it is a type of book that most kids these days don't read. It is also a great way to open up your imagination. It is not only a great piece of literature, but it is also a great educational experience. By not reading this book, you would be missing out on amazing adventures. It is a wonderful series of short stories and it is one of those books that you start out being forced to read, but as you go along, you want to read."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I found the Illutrated Man to be a wonderful book with many stories that taught lessons and had its own theme and moral. Even though most of the book was science fiction it can really relate to what we have to go through in everyday life. It shows the nature of humans and how greed and selfishness can affect the way we act towards others.What I really enjoyed most throughout my time of reading was that most events were unexpected. Also for those who really like to take pleasure in reading a wide variety of stories that have different morals, about different situations in life, should read this book. This book gave vivid ideas about what we may go through in the future. I believe that this was a great book and that it should be used for future reference."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"This book is fabulous! Never since my early childhood did a book influence my life. I enjoyed the wide variety of main characters, each with their own faults and virtues. It was very easy to link these characters to my own life and catch a glimpse of what obstacles may be in my future. Also, I like the fact that it was easy and imaginative. Most of the stories contain a twist that kept me in suspense until the very end. Those complaining about lenght have nothing to fear because the words are easy so reading long paragraphs can even take under a minute to complete.I recommend this novel for required reading because this novel contains many purposeful themes. Unfortunately, I cannot put my favorite meaningful quote here because it spoils a story but it changed my life! I saw how miserable a man became and I realized that the way he led his life is almost like mine; I did not want to share his depressing fate."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"I thought that the book The Illustated Man By Ray Bradbury, was alright. The first few stories were really interesting to me, then as I started to read more and more I sort of found it uninteresting. I don't know why, but I could really see that Bradbury was a very talented writer, he uses excellent imagery, and visual descriptions and a very vivid, large vocabulary that he had, but I just seemed to not understand a lot of what he was saying in some chapters. Though near the end of the book, the chapters seemed really great, I just liked reading the more adventure stories than the sci-fi, and most of his stories seemed sci-fi.My favorite qoute is from \\" The Fox and the Forest,\\" when a voice said, \\" The rabbits may hide in the forest, but a fox can always find them.\\" I like that qoute the best because it just relates to life to me atleast, because in a way it sort of says that you can't always hide from your problems or you can't hide from someone, because your problem is bound to reveal itself sooner or later. I don't really think The Illustrated Man should be required reading, there doesn't seem to be much in it, other than a large vocabulary, and though the stories have meanings that can relate to life experiences, I think people can find much more relief and in some ways educate themselves in other works. The Bible is a very good book to take, and that is actually the kind of book I would much rather want to read as required reading, though it doesn't all have to be read at once,it can be read slowly and patiently over a life time of course, but not just the Bible, even though that really is the best book, ever. Classic stories like A Tale of two Cities, By Charles Dickins, or even Oliver Twist, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,and those kinds of books, I think hold much more meaning, and more realistic characters and, I feel like I can relate more to stories like that, and the Bible of course."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"\\"Prologue: The Illustrated Man\\" and \\"Epilogue\\" are used as a binding element for this short story collection, linked together by images on the Illustrated Man's skin.The name of \\"The City\\" was and is Revenge, upon the planet of Darkness - and after 20 millennia of waiting, Earthmen have come calling.\\"The Concrete Mixer\\" Ettil objects to the Martian invasion of Earth - he's been reading illegally imported Earth fiction, and knows how all such invasions end.Meet \\"The Exiles\\" - the reverse image of Bradbury's \\"Usher II\\".\\"The Fire Balloons\\" Father Peregrine and his colleagues have come to Mars as missionaries to the Martians.

There is a common whimsical element in all the stories that I found enjoyable, even if most of the stories don't have happy endings. When I read a story, I had no idea where Bradbury is leading to until the last page or so. I always felt a \\"gotcha\\" feeling behind each tale.

He shows tragedic situation of influence that high technology can contain. For example, the story 'The Veldt' shows that children killing their parents because their parents didn't want their children to be with high technology. Also I felt that he is warning about the people who are trusting science so deeply. For instance, he is warning an atomic war, which he wrote in his book. It is shocking but interesting book because it shows big problem of science, but also he is warning to the people by writing the book."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"The \\"Illustrated Man\\" was a pretty good novel for reading in the afternoon or for reading at night.

Once I read about three paragraphs into each story I was able to tell if the story was going to be enjoyable or not.I thnk this would be a pretty ok book to read durring down time. This novel would be interesting to all types of readers, not to just science fiction readers. I enjoyed it because of the suspese. I also like how the author wrote the novel in many stories. It was confusfing at first, but when I started to read it more I started to think more about it.

The stories are mostly cerebral, although you shouldn't expect hard science. Mars and Venus as depicted in these stories contradict what we now know about these planets, but these inaccuracy are largely irrelevent since the themes in many of the stories don't require a science fiction setting. Although it's easy to tell the stories were written fifty years ago, the stories themselves aren't really dated, but it is amusing to read a story where the author didn't put a technology far enough into the future to avoid the popularity of his work. Overall, it's a good book but it doesn't fall into the category of a must read.

And although I read it cover to cover in one afternoon, I felt as though I had been enlightened.Granted, this is Bradbury in his so-called \\"Forties Period\\", in which most of his stories dealt with killer babies, end-of-the-world scenarios, and general all-around nihilism.

The Illustrated Man is an excellent example for those looking to give Ray Bradbury a try and find out just how good he is.The book is told with the framing story of the illustrated man - a man covered in tattoos that when stared at by others come to life and tell their own stories. Stories of a future high-tech nursery where children play amongst real animals, but when their parents threaten to take this supreme toy away, they have a plan to take care of them once and for all.

My favorite story out of this book would have to be the Veldt and also Marionettes Inc. They both had a more twisted end to them and were almost unreal but I really enjoyed reading both of them.

A few are Mars stories that didn't quite fit into the overall narrative structure of The Martian Chronicles, but are very good and make good additions to this set---for example \\"The Other Foot\\", in which Bradbury anticipated the civil rights movement by a decade or so (much like his pal Hugh Hefner, who originally published Fahrenheit 451 in the early issues of Playboy) by positing a situation in which blacks (having been sent to Mars first) constitute a majority and whites a minority. There is also \\"The Exiles\\", a tale of censorship which prefigured Fahrenheit 451.Some other highlights include \\"Kaleidoscope\\", about a group of astronauts drifting through space to their deaths after their rocket explodes; \\"No Particular Night or Morning\\", about how deep philosophical skepticism ultimately amounts to solipsism and leads to death; and \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\", a very funny about the consequences of using a robot double to do your dirty work for you...actually it's really hard to pick standout stories, as several of the others are very good too.There are a couple of stinkers as well, though, in particular \\"The Man\\", a really ludicrous story about Jesus visiting other planets after Earth...but on the whole, this is a solid collection of material from Bradbury, and well worth reading if you haven't already, and re-reading if you already have!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"One of Bradbury's more famous short story collections, The Illustrated Man gathers a variety of classic RB tales, with several focusing on Mars and its settlement, and many others dancing around the science-fictional or the fantastic. Here's commentary on a few I like:There are several stories that turn on the viciousness or uncontrolled wildness of children. \\"The Veld,\\" \\"Zero Hour,\\" and \\"The Playground\\" all imply that children have a brutal streak we don't like to think about.My favorite stories in the collection are those that ponder the life of the everyman in the world of the future. The best of these is \\"The Rocket,\\" but almost as good are \\"The Highway\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World.\\"Bradbury also likes to contemplate the vast terror of space itself, as in \\"Kaleidoscope\\" -- a story about men set adrift when their ship was hit by an asteroid, and the slowly fading radio contact they share. \\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" touches on some of the same themes.\\"Usher II\\" is perhaps the strangest story in the collection. Set in the same world as both the Mars stories and Fahrenheit 451, it tells of an eccentric oligarch who builds a replica of Poe's House of Usher, and fills it with traps from other Poe stories. An odd tale, but amusing.I have to say, though, I was disappointed not to see the story that provides the title of the conclusion become a tale in its own right--the adventures of the eponymous character on whom all the other stories take place was primed to be my favorite tale, at least until it turned out not to be told.All in all, an excellent collection. The Illustrated Man solidly demonstrates why Bradbury has come to be seen as one of the grandfathers of modern science-fiction."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"\\"Eighteen illustrations, eighteen tales.\\" \\"The illustrations came to life...\\"A man is encountered who has skin Illustrations all over his body.

All of these stories are classic Ray Bradbury -- full of spacemen, Earth-Mars conflict, psychiatrists, spoiled children, bad marriages, book burning, domestic work-saving technologies, and nervous breakdowns. They deal with the fear of atomic war, loneliness, prejudice, madness, and the dangers of automobiles, junk food, and media entertainment (but smoking is okay).All of the tales are written in Bradbury's incomparable prose and most of them are emotionally touching. But, not surprisingly, they're almost all grim, making The Illustrated Man a book that you probably won't want to read all at once unless you want to have your own book-burning nervous breakdown.My favorites are:* \\"The Veldt\\" -- a father and mother are concerned about the reality of their kids' virtual games.* \\"Kaleidoscope\\" -- a man reflects on his life as he spins toward Earth after his rocket blows up.* \\"The Other Foot\\" -- black people living on Mars prepare for a visit from white men.* \\"The Man\\" -- spacemen land on a new planet and wonder what important event could have overshadowed their arrival.* \\"The Rocket Man\\" -- a boy and his mom receive a rare visit from his Rocket Man father.* \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" -- a dissatisfied husband purchases a clone so he can escape to Rio for a month without his wife knowing.* \\"The Rocket\\" -- about the best father in the world.This is a great collection (by Tantor Audio) for Bradbury fans who'd like to listen to his stories. Scott Brick's pleasant and enthusiastic voice is deft enough to realistically portray an old black woman named Hattie, a gum-smacking blonde California bimbo, and an entire Italian family. I recommend this version!"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"\\"Eighteen illustrations, eighteen tales.\\" \\"The illustrations came to life...\\"A man is encountered who has skin Illustrations all over his body.

Bradbury came up with the theme of linking them through the Illustrated Man idea, which is very imaginative but doesn't quite tie them together closely enough. Still, there is real magic in the stories, perfect gems of sci-fi that stand on their own and can enthrall a child's mind and even an adult's. I remember reading with the greatest excitement 40 years ago and the stories stand today, though I have since moved on to more mature sci-fi writers, such as Octavia Butler and Frank Herbert.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"\\"The Illustrated Man\\" is one book that I have been wanting to read for quite awhile. If you've ever heard anyone talk about Ray Bradbury's books like their \\"amazing\\", don't judge it, until you have read his stuff. The guy IS \\"amazing\\"!The fact that all these stories were written before 1952 is really \\"amazing\\"!Ray Bradbury's obession with space, astronauts, Mars, peoples overall greed, laziness & reliance on computers/technology in the future were rampant throughout all the stories, but he makes it work well, as usual.Personally I'm not a big fan of science fiction or space stories, but these stories draw in you easily.The book has 18 individual stories, the prologue, the very last story in the book, which is titled \\"The Illustrated Man\\" and the epilogue are only three times the (illustrated man) is mentioned.The stories are all individuals, they don't run together to make one final story or anything.A few of the stories are so, so, but there were several that after reading them, I was left thinking, WOW!, they are:KaleidoscopeThe Other Foot (5 star quality)The Man (5 star quality)The Long RainThe Fox and the ForestMarionettes, Inc.The City (5 star quality)Zero HourI really don't know how Ray Bradbury slept peacefully with all these stories and all the other stuff he wrote swirling around in his mind.The only other Bradbury book I have read is \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", which was also really thought provoking and good.Looking forward to reading more of Ray Bradbury's novels when I get the chance......"},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Ray Bradbury is always a delight. While I'm a huge fan of his (sparse few) novels, it's impossible to deny that where he really shines is in his copious short works. He is, in my opinion, one of the 20th Century's great short story writers.The Illustrated Man plucks a character from Something Wicked This Way Comes and uses him as a set of bookends for this collection of 18 short stories. Like any such collection, there are high points and low points. The low points - the story about famous authors dying as their books are burned, for instance - are still fairly solid, though far from classics, while the high points - the rains on Venus, the father who is always away in his rocket, the astronauts floating to their deaths in space, the poor man and his fake rocket, the telepathic man among the sick exiles, the alien invasion via children - are high points indeed. Very, VERY high points.Bradbury never fails to impress.

Another story I have enjoyed is &quot;Kaleidiscope,&quot; this is where Applegate, a young farm boy, is looking through a kaleidiscope. He eventually finds a shipgoing down in space. You have lto pay very close attention to the book because it does get a little confusing. I would just recommend this book to serious readers and who are atleast 13 years old. This book klis filled kwith conflicts, such as &quot;Vedle,&quot; a daycare center goes bad, bytaking the lives of young babies, find out what happens yourself.

I was disappointed to find out that the book was about the drawings on his body. It turned out to be alright, because of Ray Bradbury's weird and great was of conveying messages through a futuristic setting. All of the stories had a unique way of teaching a lesson. My favorite part was when the farmer said, \\"What world?\\", after the man said the end of the world is coming.I don't think this book should be required to be read for school. It is a good book to read on your own though if you wanted. The book is really random, and yet has a lot of important life lessons.

However those were the only things that I felt were well done in this book. Although the novel was extremely descriptive, it was also quite dull, leading me to only be able to read about 10-15 pages at a time. Several of the stories seemed similar because of the setting and they had the same kind of pessimistic and dark feel to it. Most of the stories were saying such things like the world ending and that didn't make me warm up to the book too much.I am not saying that all of the stories in the book were horrible, I did enjoy a couple of them, such as \\"The Veldt,\\" and \\"The Long Rain,\\" however the number of stories I liked versus the number of stories that I didn't are 1 out of 8.As much as I did not enjoy this book, I would suggest that it be required reading, because of his amount of detail and description, and his technique. Also there are plenty of opportunities to demonstrate theme, plot, and vocabulary, because of the fact that there are so many short stories in the novel."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"While this fascinating collection of short stories certainly has its share of interesting situations, many of them, especially toward the middle, were not as creative as I had hoped. Perhaps this is because I read The Martian Chronicles only months earlier, but it seems as if Bradbury, though a terrific author, dwells on the same ideas in all of his collections. I still found some of the stories enjoyable and would recommend this book to others, but it is not as good as The Martian Chronicles or Something Wicked This Way Comes."},{"Title":"the illustrated man","review":"Ray Bradbury vividly describes worlds where the inhabitants try to live and explain their own lives.

This book is actually a collection of short stories, and while there's a main story (the actual illustrated man) it adds little value to the book and can be ignored. The short stories however are phenomenal.-The Rocket is a tale of father's determination to give his family a chance at once-in-a-lifetime adventure, brought a tear to my eyes.-Kaleidoscope and the Long Rain are great stories of human nature and loneliness.- Veldt is an interesting look at virtual reality and how we let the children be raised by tehcnologyBradbury brings to life new and original ideas - a planet waiting for ages to extract revenge on a race that was in war with its inhabitants, an alien conquest of earth via childrens' games, a man building a duplicate to deal with wife's nagging finds himself replaced...These will be fun for fans of sci-fi and classic fiction alike.

Every one of these stories is powerful and haunting in its own right, however, and I don't know of one single story that is the 'standout' in this collection...for me, 'The Veldt' is one of the top short stories of the past century--but 'the long rain' and 'fire balloons' are other favorites.others might say that 'kaleidoscope', 'zero hour', 'no paticular night or morning', or 'the last night of the world' are even more thoughtful, haunting or thought-provoking. and they'd be right, too. That's what makes the framing device of the 'illustrated man' and his tattooes so effective in this collection.... the darkness and unreality of these tales, their stylized nature, and yet, the way they stay with you.If someone doesn't like this book, they probably won't like Bradbury.

Through elaborate detail Bradbury makes you feel as if you were in the stories. The wild, yet interesting 20 stories vary from the love and inspiration on Mars, to the madness of Venus' eternal rains, to a lonely death in space between worlds.I would highly recomend this book to all ages, for it is a fascinating book which leads the mind to wander and question.

Rebecca Goldstein is a fascinating writer: to jump from novel writing to a probing study of Kurt G&ouml;del is not what one expects. This novel is a quantum jump (ahem) from her first two, which are (good) academic tales. It is not an easy, linear read (as she says, she presumes a lot from her readers), but extremely evocative, picking up on themes from the earliers ones. If you don't mind being challenged (if you like Iris Murdoch, for example), give it a try. Can't wait to read the later ones."},{"Title":"The Dark Sister (Library of American Fiction)","review":"I've never reviewed a book on amazon.com before, but feel compelled to rate this one, since it deserves, and so far lacks, a \\"five star\\". Hedda, a feminist writer with a barren social life, finds an isolated tower to write a new book. Her characters inhabit her, or she inhabits them, drawing her into the world of William James and a mysterious woman astronomer, unexpected revelations, and a range of unusual mental, maybe even psychic phenomena.A bit difficult to read at times, but completely compelling. The first time I tried to read it could not get past the first chapter. The second time, I reached the second chapter and was hooked. I knew nothing about William James, and still know little, but this is not a drawback.

Hedda is the author of complex 19th-century prose involving two sisters that turn out to be the same person along with the character William and his brother Henry James. Much of this novel is Hedda's book interchanged with what happens in Hedda's real and psycological life - which takes place in an old light house.The back-and-forth between Hedda's prose and real existence is sometimes challenging to read, and I found her real life so much more intriguing and readable than her book. There is very heavy language at times - I felt like I missed a lot here and there; however, more often I felt so detached from the story that I did not really bother to reread what I might have lost... Other times Goldstein's language sparkles, which is why I enjoy reading her so much.All in all, this story did not grab me all that much. Jewish references (another Goldstein trademark) were scant and not seemingly conclusive to the story. The Dark Sister was not a bad book at all; however, of Goldsteins' it is probably my least favorite..."},{"Title":"The Dark Sister (Library of American Fiction)","review":"The above title to this review is Yiddish for mad, insane. I did not know this word before reading the novel within a novel that constitutes this novel. I did not know many words that I now know in the following languages: Yiddish, Hebrew, Latin, Italian, French, German, and, mirabile dictu, Polish. But the word accurately describes both the form and ultimate effect of the novel that consists of one \\"dark sister,\\" Hedda, writing a novel about the Jameses (William and Henry) and another dark sister. Actually dark sisters abound as do, of necessity, dark daughters - \\"mia figlia scura\\" as one father addresses his progeny. Need I say that if the reader can't be bothered to look into all these matters, he/she might as well not bother with the book? It is full of - Goldstein's word - cerebrations in a potpourri of languages and situations that bedazzle. But the novel is essentially, to quote from it, one of those compositions that \\"arouse a response almost too stingingly poignant within those whose inmost souls are - even in a life crowded full of family and friends, students and colleagues - dyed in the tones of solitude.\\"\\"All fiction is autobiographical!\\" says one character herein. And the effect of all this metafictional, mind-turning hopscotch stylistics in the book was but to cast the focus ever more intensely on Goldstein. There is no sense, in a sense, to be made of this work. It very much reminded me of Iris Murdoch (another Philosophy professor) in certain parts. But Murdoch's sapience quickly degenerates into moralisms whereas Goldstein's keeps spinning into the deep, dark miasma of the universe and soul, and, important this, she pulls it off!The book has a dark, swampy undertow permeating it. That's as close as I can come, or desire to come, to describing it. One might as well try to \\"define\\" this Emily Dickinson quote in the book:\\"Ourself behind ourself, concealedShould startle most -Assassin hid in our apartment-Be horror's least-\\"As Hedda/Goldstein puts it:\\"How can we think eternally to maintain ourselves when personal identity is, even while we live, a plumped-up phantom, a frightened fiction by which the vast majority of us try to keep the wider sea from breaking through?But it shall break through. Sooner or later, for us all, it shall batten us down and break us through.\\"I tried to think of a reason to give this book only four stars, but, after much reflection, the only valid one was that I wanted it to continue swirling and gyring through my mind.

The photographs actually give a better idea about what could be successfully planted together than the author's prose. The book is seemingly geared for the novice gardener, but then, the author does not pretend to be writing for the garden professional or landscape designer. Instead, she has written a very readable book about form, texture, pattern, &amp; suitable planting partners, along with some information about plant size &amp; growth habits. It is a &quot;trendy&quot; book that encourages dreaming."},{"Title":"Planting Companions","review":"I love this book. There is a lot of information in it but the writing style is engaging and not overly technical. Also it covers topics that I had not read much about elsewhere. Not to mention hundreds of high quality pictures of plant combinations. It does *not* have the often-followed format of an intro followed by alphabetical plant listings. I've gardened for about 7 years and have read a lot of garden-related books. This has much much more garden design info than most."},{"Title":"Planting Companions","review":"The book is very infomativeNEVER NEVER ORDER IT FROM THE BOOKWORM.They NEVER return emails and I still have not received the book, although they have charged my mastercard accnt."},{"Title":"What Made Gertie Gallop?: Lessons from Project Failures","review":"The reasons why i bought this book were primarily to read about the experiences with past projects and also because i was curious to find out about the kind of problems that some of these well known projects had to deal with.This book gives inside looks into some former major international projects. Although long ago and of a size that most of us projectleaders nowadays will not be engaged in frequently, they still hold important elements of project planning that should be considered now and in the future. Too often these days the wheel is being reinvented, whereas simple checklists based on these past project experiences could serve as eye-openers because of the \`deja-vu' effect that relates to these projects.The book showed me that looking at the stated examples of experienced projectleaders the authors no doubt are there is nothing much new under the sun as far as contemporary projects are concerned: many problems that projectleaders encounter these days are very similar to those in the past and should be considered.Another book i read in this context was Steve McConnell's Software Project Survival Guide."},{"Title":"What Made Gertie Gallop?: Lessons from Project Failures","review":"The projects reviewed here are old enough that they have been analyzed well enough for fairly complete understanding to be possible. The mega-scale of the projects makes them less than directly applicable for most readers, but their large scale makes for a completeness in their management, smaller projects frequently skimp on their formal management and are usually less well documented, that makes for a better analysis.The techniques are well illustrated by the projects chosen and the writing does not get in the way of the analyses. This book is very clearly written, the individual project analyses can almost be read like short stories, but with the added benefit of being factual.For those more interested more in a popular treatment of engineering failure than project management failure I recommend Henry Petroski's \\"To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design\\". I mention this because when I bought this I thought this book was more on engineering failure than it was; a lucky mistake since it turned out to be more interesting and useful than I expected.Added Later: When I started bloging I included this review as part of a more general essay on Getting Things Right by Avoiding Mistakes.http://williambswift.blogspot.com/2009/03/getting-things-right-by-avoiding.html"},{"Title":"What Made Gertie Gallop?: Lessons from Project Failures","review":"After reading the author's previous work (Successful Project Managers), I couldn't wait to get my hands on this sequel. I was quickly disappointed in this book. The words of wisdom imparted could have been distilled down into a small paperback book. The examples cited were large scale &quot;mega&quot; projects that while interesting to read made for little relevance in my own work. There seemed to be a preoccupation with 3rd world projects that sounded more like the evils of &quot;big business&quot; picking on small 3rd world governments. The authors, with this book, failed to bring relevant 1997 business problems to the forefront for discussion. My recommendation is to borrow this book from someone and spend your money on their previous work (Successful Project Managers)"},{"Title":"What Made Gertie Gallop?: Lessons from Project Failures","review":"The big news last week was that a government study group released details about the next leap forward for the Internet, including transmission speeds up to 100 faster than the current 56k standard. Already, people are muttering that it isn't fair that these benefits will be rolled out first to universities and government facilities. Hey, people. I have been corresponding for the past month with a gentleman from Bombay who would commit high crimes to have 56k, and optic fiber leading to his home. His name is O.P. Kharbanda, and he is, like me, a business writer, having authored some 30 books on project management, disaster response, and other topics, including What Made Gertie Gallop? Lessons from Project Failures, co-authored with Jeffrey Pinto. In fact, I would paste the label of management guru on him, except that the word guru seems suddenly very provincial. But at 74, he is of an age to have accumulated some wisdom. He signs his email Om - because that is his name. Dr. Kharbanda's complaint - I almost said beef - is that he can't be a full player in the online revolution because the infrastructure where he is won't let him. \\"My system is admittedly not the latest,\\" he writes. \\"I have a 486 PC with 16 megabytes of RAM, a 200-megabyte hard disk, CD-ROM, and 2400 baud modem. I run DOS, though I can run Windows 3.1 as well. I connect to the Internet via pine (email) and lynx (a text-based browser).\\" So when I invited Dr. Kharbanda to visit my web site, he really couldn't. Lynx is a poor way to grapple with the multimedia offerings of the Web. And the phone connections he relies on in Calcutta are poor. Many disconnects, lots of line noise, not nearly enough fiber optic. It's not a tin can on a string, but it's not a T1 line, either. Though the middle class in India is discovering and delighting in the Internet, the experience is substandard. Only four metro areas (Calcutta, Chenai, Mumbai and New Delhi) have Internet service that he is aware of, and only a few thousand customers are enrolled so far. Without proper phone lines and without a graphic browser, you can't see someone else's Web page, much less put up one of your own. Because communications are crummy, Dr. Kharbanda has been unable to police his work the way authors in the U.S. do. When he finally was able to contact Amazon.com, for instance, they had no clue who he was, despite having about 20 of his books on their list. Even his publishers, owing to the departure of editors and the acquisition of whole houses, weren't quite sure who he was. Anyway, I have decided to put Dr. Kharbanda's writing back on the map. Starting today, he has a Web site, backboned onto mine, at http://www.skypoint.com/~mfinley/kharbanda.htm. I'm going to see if I can teach him how to send me a photo of himself. If you're into project management, give it a look. Dr. Kharbanda is a hero to me, for being eager to learn and undertake big new projects at a goodly age, despite the disadvantages of bad technology.

Being a lawyer who speaks Spanish, I occasionaly have Spanish clients, and I need to come up with a Spanish word for a legal term I am aware of in English. I read the other reviews before purchasing this Spanish-English dictionary. I, finally, put forth the $75 to purchase it. When I received it, I decided to look up the Spanish word for &quot;Judge&quot; - to see if I was using the right term (is it &quot;Juez&quot; or &quot;Juzgado&quot;). I turned to the page for &quot;J&quot; and, low and behold, THERE WAS NO WORD FOR &quot;JUDGE&quot;! IT WASN'T EVEN LISTED! I turned to the Spanish section and found &quot;Juez&quot; - which was listed as &quot;Judge&quot;; also, I found &quot;Juzgador&quot; - which was listed as &quot;Judge.&quot; (I discovered that &quot;Jugado&quot; is &quot;Court&quot; - rather than &quot;Judge&quot; as I had presumed.) I realized that this book wasn't going to work for me - having to translate FROM English INTO Spanish. On the other hand, I recently had to translate a Spanish Adoption record into English. There were Spanish legal phrases which, after several hours of using my regular (Non-legal) Spanish/English dictionary, I was able to deduce the equivilant legal phrases in English. Well, this dictionary probably would have been useful. As the author notes in his preface: &quot;Because my research focused on Spanish-language materials, my original intent had been not to include an English-to-Spanish section at all.&quot; He, then, notes that he decided to include a (VERY LIMITED and relatively small) English-to-Spanish section. So, if you are translating FROM Spanish INTO English, this dictionary will probably be useful; however, if you are trying to translate FROM English INTO Spanish, I suggest you try another Spanish/English Dictionary. (I'll probably return this one and get my $75 back.)"},{"Title":"Spanish-English Dictionary Of Law And Business","review":"I have used many Spanish-English legal dictionaries, but never have I found a book as useful as this one. Unlike the others, this dictionary includes explanations of many of the terms. If you're trying to figure what the difference is between an &quot;embargo&quot; and &quot;secuestro,&quot; this book will explain it to you. If you're translating a &quot;sentencia,&quot; you can look up that word in this dictionary, and it tells you about the four parts of a &quot;sentencia&quot; in a Spanish-speaking country. The other thing that is completely different about this book is that it contains terms from Guatemala, Peru, El Salvador, Bolivia, Chile, etc.--in other words, terms from all the countries that a dictionary from Argentina is not going to include (because they don't turn up in Argentine documents). In short, if I could only have ONE Spanish-English legal dictionary, this would be it!"},{"Title":"Spanish-English Dictionary Of Law And Business","review":"This book is most useful if you are only looking to translate Spanish to English (about 225 pages). But do not get this book if you need English to Spanish translations (about 70 pages). This section is very limited. And I mean VERY limited. Most of the legal terms, even the most basic ones, weren't there, and I did find them in my regular English/Spanish dictionary.I wish I had read the review from St. George before purchasing it. But I got this book a while ago, and after repeated, frustraing times looking up words I decided to go ahead and write a review."},{"Title":"Spanish-English Dictionary Of Law And Business","review":"Tom West brings his expertise as a translator and attorney together to produce this excellent resource. Focussing on difficult legal and commercial terminology, his translations are accurate and correspond to actual usage among the U.S. legal community. I have found this dictionary particularly useful for translating jurisprudence and court decisions from Spanish to English. Mr. West identifies several country-specific terms. In addition, he often includes information on the type of context in which a term is used and/or gives an explanation of the legal concept behind the term. For example, the dictionary explains the difference between &quot;good offices&quot; and &quot;mediation.&quot; So if you're trying to understand what a &quot;decreto exento&quot; means in Chile or what the term &quot;decretar pruebas&quot; means in Colombia, or if you're looking for a way to say &quot;casaci&oacute;n&quot; in English and make sense to an American lawyer, this is the book that has the answers. Mr. West's dictionary is designed as a supplementary reference work for high-level, experienced legal translators in the Spanish to English combination. If you fit that category, his book is a real treasure."},{"Title":"Spanish-English Dictionary Of Law And Business","review":"Hard-to-find Spanish legal and commercial terminology has become less so with the publication of Tom West's long-awaited dictionary. This small gem includes numerous stumpers, such as apelaci&oacute;n subsidiaria, inter&eacute;s jur&iacute;dico, and testigo de asistencia. West does a real service to translators by providing natural-sounding renderings of many titles of laws, government publications, and cabinet ministries. The country-specific entries (e.g., variations on boleta in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Argentina, and Mexico; operating expenses in Mexico, Peru, Spain, and Argentina; kinds of taxes in different countries) are invaluable, as are his neat translations of difficult phrases (Proveer de conformidad ser&aacute; justicia; definitivamente firme como ha quedado la anterior sentencia). Explanations of local items (d&eacute;cimo tercer mes, Panama; resoluci&oacute;n exenta, Chile) are real time-savers.

It IS a must for any lawyer or translator who works with legal and business documents in Spanish. In carefully chosen entries and bracketed explanatory notes Mr. West anticipates potential snares in usage and cultural anomalies-between civil and common law and among civil law jurisdictions. Having tested it in my transnational practice in Mexico, I found it a more current reference than my dog-eared Sell's COMPREHENSIVE SPECIALIST'S DICTIONARY (1957) and more thorough than any of my Spanish-English legal dictionaries that are still in print. It beat out Robb's DICCIONARIO DE T&Eacute;RMINOS LEGALES (1991) for the spot on my credenza between and the DICCIONARIO JUR&Iacute;DICO MEXICANO (1992) and my Bryan A.

It contains many terms that you just cannot find in the other dictionaries on the market and thus fills a gap that has undoubtedly frustrated many legal translators for quite some time. Because of Mr. West's legal training and the fact that he has done his homework in compiling terms by comparing legal documents and codes from Spanish-speaking countries with their US counterparts, I feel confident relying on the translations he provides. I have two suggestions for future editions. Mr. West does a fine job of including translations of many stock legal phrases, such as &quot;de acuerdo con lo aqu&iacute; dispuesto.&quot; But whereas you might expect to find this phrase under &quot;acuerdo&quot; (as would be the case with most dictionaries), you'll have to look under &quot;de&quot; to find it. I suggest adding a reference to it under &quot;acuerdo.&quot; Also, in future editions, I'd like to see a little more correspondence between the two halves of the dictionary. For example, on the English-Spanish side, Mr. West provides five translations for the stock English legal phrase &quot;including but not limited to,&quot; but I could not find any of them on the Spanish-English side, which is the side I use most. Otherwise, I have been quite pleased with the dictionary and have found it most helpful on several occasions in the past few weeks since I acquired it. I definitely recommend it to any legal translator that works with Spanish and English, and I look forward to Mr. West's upcoming French-English legal dictionary."},{"Title":"Spanish-English Dictionary Of Law And Business","review":"Thomas L.

You should spend no more than 70% of your earnings on household expenses. In other words, spend less than you earn. You can then spend the remaining 20% as you please.3.

This book is one of many books on principles on how to control your finances. If you can control what you eat, how much you exercise, what educational degree to go after, when you wake up, when you sleep, etc., there's no difference in deciding how much you spend and how much you save (must know for what purpose!). All you need to do is read this book along with all the other informational books out there and apply the principles as it fits your current situation. It doesn't matter how much you make. It's all about the \\"principle\\" and how to apply it. The part that many, like myself in the past, seem to overlook is that you need to control and detach yourself emotionally from money. If you can understand how much you make, when it is due you, and how much it takes to meet your minimum required needs (now come on, let's not be too greedy), then think, think, think, plan and execute and do it all over if you fail. I think it worked well for me because I took the \\"emotional\\" part out of the equation and handle money objectively. So did this book help? Definitely. Every ounce of education is worth a ton of happiness. I think it important to keep the perspective realistic but yet with a steadfast attitude without ignoring all the help that is out there. The book cost as much as, if not lesser, than a fast food plate. Why not get it instead of wasting on junk food?"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend who has practiced the wisdom in the book and prospered financially. It seems, to me, the best material on personal finance. I prefer it to some other books written by high profile authors that that i previously read. I wish I read the book earlier, but I am glad I finaly did. Though small and cheap it is a rich source of finacial wisdom. I read a library copy then bought a copy for personal reference. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"During the late 1920s, writer and entrepreneur George S. Clason created a series of simple parables about the supposed financial \\"secrets of the ancients.\\" He compiled these tales, set in Babylon some 8,000 years ago, into an entertaining yet instructive book on becoming wealthy. In the 1930s, during the worst of the Great Depression, and for decades after, readers embraced Clason's engrossing, elegant little page-turner. They learned of wise Arkad, the richest man in Babylon; of Dabasir, the slave who became a wealthy camel trader; and of Sharru Nada, the rich man who learned about working hard when he was just a youth. Each universal parable teaches invaluable lessons about wealth, how to attain it, nurture it, protect it and sustain it. These stories also convey worthwhile lessons about life. getAbstract understands why Clason's magical little book has become such an enduring classic. If you read it, you will find that you can put its simple yet sensible lessons to work. Clason calls these lessons the \\"wisdom of the ages\\" and the \\"fixed stars that shine.\\" His common sense advice about wealth can make you rich in more than money."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Since Pat Thorton's was the first review, it was one of the first i read, but i think he said it best. \\"Common sense is not necessarily common knowledge.\\" the simple lessons contained within the book are somewhat common sense (save 10% of your income), but easier said than done, since most people are used to living beyond their means, especially in today's age of spending. It takes determination and financial responsibility to live below your means and save and invest for the future. Those that rated this book low are probably the ones that have the hardest time taking action on the book's recommendations. of the number of people out there saying \\"i knew that-just save money.\\"--how many of them are actually doing it?!?! a very quick 2 hour read and well worth the time and money spent. highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I read this book back in 1994. It has much timeless knowledge.The Richest Man in Babylon is an inspirational book on helping to create an investment mentality by using parables of how the Richest Man in Babylon would have invested. It is for beginning investors who need good reasons to develop a proper mindset to start working towards becoming financially independent. It also is a good book for recharging a wealth mentality in any investor.The concepts in the book are simple, but their effects on wealth are profound! For example, George Clason covers The Five Laws of Gold. From the version I read, they are:I. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantities to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.II. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks in the field.III. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.IV. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.V. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.Overall an excellent book for beginners though advanced investors.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Although this is an very older book.

Own real estate (maybe not right now:). Yada, yada, yada...but this is not a negative review. I gave it 4 stars for reason. Some of us need to hear these laws of gold more than once in creative ways to internalize them. Maybe we've had conflicting messages from what we felt were credible sources all our life: messages like, live now...or you can't take with you.And then there are some of us who get it right away, for some reason, maybe never having to read about or go to an event to manage money properly.I digress! In The Richest...the same message is delivered in an interesting and unique way, that really makes more common sense (not too common these days) than anything. Some of us need nudging. Some of us need a reminder about balance, the cost of immediate gratification and the laws of gold. Some of us need a cheerleader to get us back in the game again.This book is another one of those. I don't believe in a magic bullet, only adhering to some good words of wisdom to combat the negative voices that bombard and plague us during these times, and these are clearly words a wisdom, and not too high a price to pay for them.John Darryl Winston"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book has taught me some amazing financial lessons I have already applied...and its clear in its teaching even though it teaches in &#34;parable&#34; style.."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is insightful, encouraging and entertaining.

In its pages we are admonished to save, invest, work hard, and continually better ourselves by increasing our ability to earn.Much of &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; may seem like good old-fashioned common sense, and it is. What makes this book so special, though, is the beautiful and inspirational manner in which it was written. If you are a fan of Og Mandino's work then you will be right at home with &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon.&quot;Very few books are still in print and widely read more than 50 years after they are first published. When they are, it must be for a reason. I seriously doubt that anyone will be reading &quot;Rich Dad/Poor Dad&quot; in 50 years.Buy this book, it's inexpensive and easily read in one day. Give it to your children and grandchildren. By doing so, you will be giving them something far more valuable than gold: You will be giving them knowledge. As Benjamin Franklin once said: &quot;An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I purchased this book several years ago, and read part of it then. The book itself has some great principles and points, all told in a parable-style that is easy to read and relate to. The writing, although 80+ years old, is very readable and the information is timeless.The eBook version of this is not the best. Although priced at only $3.99, the editing is sloppy, with some sentences obviously not written as the author intended. Additionally, the chapters run together, without very good formatting for reading on an ereader.All in all, still a worthwhile purchase, but with a recommendation for the publisher to have it cleaned up."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book teaches financial lessons through stories. Every point is illustrated through a tale that explains exactly why certain things need to be done when investing your money.It's specific advice along with a neat little story proving how it works in real life. This is a crucial point with me and all business advice. If it's not practical and makes sense in reality then it's useless fluff that may sound good but isn't useful at all. And let's face it, finance isn't an area where you want to learn by trial and error using bad advice.The investment strategies that applied back then are still as applicable today as they were back when this was first written. No nonsense, tired and true business advice. That's what made this a hit for me."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I am a financial advisor and read a lot of books on personal finance and wealth. I have read most of the greats: rich dad, millionaire mind & next door, etc. I think it is the best I have ever read! This book should be required reading for everyone, especially in high school and college. The principles taught in this book will change your life if you apply them. If you are in business, want to build wealth or just want to secure your financial future, you should definitely read this book. Those reviewers who have attempted to summarize the principles in this book are cheating you out of the true experience and life lessons you will gain from reading this book. Get it, read it, you won't want to put it down. Its an easy read, most people read it in about 2-3 days. If you read this book and choose not to adopt the principles you are retarded. Those people who gave the book one star reviews are stupid! I teach personal finance and have decided to make this book a precursor to the course."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The book arrived in just a few days, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had large print, which I need from time to time. Thanks for the great price, too!!!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The information in this book is excellent! It really helps you in organizing your finances so that you will not be lacking. I will be giving copies of this book as Christmas gifts this year. For all parents I recommend you going over this book with your children. There are some proverbs that will help them not to fall into certain pitfalls which most adults have fallen into."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I had previously read a different version of this book and bought several copies for my children. I was very disappointed with the font style in this edition. It is small, and very difficult to read. I recommend you avoid this edition."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"What was true thousands of years ago is true today. The book teaches you the simple principles that can turn your life around. Most of us in the culture of debt feel that we need to consume in order to be happy. We spend every dollar we earn, and more. TV commercials are trying to lure us into getting a new car loan. Don't! We spend everything, then we blame the government and protest when we fail. We should replace socialist principles with the timeless principles taught in this book. This book will enable each one of us to take charge of our own financial future. Socialism turns us into dependents; The Richest Men In Babylon will turn us into independent individuals. What would you rather be?This book is an eye opener. Today, I get my paycheck and, the first thing I do, I run to the bank and pay myself. I will NOT invest a penny less than 10% of my gross earnings. I am currently investing on CDs so I can build up a necessary safety net. I realize that you lose to inflation with savings accounts and certificate of deposits; however, you must build a decent emergency fund first, and you will be amazed at how fast you will change your finances around if you start living by the principles of this book. This book should be mandatory in school; however, our school system is doing a terrible job educating our kids. They should replace socialism 101 with The Richest Men In Babylon.You must invest 10% of your gross earnings, not net earnings. We have a different tax structure than they had thousands of years ago. For example, tax withholding didn't start in the United States until the WWII; therefore, it is safe to assume that the man from Babylon would invest 10% of his gross pay. You will have made the transition when you start enjoying watching your money grow as much or more than you like, say, the smell of a new car, or any other material thing that you buy. When we buy something, we are making other people richer.My story: It was at the time when the housing bubble was about to explode when I decided to change. We sold our house for more than it was appraised and bought a cheaper house with a 35% down payment. I used the leftover from the equity to pay off three car loans. Banks were willing to let me buy a mansion, but I bought a cheaper house. That was the best decision of my life! I got a 15-year mortgage and had enough money left to make a full payment every two weeks. Soon I was ahead six months with my mortgage payments, and eventually a full year. Today, four years later, I have fired my mortgage company and have ZERO debt. My debt to income ratio is now 0% for the first time ever. I live the dream of owning my own home. I have achieved it by living well below my means. I believe in the book's 10% rule with all my heart."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon first appeared on the scene in 1926 as a series of informational pamphlets on basic financial management. By 1927, several of these pamphlets had been compiled into a book and this collection has been in print ever since.In short, The Richest Man in Babylon is a series of financial parables. These stories are set in ancient Babylon and relate the story of a Babylonian regular guy who used some basic financial sense and built up a great deal of wealth.What's so great about that, you ask? The stories are laid out like Aesop's fables: each story has a concrete point or two that becomes apparent from reading and digesting the message. These points are basic tenets of how to get ahead financially in any time, not just in Babylonian times or in the 1920s.This book is perfect if you learn by reading the experiences of others. The entire book is told in a story-like format, so it often goes down much like reading a collection of short stories. The language is a bit strange, as the author attempts to sound like this is an authentic tale from the ancient days, but the messages are as clear as sunlight.Seven Cures for a Lean PurseSince The Richest Man in Babylon is divided up into several short stories of varying degrees of quality, I thought I would review in great detail the one story that I found the most compelling.The tale \\"Seven Cures for a Lean Purse\\" relates a story about Arkad, the titular richest man in Babylon. He is requested by the king to teach a class to anyone who wishes to attend on the methods he used to build his wealth. He divides this class across seven days, with each day focusing on a particular method for saving money. Here are the seven methods.Start thy purse to fattening Take one-tenth of what you bring in and save it for the future. The book uses a coin analogy: for every nine coins you spend, take one and put it away for yourself. This is very sensible; a goal all of us should have.Control thy expenditures Don't buy frivolous things even if you have enough money to pay for them. Instead, make sure that you can continue to save one-tenth of what you bring in. For this reason, I write about frugality on The Simple Dollar.Make thy gold multiply Once you start to build up some savings, invest that money so that it will make more money for you. Another pretty clear point; if you start saving money, it shouldn't just sit in a mattress. Even a high-yield savings account is much better than that, and it can double your principal in about fifteen years.Guard thy treasure from loss This one is interesting: you should only invest in things where the principal is safe. In other words, the book seems to discourage stock investing. I found this to be particularly interesting given that it was written in 1927, right in the midst of the first big American stock market boom. Of course, 1929 proved the author right.Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment One should own their own home rather than renting because then money can be invested in the home or invested in other things rather than handed over to the landlord. Something tells me that this lesson applied better before people were looking at homes that were three or four times their annual income.Insure a future income In other words, invest for retirement and your family's well being after your passing. You should be dropping some Hamiltons right into your retirement account if you can possibly afford it.Increase thy ability to earn Work hard, look for opportunities, and educate yourself. Today, a college education is one of the best investments you can make; I'm not saying that it's a requirement to be successful, but it opens the door to greater possibilities.The Five Laws of GoldAnother story central to The Richest Man in Babylon is the tale of the five laws of gold, a five-point philosophy handed down to later generations by Arkad, the titular richest man in Babylon. Here are the five laws, with discussion of what they mean in a modern context.1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family. In other words, a person should put away 10% of his or her income for the future as a bare minimum. This rule is so incredibly fundamental, yet only a small minority even bother to follow it.2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field. If you invest your money well, your money will simply make more money. Again, a very simple and obvious rule, but one that many people never get to because they didn't follow the first rule.3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling. This rule encourages cautious investing, or at least encourages the investor to at least be informed. In today's era, one can turn to the internet for plenty of investing information.4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those who are skilled in its keep. This goes hand in hand with the third rule: if you invest in stuff you don't understand, you're likely to lose money. Don't buy the latest hot stock from your stockbroker; investigate and invest where you want.5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment. The worst option is to invest in anything that promises absurdly good returns, or anything that you're heavily pressured into buying. These investments are scams and won't stand up to serious research.The five rules really are all you need to know: save some money, do some research, and only invest in the fruits of that research. Anything else is a sure way to fall behind.Other TalesThe remainder of the book is loaded with similar tales, teaching basic principles of personal finance using stories from Old Babylon. Here are some of the other teachings found in the book:A Part Of All You Earn Is Yours To Keep This is a hard lesson for many of us to learn, as most of us are ardent consumerists who are trained to spend from earliest childhood. The truth is that we need to learn to always pay ourselves before we pay our debtors - once we do that, we'll be on the road to financial success.Men Of Action Are Favored By The Goddess Of Good Luck I found this principle to be quite interesting, but also quite accurate. At first, you might take it to think that people who gamble sometimes end up big winners, but that's not what this is all about. What the rule is saying is that people who succeed are the ones that do something. Even the most conservative of investments will pay better than cash stuffed in a mattress for a rainy day. If you do something, something will happen.Better A Little Caution Than A Great Regret On the other hand, if you push too hard, you can get burnt. Highly speculative investments can turn around and bite you hard, leaving you as if you had never invested at all. Respect your principal and it will respect you by earning well; toss it to the wolves and you may get nothing back.We Cannot Afford To Be Without Adequate Protection Retirement savings and insurance are both vital to ensuring that major accidents don't derail everything that we do. If you don't have these tools, a disaster can befall you, leaving you completely helpless.Where The Determination Is, The Way Can Be Found Don't give up on investing just because the road is bumpy. If you keep at it, eventually you will find a path to success. This is true no matter what you're doing - persistence pays off time and time again.Thanks Ralph"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Great advice, even though written generations ago!

It is without doubt a book that has changed my life, because it has changed my relationship with money.There is no basic premise to this book. The only words that I can find to define what it is, is that it is a foundation stone, upon which you can and will build a great finacial future, if you adhere to the advice.This book is a philosophical/practical guide to wealth creation. The book in a sense tells a story. Interwoven into this story are anecdotes, which contain messages. Within the messages are real meanings that when applied to your life and wealth, will create profound change.I would have to disagree, with some people who say that this is the only book you will ever have to read, on the subject of money. I would recomend that you also read; The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D Wattles, Born Rich Bob Proctor, Financial Peace by Dave Ramsay..if in debt &amp; Pysco Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz, as wealth creation will also need new sub concious thinking. With these books you will create a finacial fortress, that will amaze you. I guarantee it.This book is a brilliant synopsis of timeless ideas, that is a must read for anyone who has set a goal of finacial independence. It is both a practical, spiritual and philosophical guide to wealth creation. It should be read in conjunction with the other recomended books. If it is, it will change your financial future forever. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I'll sum this book up for you in one sentence, \\"put 10% of everything you make in savings and then make your money earn you more money that doesn't require additional effort from you.\\" The rest of the book just repeats this moto. The book does supply a fun story about Babylon, but if you are strictly interested in financial advice, the book doesn't go beyond the basics of saving. A good read for most Americans who have been entranced by credit card companies and over look the piggy bank, but for the financially responsible, I wouldn't recommend unless you want a good story about Babylon."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I love this authors approach to helping people.

The stories take place in ancient Babylon, which is meant to underscore how timeless simple these principles are. This book is effective teaching material that can be read and understood by anyone old enough to understand the basic concept of money.After you read this book lend it to a young person you know, you could forever impact their financial stability in a positive way."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man In Babylon by George Clason was originally written in 1926. Through the narratives of Bansir, and his broke musician friend, we can see the standard folk who try to figure out how to get out of debt, the salary slavery and to finally attain wealth. Clason also uses the narrative of the richest man in Babylon Arkad who was initially poor but later learnt how to accumulate wealth. Through Arkad, the rest of Babylon gets to understand the secrets of wealth accumulation.Clason's book is a timeless classic and most of its message still holds true today. It teaches the values of saving, overcoming poor habits such as procrastination and being able to take advantage of opportunities. It is amazing how he was able to vividly elucidate the Babylonian lifestyle, as if he were there in that society. However, importantly, he was able to bring out these timeless values that anyone can apply today and in years to come. It is interesting that the ancient idea of compounding is what we today see as saving or making an investment.I highly recommend this simple book to anyone who may be looking for inspiration on how to accumulate wealth. Nevertheless, the idea here is to put what you learn into practice to see any results."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Written in the form of parables similar to parables from the Bible set in ancient Babylon, the concept behind this classic financial guide is: PAY YOURSELF FIRST. Simple to understand but difficult to implement, the parables allow the reader to see the concept in action and hopefully internalize it after having seen it in various contexts and from various points of view.After reading \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\", I realized that either I have control over money or money has control over me. I couldn't have it both ways and there is no middle ground, no position from which I could rationalize it or bargain my way out of this truth. Unless I was run over by a truck, I was going to get old, and I was going to need money.So, I began saving the recommended 10% of my income. I was young. It was a small amount. I figured I didn't have anything to lose. The first 10 years, it accumulated slowly, so slowly that it seemed like saving 10% of my earnings was the world's biggest waste of time. In the second decade, it began to seem like it might pay off. I am 65 now, nearing the end of my third decade of saving. Most people my age have little or no savings and will depend heavily on Social Security. Without money you have little choice.I started with $10,000, a gift, part of the profit from the sale of a condo. I have never worked outside the home since 1975. In lean years, I saved almost nothing. In other years, 20% of my income. I found a good financial advisor. My investments currently amount to more than 50 times my initial deposit and all I did was save and invest an average of 10% of my income...save and invest a little at a time."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is one of the most informative books I have ever read. I really wish they taught this material in schools. It is just a book of parables but the insight of these ancient people are a lot like what our grand-parents expected us to know. The value of a persons word and the way they conduct themselves in society. A good read that I would recommend to anyone who wants to know how to gather and obtain lasting wealth."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Great reading for fifth graders, if you finished High School or have your GED skip it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The book is a really good reading if you have a child that has just learnt the alphabet, and you want to make sure he/she won't squander all the money he/she ever gets or earns in the life.The ideas are really good, but if one didn't reach to these ideas untill the teenage period by him/herself it is probably waste of time to put any effort now.Alternatively you can read it in order to relax yourself or a child as it can be considered a fairy-tale."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"If you have ever had stale dollar store candy, you know that the fist piece is pretty good and then as you eat more the lack of substance and quality begins to collect on your pallet. If you continue to eat the inferior candy you eventually become sick of it. That is this book.I found the first few chapters were readable - but then my pallet began to object and by the end I could ingest no more of this pointless prose. Where is the point? Save money and instantly you will become rich? Now I see why \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" is also a frequently purchased title by those who read this book. Perhaps it is just not my style of thinking. Maybe I just don't get it. If found it entirely pointless and a waste of time and money.At first I thought the \\"revelation\\" that we would get as readers was the the richest man in Babylon would learn he was poor - but yet rich in good things that transcended gold and silver... no the case. Then I thought the author would tell us that the 10% rule was to give to God first - and that living from a perspective of giving and stewardship would be the key to authentic wealth... not happening. In desperation I kept reading on and on thinking \\"surely there will be a moral to the story that has some actual merit or meaning\\" NO! To the contrary - it appears that all you have to do is pay yourself - and cram all the rest of your creditors into the same little confined space so they can all wait their turn - and you will be RICH! What? If that is the case, why only 10% for me? Why not everything to me and the heck with everyone else in the world?It is this sort of thinking that causes our young people to feel they must have an iPod in four different colors and a cell phone that can do eleven things at once. This \\"thinking\\" is a part of our society that takes us AWAY from being authentic to who were were created to be - children of God (not hoarders of stuff). It's NOT ABOUT YOU!I purchased this book on Kindle and I must also say that aside from the quality of the message, the formatting was pathetic. The entire document was one long formatting run-on sentence. Having published to the Kindle Digital Platform myself - I can say from experience that about 20 minutes of formatting work before releasing this to the public would have been all it would take to at least make the text presentable - but then, nothing could fix the content itself. Wow!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense. This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices. It suggests that one should save and invest wisely. There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement. The most successful people do not follow this method. Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of). Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches with few similarities. I know many people who have followed this approach and ended with just a small savings. The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"the book was very good but the shiping took forever I waited for the book for 2 weeks."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is pitiful.

This book simplifies financial advice and never forgets there's more to life than the bottom-line (without losing sight of the importance of financial security). It can also be enjoyed by someone with hip or mildly hip sensibilities. It's well-written and made me laugh out loud a few times."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"There is nothing new here in this book. If I were to be cruel, the messages of 'save 10% of your income', 'pay yourself first', and 'get out of debt as quickly as possible' are all old news. Any personal finance book worth it's salt will rehash those points over and over again....The Richest Man in Babylon is not like those other books. In it, George Clason manages to take these dry topics and wrap them in an entertaining package. Lets face the facts, reading a 'for dummies' book, and 6 other books that pontificate to you on the virtues of saving 10% of your income may be important, but the presentation will not allow you to *believe*, and therefore these basics will never go from your *head* to your *heart*.That is where this book shines. It is not even a continuous story, but several stories linked together by common threads, from different times and points of view. The version I read even changed typestyles between chapters to further emphasize the change in POV. The lessons are presented as if the reader were learning about people physically living in Babylon, and not only does the color and warmth of the message allow it to *stick* in your head, but it's almost as if that little light comes on, and you say &quot;so _that's_ what they've been talking about.&quot; Having lessons presented by example, even if it is a fictious example, allows the reader to truly understand and take them to heart.This is an outstanding book, and a required addition to anyone's personal finance library."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I was amused by some of the 1-star reviews. You should take a look at them to get an idea of how clueless most people are about personal finance in this country. I can look around me and see that the ideas in this book are universally acknowledged to be common sense. But as I look around me, few, if any, of my relatives, friends, co-workers, and neighbors are applying them. I see credit card debt, houses bought for idiotic prices with nitwit mortgages, new cars replacing other new cars, closets so full of clothes the racks come crashing down, crushing monthly fees for cable, cell-phones, and internet services that are ultimately just a lot of empty distraction. In short, I'm surrounded by 1-star reviewers. This book is not about getting rich like Bill Gates or Donald Trump. It's about achieving financial freedom. What would you rather have -- a new cell phone ring-tone or an investment account that lets you retire at 50? That's your choice in life -- repeated every day of the week.Richest Man in Babylon is an allegorical rendering of the basic principles of sound personal finance. The ideas in it, yes, are common sense. But you could say the same thing about Poor Richard's Almanac or books in the Bible like Ecclesiastes and Proverbs. However, to paraphrase Warren Buffett, \\"it's simple, but not easy\\" to get rich. The trick is self-discipline.To keep our focus on what we know is right we sometimes need a pep talk, and this is a good one. I give it 4-stars."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is a great beginners book and the first step toward financial independance. It is a nice little story but the principles found in this book are very powerful. It puts forth principles in a very simple way as cures for a lean purse. Like \\"Make your dwelling profitable\\" \\"Make thy gold multiply\\" and puts forward various ways to do this and much more. It is written in a very simple manner and is easy to implement. Saving 10% of your income and keeping you expenses low alone are worth the price of the book.It is very simple and yet very powerful."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I just finished reading the Richest Man In Babylon. These are pretty solid teachings, and send a good message of \\"responsibility\\". If you have children old enough to read this, or teenagers, this would be a great one to have them read. It offers a good message for we adults as well. Oh, if I could only go back in time and do more of the right things in the areas of my finances. Well, odds are that you are younger than me, so I would say read this one."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The lifestyle and financial philosopies discussed in The Richest Man in Babylon are truly &quot;secrets&quot; to acquiring real wealth. I enjoyed the book because the &quot;secrets&quot; are not secrets at all. The methods can be used by people of all income levels. The Richest Man in Babylon outlines the most simple, time tested and true methods for meeting your wealth objectives. Any person living beyond their means can instantly become empowered by reading this book. This book is a must read for any person trying to create and preserve wealth for themselves and their family."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Excellent for young people getting married and graduating from high school or college. It conveys the important concepts of putting money away - and more importantly - the perils of getting into deep debt. We received this as a wedding gift - and it is one of the few that I will remember always."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book should be given to every person entering Junior High School to prepare them for life. But the funny thing is that most adults don't know these practical lessons for life. Follow this simple strategy for living and you will be rich--it's inevitable. A very interesting story to read, teaches the most valuable lessons one can learn about saving and investing. If I could only have one of my 115 invetment books, this is the one that I would pick. I give copies to friends and reread it each year. The best single book on personal finance to own. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I like to think that a book is only as good as its' usefulness or enjoyment to me. This book has both of these aspects in generous amounts. I have read it at least four times and highlighted the most meaningful parts to me. The work as a whole is simple, short, and entertaining. If you only have this book, and follow its' laws faithfully, your financial situation will improve greatly in a short amount of time with a minimal amount of sacrifice and extra work. I can say this from applying its' principles for just a little over two years: I have already accumulated a years' worth of income and have a sound estate upon which to build my future, I do not worry about money anymore, and can relax comfortably knowing that each passing day I grow more wealthy. This book is the keystone of my financial library and estate. I highly recommend that every person who can read should own a copy. Major debt seems nothing when compared to the stories of slaves who redeemed their freedom through simple financial laws and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I have read literally hundreds of books on financial management, the stock market, investing, and economics in general, and quite simply, this is the most concise, most entertaining, and most useful book on how to get your finances together that has ever been published. Written in the form of a delightful series of parables set in ancient Babylon, the book dispenses timeless advice on how to get out of debt, how to save, how to budget, how to do better on the job, and how to invest for the future.An interesting sideline--George Clason published the first road atlas of the US back in the 1920's, but it is as the writer of this timeless book of personal financial advice that he is best remembered today.If you only read one book on the subject, it should be this one."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I was introduced to The Richest Man in Bablyon nearly 30 years ago. This book is still in a class of it's own. Although written in a storybook style, The Richest Man in Bablyon also provides proven success principles.Aside from teaching how to create wealth, The Richest Man in Bablyon also teaches you how to maintain wealth. I found one idea about business saved me a bundle.The Richest Man in Bablyon is a good read and contains powerful, powerful material that will make a difference in your personal and business life."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man in Bablyon is more than just a classic in the world of personal finance books, this book offers timeless, powerful advice that really works.It's amazing that most people know about saving that first 10%, but how many do?The Richest Man in Bablyon is written like a novel in storybook style but offers advice that really delivers. Somewhat like Mark Victor Hansen and Robert Allen's great book The 1 Minute Millionaire.If you haven't read the Richest Man in Bablyon, then I highly recommend that you do. If you have read it, then I recommend that you re-read it.I also recommend The Automatic Millionaire by David Bach and for the ladies, Smart Women Finish Rich: 9 Steps to Achieving Financial Security and Funding Your Dreams."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Set in ancient Babylon, this book is a collection of articles written in the 1920's and 30's. Although the writing style may seem dated to modern readers, the advice is as true now as ever.Each story teaches a lesson on a valuable point, many of which we've all heard before, (pay yourself first, pay your bills on time, etc) but presents these points in a way that they are more easily taken to heart. As you follow the characters in these tales, it is easy to think of examples of how you can apply these principals in your own life.Following the principals of this book can help anyone become financially secure."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"When I worked as a financial planner, several of my clients who were teachers asked me to \\"discuss money\\" with their 5th and 6th grade classes. Each child received a book, we chatted an hour and that was intended to be the end of it. HAH! It turned into a weekly meeting, the kids began \\"investing\\" with monopoly money .. they began reading the financial section of newspapers to \\"follow their stocks\\", the real estate section to follow the market on property they \\"bought\\" .. by the end of the year they were all asking parents for a share of stock instead of guns and dolls for holiday gifts; they bought savings bonds with gift money; they got part time jobs to add to their treasure chests .. it was AMAZING!Thirty years later, I'm semi-retired, a number of the children from \\"my classes\\" have become very secure to wealthy, and their overall life path has been very stable .. from choosing life mates who shared their views of financial self-determination, to remembering to enjoy the lives they were building.My children have been raised the same way and my grandchildren look forward to the day they're old enough to receive their own copy of this book. I've found \\"old enough\\" to vary according to the individual child -Wesley Woo Woo was an early bloomer and insisted it be read TO him when he was only 5. He makes \\"money chooses\\" according to whether he wants something or really NEEDS it (some of his self discussions are hilarious) and he's making some very good choices."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Our society is so obsessed with rich people, but we only pay attention to their expensive mansions, cars, and lifestyles. But few of us notice how these people got there. Their expensive possessions are the end result. So, what do we do? We borrow and spend to accumulate possessions so that we can be seen as wealthy. If you truly want to know how to build wealth, read this book first.I absolutely loved it. I have read many books on personal finance, but this one gets the point across really well. The author teaches financial lessons through short stories. The main ideas behind this book are paying yourself the first 10% of your paycheck, spending less than you earn, and letting your money work for you. This is such a simple concept, but at the same time extremely hard for people to execute. Since this book was first written in 1929, I have to warn readers that it is written in old English so it might be a tough read for some people.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I am going out on a limb and disagreeing with the mass of reviewers who have raved over this book. I just can't see what the big deal is. Yes, it does present some great advice in a creative way, but I wasn't awestruck by how entertaining it was or what deep wisdom it takes to tell people to save money. I'll also mention that I'm not down on \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" because it makes me feel guilty or inadequate; I was already practicing the principles Clason preaches when I read it. First I will comment on the writing and style, and then give my reaction to the book's message.This book wasn't written as a book, but as a series of pamphlets, and it shows. The style is consistent, but the points get very repetitive. This isn't the author's fault, since he wasn't trying to write a book for reading in one sitting, but it reduced my enjoyment. The writing style is highly affected. To give a flavor of antiquity, the dialogue is written in the style of English used in the time of Shakespeare and King James--the same king whose name was given to the King James Bible. I think this is a device that works better in small doses; I quickly found it pompous and tiresome. I have read a lot of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and I much prefer the real thing to this pale imitation. I will note that one story/pamphlet is set in modern times and is mostly written in modern English. Looking past the style, Clason is a decent storyteller, and I found the chapters with a plot were entertaining, but many chapters are more lectures in fictional settings than stories, and I found these to be monotonous.The wealth-building system that is advocated ad nauseam is to devote 10% of income to debt reduction and 10% to investments. The fictional version of Babylon isn't equipped with modern markets, so the characters are more entrepeneurs than investors, but there is lots of flowery language about the power of compounded earnings. Along the way there is the obligatory call for home ownership, but the subject of renting vs. buying isn't covered in depth. The main message of the book is motivational rather than financial: it's basically a series of lectures on the benefits and satisfactions of being in control of your financial life, with a candy wrapping. I thought the book totally ducked the part of the system that's the hardest for most people, which is to live on 80% of your income. The attitude that I perceived was a cavalier \\"anyone can do it.\\" Well, anyone who is reasonably well off can do it, but some people have to choose between buying food and medicine, and not all of them are wasteful spendthrifts. But maybe people in such straits don't read this kind of book, so maybe it doesn't matter.I was already investing over 10% of my income and living debt-free (except for the obligatory mortgage) when I read this book, so it didn't change my life. If my finances were a mess and I was inclined to do something about it, I can imagine I would be inspired by the ideas in this book. On the other hand, if my finances were a mess and I was not inclined to reform, I can't imagine this book would change my behavior any more successfully than a modern tell-it-like-it-is book. Obviously people are inspired by different approaches, and this book has inspired many reviewers, but if I knew anyone seeking inspiration to straighten out their financial life, I would suggest they skim \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", which shows how modern real people successfully manage finances, and skip \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\"."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book was orignally given to me as a gift when I was a child by my father. My father told me that that within it's pages were the secrets that had made him a wealthy man. As a child I read the book and tossed it to the side.Later, my father died at the age of 52, and left my mother with enough money invested that she never needed to work.It took me a while, but I finally picked up the book again. I've started to apply it's simple rules to my life and have found that even though they seem too simple to make much of an impact... they do work!Now I am giving copies of this book to anyone who I think will read and benefit from it... just like my father did."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Richest Man in Babylon is an excellent book for everybody whoever wants to make the best out of life. The book has a very simple and lucid style. It tells the stories of Babylonian people who mastered the laws of GOLD (MONEY). These rules are eternal. No school in the world teaches these rules to its students. But the very knowledge of these laws is a MUST for everybody. This book goes an extra mile in prospering the life of anybody who reads it and follows the laws of GOLD shared in it.An EXCELLENT gift on the occasion of birthday or marriage!No SCHOOL or COLLEGE Education can take the place of the LAWS of GOLD shared in the book!

I have recommended it to family &amp; friends and I also think it would be a good gift for someone starting out."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is one of the quickest reads I have had in a long time. Not because the book is short I mind you, but because it engages. The stories in this book all have a point to make, wether it is about saving, investing for the future or how hard work pays actually pays off. This book was written in the 20's and I'm suprised it has the foresight to mention not to get into get-quick-rich schemes! I would recommend this book even to people who don't care about saving money and just want a couple of good stories to read."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Exactly what I like!! Timeless principles about wealth creation and management."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Books On ShelvesIn George S. Clason's &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon,&quot; vital ancient secrets are told on how to get rich. This book represents the valuable information in a series of stories, which in turn make the book more interesting and easier to follow. As an example, one of the most useful tactics about money in this book is &quot;The Seven Curses for a Lean Purse&quot; (22). These seven curses become more evident to one once read through their daily lives, as they are not so common sense traps that everyone falls into.Along with the great secrets and stories, is the choice of words presented in the text. A clever mix of modern English and biblical style make the book an easier read while adding onto the stories. On a scale from 1-10, this book would definitely receive an 8 if not better, due to its secrets told and guidelines presented in it such as \\"The Seven Curses for a Lean Purse\\" (22) and \\"The Five Laws of Gold\\" (57). If one liked \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" by Robert T. Kiyosaki or other books similar to it, one will enjoy this book. Once taught and told the secrets of this book, one's financial ways will differ and improve.

Clason uses the language of the King James Version of the Bible (although this book is not at all biblical) to create anecdotes set in ancient Babylon that tell you (the modern-day reader) how to handle your money. The amazing thing is that the advice is not at all outdated. It's right on the mark and shows money knowledge that hardly is taught in school. It's easy to read and understand and highly entertaining. In fact, one of its stories, &quot;The Luckiest Man in Babylon&quot; is almost enough to bring you to tears.It is shown in this book that when you are in debt, you are a slave to what it is that you agreed to go into debt for and you must pay it off to regain your freedom (are you a five-year slave to a car [or the institution that financed it] like I was?). Look at the state of the nation's economy and you'll see we live in a nation of slaves.That's why you must get the reverse into action; make money a slave that is working for you.Many people have heard the popular phrase from this book, &quot;pay yourself first.&quot; I highly suggest you read this book first so you can see how you should go about paying yourself first; there is a method to it.This book is truly a classic and should be required reading for all classes on money or for anyone going into business for oneself.

This book is great.I've read many books on finance and investing, and just when I was getting jaded, this gem popped up. The title kept jumping out when I did on-line searches, and I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about.This book was written in 1926, and I guess that is what took me so long to buy it. I figured that times changed, and it would be out of date, and only recommended as a \\"quaint\\" or \\"nostalgic\\" investing book.I couldn't have been more wrong. This book is as true today as it ever was, and the \\"parable\\" style of the book makes it way more interesting than most books on finance. It is a great introduction to saving, and makes a great read (regardless of your level of financial knowledge).If you don't know where to turn financially, and don't understand how to \\"get ahead\\", do yourself a favor and read this book.

However, the beauty is that man's desire for wealth is nothing new at all. The principles taught by parables are the same then BC as they are now. I enjoy re-read ing the book every year around the winter holidays."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I wish I had read this when I was 18 intead of when I was 30. I read this several years ago and have been paying myself first ever since. I can't wait to read this to my daughters as a bedtime story when they are old enough."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is so beautiful in its simplicity. It provides the quintessential, capitalistic concept that the majority seem to miss- on saving and investing. This book is not the in-depth 21st century read about investing wisely in today's markets, rather it is the all time read to acquiring and investing your wealth. It shows how everyone, even a lowly trashman can one day retire comfortably as long as he learns the &quot;ways of money&quot;. It provides the basic concepts and you apply your current scenarios. Every time, without fail, you will come up with one thing: how to build your wealth. This is the TRIED AND TRUE method to increasing your worth. This IS NOT the get rich quick book you might be expecting. This book teaches you how to save, make your money work for you and in general how to be a lord of your wealth (or wise in the ways of money), as opposed to your money ruling you. Timeless and priceless knowledge that every single person not living under totalitarian or communistic rule should know so that they can seek their own financial freedom."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Like most people, I was confused on how some people accumulated great wealth while others(including yours truly) did not. I DECIDED to do something about it and purchased this book and Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. THESE BOOKS HAVE CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER! The examples given, the practicality of the theories, and the relevance to today makes The Richest Man in Babylon and Think & Grow Rich compelling reads. Changing the way you think of money, ways to attract money, and ways to build wealth are some of the key points addressed. It has opened my eyes and motivated me to become wealthy, something that I previously thought was an immoral goal or something to be ashamed of. Read it, apply it, and reap its' rewards. It works!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is a fantastic book. I loved the old English style of writing. It is a must read for anyone who does not pay themselves first. The concepts in this book are timeless. The book of Proverbs also has a fair amount of wisdom on money. You would do well to read both. The stories presented in this book are both entertaining and educational and I would highly recommend this book to anyone open to changing their mindset about money. This would be a terrific gift for a college or high school student who is not well versed on how the proper or improper use of money can determine your financial fate"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The incredible value of this book is obvious from the sheer number of glowing reviews, and the fact that it was first published in 1926 and is still popular today. This book is undeniably valuable because it delivers PRINCIPLES that will never be obsolete. The passage that really hit me was the part where it said that if you're not paying yourself first by saving a portion of your salary, then you're really just a slave; you should really just ask your boss for room and board in exchange for the work you do! The truth of this statement hit me like a ton of bricks, and inspired me like never before to start saving my money. This book provides the instruction that all of us should have received while growing up. I can't count how many times I heard during my life that I should save money and invest, but I didn't really get any good explanation about the practice of saving until I read this book! I wish I had discovered this book ten years ago."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Get this book! A simple easy to understand story of gaining wealth. And it was fun to read. The author puts the technique in terms that satisfy all people reguardless of there income or wealth. And it shows that the same basic principles can work for everyone. I read because a friend gave it too me when I asked him how he learned to handle money."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book, without question, is one of the greatest book on money management and individual financial security that I have ever read.The rules that applied way back then, are still true to this day and the techniques and methods of both saving, investing and advising about money are very real.I would highly recommend this book to everyone, especially to the younger generation, such as myself as we can greatly benefit from it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I've always wondered how rich people became and remained wealthy. Now i know why! I'm 22 but i know a good book when i read one.This is the best book i've read on making and keeping money. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book makes you realize how often we don't make use of the basic common sense we all have. It makes us go back to basics as to how we can accumulate wealth and realize how foolish we have all been with spending money. Its a great book to help you get back to financial Health."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Isn't it amazing how so many of us pay everybody but ourselves? This book turns that around. You learn to pay yourself first and then spend what's left. Before reading this great little book, I was a spender and was living paycheck to paycheck. This book turned my financial life around. Don't let the small size of this book fool you---it's loaded with powerful information. Two other must read books are &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; and More Wealth Without Risk&quot;"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I like the old version better; there are some typos in this printing, but you can't get better financial advise than this!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I loved the book. I am giving a copy to each one of my grand-children.It takes you thru very simple steps in an exceedingly entertaining manor.Most importantly, any juvenile can understand the procedure proposed in the book.Which, I believe to be the most important factor presented by the author, if we are to see future results.Yet, obviously, from the sheer amount of sales and testimony, his technique is successful.I was brought up in a environment, during the 60's, which cared little of teaching a woman to do much else but raise their children & be a housewife. Consequently, I had not given much thought to the financial dynamics of factual exchange.I appreciate the crash course to financial abundance, albeit in my later years.We should want to leave a Legacy."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"We bought two of these as gifts. Have now sent them back. This book is full of errors and poorly laid out. Also contains inappropriate letters and numbers mixed up in the text. This book obviously was not \\"proof read\\" before publishing and looks,to us,like something put together just to make a \\"fast buck. We were too embarassed to give the books to our friends!!!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book, considered a \\"classic\\" by professional networkers, home-based business owners, self-help aficionados, and Network Marketers, comes close to living up to its potential.Written in the 1920s, it has some dated aspects which make it somewhat distracting in today's politically-correct culture. Yet, the narrative, which reads like a translation of an ancient text, actually helps set it apart from all the other books out there, dealing with personal finance.The question is, how does one become wealthy?And we get basically the same answer that any reputable book will provide: save some money (they use the requisite 10 percent here), and spend less than you make. But there are a couple emphases placed in this book, in which it does add some real value:1) Increase your earning potential.2) Pay back your debts.I found the second to be the most instructive, and even convicting. The person that pays back debts in a timely way, may still need to ask for loans - but if you are good about attempting to pay them back, it will be easier to obtain money in the future. And personal loans from friends and family are always to be preferred over institutional loans.So - this book is not all it is cracked up to be, but good nevertheless. You can read it in a day, and should.Now - here's to paying back all my debts, first, and quickly!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is an older book written by George Clason around 1926. To give you a real idea of the age of the book, its author served in the Spanish-American War (that was in 1898 for those of you wondering). The book is not written as one constant story; instead it is a collection of parables the author wrote over a period of time, all assembled into one collection. Each parable has a theme to it, such as seven cures for a lean purse and the five laws of gold.The writing style is unique. Most of the story is told through character dialogue, in a language that I can only describe as Shakespeare without the rhyme. You will see the words \\"thou\\" and \\"thy\\" frequently throughout the book. It took me a few pages to get used to the style, but after that I hardly noticed it.What I like most about this book is the length. My copy is only 155 pages, but those pages cover most of the major personal finance lessons with easy to understand stories that still manage to get the message across.The Seven Cures for a Lean Purse is the first lesson. The 7 steps to accumulating money (in my own words):1. Pay yourself first2. Spend less than you make3. Take advantage of compound interest4. Exercise risk management and don't lose money5. Own your own home6. Create passive income so eventually you can stop working7. Improve your ability to earn more moneyThe rest of book continues to build on these 7 ideas, as well as add a few new ones.Recommendation:If you are looking for a short but great lesson on personal finance this is the book to go too. The lessons in this book are timeless, and since it's such a quick read it's definitely worth a look. If you're just getting started on learning the basics of personal finance this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Short book. Timeless advice. What can I say.Well, the fact that it is set in ancient Babylon shows that the basics of finance are truly timeless, and only misinformation from our great friends banks and credit card companies have buried these understandings from us."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I was introduced to this book by a friend, bought a copy and put it down for a year. It sounded strange that a book about ancient culture of Babylon has something to say about making money. Furthermore, the back of the book purports that it is written in easy to read Biblical style language. I never found the Bible to be exactly an easy read.Nonetheless, one day I decided to read it. I was really impressed to the point of inspired! Such logical and practical sense in how to make money without first losing your shirt. In fact, you not only get to keep your shirt, but also provide shelter, clothing and food for your family on top of it! It is not worth writing the formulas or ideas in this review because it would only lose the impact. Read it so the wisdom is in it's proper context.A great book, &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;, written sometime in the early 40's, I think, continues to be an excellent resource in making money. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is having trouble saving extra for the future."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is an interesting book. To begin with, I believe than any book, even a bad book, has some useful truth that will benefit anyone. However, this book is a good book, despite its rater offish title. For non-Christians &#8220;Babylon&#8221; is a Biblical term for worldliness and all things evil. But that one objection aside, I think that this book on finances is useful for anyone.This book is written in a pseudo-scripture, or pseudo-ancient text approach that Nietzsche used in &#8220;Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&#8221; The benefit of this approach is that it gives the truths an air of mystique, so you pay attention. Clason even uses some of the awkward Elizabethan phrase constructions and Hebraisms found in the King James Version of the Bible. SO expect the reading to be a little different than say, Idiots guide to personal Finances, or the Motley Fool money guides. But if you can get caught up in the mystique and mythic feel of the book, then you can go ahead.Yes, this book covers a lot of basics that may be common sense to some people. But our economic education in this country is substandard that some people do not even know the basics. Shakespeare pointed out in Sonnet 66 that simple truth at times is miscalled simplicity, and I hope the simple truths in this book are not overlooked because they may be basic. Indeed this book is a primer on basic personal economics&#8212;say Economics 99. But you need to start somewhere, and this book provides a basic plan for anyone new to managing money correctly.There are some pieces missing, such as resisting the temptation to buy on credit, or worldliness in general, or how to invest wisely in the stock market, but the basics are covered here.Get this book for your teenagers, and have them memorize the seven &#8220;Rules of Acquisition&#8221; on the fly page. Then have them outline every chapter, to engrain the principles in your heart and minds. They will thank you later on, when their friends have $20,000 in credit card debt."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"After reading many books on finance and success I can honestly say this one changed my life. I've never looked at money the same way since. Mr. Clason's idea's are easy to grasp and he repeats them in interesting ways so you begin to commit them to memory.DO NOT WAIT TO READ THIS BOOK! Get on the road to financial success today."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I have owned a dog-eared copy of this classic for over twenty years and I read it at least once per year. Each time I find something profound that I somehow overlooked. Written in the style of ancient parables, this masterpiece should be shared with any young person about to embark on his/her first financial journey of earning and saving. Cutting through stuffy economic principles Clason lends good old fashioned horse sense to the mystery of accumulating wealth and security. I have made gifts of copies of this book to more people than I care to count and it has touched each one profoundly. Great company for a first paycheck!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"An excellent precursor to &quot;The millionaire next door&quot;, Clason uses of parables set in ancient Babylon to illustrate methods for accumulating wealth. Start with &quot;pay yourself first&quot;, which means saving should precede consumtion. Might be better for a younger audience, with its Arabian Nights feel. For a modern, empirical explanation of the wealth-building process, see &quot;Millionaire&quot;."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Unlike most books on wealth building, this book does not discuss difficult things like market manipulation and analysis. Through telling a very captivating story, it concentrates on teaching the time-tested methods of working hard, saving money and building wealth. In simple language it offers wisdom on how to use and save the money you have, how to earn more, and the wisdom behind smart investing.Forget the market and business how-to-get-rich books. This book is easy to understand, easy to read, and is filled with simple advice that just makes sense. It is the financial guide for everyone."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I regret that I didn't know about this book years ago. I've given it out to at least 17 grads and hope they'll read it before they're 40. The principles are timeless, powerful and inspirational. I've been working at the principles for almost two years and it's better and easier than I imagined."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Some have compared this with the Millionaire Next Door. Fools! The Millionaire Next Door taught how to be scrooge and never enjoy life or your money. This book is different. It tells you to invest enough for future and retirement BUT it also leaves much for daily spending, it speaks highly about owning a nice home and dressing up your lady. This is a winner!This book does not tell much about investing, more about how to save money for investing. If you don't know about investing, then complement this with The Schwab's Guide to Financial Independence."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Excellent-should be required reading for all! *****This is an excellent book. I read it back in 1998, what a pity I hadn't found it when I had FIRST started to work! It verbalises what one needs to be aware of in the management of finances. In other words it tells you HOW to acquire AND KEEP wealth!I immediately streamlined my finances upon reading this book (completed within 3 hours). I have not looked back since!It was a life altering moment. I am now and have been debt free with assets and savings for retirement! [Which I am still doing] I am following the plan rigorously.Life's lessons \\" Help your friend in such a way that his burden does not become your own!\\" This little parable ahs helped me a thousand fold! \\" Life is good do not be afraid to spend and live niggardly\\" Just a *couple* of the POWERFUL stories and statements that are packed in this book.I now give copies as Christmas gifts and wedding presents. Unlike many recent advertising marvels, this book has SOLID information that you can use IMMEDIATELY to acquire wealth!Additionally, it has good morals and values to live by.I read it at least once a year to keep me focused.This one of those gems that can change your life and make you wonder...what was I doing before I was exposed to this?BUY the book! It is money well spent."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is one of the core books that I've built my entrepreneurial life around. You have to understand how money works. Some of the best selling financial books today, won't teach you the basic key principles that are taught in this book."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is the book that got me started on a passion for saving and being smart with my finances. I read this book many years ago and it is the one that started the fire within me to save and live within my means. Since then I have graduated to other books on the subject and have learned a lot about the subject. However, you never forget your first kiss and that is what this book is to me."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is an incredibly insightful book, that really needs to be read slowly and really digest the parables that are being recounted.Specifically these items are very important: *He must pay his debts with all the promptness within his power, not purchasing that for which he is unable to pay *He must take care of his family that they may think and speak well of him *He must make a will of record that, in case the Gods call him, proper and honorable division of his property be accomplished *He must have compassion upon those who are injured and smitten by misfortune and aid them within reasonable limits. He must do deeds of thoughtfulness to those dear to him. *Cultivate thy own powers, to study and become wiser, to become more skillful, to so act as to respect thyself. Thereby shat thou acquire confidence in thy self to achieve thy carefully considered desires."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"After reading this book you will understand the title. This is the perfect gift for a graduate or anybody looking to seriously start saving. The chapters are short and concise and the stories are easy to follow and understand. While most of the morals of the stories are well-known, this book helps to point out the obvious. And in case you don't actually figure out the point of each story, there is a short summary at the end of each one.'Richest' is a lot easier to read than most of the other books on similar topics and to think this one has been out longer! Definitely recommended and a great gift. Especially with all the talk about teens and college grads who are financially lost. Great way to start them off on he right financial foot."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"READ THIS BOOK AND THEN IMMEDIATELY READ THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR. THIS WILL FOREVER CHANGE YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE. YOU SEE, NOT ONLY IS IT OKAY TO BE FRUGAL, IT'S COMMENDABLE. BE SYSTEMATIC WITH SAVING 10%, 50%, OR WHATEVER AMOUNT YOU CHOOSE...JUST DO IT."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This was an awesome book! It was filled with normal common sense that anyone can put to use and succeed. I recommend it to everyone, whether starting out or starting over."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Not bad read overall. Teaches the same basic principles you will find in most books. If it had been the first financial book I had read, I may have given it 4 stars. Definitely teaches some good lessons for Life, but I think there are better books for learning about Finances and saving."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is one of the few books that changed my life (along with the first few chapters of Rich Dad Poor Dad, and, in my personal life, the books Your Erroneous Zones and How to Become an Alpha Male). I won't repeat what others have already said, except to say that having studied finance, I think the advice should really be to save 20% of everything that ever hits your checking account rather than just 10%. The reasons are twofold:1. Taxes on investments. They're much higher today than they were a few generations ago, so we need to invest more to overcome that. (Sorry!)2. The expected return on investments appears to have gone down. Whereas as late as the 1980s it was around 10%, today a lot of academic researchers say it's only around 8%."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is a book anybody who wishes to get wealthy must have on their bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Buy this book for your children and grandchildren. It will teach them how to save."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This easy to read book (2 hours or less) has great wisdom in basic principles of saving and investing for building one's wealth. While there may be better ways to establish a disciplined savings plan (i.e. Quicken), the necessity of conservatively and continuously setting aside a safety net reverberates throughout the simple lessons in this text."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I've been reading lots of personal finance books and this was absolutely the best one. I've given it to my mom to read. I'm buying copies for everyone who asks me for financial advice. I just graduated with an MBA- and apart from my major college loan debt I wanted to figure out a strategy to deal with quickly, because I work as a financial advisor with people who have major debt and nothing saved- this book has an amazingly simple startegy that could help them and me. Basically it tells you to save 1/10 of every paycheck. Send 2/10 to pay debts and fit all your expenses into 7/10 of every pay check.You'll grow in worth (because of the 1/10 put away every pay check), your debts will reduce overtime because of your 2/10 of your paycheck sent to them. Deciding you have to teak your expenses to fit into 7/10 your pay check is a much more organized way of doing your finances rather than the sloppy \\"I'll save if anything gets left over\\"- which never happens.Also because it's an old book, it explains the ideas behind financial concepts in simple words rather than using hard words that economics majors like me had to cram before exams and nobody else understands."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is a beautiful little book. Parables bring home the relevance of basic financial planning concepts, making them tangible, understandable and memorable. Very easy to read. I bought a copy for everyone on my Christmas list last year."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"When I asked a millionaire lawyer how he was able to attain his wealth, he recommended me this book, telling me that it had the greatest influence on him of any such book. Naturally, I had to check it out!This book was written in the 1920s, but is as relevant now as it was then - and prior to that time, as well. It is written in an allegorical format, making it much easier for the reader to understand, relate, and put into effect the ideas described in this book. If there are two major ideas to be learned from this book, they are, \\"pay yourself first\\" and \\"invest your money and your money's money.\\" It does sound like common sense, but you will be amazed how few individuals actually practice them.Even aside from the financial lessons contained herein, the stories are rather entertaining. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone, either as a gift or for one's own benefit. This is one investment you cannot afford to forego!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Don't let the simplicity of this short, easy-to-read book make you feel like you would get more value from something denser or more complex. The fact is, financial basics ARE simple. This book presents them in a story set in Ancient Babylon, which reads quickly yet resonates deeply with financial truth.Is it really that hard to be rich? Clason explores such topics as spending less than you make, repaying your debt, saving for the future, and investing wisely. There are no secrets, no tricks, no insurmountable challenges - just the basics that have escaped much of today's credit-card generation.The best plan is to go ahead and buy two copies of this book, one for you, and one to loan or give away. This is too good to keep to yourself. An obvious classic for college grads or new families, the wisdom within is just as relevant and accessible for learners of any age.If the book has a fault, it is its failure to address charitable giving. Whether you tithe at church, or choose other non-profits to share with, giving is an important part of financial management that is not mentioned at all here.Regardless, Richest Man in Babylon is a classic for a reason - its wisdom has stood the test of time, and will continue to shine a light on a simple, straight, yet often-overlooked path to financial well-being."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I believe there was no bad reviews on this book! Because, it is awesome! It is something very wise, very exciting, very condence, very useful.

I graduated from college with school loans and a savings account that I needed to borrow $15 to open.

This book is extremly interesting and I started following the steps as soon as I finished the first chapter."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I first read this book 25 years ago and immediately began to practice the principles in search of financial independence. Having being used to living paycheck to paycheck, it was a welcome relief to be out of debt within a three year period.

This book is truly a basic text that I teach from with each person I tutor."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is the easiest book to read about managing one's personal financial affairs, and the best book I can recommend. After two degrees, I still haven't read any book or magazine that has had more impact on my personal financial situation. If one truly lives by the principles listed, they will have a successful financial future. I've given away many of these books for weddings, graduations, and personal gifts - It is worth more than any other financial gift one can give. It teaches people to be self reliant, even if their present situation seems financially hopeless. There is a solution."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"What is wrong with formal education in America today?

Overall, it is an outstanding book to read for all ages, from grade school age children to adults."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I came upon this book from the reference section in &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;. Actually if you read all the books in that reference section, you will have realized that Kiyosaki has no original ideas of his own. But getting back to this book...The Babylonians were the first engineers, the first mathematicians. They were the first with written history and a system of currency. They built huge buidings and their fortress walls are one of the seven wonders of the world. Now, all these are gone, but their wisdom remains eternal.This book contains stories of the ancient Babylonians, each with an important lesson. There is a bit of repetition, but this lesson is so important it might as well be repeated throughout the book. This is the lesson of saving what you earned. Save at least ten percent. Even when you are not making alot, save that ten percent! And before you know it, you will have this huge amount of money that you don't know what you should do with it. But before you spend it on playstation games, wait! This money should be used to help you make more money. And the money you make from this, you save ten percent. Then you use this money to make more money and save ten percent of what you earned and so on and so forth. And before you know it, whamo! You are the next Warren Buffet.The other important lesson in this book is to work hard. Treat hardwork as a friend rather as an enemy and you will be rewarded greatly.These are more or less the messages of this book. Simple as they sound, you should definitely read the book yourself because the stories are just amazingly inspirational and heart-felt. Can you imagine they were carved in stone many centuries ago and still, they are some of the best writing and with MEANING as compared to most of the garbage writing printed out today? This is the second best book I ever read."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This is a wonderful book. It should be required reading for every high school senior in our country. The book's memorable stories & parables entertain the reader and outline a real, logical and understandable approach to wealth creation.Even though the book was first published in the 1920's, its wisdom is timeless and the lessons of yesteryear still apply today. Read this book and share it with your family, your friends and your business associates."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"George Clason's Richest Man in Babylon is considered a classic in its field for good reason. This slim volume offers common-sense advice on how to gradually build solid wealth. Clason offers no get-rich-quick schemes or stock market tricks. Instead, he offers solid foundational principles which anyone can follow, such as \\"Save ten percent of your income\\" and \\"Live within your means\\". While they may seem obvious, far too many people fail to utilize them.Clason preferred to dispense his advice in the form of parables rather than simple lectures, so this is far more readable than your average investment or personal finance tome. The writing style, which is imitative of \\"King James English\\", is a bit corny, but this does not detract from the read. The stories are not exciting, but interesting enough to keep your attention. Most importantly, the principles are valid no matter what age or economy you live in, so the book, despite its age, is a wonderful introduction to the basics of personal finance for anyone."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Lots of successful people cite this book as having given them a solid grounding, which is why I was keen to read it.OK, a lot of the language is dated - thee, thou, wilt, didst etc - but it is extremely readable. The language in fact enhances the reading experience - it underlines the timelessness of what is being written.The book is a series of chapters, and each chapter has a truth, explained through a story, like a parable. The characters are, of course, from ancient times, but their thoughts and actions are exactly how people think and act today.It is no new thing that people look for the \\"get rich quick\\" and the \\"lucky\\" roads to wealth, but in fact the right way is quite simple. There is discipline involved, sure, but it isn't hard.The richest man in Babylon got where he did by working hard, taking advice, putting money aside and investing it wisely. What I particularly like about the book is that all the characters who succeed make mistakes along the way, but that doesn't stop them from ultimately getting to their goal.A true classic."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon teaches sound financial habits that outline how you can start becoming wealthy solely on money you already earn.The book is broken into chapters, each told in a parable format that takes place in ancient Babylon to explain a certain area of personal finances (investing, savings, insurance against loss, etc). What's most clear is that these \\"ancient\\" financial secrets are actually applicable to people today, regardless of the advances in communications and technology. The idea is that sound personal finances are goverened by rules that are everlasting.On a side note, there is no real suggestion of the types of investments that one should make. If you're looking for a book on how to invest in stocks or mutual funds - this isn't it. Rather, it is an overall plan for success that you can custom-tailor to your situation.All in all, this book is fantastic, and at under $7, is something that even the most cash-strapped pauper can afford, and start on the way to a better financial future."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I had heard about this book for a long time but when finally got a chance to lay my hands on this. I was just amazed. It is a light read and can be enjoyed by almost anyone over 10 years of age. The meaning that you can draw out of it would however differ. The depth of thought is simply fantastic and presenting it in a story form makes this book difficult to keep down. Each reading of the book will uncover a new lesson."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book doesn't teach you how to make money - it shows you how to keep it and grow it. I am only 14 but I read this book when my internet business began to do well. It's not good making a lot of money if you don't understand how to keep and invest it. The principles in this book will stay with you forever, and you will realise that growing wealthy isn't rocket science - it's just common sense."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I'm in my gravy making years. While I've done okay saving and doing some work to prepare for retirement, it's time for me to be more aggresive. I've recently bought 4 books on the subject and \\"Babylon\\" is by far the most straight forward, easy to read, and easily memorable out of the bunch. The writing style is entertaining and that's probably why I remember the lessons in the book.If you are serious about keeping what you earn and are tired of living from hand to mouth or paycheck to paycheck, this is the single best investment in your future that you can make. Start here. Relearn what money really is and how to use it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I work in the Financial Advisor training program at Legg Mason. This book has been used in their training for years now, and teaches an invaluable lesson in wealth management and retention."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"My dad made me read this book when I was 12 years old, and I loved it. I made a presentation of the information to my high-school English class, using the 7 principles. I don't think any of them got it, including the teacher. I have given tons of copies of this book to friends in bad financial shape over the years. Those that GET IT, benefit. The rest, oh well. I read this book about once a year for the past 20 years, and it has helped me tremendously. This should be mandatory high school reading."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Training for my M.A. degree involved deep analysis of literature, and a mastery of the many known devices that authors use to grab a reader's attention.This book uses a simple device (called archaism) to deliver small stories which, stylistically, read like Biblical parables -- though they have nothing at all to do with Judaism or Christianity -- this book worships only at the altar of gold. And a most practical and profitable sermon it is.How ironic is it, that also during my M.A. studies, the great universities of our land never taught me one fraction of the financial truths laid out so clearly in this book. Profound truths, that can free the low-wage-earners like myself (or anyone who makes a living in the arts) from the slavery-like yoke offered by credit card companies, from risky and stupid investments, and from the foolish desires that generally cause people to overspend.The book centers on the theme of slavery. The literal slavery of ancient times is astonishingly allegorical of the financial slavery that debtors find themselves in. This type of slavery is not new. It hounded Charles Dickens, preoccupied Thoreau, and drove Marx to conclude that labor needed to revolt ... But all that is distraction. This book has the true answer to wage slavery, and that is that one must keep what he earns, and make it grow. Simple ideas to comprehend, and simple to execute if one can grasp the truths the author describes. Money, and the laws governing it, are unchanging.Some readers may be put off by the book's device of the parable. Its dialogue and situations are sometimes heavy handed and overly preachy, once you see the parable's moral coming at you a mile away ... but this book speaks the truths that are worthy of Aesop. I am richer for having read this book, both financially and spiritually."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I must admit that the rebel in me cringes that I bought and read this book, but you know, I'm following its principles anyway and I am pretty amazed at how my debt has started to melt away and that I have a nice little savings account. My father works at a bank and scoffed at the simplicity of the book when I showed it to him. But now he is designing a financial planning program at work and was partly inspired by the book!What I really like is that it has helped me to feel more secure, just knowing this powerful little formula. You don't have to be a millionaire to feel wealthy and secure.This just seems like one of those books that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book contains age old truths about money. In this time of easy (maybe too easy) credit and widespread debt problems the book has good info about how to acquire and manage money. There is also good practical advice about how to get out of debt. The best thing about the money acquisition plan is that anyone can put it into practice without becoming a miser. Everyone should read this but especially young people who are just starting out. I wish I would've got my hands on this at age 20. Well, better late than never!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":".......which is a pretty strong statement, but it's so very true. I recommend everybody read this little gem of a book that's filled with truth and is essential for any &quot;type A&quot; personality. It's a cute biblical story that is made up of serious life-lessons aimed towards properity.........NOT just money, but anything pertaining to self; ie: time, love, health, savings, possessions, income, etc. I used to own and run 3 retail stores with subcontractors, sales clerks, bookkeepers, service routes, product education seminars, on, and on and on. After reading this book, I realized that my time and health is as valuable as the money brought in, which a lot of times was paid out for overhead. I still own the same company, but I've geared WAY DOWN. It was a hard decision to make and I prayed real hard about what and how to do. We actually now live in a bigger house, enjoy each other more, and are a lot happier about life.......Amazing what reading a tiny little book can do for a life! The point of this story is to work smart and to put yourself first-----Oh, I still hate to say that-----because that's how you'll be more prosperous and more helpful to your family, friends, and all others.It's a short, quick book and I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"\\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" along with \\"The Baron Son\\" by Vicky Therese Davis are two of my favorite financial parables.

If there's only one thing I can mention that paves my way to become a professional personal financial planner, it's this little book by Mr. Clason. Today, I always have George Clason's &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;, 5 in English and 5 in Chinese, nicely wrapped, in my gift stock. Whenever I met a fresh client or friend who have not yet built the belief that he/she could be a millionaire, this booklet is the first present he/she would received unconditionally. While most writers in financial planning says it takes only a fifth graders' mathematical knowledge to understand most of the truth about being financially freedom, this booklet is powerful and inspirational to tell all the basic truth for virtually every body. I found it a powerful tool to educate the kids about spending, savings and giving. In particular, the story about the confession by the Nottingham archaeologist Prof. Shrewsbury would save a lot of people from their debt."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I read this book in the early 1960s upon the recommendation of my then Dale Carnegie instructor. For me it was most effective because of the clear, simple style in which it is written. I participated in an employer sponsored stock purchase plan during my entire career with AT&amp;T. In addition, the employer matched a percentage of each dollar saved which is like found money. Whenever I wanted to buy something NOW, I thought about the suggestion in the story to &quot;never sell your children,&quot; referring to not spending earned interest. I never forgot that. I am enjoying a comfortable retirement today. I credit the suggestions in this wonderful book with keeping me on track. Now it's OK to spend some of my &quot;children.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Clason's time tested classic has sold over 1.5 million copies and is a must read for anyone interested in achieving financial success. The principles embodied in the book are, in the author's words, \\"a cure for a lean purse.\\"The book is a collection of short stories that all revolve around five basic concepts:Money comes to those who save.Money multiples for those who invest it.Money stays with the person who entrusts it to wise people.Money is lost when invested in things with which you are not familiar.Money is lost at a fast rate by pursuing get-rich-quick schemes.The reader should keep in mind that Clason wrote these stories to be published as pamphlets and distributed to bank customers. While the lessons are obviously designed to encourage saving money (thus helping the bank), its lessons are quite valuable and worth learning.You may also want to read Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth by Phillip Collinsowrth.Ron TaylorAuthor, Network Marketing: MLM Strategies for Success and Wealth Creation"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book is great for people who tend to make a decent amount of money but foolishly squander it. It is written in some older English, but it is not too difficult to follow since the stories are easy reads. It mainly talks about ten key ideas.1. Save 10% of what you earn2. Don't get involved in investments that you do not understand or don't invest in someone else' idea unless it is in the area of their expertise3. Don't gamble or get involved with quick rich campaigns4. Focus your energies on improving what you do so that you can increase your earnings5. Be true to your word - pay back debts and build relationships6. Invest wisely - mainly invest in your area of expertise or with a good friend in his or her area of expertise7. Be decisive - don't take too much time in deciding an investment is right. If you wait too long, the opportunity may be gone. This is a fine line because you don't want to rush in either.8. Invest in yourself so that you can improve your skills in the future9. Be a person of action - luck comes along with hard work10. Have a strong determination that you will succeed.The book was a very quick read - I read it in about hour or so. Much of it was a bit repetitive - I guess it helps to ensure that you got the points. Honestly, I thought I would get a lot more out of this book. I already knew of most of ideas, and in the places where I could use some help like being decisive it did not give me suggestions to improve in that area. I guess it will just take some more practice on my part. I would suggest stopping by your local library to pick up this book. If you like it enough, go out and get it and add to your collection."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Walk into any better bookstore, make a beeline to the personal finance and investment section, pick up any of over two or three dozen books, rip off the cover and boil it down it's main points, and you'd be left with one book: The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason. Name authors you will - Suze Orman, Ric Edelman, David Bach, Dave Ramsey - none, and I mean none, have improved on the simple and timeless principles laid out in these pages.The book began in 1926 as a series of informational pamphlets written in parable form. The parables, set in ancient Babylon, follow the travails of Bansir, the journey of Arkad, and the lessons of Old Kalabab and offer a financial plan to put readers on the road to riches. The principles, repeated often throughout the book, make the promise that \\"A lean purse is easier to cure than to endure.\\"While that may, or may not be true, the book should resonate with readers regardless of their financial status. Most readers will recognize that they've been where the parables take us, on the downside and on the upside, and quickly realize what steps should be taken to move forward. In that sense, this book is a fantastic guide to the laws that govern money. For, as the book suggests, \\"Money is truly governed by the same laws which controlled it when prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, six thousand years ago.Taken further, I view Clason as an ideological precursor of modern financial planners, who take a role similar to Old Kalabab and attempt to impress upon clients the very same principles Clason deftly weaves throughout the book. The terms are different, but the lessons identical. The importance of saving by paying yourself first, budgeting by controlling your expenses, intelligent investing with wise and experienced counsel, insuring yourself against catastrophic loss, and planning for your golden years are as sound for the time and place of the book's parables as they are today.While newer books may have flashier covers and contain three times as many pages, for those seeking to improve their financial condition and, better yet, accumulate wealth, I don't know of a better investment. The Richest Man in Babylon is a book you should not only read, but study."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I picked this up two years ago just because it seemed interesting and I figured for $8 I couldn't really lose.

This book is a short and easy read, yet I still, about halfway through, wanted it to speed up and give me more &quot;meat&quot;.I guess my main problem with the book, although it does have important, timeless financial information... is that it is not short and easy enough.

ClasonBabylon, lying near Euphrates river, was once a flourishing kingdom. The Babylonians had great achievements in agriculture and construction and they knew secrets of becoming a rich.You may think the secrets are cliche or even common sense, like spending-wise, investing in premises, don't lend money to unexperienced proprietors etc.. But take an example, like investing in premises, there're at least two benefit to us. First, for the hard-workers, they'll have revenue from rent; secondly, for the less hard-workers, this involuntary kind of saving is definitely benefitial to them.People in modern society spend too much valuable time in day-dreaming to be a millioniare while doing nothing pratical and forget about hard-working and saving, two very important characteristics of being a rich. Yet saving time and improve own knowledge are important too, on my view, accumulating capital, seeking advice from experienced investors and investing in items that we know well is the rule of success.

This classic is a favorite of many of my preferred authors, so I thought I would add it to my repertoire. Clason is a fascinating man, born in Louisiana, Missouri in 1874 and started his Babylonian-based writing in 1926. This book has very solid messages and it's no wonder why this book has become a finance classic.Clason uses parables set in Babylon to make his points throughout the book. One chapter does a really great job of encompassing several financial points, The Five Laws of Gold. Each of the five laws are very simple and if used can work wonders in building your wealth.Five Laws of Gold1: Gold comes gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put aside 10% of all he earns to build an estate for his family and future.2: Gold labours diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds it profitable employment.3: Gold clings to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.4: Gold slips away from the man who invests it in businesses that he is not familiar or is not approved by those skilled in its keep.5: Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who follows the advice of tricksters or schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.I feel Law 1 is the most useful thing anyone can use when starting to accumulate wealth. I have touched on this in a couple blog posts, but I want to really drive it home. The best way for you to really start making a large sum of money is Paying Yourself First. YOU is the most important investment your have. YOU should have the mentality that YOU are your most vicious creditor you have. You owe YOURSELF before you pay anyone else.... Figure it into your budget. When you get your paycheck have a set number each month that you owe YOURSELF, I like no less than 10%. Never budge on paying yourself and always do it first. In my last blog about I Will Teach You To Be Rich, I showed you how to automate your finances. This makes it very easy to pay yourself. If you have $500 a month coming out of your checking account, and into your ING Direct or Emigrant Direct Savings Account, the day after you get your paycheck, you won't even consider that spending money. ING and Emigrant Savings Account pay 1.3% interest right now and it takes a day or two to get money when you do a transfer. I definitely recommend either of these accounts. I challenge you to start paying yourself first... trust me, you are worth every single penny. PAY YOURSELF FIRST!More on ING and Emigrant Direct Accounts.... I just changed from Emigrant to ING because ING allows you to have several sub-accounts under the same over arching account. You can create nicknames for each of your accounts and each can have automatic savings plans for each separate account. Let's play pretend... You have and ING Account with sub accounts named Wedding, New House, and Vacation (I will discuss retirement accounts in a separate blog down the road... saving accounts should be used for short-term expenses: 3-6 years). You want to Pay Yourself First so you have get paid on the 1st each month and on 2nd you have ING pull $500 from your checking account. This $500 will be split among your accounts $150 to Wedding, $250 to New House, and $100 to Vacation.... In 5 Years we will have... drum-roll... $9,294 for your Wedding, $15,490 for your New Home, and $6,196 for your dream vacation... Total Savings = $30,980. Determine what you want you pay to be and work your budget so you pay yourself before anyone else... be vicious... get creative and figure out a way to pay yourself what you want. I want to make a point that much more money can be accumulated than this for the long-term... More on that later.The Richest Man in Babylon is a great book with lots of great parables. It's not a long read just some different language usage. I think it would be a good read for anyone that has a little extra time... probably a vacation read... in 5 years you'll have plenty saved up for that! If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"it is not an easy book to read, but after a few times it hits the spot, well done."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I have just finished this book and I cannot believe what I just read.

These organizations began distributing a series of pamphlets written by George Samuel Clason which dispenses financial advice through a collection of parables set in ancient Babylon. This book is a collection of these pamphlets.Strategies come and go, but the seven principles outlined in this book are timeless:1) Pay yourself first by saving money each pay cycle2) Control your spending3) Invest your money4) Understand risk in your investments5) Make your house a profitable investment6) Insure a future income by becoming excellent at it.7) Educate yourself constantly to increase your ability to earnThis seminal book is for financial education what C.S.

I have heard these principles for many years. But never been able to apply them. The simple way it is presented here and with ample examples, parables, down to earth, helped me understand how to take action, and apply the principles stated in this book.The old english style is a little bit annoying, but I was so immersed in the book that I have been able to read it very quickly.I appreciate also how the principles are reminded at the end of every chapter and are written in italic or bold and frame.

As a counselor for senior citizens I've seen what happens to people when they either don't know or don't take the advice offered in this book. It's heartbreaking to see people who have worked all of their lives and have nothing to show for it in their later years. This book can change all of that! Buy it, read it, and do what it says!Linda Savoyard, author of \\"Mid-Life Makeover: Getting Healthy, Happy and Financially Secure in the Second Half of Life\\""},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"\\"The thoughts of youth are bright lights that shine forth like meteors that oft make brilliant the sky, but the wisdom of age is like the fixed stars that shine so unchanged that the sailor may depend upon them to steer his course.\\"The context of this book is critical to understanding the significance of its message. The work was written beginning in 1926 as a series of pamphlets. Each contained timeless financial advise that was a gift to the masses in a time where monetary security was far from certain. Every gold piece truly counted. Financial and business book advocates may argue some of the messages are simplistic, but that is akin to saying that Alexander Graham Bell's telephone was not very high quality. In reality, the simplicity of the message is what makes the book great. Today, many investors are tempted by and exposed to a maelstrom of \\"money growing\\" products. From stock trades, loans, financial seminars, \\"get-rich quick\\" schemes, the path towards financial health can be quite confusing. In reality, however, the clear-cut road to success lies within the parables in this book. The message has a warmth and genuineness that is the polar opposite from the sleazy sensation associated with financial gurus and their $999 get rich box set....What exactly then does the book teach? Why is it valuable? While I don't want to give away the lessons, they reminded me that fundamentals are the key to success, even in 2011. Clason treats the reader as if, the reader him/herself is on the path towards financial discovery; yearning to hear the words from The Richest Man in Babylon and then proceeding to follow in his footsteps. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I have read this short read several times throughout my life and have even bought it for several of my friends. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Simple, easy read that would be perfect for younger readers to learn about personal finances. The focus on paying off debt, making smart investments and \\"paying\\" yourself first was reiterated numerous times in various ways. I like the use of short stories to illustrate these points and, because it was repetitive, you couldn't miss the message. This is probably too simplistic for experienced investors but I bought it with the idea of sharing it with my younger friends and family members."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I won't bore you with details in this review as other reviews have covered the details and some even include spoilers to the story.Some reviewers seem to think that it's much harder to live off of a portion of your income than this book suggests. One even suggested that it's difficult for most people to live on \\"80% of their income\\". Nonsense. It's not difficult to do. I have been in severe poverty to the point of \\"couch surfing\\" and not even owning a bicycle (read: homeless and walking)...Yet, I was able to do it. The difficulty level is only mental for the vast majority of people. One needs to have the discipline to say \\"no\\" to themselves and live below their means. Those who are too poor to use the principles in this book are only those who don't even have an income to begin with. Those people have to start at square one and get an income. I don't think one has to be \\"reasonably well off\\" to follow the principles in this book, but one does need a regular income--even a very small one. Step one: Get a full-time job.All that said, the book isn't too bad; however, the writing style comes off as being corny and silly. The first printing of this book that I'm aware of was in 1926; however, it attempts to use language from 1626. Unfortunately, the use of Middle English in this book is not entirely correct, accurate, or well done. Anyone who grew up on a King James Bible (or Shakespear) will probably find the writing silly and annoying. I thought it took away from the story and was a bit distracting. At the least, it is an unnecessary literary tool that is a distraction to the reading. At the most, it can be difficult for modern readers to understand and will cause readers to miss important information.Otherwise, the book seems to provide more of a starting point and an \\"imagine yourself rich\\" motivational story than a step by step guide to all aspects of gaining wealth. Fortunately, most people who need this introductory motivation more than anything else seem to also be those who have very little financial knowledge. Those who are confident and highly motivated to gain wealth have already done their homework and already know how to work the details. Those types of people probably won't need this book as they are already past it in my opinion.I'd recommend this book to the financially naive who can understand Middle English (e.g. graduates from private Christian schools, high schoolers who can understand Shakespear, etc). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not familiar with that archaic language or who already has some financial smarts."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is a 1926 financial self-help book by George S. Clason. Here, Clason presents a number of short stories, set in ancient Babylon, that communicate basic wealth-building principles.Clason's principles are sound and timeless: work hard, live within your means, save, and invest wisely. Clason also presents a get-out-of-debt plan whereby the debtor lives on seventy percent of his income, saves ten, and pays his debts with twenty. All these concepts are offered so simply that just about any reader should be able to grasp them.The stories themselves hold the reader's attention most of the time, although the Babylon shtick gets a little wearisome toward the end (and this isn't a long book). The characters all speak in King James-style English, but it doesn't always sound right (recent revised editions of the book, I understand, have updated the English). But it's never too big a problem, and even so, a lot of people are going to find The Richest Man in Babylon a lot more appealing than a dry, straightforward book on finance.In short, The Richest Man in Babylon is a readable, accessible introduction to wealth-building principles and financial responsibility."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"\\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\\"...Confucius (604 BC - 531 BC)And the road to riches and wealth begins with this book.

The advice to pay oneself first - keep aside atleast ten percent of your income and the savings set aside in prudent and safe investments multiply manifold over a long period is at the core of this book.

Clason has taken several simple money management principles and wrapped them in colorful stories of an ancient culture, which reminds us that financial struggles and the principles of how to escape them are timeless. This book has travelled the years well because the dialogue is already that of another time.

The other 9 stories are also interesting but the second story alone is worth more than the entire book.The cover of the book which I have says &quot;more than two million copies sold,&quot; and I am sure this small book has made those two million people - smart and rich."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This incredible little book was recommended to me for many years because of the texts inspirational qualities, in terms of offering timeless simple truths concerning thrift, financial planning and the value of a good work ethic. The formula offered for financial independence is highly practical and workable. Promoted as success secrets of the ancients, the text is written in parable form, similar to the bible, which gives the entire work a credible quality. I know from personal experience, that with persisitence, a good work ethic and a strong will to succeed; one can achieve a modicum of financial prosperity. Which, by the way, includes enjoying the fruits of one's labours. \\"Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain or try to save too much...live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy.\\" (20) In other terms, the lesson offered is a practice in moderation, not letting one's behavioural pendulum swing too far either way, but earning well and living well in the mean is a key to achieving a happy life.

This is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book uses parables to convey simple but profound financial advice. The ancient setting is excellent in showing the timelessness of this advice. The use of parables is a very entertaining way to convey information. While the advice offered in this book is not earthshattering or new, it is useful and true. The true value of this book, however, is not in its advice; it is in its motivational power. It will inspire you to do what you already know you should be doing.

Through a fascinating and believable story of Arkad, we learn that \\"a part of all you earn is yours to keep\\". I immediately connected with Arkad, because he and I both thought all of my earnings are mine to keep. Algamish, the money lender, said to Arkad \\"Do you not pay the garment-maker?

Sadly, I didn't have the sense to see how valuable this book was. It would be another 12 years before I finally sat down to read it. It drives me nuts to this day that I wasted those 12 years.This book introduced me to the concept of \\"pay yourself first.\\" Thanks to George Clason, I now realize that getting rich isn't a matter of how much you make--it's all about how much you keep.Babylon's basic premise is to save no less than 10% of every dollar you make; and not only save it, but put it to work. Do that consistently and continually, and you can't help but get wealthy. Why work like a dog only to hand over your paycheck to the landlord, the grocery store, the credit cards, etc? Much better to keep the 10% and have something to show for your effort. Once you accumulate enough, the money does all the work.Not sure this is for you? Go ahead then--keep living paycheck to paycheck. We'll see who comes out ahead.

It took me five years to read it and another twenty years to figure out how much wisdom it contained. I gave copies to my sons. The basic theme is that regardless of your income level or debt situation you can succeed and grow rich if you follow the simple formula. 10% for investment. 20% to pay off debts. And 70% to live on. The secret is the 10% to invest. Few of us can do that all the time, sometimes paying the electric bill takes all we've got and then some, but its good wisdom, and in a persuasive format.

Clayson, but written as if it had been translated from tablets taken from the ancient city of Babylon. Though the device is similar to something H.P. Lovecraft would use to establish credibility in a horror story, here it lends weight to his lessons and principles about how to create wealth. The basic principle boils down to save a dime from every dollar, but there are more nuggets of useful advice that would work wonders if you would but follow them faithfully.It is a bit jarring to the modern ear when Clayson talks of slaves and slavery, but when you think of it, being in debt instead of saving and having your savings and investments working for you is a kind of financial slavery. Like the 'drinking gourd' in the sky, if you follow the principles set forth in 'The Richest Man in Babylon' it will free you from the shackles of debt.I liked the last part where it described how Babylon was able to flourish despite not being a major port and not even having lots of natural resources such as forests or minerals. Through an ingenious system of irrigation and hard work, as well as systems of writing and record keeping, Babylon became a center of commerce. Kind of like Bakersfield, I'm thinking.10 Books for Further Study on Wealth Building and Personal SuccessHow to Be RichThe Millionaire Next DoorAs A Man ThinkethSeven Pillars of Wisdom: A TriumphThe Way to WealthThe Art Of WarRich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!Gold Ahead by George S.

The Richest Man in Babylon falls into this category as a book whose principles are conventional yet significant.Save ten percent of your income, constantly analyze and cut your expenses, guard your investments, obtain all necessary insurance; all these principles will appear obvious in nature, but this should not discount the value of the book. The Richest Man in Babylon provides a resounding message tucked within short historical anecdotes intended to ensure this advice takes hold of the reader.

It is rather a story of hard working men in ancient Babylon going to a rich friend and that rich friend (The richest man in Babylon) explains how to do so. It is remarkably clever and a truly timeless piece of literature. As applicable here in the 21st century as it was in 1920 when it was wrote.A short, extremely satisfying read. You should definetly buy this to achieve wise advice on finances from a man who knew what he was talking about.

Here is a brief summary of what this title has to offer:-Save 10 percent of what you earn, regardless.-Control your expenses.-Make your money multiply (work for you).-Invest wisely and look for the advice of wise persons.-Own your home.-Make sure you have provisions for when the time to retire comes.-Countinue to learn about how to make money.The book really comes down to these few learnings, which by no means is little. In fact, the way the story is told, it's very easy to grasp, and very likely you will feel identified with several of the characters throughout it.

As other reviewers pointed out, this is basic, common sense information, but good advice bears repeating. Each of my children have a copy of this book and began a savings program before age 16.I think the biggest point the book makes is, it does not matter what your income level is, anyone can save 10% of their income if they really think it is important enough to do, and that small amount on a weekly basis is hardly missed at the time, while growing over time to be a substantial amount. As Albert Einstein pointed out,there is nothing more powerful than compound interest and that is what you get by saving just 10% of all of your income.

Even a 10 year old will love and understand these beautifully written stories of the Babylonian wise men. This book saved me money even before I bought it. How did that happen?At a book sale the other day, I wished I could find an interesting read. Since nothing caught my eye, I rather grudgingly picked up two rather uninteresting expensive books, ones I would normally avoid. Later as I wandered around my eyes lighted on this most unusual title. I like reading about ancient cities so I naturally picked this one up. It was a book on the basics of personal finance. A few minutes browsing through it were enough to convince me that I would be wasting my money on the first two books. So I put them back and returned home clutching a copy of \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\".On reading it, I understood a law which has transformed my thinking for ever. The law said \\" A part of what you earn is yours to keep.\\" I now pay myself first each month when I get my salary. Each rupee I pay myself, I put in the growth scheme of a mutual fund. Each rupee is a slave which will work for me throughout my life. Each slave will have children and those children will work for me too. They in turn will have children who will also work for me. And the cycle goes on... This is an important lesson I have learnt from the Babylonian wise men.You'll meet Bansir the chariot builder who can never make his ends meet and his wise friend Arkad, the richest man in Babylon. You will enjoy their life stories while you learn the simple laws that govern the acquisition of money. &lt;em>A part of what you earn is yours to keep. Try it, you will never regret it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Hello all,Firstly, should state I have read the translated version of this book in Chinese. This book is probably one of the most useful personal finance books I've read. The advice, seemingly simple and straightforward, truly does make a difference in planning one's future.For it does not promise instant rags to riches, other practical advice includes 'working hard in one's job', 'saving 10% of your monthly salary' and 'do not be too stingy, enjoy the rest of the salary and life's many wonders' while keeping strictly to the principles of savings and investing.Right now, I'm working on 2.5% savings, it's less than the recommended amt but it's a mindset of \\"less now, more later\\". While paying off one's loans and debts, while saving, can feel the security and empowerment that comes with increasing one's savings as described in the book.In the end, what the book preaches is sticking to a simple formula of1)Earn one's money through labour2)Save 10% of earnings3)Spend the rest of 90%4)Invest savingsRepeat infinitely.The analogy of using a seed to describe the growth of money is apt as it requires discipline, patience and perseverance.A recommended read."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"In this easy to read and easy to understand book, you will find priceless, ageless advice for creating, building and maintaining wealth, woven into a wonderful story.

This classic masterpiece teaches you the rules of money, how to acquire it, and how to make it work for you. This small, 144 page book is worth its weight in platinum and will pay for itself over and over and over... again and again (I can't stress it enough ). The book is written in a story or parable format, where, through examples, a reader discovers how to harness the mysteries of money. These parables are relatively short and extremely enjoyable reading. It's time to invest in yourself!

No joke."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I first heard about this book 17 years ago. At that time, I was in a direct sales company and had the good fortune to attend a seminar conducted by a businessman named Jim Rohn.Mr. Rohn talked about his early mentor, a man named Earl Schoff and went on to tell us how Mr. Schoff turned him on to personal development and pointed him to the right books to read. One of the most important books, said Rohn was The Richest Man in Bablyon.Rohn had made and lost a fortune but came back and made another fortune and gave credit to the principles in The Richest Man in Bablyon for helping him accomplish that feat.I read The Richest Man in Bablyon and have to admit, I hated it! I thought it was stupid, like feel good stuff that has no substance. When ever friends came over, I hid the book. I felt so ridiculous.But Mr. Rohns words of wisdom kept echeoing in my mind. So I read it over and over untill the principles were imbedded into my conscious and subconsious mind.Soon, after the fifth reading, the the principles became habits for me. My wealth esculated at a very rapid rate. I was no longer wasting money. I was now investing the first 10% of my income, tithing 10% and investing another 10% in capital like no load mutuals, real estate, discounted mortgages, tax liens and my own business.The Richest Man in Bablyon has 7 basic principles:1) Start thy purse to fattening - save/invest2) Control thy expenditures - watch out for self serving brokers3) Make thy gold mutiply - use powerful investments4) Guard thy treasures from loss - watch out for brokers withtheir hot tips.5) Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment - rental properties, your own home---but stay within your means.6) Insure a future income - do work that you love to do. Become excellent at it.7) Increase thy ability to earn - education never stops. Keep reading good books like this one, The Millionaire Next Door, Rich Dad Poor Dad and so on.The Richest Man in Bablyon is an excellent book. Although only 145 pages, it is packed with powerful information that can be life changing. It has helped some people like Jim Rohn and others become millionaires.George Samuel Clason was born in Louisiana, Missouri, on November 7, 1874. He attended the University of Nebraska and served in the United States Army during the Spanish-American War. Beginning a long career in publishing, he founded the Clason Map Company of Denver, Colorado and published the first road atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1926, he issued the first in a series of pamphlets on thrift and financial success, using parables set in ancient Bablyon to make each of his points.These were distributed in large quantities by banks and insurance companies and became familiar to millions, the most famous being &quot;The Richest Man in Bablyon,&quot; the parable which has impacted the lives of millions of people. These &quot;Babylonian Parables&quot; have become a modern inspiritional classic.The Richest Man in Babylon is must reading for anyone who wants to achieve maximum financial success. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I am continually amazed at how a book so small can contain so much content and be so powerful. This book should be mandatory reading beginning at the grade school level through college and should be given as a gift right along with a diploma.I took the advice of acde1034@yahoo.com who recommended 'The Millionaire next Door&quot; and &quot;More Weath without Risk&quot; and bought and have read both. Both of these books are in the same status as &quot;The Richest Man in Bablyon&quot; and should also be required reading by anyone who is serious about their financial future. I am now giving &quot;Richest Man in Bablyon&quot; as a accessory gift to a cash gift at weddings and graduations."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I often give this book out as a gift whenever a person younger than me asks for my advice on money. I always present this book to them saying &quot;if you read it and do as it says, it will work magic.&quot; It really contains excellent, time tested advice, and would make a good gift for someone in their early 20s who is on their own for the first time, and struggling.The book is a series of parables about money written in the 1920s by George Clason. They were written as individual essays of a few thousand words, but the theme throughout them is consistent -- save 10% of your money, give 10% away, use 10% to reduce your debt load, and live on the remaining 70%.The stories in the book are entertaining; they are reminiscent of some of the parables in the Bible, such as the Prodigal Son or the story of the Workers in the Vineyard. I think this is intentional on the part of the author; certainly readers in the 1920s had an appreciation for &quot;old fashioned stories with a moral&quot; that people today seem to have lost. I enjoy the book greatly, though, and any thoughtful person who reads the book should find it interesting, especially if they are trying to get their finances in order."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I first read &quot;Richest Man in Bablyon bac in 1975. At first I was taken back by it's compact size and story book style. This book should be read by everyone from grade school to the college level students, employees, executives and the self employed. In todays's society, where people spend most if not all of what they make, this book is mre valuable than ever. Other books I would recommend are; &quot;The Millionaire next Door&quot; by Dr. Stanley et all, &quot;More Wealth without Risk&quot; and &quot;Financial Self-Defense&quot; by Charles Givens. Great book. A must read for anyone seeking financial independence,"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I am still amazed that such a tiny book can deliver so much powerful and timeless information. The Richest Man in Bablyon contains the secrets of the ages and is a must read book for anyone who wants financial success.It should be read and reread, over and over."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"When I started in sales 15 years ago, a very good friend of mine turned me on on the mind books. This was one of three he recommended and he was very successful.The other books were Think and Grow Rich and Success through a Positive Mental Attitude. The principles in Richest Man in Bablyon are timeless. Remember, you can live off your income, but you can't get wealthy off your income. You only get wealthy by investing and Richest Man in Bablyon teaches that all important step of investing.Two other books to read in the area of personal finance are Wealth without Risk and Financial Self Defense by Charles Givens. These books will show you how to save more on what you make."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I have to chucle when people say that outstanding books like this one by George Clayson are just &quot;good old fashioned common sense&quot; and are complaining because of the books brevity. You missed the whole point!Common sense is not necessarily common knowledge.I used to work for a millionaire who credited the principles in this book for helpin create his fortune which was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Save a dime out of every dollar. That is all it takes to start your fortune. But how many actually will do it?"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Twenty-five years ago, I sold radio advertising and had a client who seemed to have it all. Owned two of the town's best restaurants, drove a Porsche and a BMW, the hot cars then, was always taking a week or two off to go skiing or something and was only one year older than me. I'd spent a lot of time with the guy--he wasn't a great brain, terribly clever or witty. But he knew how to handle money.After calling on him for a couple of years, I figured I knew him well enough to ask him how he did it. I expected to hear he was deeply into commodities trading, or had an uncle who worked on Wall Street, a wealthy family or something like that, but he said it was really very simple. Once a year, he read The Richest Man in Babylon, and the rest of the year, he tried to apply it in his daily life.Well, you know how it is with people who Get Relgion. I wasn't in a place where I could accept that something so simple as reading a hundred and fifty pages of Ye Olde Storey could actually turn my financial life around, but I bought a copy. And about a year later on a rainy Saturday, I started reading it and couldn't put down. I know that's a phrase you see repeated in countless Amazon.com reviews, but it was true. The characters from the book reached out across thousands of years and grabbed me by the lapels and shook some sense into me.I have tried to re-read the book at least once per year, every year since then. Something else: I've tried to give away two copies per year, to people I know and love who I feel can benefit from not making the same mistakes I made in my mispent youth.There aren't any magic formulas in this book. There is nothing about options or day trading or investing new whatever the latest new technology is. It's almost math-free. Kind of ironic, when you turn the pages of the average business best seller and try to figure out the charts and graphs and algebra.This is a book that ought to be used in our schools. It's written in a wonderful old-world style and the characters are real heroes, grapling with many of the same issues we struggle with today--they're just doing it without cable-TV and the internet. You want a new Lexus? These folks talk about how hard it is to survive without one of the newest-model chariots. It's the same thing, really.Do yourself, your spouse, your children, your neighbors a favor. Buy a few copies of this one. Keep one for yourself, and give away the rest. Mark yours up. Underline it. Make notes in the margins. Try to re-read it whenever you feel yourself being tempted to pop for ADSL or new cellular phone or a ski trip or the latest and greatest widget.Read a single financial book, and you get a few good ideas. Read two and you get a few more. Read several and you start to get very little new information. I've read dozens of titles, from Andrew Tobias to Martin Zweig. But I'd recommend you start right here. If you never read another book on money, you will have a very sound basis for a very good life, after spending a day in ancient Babylon and watching how they learned to handle money thousands of years ago. This is the money book to buy if you're only buying one."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I think that some people underestimate this book due to it's small size.

Then you will achieve some real results."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"How are the sophisticated doing financially?

Although its writing in &quot;Old English&quot; posed some challenges at first due to the fact that I am not an English native speaker, the interest in reading it overcame this fast.

To my surprise, at the wedding a multi-millionaire (in 1950'dollars) pulled me aside for a private conversation. He slipped me a small wrapped present and advised me it was the absolute secret to his successes in life. Wow, I thought - a real key to success?!Upon unwraping the gift I was again surprised. It contained a very simply written, eary to read, book of basic financial fables. This was my first introduction to \\"The Richest Man In Babylon\\". I was disappointed, and dubious, until I realized that Bill H. so believed in its principles that he had written a private message to me (which will remain private) on the fly page and then signed it. Now I may have been a poor young cowboy, BUT my mom raised no fools! I wasn't about to second guess my wealthy mentor...and I was definately tired of being poor!First, I read it cover to cover. Then I contemplated what I had read for a period of time. Finally the power of the simple advice offered in the book hit home. I knew that if a person reads something new, 90 days later only 2-3% is still available for conscious recall, but if a person reads (or hears) a teaching in exactly the same words every day for one week it will become ingrained thinking. A 67% conscious recall is then available to the student. So I outlined the book's chapters and tape recorded them. I then proceed to listen to them, in order, for seven days each.Net-net, as I celebrate my 50th year with Nancy (a true keeper) and what we refer to as \\"the Book\\" (also a true keeper), I find us enjoying strong financial independence in our retirement age. As a life-long entrepreneur, my personal successes and the successes of my companies are directly rooted in this simple book Bill gave me so long ago.I recommend EVERYONE buy and learn from it (as opposed to just reading it!)

It was written in 1929. The principles have taken good care of me all my adult life. If the young (and the not so young) would apply its teachings then the world would not be in the financial mess it is in today. Unfortunately people won't listen for the most part. I know, I have tried to encourage people to read and impliment it but largely to no avail. It is 100 pages of fabulous information! I bought nine copies of this for my grandchildren and personalised each one with written encouragement. I hope they will be more receptive than the very large majority. Earl Nightingale once said, \\"If you do the opposite to what everyone else is doing you will probably never make another mistake in your life.\\" What is everyone else doing? Well one of the things is, they're not reading this book, or if they are they are not applying what it teaches. Wise up, buy a copy, read it and do what it says! It will undoubtedly be the best fiver you ever spend on financial advice. You don't need a financial advisor. George Clason will give you all you need for five quid. If you're in debt you don't need a company to help you out. You can do it yourself for free. I am off on my 4th holiday this year. Thanks George! What more can I say? Just one thing.

Since, as many other readers state, you must listen to these principles until they become imprinted in your mind to become successful at gathering wealth.

I expected to learn how to start saving for the rest of my life. Although I'm still worried about my future I feel a little more confident about it after reading this book. Instead of simply giving me a list of things to do to not end up homeless this book told several stories about men in much older times with financial struggles and men with no struggles thanks to their financial strategies. This helped the book find a balance between informative and interesting.To me the most important part of the book was the Babylon guard. He tells us how an enemy army was kept at bay because of the city walls. This is a great analogy for how if you have the necessities of life such as a house that's yours and plenty of food for your family, Its worth not being able to enjoy simple luxuries available to others. Needs and wants are to very different things.

I found the contents very interesting and instructive. To give financial advice in story form is an excellent idea, and makes it entertaining and easy to understand. Unfortunately - I guess I'm not used to it - therefore found the \\"ancient\\" language, namely all the \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\", \\"goest\\", \\"savest\\", etc. terribly stilted and a bit tiresome to listen to after the first twenty minutes or so.

I purchased myself a copy and my wife. This book will change your concept about saving and taking advantage of opportunities."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Ditto fellow readers: I also first read \\"Richest Man in Babylon\\" in 1975 when I started my job at Honeywell, Inc. It changed my life too. Crocker Bank (now gone) was located on the corner of same property as Honeywell, on Century Blvd, in Los Angeles. I was a single mom and wanted to buy a house. I made an appointment to talk to the banker. I had no idea how I would be able to afford to purchase a home for my son on my income. I can't remember the bankers name, but I am forever grateful for his advice and recommendations. One bit of advice was to read this book. Needless to say, I transformed my thinking, attitude and behavior about money. I began investing in myself first by diverting 10% of my income into a saving and gave 10% away off the top. I also started a little business with MLM (now Network Marketing). The investment was affordable, (meaning very, very small) and so was the risk. The possibility was there to leverage my money and it was up to me to seize the opportunity, which in essence was sweat equity! I was a \\"Holiday Girl\\" and sold lotions and potions, when I wasn't in class or at work. Something amazing happened, in two years I was able to purchase my own brand new home in a new development. I must share that it was so much fun knowing I could afford a new home. I looked at different neighborhoods, models and square footage. I finally selected the development and re-designing the floor plan. I picked appliances, window covering, flooring and carpet. I redesigned the entry foyer and custom designed the fireplace, opened the master bedroom with sliding door out into the back yard, because I knew I would add a pool. The following year I put in a pool! I was the only single woman owner in the new hosing development - an obvious rare feat in 1977.The Richest Man in Babylon introduced Seven Principles:1) Fatten Your Purse -Win-win-win with 10-10-10. Pay yourself first-Give 10% away-Invest 102) Control Your Expenditures - Cut up those credit cards. Guard your desires. Stay within your budget.3) Make Your Moolah Multiply - Put your money to work honey. Get advice to avoid pitfalls of investments4) Guard Your Treasures From Loss - Protect your principle from loss and watch for corrupt banks and greedy lenders5) Build Your Home Into A Profitable Investment - Leverage your our home to create income, recurring revenue, rental properties - stay within your means.6) Insure A Future Income - Only do work that you love to do. Become excellent at it.7) Increase Your Ability To Learn and Earn - It is a heart and soul adventure.

Like many parables, the instructive lessons it conveys usually are not unknown to us. Those readers who were disappointed by this book, particularly those who thought they would receive some magical advice as to how to become fabulously wealthy, missed Clason's more subtle message concerning human nature. It is, for instance, clearly good advice to place 10 percent of one's income into savings; however, Clason's character Arkad does not rest his advice on that point alone. Careful readers notice that several types of men approach Arkad for his advice. Some of these men are poor, while others are relatively well off; yet each man perceives his purse to be equally thin. Why? Arkad's (and therefore Clason's) more fundamental message addresses the human inclination to assess one's well-being according to the amount of material goods one possesses; and not just any material goods, but those that are quite unnecessary to living a good and happy life. A plain and simple life, we discover, is a good and happy life. Not only does such a life free us from petty distractions, but in so doing it reframes our perceptions of what truly matters in life by renewing our attention to objects far more important than the latest fashionable clothing, computerized vehicle, and technological gizmo.Clason's book is not so much a revolutionary self-help manual as it is a gentle reminder of how we ought to conduct ourselves in life. There is no shame in admitting that we need such reminders; I need them myself, and that is perhaps the principal reason that I appreciate this little story."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Many of my peers believe that they have to hit a windfall in order to become \\"rich\\". They don't understand how to get there in a methodical way since we live in a world that glamorizes lottery winners and serves up get-rich-quick schemes in the media.Those are the exact people I recommend this book to. The Richest Man in Babylon introduces the fundamentals of accumulating wealth to the masses. This book can really help shape the mindset of people looking to reach utopia one day. Aside from an awful lot of luck, getting rich starts with simply thinking a certain way.That said, where this book is lacking is in the tactics, which is fine. Building wealth is about creating and executing offensive and defensive strategies and not about 'just tell me what to do to get rich' formulas. Although the strategies here are timeless, those looking for a road map may be frustrated. To those folks, I must add the following: There is no step-by-step recipe that works for everyone. Learn these lessons and be your own pathfinder. If are are diligent, you will get there."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"If you have children, buy this book! This is a primer for life!Much as children have been read Aesop's fables, Uncle Remus, Vedas and the myths of whichever European or Asian early civilization you want to chose in order to teach them to grow up to be civilized people, this book is vital to teach them to grow up and be upward mobile upper class people.Mobility is a skill set, not a fortune of birth. Some people chose to find those skills for themselves but, much more commonly, upwardly mobile people are taught those skills and raised with them such that they become and ingrained part of who they are as a person, family and community.This book teaches those skills in parables and short stories that are simple enough that children will learn them. They are pointed enough that youth will listen to them. They are correct enough that adults will want to continue to adhere to them.Yes, this book is neigh a century old. I predict that when it is two millennium old, people will still be reading it as Aesop's works are still read today. Paul Bunion may be forgotten but the richest man in Babylon will still be told of in whispers to children who will grow up to achieve wealth."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"In this book,a man from Babylon learns his wisdom from an old man he met when he was younger and now teaches everyone else his wisdom, passing it down to other listeners.

Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment. 6. Insure a future income. 7. Increase thy ability to earn.It is basically saying pay yourself first, don't be tempted to spend any money on dumb things or invest in silly things and be confident in your investing and trying to be wealthy.This book would be good for the academic reader that wants to learn a few things and this book deffinetaly teaches you a thing or two in a creative way by telling the story of a rich man in Babylon.The books effectiveness for me and I certainly hope that will help others, will teach you about how to save money and how to deal with it on a financial level.

Highly recommended this book to my sons, as a guide and foundation for handling their finances."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is a collection of allegorical insights into financial wisdom and wealth, told though parables of several generations of men living in ancient Babylon. The lessons taught bear striking similarity to those of Rich Dad, Poor Dad--that was published more than 70 years later--and fans of the later Kiyosaki/Lechter book will likely enjoy this older one written by Clason, published in the 1920's. I had minimal prior familiarity of Babylon prior to reading this book. While the forward does discuss the historical context of Babylon, the book itself is *not* about the city proper. It is about finance in a real-world, rags-to-richest sense.The 3rd-person narrative and biblical lexicon and grammatical style took me by surprise, though once I saw past the dialog into the stories themselves, I found myself entertained and frequently nodding in agreement. Non-native English speakers *may* stumble on the character dialog. For example, \\"Never, in all the years of our friendship, didst thou talk like this before...\\", or, \\"There were skekels which I cast with careless freedom to the beggars; there were pieces of silver with which I did buy finery for my wife...\\" will read without much issue to native readers, though may prove distracting for readers not accustomed to archaic English writing.Overall: 4 of 5."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Having been written in 1926 and not updated since, you'd think this book was more than a little dated. Not so. The advice given is timeless.

It's the most inspiring book about money I've ever read. I've saved 20% of my check for the first time probably ever this check and I plan on sticking to it. If you want some motivation to save money, read this book."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"As the author of a sequel,The Richest Man in Persia: This long-awaited sequel to The Richest Man in Babylon is today's blueprint for safe, ethical wealth and personal success, I was absolutely inspired by George Clason's book. I bought my battered copy more than 50 years ago and it put me on the right track for personal success from the start, and again when I lost almost everything and had to start again.Inspirational writers through the years have sung the praises of The Richest Man in Babylon. I believe this has been without exception.The book was written in beautiful parable style and tells the story of The Richest Man in Babylon as he shares the secrets of his success with the poor citizens of the city.The greatest secret of all, and the one that truly drove this book to success for decade after decade, was to pay yourself first. Save 10% of everything you earn and live on the rest. Invest the 10% and keep investing it, adding all the interest you earn.This is such a simple rule, you may be inclined to dismiss it, but I urge you to buy the book and read it fully. Wisdom often is simple, and this is certainly wisdom that can be yours.I've given this book to many young people and those who took it seriously have succeeded beyond their expectations. Every young person should read The Richest Man in Babylon.And not so young. I'm very much youth-deprived now and I advocate the book for all ages. In fact, one of the stories in the book is about a professor in England who had fallen on hard times and was saved by the book's ideas.If you are doing it tough now, or if you want to make life better, or if you're just starting out and want wisdom to guide you, this is your opportunity.I urge you to dream, and dream big.

After all of the stories that repeat the principles, the author explains quite simply a formula to follow to start a path towards proper budgeting and financial success. The 70-20-10 approach works. No one ever said it was 'get rich'. It takes work, which is also something the book teaches.Money management skills are terribly taught, if they are taught at all, in schools.A simple $10 dollar lesson that I am guessing a majority of people could benefit from if they are wise enough to understand the basics being explained.This book should be mandatory reading for all school children, and heck elected politicians too! :)"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Forget \\"Rich Dad\\", this book actually tells you how to be rich in simple, understandable language.

This is the kind of book that I would give/recommend to anyone regardless if their interest is outside of business/finance. Since finance can seem daunting these days due to its complexity, the book simplifies it through short stories. The insights that it provides allows me to step back and look at finance in simple terms. It opened up my eyes by introducing new possibilities, and adds positive reinforcements as to what a person can achieve in his/her lifetime. The wisdom that the book teaches is financially enlightening and it can totally change how you view your finance in many ways. Although the messages are delivered in a very unique fashion, the underlying nuggets of wisdom are direct and concisely to the point.The concepts might be a refresher to individuals who already has a solid grasp of their finance, but nonetheless, it solidifies what you already know in many ways. This is a type of book that I can refer back to time and time again. If you apply some of the concepts that is presented in the book to your life, you will be definitely on your way to financial freedom. If I can sum up the book in one word, it would be \\"refreshing.\\" I recommend this book to everyone regardless of your interest or age. Read, apply, then repeat."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Great book for those trying to understand how to have money. Written in the old King James bible style it can be a little hard to read, but once I adjusted to it I actually found that it made it more interesting to read.

If you only take one thing from this book that is the most important."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"If this was required reading in Middle School, perhaps the US and the world wouldn't be in the financial mess we're in today. Basic common sense rules for managing money are espoused in this book. The problem is that common sense is becoming increasingly uncommon. I gave this short book to someone who was going into the hospital to read there, knowing they would have time to kill. That they didn't read it was enlightening. People are ignorant about money because they choose to be. Don't be ignorant, read this book!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Just because something is old, doesn't automatically mean that it is outdated. A good example for this is \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\". The original version was written in the 1920's yet its financial advice is as current as it was back then. I enjoyed listening to these ancient tales while noting all the important money lessons. Especially now that we are faced with a weak economy it is important to remind ourselves of some of these basic rules when it comes to handling money and building wealth.For example:Pay yourself first.Live on less than you make.Live on a budget.Invest your money.Diversify.And don't go into debt.I believe that these rules will always hold true no matter how advanced our society becomes. This book is definitely a good way to refresh some of our financial common sense. Short and straight to the point."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I do not usually appreciate \\"self-help\\" books, but the points made in \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" seem to be mostly just common sense. Unfortunately, most people completely lack common sense about money.One of the main ideas that most people never seem to get is that it is better, and more interesting, to make money from your MONEY than to make money breaking your back. However, this leads us to the first difficulty: in order to make money from your money, you have to have some.As we supposedly \\"all know,\\" we cannot have our cake and eat it, too. But most people spend every penny in their paychecks, and then some run out and charge more on their credit cards. They live from hand to mouth, from paycheck to paycheck, and they never even dream of actually saving 10 percent (or more) of what they earn.But how can you have money if you don't have any money? Let us imagine some typical American, earning (say) $40K per year. Saving 10 percent of his salary would give him \\"only\\" $4,000 in the bank at the end of one year. This looks pretty miserable, until you stop to wonder just how many people could actually lay their hands on $4,000 in cash WITHOUT doing a cash-advance on their credit cards. By the end of the fifth year, this fictional person would have $20,000 in the bank, assuming no interest and no investment income.But now this person is in a position to actually begin making investments, and watch his money work for him. And the profits from that should just be plowed right back into \\"the money tree.\\"My personal opinion: if you think there is another way to \\"financial freedom,\\" you are simply deluding yourself. Win the lottery? Gee, how many rich people do you know who got their start that way?Answer: none. Lottery winners usually run out and spend their winnings faster than they come in. Consider winning \\"a million dollars\\" in some phony lottery which does not actually hand you a million dollars, but doles you out $50,000 per year over 20 years. Most people turn this into a sort of middle-class welfare, and wind up as broke as they ever were. But, if you did NOT quit your job, and put that money in the bank, faithfully, over a 20-year-period, you would (after investing it) have a whole lot more than a million dollars.The author of this book was clever: he set it in ancient Babylon. The point was that reality, in many important respects, does not change.I would agree with all that there are many ways to be wealthy: in learning, in money, in love, in friends, and so on. But it is very difficult to attain those other happinesses if you can't make the rent.This is actually a good book. It has never gone out of print, and that may mean something."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I enjoyed The Richest Man In Babylon and appreciated this book by George S. Clason.

It is written in story form, telling parables about money and accumulating wealth. The story format makes it very impactful. I think even today we have slaves and slave masters. The slaves are the ones who work for other people and live paycheck to paycheck. The slave masters are the ones who own companies or have other types of passive income, thus having slaves work to support them. I have passive income myself, and I have slaves working 9 to 5 jobs to give me my income. I no longer work for other people. I'm self employed now and I have my own business. Working for other people was hell and working for myself is heaven. I was very abused in every job I had, but as my own boss I treat myself very well!

Such is the case with George Clason's, THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON. Originally published in 1926, this book is not only still relevant today, but over the past eighty or so years has spawned many a financial success book. In fact, this is like an early version of Robert Kyosaki's decade old, Rich Dad Poor Dad.It's even quite possible that this very book may well have been the financial training Kyosaki's rich dad used to create his wealth and became the financial knowledge he passed on. The timing is certainly about right. The lessons are more than similar.This book is written in the form of a parable as told in ancient Babylon. Clason uses what he thought to have been the proper language of the time, similar to the King James English derived from the translation of Textus Receptus. Herein lies my only knock on this great book. Unless you don't mind wading through all of the \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\" and \\"hath nots\\", the book does become tedious at times.Nevertheless, it is well worth the effort. There are precious pearls of financial wisdom to be gleaned from these pages.

If you make 300 grand a year, and you spend 325 grand, you are broke at a higher level. Clason's book reveals how to build wealth with money you already have coming in, that's it!

None of the concepts presented in the book are novel, in fact they are all common sense. That being said, they are presented in a very enlightening context that spurs self reflection. The concepts discussed focus on the importance of savings, and investing these savings in a responsible and safeguarding manner. The book also focuses on the importance of hard work, and advocates against debt and living beyond one's means.This is a very inspirational book that is both easy and entertaining to read for old and young alike. It is truly amazing that the basic laws of personal finance realized thousands of years ago still apply. Wikipedia has a detailed summary on this book for further reading: [...]. On a side note for readers, this edition is written in King James English.Below are some excerpts I found particularly insightful:1- \\"One may not condemn a man for succeeding because he knows how.Neither may one with justice take away from a man what he has fairly earned, to give to men of less ability.\\"2- \\"Preceding accomplishment must be desire.

It's a natural choice for kids who are just starting to discover the pleasures and dangers of money; at that age, books can have a big impact of values!Don't look to this book to give you advanced financial planning information or directions on how to start a Roth IRA. If you're a financial whiz, you've probably already mastered many of these principles.

For those of us that live in the real world is also some hard work and self-sacrifice involved. This classic book contains the very advice that most sensible parents would want their child to hear, but unfortunately -- most kids don't listen to their parents. Of course, unlike this book, most parents these days don't speak in (supposed) Babylonian parables -- maybe if they did, kids would listen more.

The problem with these books are that they can only be implemented when you have accumulated certain amount of money (typically around $500k in assets), so it wouldnt benefit the average joe. On the other hand if you do possess the required assets, it is still a struggle to double your wealth because you dont have the knowledge of the fundamentals of creating wealth.Majority of the information out there would explain to you how to increase your assets, but what they dont explain to you is how to start with \\"Nothing\\" and create wealth. \\"The richest man in babylon\\" clearly addresses this important issue and have to admit that majority of the informations out there lack this principle. It is like teaching you how to write sentences without you knowing your ABC's,... and thats why lots of informations on creating wealth fails with so many people.Being successful in any area of your life means grasping and mastering the fundamentals, and \\"The richest man in babylon\\" delivers the fundamentals clearly, precisely and easily.I give this a 5stars based on the high quality of educational content it provides to its listener/reader(from all walks of life)."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"First of all, if you don't like reading books written in shakesperian language (thou, thy, blah, blah) then stay away from this one!!

It was published in 2011 by Myriad World Publishers. (The original book was published in 1926.)I bought this one to replace the copy I lent to a friend. The typography is TERRIBLE!!!! It's so small I'd need a strong magnifying glass for every page, and it's laid out quite strangely and unattractivly. I agree with what another reviewer said, it looks as if it were just cut-and-paste from somewhere else and never reviewed by a human eye before going to press.Bottom line: DON'T GET THIS VERSION, buy another one that you can actually read. It is a wonderful story, illustrating basic debt and financial principles easily and clearly."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"This book was pretty good, and I would have given it five stars had it not been for two things:1) The repeating of information over and over again (maybe the author wanted this to strike his points home, but for me it was a little overkill).2) The language used. It seemed to be in a NKJV of the book... I would assume all of them are like that, but this one was like \\"thou hast\\" and things like that. (Maybe it was the author's purpose to \\"bring you back\\" to the Babylonian times, but to me it was just a distraction and made it a little bit harder to read).Other than those two things, the book was great! It was a short read (important IMO) and I found it very hard not to continue on to learn the next \\"step\\" or find out more info that was just in the next section.Worth the few hours to go through it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"I would recommend this book as the best first book on money for anyone that would like to begin reading about the subject.

I would also recommend parents or educators give this book to their children to read (even though it's not a children's book) because it's accessible to people of all ages and enjoyable enough to keep the interest of even an overstimulated child.This is the place to begin to learn about money, but not the end of the road.

It tells you not to invest with a shoe maker who wants to become a diamond trader. Why? Because the shoe maker knows nothing about diamonds. Sounds simple enough? It is, but we need to be reminded of this. Most new businesses are probably going to fail, but our aspiring capital seeker will tell us anything to get our money, so by the end of his pitch, if we're naive enough, our heads will be full of hot air and we'll be flying, dreaming of those profits to come, and perhaps to eager to break our piggy bank and multiply it.Luckily, books like this tell us fables that will remind is of the legendary mistakes of others, so we don't fall in the same traps."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"When you forget to appreciate yourself this book tells you how in technicolor.

Buy the book!"},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"In the pages of history, there lives no city more glamorous than Babylon, known for its lavish houses, palaces and huge city walls. Its very name conjures visions of wealth and splendor. Its treasures of gold and jewels were fabulous. One naturally pictures such a wealthy city as located in a suitable setting of tropical luxury surrounded by rich natural resources of forests and mines. It was located beside the Euphrates River, in a flat, arid valley. Babylon is an outstanding example of man's ability to achieve great objectives, using whatever available means at his disposal.Babylon, as George S. Clason notes, it was also the cradle of modern finance: money as the means of exchange, tradable property titles, promissory notes and all forms of lending and borrowing were all highly developed. Its prosperity continued for centuries because its inhabitants were allowed to make money freely. Even slaves, if they could earn a bit on the side, could eventually buy their way to freedom.Moreover, Babylon's success inspired Clason to write a series of parables which would demonstrate the unchanging principles of finance and wealth building. When George S. Clason's introduced these parables in a famous series of pamphlets, they became very popular (All are pregnant with practical wisdom) and were distributed by banks, insurance companies, financial institutions and other employers to teach the benefits of saving and hard work.His advice soon provided guidance to millions of readers. Although first written over half a century years ago, these teachings are as relevant today as they were for the citizens of Babylon. The success secrets of the ancients -- an assured road to happiness and prosperity. Countless readers have been helped by the famous \\"Babylonian parables,\\" hailed as the greatest of all inspirational works on the subject of thrift, financial planning, and personal wealth creation.Acclaimed as a modern-day classic, this celebrated bestseller offers an understanding of -- and solution to -- your personal financial problems that will guide you through a lifetime. This is the book that holds the secrets to acquiring money, keeping money, and making money earn more money. These fascinating and informative stories have become a modern classic in their field.The Richest Man in Babylon is a book you will want to read yourself, recommend to friends, and give to young people just starting out in life. The best advice is often free. The solutions to life's toughest problems are often the most simple. Perhaps that is why the best advice too often is ignored. It's just too simple to be believable. The advice offered by this book is so simple that it most often is ignored. Yet it reveals the only reliable secret to obtaining and accumulating wealth. It is a simple (and safe) secret for obtaining riches. It is not easy, but it is simple. It is hard to execute, but it is unfailing.There are a lot of ways to build wealth, but there is a simple, sure way that can always work. And these are what George S. Clason made very clear in this timeless classic. His first prescription is to pay yourself first. Set aside 10% (or more) of what you earn before taxes, before expenses, and before debts. Then, tackle those debts by applying the next 20% against them until they are gone. That leaves 70% and you should live on this. Spend it and enjoy life as you can while staying within this budget. To be realistic, you must control expenditures. That is the second point, and often the biggest missing ingredient in accumulating wealth. All of a sudden expenses simply rise to meet the new level of income.Once the debts are gone and the savings grow, and then make your money work for you by investing in money-making ventures. But guard your treasures wisely, as money slowly gained can be quickly lost by risky choices. Here is where you have to rely on experts until your own experience affords you the knowledge to make good choices.Furthermore, Clason emphasizes that inaction is often the greatest thief of success. While building your savings be alert to good business opportunities and seize them when found. Own rather than rent and insure a future income by royalties, rents, and so on. Finally, and perhaps simplest of all, is to increase your ability to earn by acquiring additional new skills.Conclusively, this is a small and cheap book, readable in a few hours. However, don't fall under the false impression that the lessons are too simple. The laws and parables are simple, but executing a plan takes effort and the right mindset. It is the best starting book to discover the first steps of personal wealth creation and accumulation. If you haven't heard of or read The Richest Man in Babylon yet, maybe this is a good time to grab a copy for yourself and read it."},{"Title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","review":"Lots of people say &quot;Money isn't everything&quot;, and they're probably right. However, most of the people who agree with that statment are those who have taken steps to ensure that Money is no longer a major concern in their life.The information contained in this book is ageless, practical and indeed, priceless; it can stand proudly against the modern-day texts, such as &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; and &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot;.

How could I not given the lofty Amazon rating (5 stars strong with many reviewers) and the book jacket's promise as \\"the book that holds the key to personal wealth\\"? This book does not disappointI would recommend the book because the parables do help describe Clason's points in an engaging way.To help in your purchase decision, the following is a summary of the book's contents:(1) Save a portion of your income (Put away X% of your income every paycheck)(2) Control your expenditures (Don't spend more than you need to)(3) Invest your money (If you are unable to invest effectively, get someone else to invest your money)(4) Purchase a home(5) Increase the amount of money you earn(6) Protect your wealth against lossesIn effect, the book can be summarized by the following statement:Maximize your wealth inflows (Points: 1, 3, 4, 5) while minimizing your wealth outflows (Points: 2, 6).If this all seems very basic to you, then this is NOT the book for you.

I first heard about this book back in the 1970s when I was involved in my first network marketing company. Fortunately, the people associated with that company taught more than just use the company products and put all of your money into company material.Many years later, I attended a seminar and met the great Jim Rohn. If you have ever heard Jim Rohn speak, then you know that this is along with Think & Grow Rich one of his must read books, the book his mentor Mr. Earl Schoff told him about and the book that allowed Jim Rohn to become financially independent in only 6 years.Don't let the size of this book fool you---it is packed with powerful information. It is must reading. This book is the basis of many of the top financial experts from Charles J. Givens who calls it \\"The 10% solution\\" through Suze Orman, Dr. Stanley \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" up to David Bach \\"The Automatic Millionaire.\\" I don't know of anyone who has amassed any real level of wealth without practicing these principles.It's a small book. An easy read. You can finish it in one evening. But if you use it, you can amass a fortune.Jim Rohn says he has recommended this book at his seminars, in his books and on his tapes for nearly 40 years and best as he can tell only about 3% actually go out, buy the book and actually read it and apply the techniques.

Takes a few minutes to get used to the language, but you'll suddenly find yourself caught up in a series of &quot;a-ha's!&quot;The book is filled with common sense advice, but the beauty is that it's presented in such a way that you're vaulted into a different way of thinking about accumulating wealth (similar to the style of &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot;, only this book was originally published in 1926!)Coming in at only 144 pages, &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; is an easy 1-2 hour read and will forever change the way you view personal finance.
