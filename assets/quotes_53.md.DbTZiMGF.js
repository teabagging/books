As the book progresses, it does seem to get harder, but that doesn't take away from the overall greatness of this book. In comparison to Mere Christianity, it's a much easier book to read, but seems to be directed to a smaller, already-Christian audience. Having said that, I would recommend it to anyone willing to take the time to read it and put the effort into getting something out of it, regardless of religious beliefs. It doesn't take a lot of effort, but as with any book that requires self-reflection, you won't get something out of it if you don't let yourself."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Problem, how do you take a book as good, timely, useful, insightful and intelligent as C.S.

His great timing, his irreverant humor, (not easy to express with established and unchanging lines!) and a history of making us laugh at bureaucrats and you have an audio book on morality that gets its message accross even better than it did in print.Of course there are those who don't like the message of the book in the first place, for them it can be percieved as entertainment and fine entertainment.

Am pleased with the total transaction."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"For a bit of 'inspirational' reading this Christmas, I picked up _The Screwtape Letters_. I've read some of the Narnia series as well as _Mere Christianity_ by Lewis and I knew the basic gist of Screwtape, but still wasn't 100% sure what was in store for me.The book is a series of letters written by the demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood. Both are demons of Hell and the letters are discussions of the practices used to tempt humans and lead them down to Hell rather than letting them make it to Heaven. Wormwood is a junior demon working on tempting a human man in 'contemporary' (to Lewis...~1940s) London. Screwtape is a senior demon no longer doing field work but now in a higher administrative role and full of good advice for the young Wormwood.The book is often humorous as you read about the follies of humans from the point of view of these immortal and immoral tempters. The humorous anecdotes are also subtly invasive as you realize just how true to life these comments are.Screwtape advises Wormwood to take advantage of the foibles of human nature to lead the man down the path to Hell while all the while letting him believe he's on his way to Heaven. The subversive realities these demons try to persuade the human to believe are strangely familiar to the social norms of the world in which we live.Screwtape admonishes that, unless the man is truly vile, Wormwood shouldn't try to push him away from religion but rather let him get puffed up in his religion to the point of self-exhaltation based on his own interpretations. The demons are wary of the truly penitent but are grateful for the many who go through the motions of religion for perception only.There are many good lessons to be learned through the book. Many poignant passages softly chastising humble pride, valueless bravery, hopeless nostalgic dreamers and others.It's a great satire on the state of the world.What was most sad and scary to me is that ~50-60 years later, not much has changed. The same subtle lies are being whispered through the world and countless humans (myself included at times) are believing them and gently paving our own way to Hell.Two other things I found very interesting in this book:1. This edition included a short epilogue from C. S. Lewis. In it, he discusses the difficulty of writing from the point of view of a devil. He wrote of the darkness he felt in trying to shed all semblance of goodness in order to portray such a viewpoint. Perhaps one of my favorite themes in the book was that of Screwtape trying to understand \\"God's Love.\\" He just couldn't believe that God truly loves us and that it is that Love that is at the heart of his motivations. I think Lewis truly threw himself into the role of Screwtape and did a great job embodying the demon. I don't envy him that difficult task.2. This edition also included Lewis' one follow up to the Letters. It was a short work called \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" and the setting is a graduation commencement for novice demons just out of training and ready for assignments. Screwtape is giving the commencement speech and toast. His language and themes were again very relevant and honest satires on the world we live in. A few paragraphs really caught my attention...He talked about the education system of humans and ways they (the demons) might undermine it. He talked of standardized testing and lowering the scale to the least common factor such that the most inept student could succeed (only with that bare minimum) while the average and excellent students will leave school with no educational increase. He talked about undermining the true study and learning by replacing it with rote memorization of facts and figures to the point that any ability to truly think would be diminished and thus humans would not be able to see through the flimsy temptations. Sadly, a lot of the language in this section sounded far too similar to the No Child Left Behind legislation and other similar practices in the school system today. How sadly prophetic Lewis was on this front.I'd be interested to find some analysis of it that helps break out different letters into their themes...maybe I'll work on one. Something that could be used to pull out passages about some of the different temptations: Love/Romance/Sex, Religion, Pride, Nature, etc.Overall, I really enjoyed this novel. There were a few sections that really seemed to drag on but generally it was a lot of fun to read and it left me in a state of deep thinking afterwards. Give it a try.****4 stars"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Read this book for entertainment, great writing, its original premise, or whatever, and you won't be disappointed. If spiritual thoughts start sneaking up on you somewhere along the way, I promise it won't spoil the fun."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"An excellent book which shows how the \\"other side\\" thinks. Great writing! One of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis is clearly one of the masters of 20th century prose. His theological ideas are very succulent in their purpose and while I may not agree with every doctrinal belief of his, the essence of his message is a very pure one - fulfilment comes only from submitting your will to the Father, through loyal service, dedication, and love (which He very happily returns to you in limitless abounds).\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is a collection of epistles from the senior devil Screwtape to his junior 'tempter-in-training' nephew, Wormwood. The contents of Scewtape's letters are various discourses on how to spiritually influence the tempter's human \\"patient\\" into staying as far away from God as possible.Through this devil's advocate style of writing, we are given a very interesting glimpse into the workings of the evil one and how he can gradually pull people away from the Father through subtle tactical advances.Many times through reading Screwtape's letters as he discussed the behaviour of Wormwood's patient, I would have to stop myself and think, \\"Wow, I have acted exactly the same in that situation before\\" and Lewis begins to open up your perception of your own behaviour with an accurate objective commentary of our human thought processes - and the way in which they can be turned against us, e.g. how realising one's own humility can easily turn into a form of spiritual pride.Most surprisingly, was a passage where Screwtape discusses how God's only desire is for every human being to become exactly as his Son is, to the point where they realise that they are themselves sons and daughters of God. Lewis definitely understands the very core of Jesus' teachings, no matter how much Christianity has corrupted them over the years.Fiction-wise, all of the characters mentioned are given to us in brief glimpses at different times in the book, to the point where while there may not be large amounts of detail on them all, you could give a good description of each at the end of reading the entire book.Some of the more \\"story\\" focused elements are quite fun, and give us a glimpse into the 'mythos' that Lewis has obviously given some thought to before writing the \\"Letters\\". While some events are quite enjoyable, even humorous at times (such as when Screwtape's momentary anger causes him to involuntarily transform into a giant centipede) I felt slightly disappointed that there weren't more plot elements or details of this demonic \\"world\\" that Lewis' characters live in - although perhaps this was to preserve the authentic tone of the letters and the fluidity with which the book progresses.Overall, some passages touched me so deeply that I would have to ponder on them for some time before continuing on. I must admit that some of Lewis' ideas were so profound; they went over my head completely (I'm only 17 and have no qualms about admitting that I still have much more to learn, spiritually and intellectually). I hope that with future re-readings of this book (which for me, there most definitely will be!) I will pick up on things I had missed last time and, with hope, have a few more moments of inspired revelation.This is most definitely a classic which should be read by everyone, religious or not. It will open up your mind to many philosophical ideas about the nature of human beings and the psychological way in which we perceive spirituality.For those looking purely for a fictional reading experience, this one may be a little scant on details to satisfy your curiosity.I have no hesitations in recommending this book with a stellar 5/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Oh my, what a book this is. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this book. And yet, at the very least, I now know what caused some evil \\"goings-ons\\" in my own life. Evil that is so invisible and subtle that I hardly knew it was there. It seems like no matter what we humans may try to do, Satan always seems to have a trick up his sleeve to throw us off kilter and drag us down with him. This book will give you a better understanding on how demons and Satan operate. A must read. This book is truly C.S.

God is referenced as \\"the Enemy\\" while Humanity is both despised - out of jealousy - and admired by the demons.There is much to take away from this book. While it is sold under the category of \\"Christian inspiration\\", and rightly so, I argue that this novel is of value to any person regardless of their personal faith and convictions.

Written with brilliant, witty satire, Screwtape reviews diverse methods to entice Christians in times of weakness, fatigue, & immaturity into sin for consumption by the Devil. Lewis demonstrates a distinctive & novel prose & notable clarity in describing moral-ethical issues Christians of diverse age groups face in love, wealth, poverty, friendships, gluttony, cowardice, sameness & idle minds. It is not a book to be glossed over, but requires some patience for digestion of remarkable prose with much to learn about bending of minds & seeing motives in common & uncommon people."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis literally wrote a Christian masterpiece with \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". The format is beguilingly simple, and the letters as written by Screwtape, a senior devil, to Wormwood, his junior associate, are tremendously entertaining without even considering the theology. If this were just an exercise in \\"thinking like a devil\\" then Lewis pulled that off well enough to entertain a reader of any religious faith. But the book is so much more.The thing that amazed me most was the timelessness of it. While the \\"patient\\" (the mortal being tempted) is assailed by events, the events are such universals of the human condition that it is easy to see oneself on almost ever page. Whether it is concern about \\"the war\\", what \\"educated\\" and \\"modern\\" friends might think about the patient's faith, or the desire of the patient to look around for a church he likes better than his current one, they could just as easily have been written yesterday.The book is so entertaining that it might be tempting to rush through it. I would recommend against this. Literally every page has something to say, something worth thinking about. Take your time, be both entertained and provoked to think. You will not regret this."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I suppose this is considered a novel. It's short but masterfully written. I read it several months ago and I will never forget it. The entire piece is a series of letters written by a senior devil to a junior devil and it proved as frightening as it sounded. C.S. Lewis paints a vivid and realistic picture of tempation and the daily fight every Christian faces with sin. It is absolutely stunning and I cried *joyfully* at the end.

It takes you to a journey inside a demon's mind to discover how he might work, think, deceive, and plan his 'catch'...all this making you smile, cry, learn, have fun, and learn again. It will open your eyes to the ways darkness might be targeting you by presenting the ideas in a very entertaining and yet very deep approach.

Lewis notes that this book was not fun to write. I would argue that it is not fun to read, either. You are likely rechecking how many stars I rated this book, and yes, I meant to give it 5. I regard it highly because this book forces us to see how in even this simplest of things we can be neglecting God. While it is not enjoyable to hear about how even the simplest things one does can hurt others, or play into the hands of evil, it is highly valuable. Don't expect to smile as you read this book, but expect to learn more about yourself."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Although C.S. Lewis published &#65533;The Screwtape Letters&#65533; in 1942, its theme is every bit as appropriate today. A collection of correspondence from a veteran devil to an apprentice demon, the learned counsel for debasing virtue is all too commonplace in practice today.The corruption of language has been articulated by many social critics over the past decade to so, but Mr. Lewis referenced this nascent technique sixty years ago. The experienced devil, Screwtape, seems to be embracing modern day parlance when he brags about the word &#65533;Puritanism&#65533; taking on its pejorative status. &#65533;The value we have given to that word is one of the really solid triumphs of the last hundred years; by it we rescue annually thousands of humans from temperance, chastity and sobriety.&#65533;Today we often hear the cant that one religion is as good as another, and saying a certain religion is true will elicit terms like discrimatory or judgmental. While most churches advocate truth and righteousness, a lack of loyalty to one is not a positive development and Screwtape was knew this to be true. He waxed, &#65533;if a man can&#65533;t be cured of church, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighborhood looking for a church that suits him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.&#65533; He was especially fond of churches that change to meet current demand and praised a church where &#65533;the vicar is a man who has so long engaged in watering down the faith to make it easier for a supposedly incredulous and hard-headed congregation that it is now he who shocks his parishioners with his unbelief.&#65533;Often Mr. Lewis's healthy sense of humor is artfully displayed. An exasperated Screwtape writes desparigingly that one mortal is &#65533;not only a Christian such a Christian--a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouselike, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss. The little brute, she makes me vomit.&#65533;Throughout the fantasy, a bounty of real advice is present. Simple tidbits such as Screwtape&#65533;s simple statement that &#65533;the safest road to hell is the gradual one&#65533; should serve as a tocsin for many readers. With wit, ingenuity, reverence, and jocularity, C.S. Lewis created a timeless classic to exhort the ages."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"In the original preface, Lewis says \\"There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.\\"Lewis had what I consider, a very biblically orthodox and, if I may say, HEALTHY conception of \\"devils\\". For him, the devil was NOT an equal power opposite to God, or in any way self-existent from all eternity. The devil was, and is, a created being... originally good, but fallen. An angel, who by the abuse of free will became an enemy to God, and as a corollary, to us. As such, he is the opposite not of God but of Michael (the Archangel).Anyhoo... in the summer of 1940 Lewis set out to write this book which \\"would consist of letters from an elderly retired devil who had just started work on his first 'patient'. The idea would be to give all the psychology of temptation from the other point of view.\\"The result is this collection of thirty-one intercepted letters between the senior devil (Screwtape) and his nephew Wormwood who has been assigned the damnation of one man's soul.It is brilliant.Here we see how the everyday life of the 'patient' looks from the viewpoint of Hell... how the many daily temptations are designed to chip away at the very foundation of who he is... to lead him not toward Heaven, but away from it. What is notable is the subtle nature of the temptations... ie., to be picky about what you eat, to hop from church to church, to argue, etc., rather than (for instance) to go out and shoot your neighbor. All is \\"good\\" in Screwtape's world as long as it leads ever so gradually downwards! Throughout the course of the letters, the state of this particular patient's soul undulates as he experiences a conversion, doubt, dangerous friendships, war, love, and finally, in death, oneness with God.The theology latent in this work of fiction is undeniably Christian. Those readers with even the slightest Christian sensiblilties will be further convinced that there are unseen forces presently at work in all of us, whose goal is to sap life in the here AND after! For other readers, as Anthony Burgess once said, \\"Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way.\\"And, oh yes, \\"Readers are advised to remember that the devil is a liar. Not everything that Screwtape says should be assumed to be true even from his own angle.\\"Remember whose mail we're reading after all!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"With this book C.S. Lewis gives his version of what hell, demons, temptation, life, humans, God, look like from a demon's perspective. This book really shifts the paradigm of why things happen, to more, who or what causes these things to happen. The author does a masterful job of looking at human's and how they struggle through life, conversion experiences, change, success, failure and a wide range of human emotions.The thing that sets the Screwtape letters apart is the format of how Lewis accomplishes his task. He sets this book up as a series of letters from an mentor to a mentee, and it is all focused around one human who the mentee is trying to tempt and lead down the wrong path. The mentor does his best to show the mentee how humans can be tripped up.This book is good for a wide audience, from skeptics to believers, from Christians to Hindus. It looks at the human spirit, and how God created us to function, and how we can easily screw it up. I highly recommend this work if you want an intellectual challenge and a clever read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I simply love this book and it makes one think.Written as a series of letters from a senior devil to a junior tempter, this delightful book presents Hell like it was populated by cubicle-dwellers. Hell as a bureaucracy where if one does not do one's job, they are eaten by their boss.Lewis' insights into temptation and sin are priceless and thought provoking. Who would have thought that dying young was a blessing and that living to old age a curse in that it leads to a whole host of new sins? Or that the devil would encourage one to hang around with Christians so long as they are the \\"proper sort.\\"I have read this book multiple times and come away with a greater insight each time into my own actions and temptations. Not only that, I am thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Narrator of this Screwtape Letters audio version MAKES the book fantastic. Ralph Cosham brings to life Screwtape, with his beautiful deep English accent.Screwtape Letters is a book of letters written to an underling devil who is at first trying to keep his 'patient' from converting to Christianity. When he fails and the patient converts, Screwtape is very displeased.The letters then take on a new tactic whereby since the patient is a Christian, the attempt becomes one of trying to keep from making the Christian life real and deep spiritually.Obviously the point it to make the reader Christian aware of the devious methods that satan uses to draw the Christian from Christ.Cosham's reading is stellar."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is a must read for anyone who seriously wants to led a better life. The humor makes this a page turner, but the message makes this a book worth reading repeatedly. I often think about the \\"all I want is...\\" when I catch myself complaining about something going wrong.This is a great gift for believers or non-believers. This and another book of his \\"The Great Divorce\\" are the two books that I read the most often."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"When one first sits down to read Screwtape Letters, they will usually be baffled. You are sent straight into the middle of the story, as it seems. Young Wormwood, a junior tempter, has been assigned to his first patient. Patients are humans who have tempters inside their brains, so everyone is a patient of someone. Wormwood's job is to tempt people away from god. There is supposedly a tempter in everyone's brain, undetectable, who offers up suggestions and advice on actions the person is about to commit. All suggestions and advice are made so the patient will turn away from God, and all that is good, and toward Satan, and all that is bad. This is the basic premise of the story, yet it is much deeper. It delves into ones intellect and shows them ways that Satan catches us and tempts us.Wormwood is the Nephew of an honored tempter, Screwtape. His Uncle Screwtape writes him letters on how to lead his patient away from God and toward sin, hence Screwtape Letters. He gives Wormwood ways to show his patient other ways of doing actions that could have bad consequences, though the tempter tries to block the thought of the consequences away from his patients thoughts. Screwtape answers Wormwoods questions about different scenarios and scolds him when he doesn't follow directions properly and lets the patient go toward The Enemy, or God.In turn, this novel shows the reader how Satan is catching them and tempting one toward one of the seven deadly sins: anger, lust, gluttony, ect. After reading only a few chapters, one will soon come to realize their faults, which is why this book is so great. Screwtape Letters points out you wrong doings and tells of how Satan exploits them to his wishes. There really isn't a plot to this book, just a collection of letters and an underlying plot to make the understandable. It really doesn't require a huge plot though its so good. The theme Good vs. Evil is so strong it takes the plots place.One will find this book quite enjoyable and truthful about human ways. Though in the end Wormwood does lose the patient to God, not saying how, it shows that you can fight temptation if you put your mind to it.This novel deserves an 11 out of 10 and the Newberry Award in all categories, no matter if it even falls into them. This book is that good and everyone should read it. It will minimally change your life at least and help you recognize your own faults."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This wonderfully witty work of CS Lewis brings to light many weaknesses of the human race, and especially those pertaining to Christians. In a masterful style of satire, the book consists of a series of \\"letters\\" written from a high-ranking devil to a low-ranking one. The latter, Wormwood, has just received his first \\"patient,\\" a young man, and Screwtape, his uncle, corresponds with him, giving advice and pointers as to how Wormwood can effectively conquer this man's soul.The genius in this book lies in the advice Screwtape provides. Rather than counsel Wormwood to tempt this man into large sins which would instantly destroy his soul, Screwtape takes a subtler approach. Letter after letter outlines ways in which Wormwood can turn the man's triumphs into tragedies, progress into hindrance, and virtues into vices. Instead of trying to tempt the man into quitting church, for example, he advises persuading him to visit a number of churches, thus insuring that he will become a 'comparer' of churches rather than a follower of one specific doctrine.The obvious message of this book is a warning against the old \\"frog in hot water\\" idea. If you throw him in hot water, he will jump out, but put him in cold water and gradually increase the heat, and you will soon have a cooked frog. Lewis's message, masterfully presented and so clearly thought out (as is typical of him), is that Christians need to stop looking beyond the small things, to see the error in so many of their seemingly insignificant actions. Perhaps the beauty of this book is that it shows just how easy it is to lose one's soul.CS Lewis was a master of Christian thinking. This book is a product of his genius, a masterpiece full of invaluable advice."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"There are piles of books on conversations between man and God. I even recall one aimed at Junior Highers that was structured around e-mails from Heaven. All of the books contain encouragments for work, life and love. 'The Screwtape Letters' also contains much encouragment and advice, but of a much differant kind. Screwtape is an old, wise demon who's spent many years tempting, distracting and leading humans astray. Wormwood, a much younger demon, and Screwtape's nephew, has a 'patient' that is causing him trouble. The tone of the book is what struck me first. It isn't really devious or noir at all, it's very matter-of-fact and quite often bright, almost cheery. You get more of a picture of a slightly withered old man writing to his nephew by fire light with a quill and ink rather than the more expected gargoyle scrolling gothic letters with a claw dipped in human blood. The book's purpose is to bring the ways of demons to light, and the tone helps a lot. Though it may seem like the light, friendly tone would deminish the serious subject, it does not, rather it illuminates the most base element of deception: trust. This friendly speech of familial love is disarming and shows how Screwtape was so successful. Most Christians can see the truths of what is said, we've all experienced this kind of temptation, those who \\"haven't\\" are in denial. Something that not a lot of writers when speaking of Hell and demons really plays on is the relationship between Heaven and Hell. The relationship couldn't be more plain here, or more truthful. In the introduction, Lewis sights that the Devil is the father of lies. And reading the book you come to the obviousness of the truth about him: How can he lie if doesn't know the truth?The greatest value of this book is not empathy. It is not a book designed to exhort you by saying 'everyone goes through this'. It is a guide, a warning, a class on the tactics of demons in order to prevent their working. If Demons are the terrorists of the soul, then think of 'The Screwtape Letters' as a sort of Spiritual SWAT class."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"If you didn't have the benefit of taking a general theology class in college or you want to grow in your faith, read and discuss this book with a few friends. Lewis's elder demon Screwtape can teach us a lot about ourselves, about God, and about contemporary culture. Lewis writes in an easy-to-read, quotable style which is sure to challenge our modern thinking.In one sense, it's a primer on how to sin. The book is full of \\"advice\\" on how turn a good thing into a sinful one. I remember my wife being challenged by the discussion of gluttony. According to Screwtape, it works both ways, by eating too much or too little, because the key is flattering your pride. All sin stems from our natural, self-honoring pride, and Screwtape gives many examples of how to insert that pride into everything we do.Of course, it isn't as if you are reading letters from the devil himself, every word corrupting your spirit. This book praises God's grace in a Christian's life (in a back-handed sort of way). And it's funny. I love it when Screwtape gets so mad he morphs into a worm, and his secretary has to finish the letter. I also love his description of the coup Lucifer led against God Almighty before he and the angels who supported him were kicked out of heaven (becoming the demons they are now).It's a great, little work of fiction, loaded with applicable truth."},{"Title":"U-boats in Camera 1939-1945","review":"Basically, a great addition to other u-boat books. Like Hitler's U-boat War (two volume set). I recieved this books as a gift. It great if you read other books about u-boats. Any war junky would love the book. You won't be sorry. Lots of nice pictures. Some I've never seen before (go figure). Not a stand alone book.I would buy it with Hitler U-Boat War by Blair Clay (2 books).Great addition. Keep in mind. I'm a WW II (and history) junky!"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Angels of Wrath","review":"Larry Bond is an excellent techno-thriller author. Just a couple of weeks ago I gave a five-star review to his \\"Dangerous Ground,\\" one of the best stories of submariners I've read in years. Perhaps that's why the disappointment I feel about \\"Angels Of Wrath: Rirst Team\\" is so sharp. The book just isn't Larry Bond. (It is co-authored by Jim DeFelice.)I dub this a Lego novel. It's like the authors wrote out a bunch of action scenes on notecards and than simply laid out a grid, like building something with Lego blocks. The result is a techno-thriller that's all fluff and no depth.The \\"hero\\" is Bob Ferguson. Hey, let's make Bob a maverick in the CIA, someone who has major difficulties in taking orders and playing well with others, particularly his superiors. Now let's make him a \\"team leader\\" of the \\"First Team,\\" a multi-departmental group that's supposed to squash threats to the United States. Hmmmmmm, what else can we do for Ferguson. Hey, what a great idea! Let's give him a possibly terminal illness and have him take pills for it once in a while!Of course, Ferguson is ever so sophisticated. A ladies man, of course. A polylinguist. A oenophile and connoisseur of single-malt scotches. Is that enough? Not by a long shot. Ferguson's father was a legend in the CIA and Ferguson, the son, seems to have some psychological problems with that. But not to worry: every bad guy in the world seems to be frightened of Ferguson, who by the way, is also a master of disguise.In sum, Bob Ferguson is a total caricature, not even as believable as a comic book hero.Take this joke of a character and put him into a circus that is supposed to be a plot. First we have the extremist religious cult that is trying to foment a major terrorist attack in the Middle East in order to trigger the Apocalypse. The FBI thinks it has arrested everyone after one of the cultists is blown up in Egypt. Oh my gosh, they missed his sister who has been a sleeper for decades. Off she goes to the Middle East to find an arms dealer who will sell her the weapons necessary to trigger the end of the world. Believable? No.Arms dealers. The book is loaded with them. They all fear Bob Ferguson who has been dispatched first to find the cultists and then track down an Iraqi terrorist. Corrine Alston, a 26 year old special counsel to the President with no background in intelligence or covert operations is told by the President to \\"supervise\\" the operation. Of course, Ferguson wants nothing to do with his boss, who is running her own operations (yes, plural) in the Middle East. All of the arms dealers drink champage. All the time. So does Ferguson. Just can't be a tough guy without a flute of champagne in your hand.There are backstories aplenty. Too many. And there's action: every two or three pages another corpse or two or ten is thrown on the pile. The action rarely has anything to do with anything except filling pages.And then there is the rogue Mossad agent, an alcoholic, still grieving over the murder of his Muslim wife at the hands of terrorists. Oh yes, he has plans too.In sum, this is a sharp departure from Larry Bond's normal excellence. Every page is painful to read. The characters have no credibility. The plot is simply a mishmash of pointless action scenes. Compare this with most of Bond's earlier work and you have to ask if something horrible has happened to Mr. Bond.Whether it's the co-author or falling victim to fame and greed, I hope Larry Bond will put this part of his life behind him and get back to writing some of the best techno-thrillers of the day. This certainly is not one of them.Jerry"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Angels of Wrath","review":"I have been a big fan of Bond's for years. However, when good authors take on \\"co writers\\" I get the idea the co writer does the books. I have seen this with several other Authors. This doesn't even seem like a Larry Bond book.

The paintings he left us show us the simplicity and sensuality of his times and their brilliant colors and joyous images express the passion of Renoir's own soul.The paradise of color and the changing effects of light were Renoir's greatest gift to the world. This book, Renoir: The Crown Art Library, showcases some of the artist's most beloved works and gives a brief overview of his life.A quick glance at this book tells you that Renoir's favorite subject was always people. In fact, it is possible to select an entire series of masterpieces from Renoir's works without including even one landscape--something that would be impossible with any of the other Impressionists.The people created by Renoir are always filled with the warm joy of simply being alive. Of the many illustrations in this book, most are in color, allowing us to both study and participate in the &quot;joie de vivre&quot; that Renoir, more than any other artist, communicated to the world.There is a short analysis of the evolution of Renoir's technique and we learn why he abandoned the dark, sombre colors of the Old Masters and turned to the brilliant reds, blues, yellows and greens of which he was so fond.We learn how and why the feminine form became a stronger and stronger element in his paintings, especially those of his later years, and we see how, in the last ten years of his life, he limited his palette to only a few colors--cinnabar, ochre, Naples yellow, black and some white, yet managed to create playful visions of a sun-bright world, seemingly devoid of weight; paintings in which contours of people and surroundings are blurred and all is joined in a concord of color and naturalness.Renoir: The Crown Art Library is a wonderful introduction to the life and style of this master Impressionist, the world's most joyous painter. Those looking for a biography of Renoir would be better off choosing Renoir, My Father, by Jean Renoir, the artist's middle son. In-depth analyses of Impressionism and Renoir's own technique in particular, are also better covered in other books such as Rewald's History of Impressionism.But for the vast majority of people, laymen who only want to increase their knowledge and appreciation of the world's greatest artists, Renoir: The Crown Art Library offers a wonderful starting point. With is lavish illustrations and lively text, it will broaden the scope of anyone's understanding. The book is a joy to browse and once insight is gained into the how and why of each painting, that joy is only increased.While certainly far from exhaustive, Renoir: The Crown Art Library, is a lovely book and anyone with even a passing interest in Renoir and Impressionism will find it well worth their while."},{"Title":"Renoir","review":"If you are looking for the book for Renoir, this is it. Large, slipcased filled with over 200 color plates (no black and white at all) this is currently the best book I have seen on the market for an overall glimpse of Renoir's work. He painted thousands of canvases, so this is a wonderful distillation of his career. Some of the old favorites are here, some are blown up to cover 2 pages.Most are at least full page size and cover the gamut of his career.If you need a general book that has excellent reproductions that are clear and a good sampling of his work, this book is very impressive. Some may be bothered by pictures that are split over 2 pages, but they are aligned so well, that all of the painting is visible and you don't need to break the back of the book to see it all. The majority are just on one page, taking up most of the space and very high resolution. Only 3 or 4 of the 200 + paintings are a little on the yellowish side, sadly enough the famous blue umbrella painting seems to be one of them. However, the vast majority are near perfect and the text is well researched."},{"Title":"Renoir","review":"This is a large and magnificent book. It contains a scholary text and an abundance of large beautiful color plates. The book is a truly a pleasure to browse, but also serves as the best serious one-volume monograph on Renoir found on the market today. It is a certainly a lifetime keeper and is protected by a sturdy, illustrated slipcase. Typical of the kind of books published by Abbeville Press, it is worth its full price, let alone the \\"steal price\\" on Amazon."},{"Title":"Renoir","review":"This book was very informative, of both Renoir's life as well as his art. I enjoyed reading it thoroughly and would recommend it to any art lovers."},{"Title":"Girls at War, and Other Stories","review":"This is an impressive collection of short stories that covers a twenty-year period of Achebe's writing. They also cover a period of history in his native Nigeria that spans from the late colonial period to the Biafran war. In them Achebe explores various aspects of a predominant theme in his work, i.e. tradition vs. modernism in his country (as introduced by British colonial administration). The various stories offer glimpses into the lives of people from various classes and walks of life. Achebe has a concise and eloquent writing style; he has an almost singular talent for making very pertinent observations in an extremely pithy fashion. Thus, for example, in the few pages of a story like \\"Dead Man's Path,\\" Achebe brings to life the problems which ensue from the drive for quick modernization, the desire to adhere to tradition and the hypocrisy of Nigeria's colonial administrators. Also impressive is Achebe's mastery of narrative styles, i.e. first person, omiscient, etc. These stories can be read on their own, or as a supplement to Achebe's similarly powerful novels."},{"Title":"Girls at War, and Other Stories","review":"Did you know that free schooling was only briefly offered in Nigeria? There's a poignant story about it here.I learned a lot about Nigeria from these stories. Sometimes, the stories seemed to end a little too abruptly, but I guess that's part of the story format: it has to end sooner than a short novel, anyway.Mr. Achebe is a fine storyteller and he has many interesting things to say about the people and customs of Nigeria. I recommend this book, but only after first reading his classic novel about 19th century Ibo tribe people, Things Fall Apart.After reading these stories, I was both attracted to Nigeria and repelled by it (I've never been to Africa). Achebe does a good job of capturing the ambivalence aroused by Nigeria's exotic nature (to Americans) mixed with its societal dysfunctions.Diximus."},{"Title":"Girls at War, and Other Stories","review":"Very impressed. I am glad I read it again after all these years. The story of the Mad Man is very funny. I was cracking up while reading it."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"Although my daughter and I love Madeline, this particular book was disturbing. Miss Clavel buys Pepito some tools to give him \\"an outlet for his energy\\" and he builds a guillotine to decapitate chickens! He turns a cat loose in the midst of a pack of dogs and is then attacked by the dogs, resulting in a visit from the doctor. In the end, of course, Pepito changes his ways. But it in no way compensated for the fact that the majority of the story was, at best, dark. I don't tend to be faint of heart when it comes to literature, but this was not appropriate for my 4-year-old."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"The third book in the \\"Madeline\\" series, this focusses on the wild behavior of Pepito, a troublemaking boy who is meant to be a foil for the mischievous Madeline. The behavior shown is pretty excessive, though: Bemelmans shows the boy tying a cat up in a pillowcase and releasing it into a pack of dogs, which strikes me a way too violent. Certainly not appropriate for smaller (toddler) readers. Even if you liked the other Madeline books, you might want to think twice before picking this one up. It's a little scary."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"While I've generally enjoyed the Madeline series, this story was uncharacteristically and excessively harsh. What adult wants to have to explain a guillotine to a 4-year old child?"},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"The original Madeline is charming, well written, fun for kids of any age. The Bad Hat is none of those things.Other reviewers have commented on the negativity and preschool-unfriendly content, like decapitation. I'm actually not a parent who tries to shelter my 3- and 5-year old from too many things, but even I have to agree there's nothing to recommend this for younger kids.That's not the reason for my 1-star review though; for older kids the content wouldn't be an issue. I just find the poetry to be yucky to read. It doesn't scan, and the rhymes aren't particularly good. Perhaps I'm spoiled by Dr. Seuss, or even by the first Madeline book; but I prefer good poetry to bad, and imho this is just bad."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"This is my least favorite of the Madeline series actually written by the original author. While full of fun rhymes, the book doesn't particularly hang together - plot sacrificed to rhyme. Did i really want to explain a guillotine to a 4-year-old?"},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"Pepito, the boy in this book has a change of heart and goes from being unkind to animals to caring for them. It is a good story. As far as it being &quot;dark&quot; as another reviewer said,well,does that reader eat chickens? That's what Pepito was doing before he learned a new way to live with the animals he came to love."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"My daughter and I really loved this book! The rhythm of this Madeline book is especially good. It highlights Madeline's courageous, assertive personality as well as her compassionate intuition!

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"\\"In an old house in Paris that was covered in vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines.\\" In 1939, Ludwig Bemelmans began writing stories about a group of girls in a school in Paris, foremost among whom was the irrepressible Madeline. Those books are now considered classics in children's literature, having collected many awards.In this Madeline adventure, when the Spanish Ambassador moves in next door, Madeline quickly realizes that his son is definitely a \\"bad hat.\\" The young man, named Pepito, loves playing tricks - the nastier, the better. But, when a particularly nasty trick backfires on him, Pepito learns a very hard lesson!This is another great Madeline story. I liked the gentle rhyming of the story, and my little reader liked Pepito's adventures and misadventures. So, let's just say that this book is a classic of children's literature for a reason! My little one and I both highly recommend this great book."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"The other books are good, but this one is truly entertaining. In the hands of most authors, a character like Pepito would be a failure. He skates and bikes dangerously, captures animals, builds a guillotine to help his chef with the chickens, tries to feed a cat to hungry dogs, and in an act of redemption, releases half a zoo from their cages. But this author pulls it off delightfully. It's not even remotely disturbing, because it's all so ridiculous, and is, in any case, wound up quite neatly. Pepito is a terrific foil to the twelve little girls, and story is tight and witty."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"I'm surprised this book isn't better known, given the popularity of the original Madeline book. The message of the story was ahead of its time. My family enjoyed this book much more than \\"Madeline's Rescue\\"."},{"Title":"Madeline and the bad hat","review":"The only other Madeline book that I had read besides \\"Madeline\\" was \\"Madeline's Rescue,\\" although I knew there were other books out there about Ludwig Bemelmans' precocious young girl who lived in an old house in Paris that was covered with vines. So reading \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\" was a new experience. Still, I have no explanation for why I did not recognize the idiom of \\"a bad hat\\" as a colloquialism for an unscrupulous person, even though I feel like I should.In \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat,\\" the Spanish Ambassador moves into the house next door to where Miss Clavel and the twelve little girls in two straight lines live. Miss Clavel is excited to see that His Excellency has a boy, but Madeline knows as soon as she sees him that this little boy is a Bad Hat and his actions prove her right. We know that boys will be boys, but apparently that means being mean, at least for Pepito (which we eventually discover is the young boy's name). Miss Clavel finally decides that the boy needs an outlet for his energy, and so she gets him a chest of tools, thinking that \\"might be attractive, For a little boy that's very active.\\" But Pepito reduces Madeline and the other little girls to tears by building himself a guillotine and while we do not actually see it in action the device is clearly used to cut the heads off of the chickens the cook is preparing for dinner.Pepito clearly deserves a comeuppance and what is surprising is not that he gets one, but that it is rather painful. One day while Miss Clavel and the twelve little girls are out for a walk, they spot Pepito carrying a bulging sack. They follow him and discover that all of the dogs in the neighborhood are following him as well, because of what is in the sack. Now, the key educational part of this book, besides the illustrations showing interesting parts of Paris, is that we learn that you have to cry \\"AU SECOURS\\" if by any chance you are ever in need of help in France. That means that once again Miss Clavel has to run fast and faster.What happens is a transforming event, turning the former Barbarian into a Vegetarian. Bemelmans turns everything around so that young readers can clearly see the differences in Pepito before and after. There are three times as many full color illustrations in this 1956 story as there was in the original \\"Madeline,\\" mainly because Bemelmans uses the artwork to depict scenes other than the characters out and about in Paris. I wish I could figure out the logic to why some art is mostly yellow and others are full color, but so far nothing makes sense. As always, the childlike illustrations are so captivating because Bemelmans' art always seems like advanced scribbling. My only complaint is that Madeline takes a back seat to Pepito in this story. She comments on his behavior, but does not actively participate in his reformation. But we have to wait for her next outing, \\"Madeline's Rescue,\\" to be back on more appropriate ground."},{"Title":"Fun in a Chinese laundry","review":"In this magisterial autobiography, Josef von Sternberg reflects about his personal career, film and its history and art.Von Sternberg will always be remembered for one of the most impressive movies of all times 'Der blaue Engel', but his career covers the sound and silent movie period.It is a very revealing book, not about his personal life, but about his professional viewpoints and struggles.His actor's direction was based on a penetrating insight into the real human nature. First, he considered that 'the guinea pig of the artist is his own self' and secondly, that 'the average human being lives behind an impenetrable veil and will disclose his deep emotions only in a crisis which robs him of control'.His professional life was an enduring fight with(1) the film studios and its producers. He knew their blatant commercialism: 'If a snail were to offer a contribution of value to Hollywood, it would be located instantly'.(2) his actors (an E. Jannings or a C. Laughton behaved like bad children on the set. A notable exception was his miraculous actress Marlene Dietrich.)(3) his rivals within the director's guild.and ultimately when the movie was produced (4) the moral establishment and its servile movie critics.Von Sternberg understood the profound impact of the film medium, which revealed 'the real world where wealth and poverty live side by side, and where cruelty and indifference can no longer be ignored.' The medium has an amoral basis: 'the strongest appeal to the masses was the simplest one: the formula always revolves around sex and its biological associate, violence. ... One bond that links all audiences is the animal in man.'He also gives us a penetrating portrait of some of the greatest masters of cinema: D.W. Griffith ('remove these 10000 horses a trifle to the right'), C. Chaplin ('the comic side of humiliation') or E. von Stroheim ('the intensity of his actor's direction').His ultimate goal was to create 'art', for 'it is easier to kill than to create.'The overall picture shows us von Sternberg as a noble, passionate, honest, craftful and extremely intelligent movie director.This autobiography is part thriller, part melo, part drama, part psychoanalysis.It is an essential read, not only for the film historian."},{"Title":"Fun in a Chinese laundry","review":"Jo Sternberg received his first screen credit in 1923, as an assistant director. The film's producer streched Jo's name by adding the --sef von-- to it, saying the longer title sounded regal. Sternberg hated the idea, until criticism came in from everywhere that \\"the Huns are taking over Hollywood.\\" Because of this backlash, Jo defiantly chose to keep his new moniker. This vignette speaks volumes about Mr. Sternberg.As a director, he was widely hated by dozens of actors, writers and producers. In FUN IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY, Sternberg deflects and denies every charge, yet could all those accusations be false? Jo admits that he routinely criticized actors for not following his instructions precisely, and never gave praise when they performed well. To him, blandishments would have been like \\"praising them for breathing.\\" The man has nothing good to say about actors and their craft, and he takes up two entire chapters doing so. Special \\"attention\\" is lavished on the despised Emil Jannings (a \\"manipulator\\") and Charles Laughton (\\"masochistic\\" and \\"a daymare\\").Sternberg is an excellent storyteller, particularly about the many exotic locales he'd visited. His memories of individual movies reveal a colossal ego-- every minor actor he came in contact with was immediately launched to stardom, so he claims. The director is everything; the cast and story secondary. His cinematic flops were someone else's fault-- in his own mind, Jo could do no wrong.And yet for all the rant and egocentrism, FUN IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY is a fascinating read. Simply take Jo's occasional forays into excessive metaphoric semi-colonisms with a grain of aspirin, and wait for the good parts. You'll be more than amply rewarded.Josef von Sternberg was annoyed that people constantly confused him with his directorial contemporary,STROHEIM."},{"Title":"Fun in a Chinese laundry","review":"Full of cynical, razor-sharp and often very funny opinions. It's so one-sided, however, that I came away very curious to read what Dietrich herself thought about their relationship-- preferably in her own words.Sternberg was definitely quite a character, and his autobiography is vastly entertaining."},{"Title":"Fun in a Chinese laundry","review":"Of great interest if you're a fan of von Sternberg's films and possibly even if you're not. He was so well-suited to autobiography: opinionated, amusing, and clear-eyed and unstinting in cataloging the ways in which lesser beings had wronged him. If you are familiar with his films there's a lot here to deepen your appreciation. For example, the fact that his first job after leaving Vienna for New York was in a millinery shop. It's a brief passage in the book and it was a brief passage in his life, but the imagery was clearly an influence on his tendency to crowd his frames with all manner of texture and shadows. You needn't have seen the films, though, to enjoy bits such as: \\"In this period I made some friends. One of them drowned in a lake while on vacation, and another took me to my first restaurant and made me intoxicated for the first and only time in my life, filled my pockets with ice cubes, and paid for some woman to sit next to me and massage my thighs.\\""},{"Title":"Fun in a Chinese laundry","review":"Autobiography (1986)Name changes from Jonas Sternberg (Wien) to Joe Stern (New York) to Josef von Sternberg (Hollywood, 1894-1969) already indicate a pronounced ego and a remarkable career, mostly in tandem with German \\"vamp\\" actress Marlene Dietrich: From the silent hit Underworld (1927), he entered sound with The Blue Angel (1930), and produced in rapid succession Morocco (1930), Dishonored (1931), An American Tragedy (1931), Shanghai Express (1932), Blonde Venus (1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934), The Devil is a Woman (1935), and more.

I spent quite a bit of time trying to adjust my posture and walk \\"the right way.\\" Finally, I decided that, like many things in life, there is no one \\"right way\\" for everyone.People's bodies come in all shapes and sizes and we should walk in a manner that is natural for our physiques. Short and stock people walk diferently than tall, narrow people. Men walk differently than women. If you have a belly (that you're trying to walk off), you are going to walk differently than a person who is already thin. Make sense?Let's face it, walking isn't a huge mystery that the author claims it to be! Um...you just put one foot in front of the other!

The reason the doctors were willing to perform the risky surgery at all was because he was in otherwise outstanding health, primarily due to his daily two mile walks. He not only had a full recovery, but continued his routine until shortly before his death at age 98. That says a lot about the power of walking for fitness, especially for those who are unwilling or unable to run. Having said that, however, I couldn't imagine that you'd need to know much more about walking than whatever is required to motivate you do to it in the first place. Apparently I was wrong...In this surprisingly engaging tome you will learn about intelligent walking, ways to move more efficiently and healthfully as you walk for pleasure or exercise. The authors describe a five step process: getting aligned, engaging your core, creating balance, making a choice (e.g., cardio walking, energy walking, and meditation walking), and moving forward. Contents include body alignment, balance, focus, body sensing, flexibility, breathing, and other important aspects of a healthy exercise routine. There is also some good information that compares and contrasts on- vs. off-road walking (or hiking) as well as treadmill routines. There are also short sections on nutrition, choosing proper footwear, and other peripherals too. It feels like the authors were stretching to find new things to say that were not repeats of their previous book Chi Running in many places, yet it was surprisingly good nevertheless.Chi Running was a great book, one I've found personally quite useful, but I had very low expectations for this one. I was pleasantly surprised. It really is a pretty darn good tome, particularly if you have not read the first one.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Blinded by the Night, among other titles"},{"Title":"ChiWalking: Fitness Walking for Lifelong Health and Energy","review":"****\\"ChiWalking: The Five Mindful Steps for Lifelong Health and Energy\\" is a life-changing book for a walker. ChiWalking is essentially a way of using the body's energy system to maximize your walking experience. This encompasses a variety of things, from the form or posture you use when walking, to how you move, to what you think of or meditate on or focus on, and much more.Before I started ChiWalking, I had a lot of pain in my left hip. Since learning the ChiWalking technique, I have no more hip pain.However, I availed myself of much more than just the ChiWalking book. I started with the book, and thus understood what I needed to do and why. I am not very good at translating something from a book to action, so I wasn't able to duplicate the movements on my own from just the book alone. I would not blame this on the book, however, because the book is very clear, and would be really beneficial for those readers who can pick up mechanical movements from illustrations and exposition. I then purchased the ChiWalking DVD, which helped a lot. I saw people practicing what I had read about in the book. Still, I could not translate that into action, mainly because of my learning limitations. However, it excited me and motivated me to take a ChiWalking seminar in a nearby large city. In the seminar I received feedback as to what I was doing wrong. This was what was most helpful to me. Without the book, however, I would not have had the background to fully implement the instruction I received or to really incorporate it into my walking practice.The ChiWalking book thoroughly explains theory and practice behind ChiWalking. It is where you should start to find out if ChiWalking can help you to be a better walker. It explains all steps, skills, technique, how to design a personal program, variations such as hiking, off-road walking, and treadmill walking, plus various specially designed walks to develop your \\"chi\\" or overall energy.If you love to walk, you should own this book. If you want to walk, but have had problems doing so, you should own this book. Even if you just implement the proper form in your walking, you will benefit from reading \\"ChiWalking\\". If you are intrigued at all by the idea of your personal energy system and walking, I would highly recommend this book.****"},{"Title":"ChiWalking: Fitness Walking for Lifelong Health and Energy","review":"I persevered with \\"Chi Walking\\" techniques long after they caused back pain thinking the pain was caused for some other reason or I just needed to polish the techniques.In retrospect, there much misinformation in this book, but I think there are four errors of advice that affected me negatively the most.Firstly, Dryer suggests walking with a \\"pelvic tilt\\" (or retroverted pelvis) that leads to back tension. Secondly, Dryer suggests tilting forward to walk which stresses many muscles and encourages a hard landing on the foot. Thirdly, he suggests not pushing with the toes which fails to use the right muscles for walking. Fourthly, he allows the hands to come forward to the body's center-line which pushes the shoulders too far forward.Gokhale's8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back: Natural Posture Solutions for Pain in the Back, Neck, Shoulder, Hip, Knee, and Foot (Remember When It Didn't Hurt)describes \\"Walking as a series of forward propulsions, not falls\\", which is basically the opposite of \\"Chi Walking\\". Practicing Gokhale's theory and techniques for several weeks has mostly undone the damage and eliminated the pain that \\"Chi Walking\\" caused me.If you try \\"Chi Walking\\" and it hurts, don't persevere because you've probably already mastered the techniques all too well."},{"Title":"ChiWalking: Fitness Walking for Lifelong Health and Energy","review":"The Chi Walking Technique as presented in this book has helped me clear up chronic right hip pain I've had for decades. Knee pain I've had since two goofy falls a couple of years ago, is also starting to diminish. I am walking easier than I've ever experienced in my life! Rather than feeling I'm dragging myself around my walking course, the Chi Walking protocol has taught me how to enlist proper alignment, gravity and body mindfulness to walk more powerfully yet easily. I highly recommend the book, though I think the author could have used a better editor. It is very wordy and overlong. A lot of text could have been cut while still nicely presenting the basics of this powerful body alignment technique."},{"Title":"ChiWalking: Fitness Walking for Lifelong Health and Energy","review":"I have read both the ChiWalking and the ChiRunning books. Not surprisingly, they are very similar and largely duplicate each other. However, before anyone interprets my remarks as criticism, let me state up front that that is not the case. I'm just saying that if you own one version, reading the other will not greatly expand your knowledge.With that off my chest, I loved the ChiWalking book. It is well written and an easy read. Danny's enthusiasm for walking is contagious. The value of this book is that it not only teaches one style of walking, but it goes well beyond that in teaching a lifestyle of exercise, good nuitrition, and living a balanced life. It is the complete package. For those who have not already read ChiRunning, this will be the best $10 that you've ever spent."},{"Title":"ChiWalking: Fitness Walking for Lifelong Health and Energy","review":"While ChiRunning was the first running technique book I'd ever read, ChiWalking is definitely the first walking book I've ever set eyes on. With something that we do almost unconsciously, it's kind of silly to think that we'd need an instructional on how to put one foot in front of the other, right?Well, news is, you should check out this book to learn how to walk injury-free--which is probably an entirely different approach than how you are walking now!Danny's approach will help you understand your walking form, make it fun, and most of all keep you injury free while you're exercising. Let's face it, no everyone can lace up a pair of shoes and do a quick 4 miler. Many people need to walk and if you're doing it right, you'll avoid the most common injuries and nagging hip, knee, and lower back pain.Just the same with ChiRunning, I've told many clients since being introduced to Danny's ideas and ChiWalking to pick up the book, read it front to back, and do every drill in it. Once they have they come back to me thrilled and ready to give in another shot even though their doctor has told them \\"never again.\\"The book will transform your running by allowing you to lighten up on your feet and and use less force to propel you forward. Danny's approach is Eastern and he teaches to let gravity work with you and lean into your walk while you let your legs pick up then swing forward. When you get what he teaches it's almost effortless.This book is for all those who haven't been able to run and a must have for those with knee, hip, and lower back troubles as well.

The covers on my copy, both front and back, curl up like a paper towel roll.

I savoured it for weeks! With every revelation and each reported experience, I was cast further and further adrift on a sea of my own thoughts and memories, recalling with amazing detail my experience of that intense, joyful and sometimes tumultuous time of life referred to as the postpartum.This book was definitely not what I expected! More than conventional stories of mother/infant bonding, Ms. Hallett gives us intimate and thought-provoking glimpses into her own and other women's postpartum experiences, which for many include voyages into exotic imaginal realms, and mysterious, sometimes disturbing altered states of awareness. From the blissful to the surreal, no two experiences described in her book are alike, yet they are connected by a common thread. The message is that even the most difficult of postpartum journeys are transformational opportunities for the psyche which may lead, not only to a deep and more intimate connection between mother and child, but also to greater levels of personal growth and self-awareness, and the birth of enhanced creativity and freedom. My only regret is that _In the Newborn Year_ was not yet published when I began my own journey into motherhood!"},{"Title":"IN THE NEWBORN YEAR","review":"Ms. Hallett has clearly and beautifully addressed the &quot;other side&quot; of postpartum days.

I found it particularly striking that the authors sometimes present mistaken approaches to problems, follow them through to show what has gone wrong, and then show how to avoid the mistakes. This is particularly valuable when using the book for self-study. The exercises are carefully chosen and serve to expand on each section's material."},{"Title":"Selected solutions for discrete algorithmic mathematics","review":"The book does a good job of providing examples, the few that it does provide.

The book gave me an opportunity to sit and listen to 19th century conversations. It has become one of my reference books."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is my first exposure to Twain, and I enjoyed it, but it is a bit of an odd book. The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me.

He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them. Parts of it were slow, but it is a very old book, written in a different style than today's stories, so that is understandable."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I really liked this book very much.

Five stars for creativity, depth, and witty humor.

Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I haven't read much of Twain's works, but this is undoubtly the best Twain book I have ever read (Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, jumping frogs...bleurgrht!). So far this is my most favorite book. It is one of the few books that can actually bring me into a whole new world. A very fun read too!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I am a true fan of the King Arthor legands and of the writings of Mark Twain, but this novel does not meet up to either things. Basically the writing is not as well done as his other stories like Tom Sawyer and it puts down the whole legand of the Round Table. If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story.

His vivid working inspired and kept me on the edge from reading chapter after chapter."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a good book.Read it.IT RULES!(haha just kidding,but it was pretty good.)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read the book, &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.&quot; This is about a middle-aged man from Connecticut in the 19th century. He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

Morgan keeps a diary of the events and happenings of what goes on during his crazy adventure at King Arthur's kingdom. Using 19th century technological advancments, Morgan fools everyone into believing that he is a great magician. After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't.

It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this.

It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager.

It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse. However, the best part is the contrast between the author's confident early youthful years and the much later, postwar years of bittersweet reminiscence and regret for what has passed, never to return. A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard. If you've read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, you'll enjoy this, or even if you haven't, you should try A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review [...]*"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I did not think this was a good book at all. I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery. Besides that, many things in this book are too unrealistic and not well thought out in my opinion."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"My kids love the Arthur and Merlin stories. We have read T. H. White's \\"Sword in the Stone\\" many timesThe Sword in the Stoneas a family.This book pokes the Arthur legends, and pokes them, and turns them over and gives them their due, and then pokes them again. And again. The satire is simply wonderful -- twice as good if you have read Thomas Malory and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.The section on breaking the enchantment on the well, with the sensational German-sounding incantations, was wonderful. The whole book was entirely enjoyable.Little kids won't get this, unless you are willing to read it all together. Better for big kids. But just try to get my copy away from me.Trina Schart Hyman has done several wonderful children's storybooks, and she won a Caldecott award for her \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" Her chapter headings and full-color plates in this book add quite a bit."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else? The ending is not particularly uplifting, which is too bad...I like my books to end on a happy note. On balance, though, it's pretty good entertainment.'"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Three books in one. 1) Mississippi River history and geography, 2) My life as a riverboater, 3) Return to the steamboats, a miscellany.

But this lesser known novel embodies all that is great in Twain's writing. It has the humor, but also represents Twain's great eye for social commentary. I highly recommend it to all fans of Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528).

But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.) This is a classic and it should be familiar to all well-educated individuals."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I home school my daughter and was looking for some works by American authors.

It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I love this book.

There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic.

I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand. Because it was set in the middle ages, the characters used old-fashioned words like &quot;Lo&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; etc. that i could not understand.

The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first.

His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title.

The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010. It did not disappoint. There was all of Twain's wit, great storytelling, and wonderful descriptions of the River that served as a wonderful campanion for our family's trip."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although it seemed a bit strange to me that Mark Twain detoured away from his usual straight works of fiction to something that is obviously based on fantasy, I am from Connecticut, so I embraced this novel with open arms. What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM. Well, I am twelve, and I thought this book was wonderful. This was my first truly \\"grown up\\" book I've read, mostly sticking to my age level before, but I really liked it. If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels. (nothing wrong with those of course, but there is too much of a good thing...)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I would probably scream and faint.Regardless, one makes do with what one has readily available.I found the story thought provoking on many levels. In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River. Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such. It is written in typical Mark Twain style - his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book was at first a huge disappointment. I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought. The Yankee observed some very dark and distrubing facts about people. The book was not the most entertaining book, but the insight to humanity makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility.

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey. Well before the reader finishes \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" they will know why Mark Twain is often spoken of as the \\"Voice of America itself\\" and considered among the very greatest storytellers in all of History. Selecting the \\"Best\\" or the \\"Most Enjoyable\\" of Mark Twain's many, many writings would be a task as hopeless as picking the prettiest photograph ever taken anywhere along the Mississippi River.

It gave interesting ideas and showed the foolishness of the knights in the famed 'Camelot.' I loved it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A &quot;modern&quot; (late 1800s) man named Hank Morgan, after getting into a fight with a subordinate at his factory and being knocked on the head, is mysteriously transported back to Britain, 19 Jun 528 AD, the heyday of Camelot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round. The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period. He is faced with a lot of these incidents like going to war.It takes place in the nine tenth century in Camelot. I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again. Mark Twain is a master story teller. I enjoyed it again,40 years later."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition. A little dissapointed in the amount of time it took to ship."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author, but he makes this a good story anyway. He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his &quot;magic.&quot; Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before. Unfortunately Twain, once again, falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained, but not better off."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is great. Owning a hard copy of my own, I looked into buying it for my Kindle, but was shocked at the sticker price. It is 7.16 here (as of December 26, 2011), but it can be had for free at Project Gutenberg. Which will I choose for my Kindle? No contest!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&iexcl;s Court&iexcl; is a hilarious story written by Mark Twain. The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books. There are also some great pictures included in the book, from portraits of Mark Twain to pictures of King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A fellow from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut finds himself back in early medieval England, specifically in King Arthur's Court. Our protagonist revolutionizes their society be introducing them to the printing press, the bicycle, and socialism, among other things. The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts. It provides insights into changes over a period of 30 years."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a wonderful story with clever twist all the way through it. Hank, the main character, manages to go back in time to the year 513. Hank then goes about the business of trying to modernize a soceity that seem to want to resist any improvement. Although the main objective of the story is Hank's attempt to modernize Britian, he has some pretty wacky adventures along the way. From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature. The book is a joy to read of a distant day when the steamboat was king of the river!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin. It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past. He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place. The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well. It had a twist to the ending."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A fan of Mark Twain and a fond reader of Prince and the Pauper, I recommend this read for children's classics series.

In this book, Hank Morgan wakes to find himself in King Arthur's England. The Yankee uses all his scientific knowledge to be a Chief Minister in the King's Court. He outwits the magician Merlin and gracefully win the kingdom. There are exciting chapters like the Ogre's Castle, The Yankee and the King sold as Slaves, Yankees fight with the knives, in merlin's cave.

In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good.

It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive.

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read.

They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion. The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything. But the world my never know."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small. The story is just as classic as always, and to it I give a galaxy of stars. However, to the knuckleheads at Bantam, I have only condemnation. The print is as small as I have ever seen. My thirty-something eyes are still strong, and are aided by glasses, but I find that after a half an hour, I must put the book down. Spend a little more money, and do yourself a favor, and buy a different version of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot. The book made me think, what would the world be like if some one actually did go back in time?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain brings up a lot of interesting points which, although not new, may seem so because of the manner and voice he uses to bring them up. Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency... And, hey, you've gotta love Hello-Central!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier. Twain tells the story first-hand and with his unique combination of wit and descriptive narrative. This is truly an American literary classic and a must-read for anyone interested in 19th century America."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book came very quickly and in perfect condition.

And doesn't a pilot stand at the wheel and gently guides his craft down and back. Ha. Twain's description of the Mississippi River is a voluptuous exploration of his lifetime love, and of American history as well, and the complexity of it is astounding. There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him. There are scores of scenes like this that make you bust out laughing, and scores more where you choke up at the majesty and tragedy of it all. Magnificent book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The story is classic.

I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us? Twain implies not, but I don't know if I'd agree or if I'd attach a greater failing to the man than the idea.(less)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

Most of the rest is just pure fun to read. Some of it, laugh-out-loud fun to read. And it comes down not so much to the stories themselves but how Twain tells them with such great wit and perfect turn of phrase.

As it says in the introduction, this is a great 'hodgepodge' of a book,being statistical journelese one moment,then pure Twain the next,and its this pure Twain that keeps you on board reading even the appendices at the end!Its obvious Twain couldn't stand the twee 'Merry England' novels of Sir Walter Scott,which no doubt he deplored as a boy,but I think he's dragging us into one of his famous exagerations when he blames Scott, not only for the outdated chivelry nonsense that plagued the Southern sensibilities of his day,but also for being the fundamental cause of the civil war!! As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there? Who better to read than Mark Twain?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed. This account reads something more like a travelogue.Interspersed through this account are a number of anecdotes and commentaries, covering a various and sundry range of topics, including tall tales, legends, architecture, culture, grammar, mule racing, cockfighting, and Sir Walter Scott's detrimental effect on the American South. One could spend several pages listing the topics Twain covers, but suffice it to say that the majority will be of interest to the discerning modern reader. His tall tales (often related as fact) are particularly good.Twain is just as engaging here as he is in his fiction. He is self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek, and his style is completely endearing. And if a particular topic is not of interest to the reader, well, he moves on quickly enough.Ultimately, Life on the Mississippi is a fascinating read, not only for detailed insight into nineteenth-century life in America, but also for the countless tales Twain relates in his inimitable style."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"first of all, for those of u who dont know what \\"thou\\" or \\"thee\\" means,they both mean \\"you\\"! and for all of you who say this book is anti-religion, you must fail to understand that the catholic church was a very powerful and disliked back in the middle ages, and he was describing what religion was like back then.and finally for those of you who say that they dont like the 1800's speech,IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE 1800's!do you expect mark twain to write like we would nowadays?just because he writes a book about time traveling doesnt mean he IS a time traveler!This is a very interesting book,describing in detail what it would be like to mix middle ages with the 19th century.would recomend this book to anyone that knows what \\"thee\\" or \\"thou\\" means."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"With each Twain novel I read, I am amazed at how he can be so funny while packing such astute insights about life. This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel.

There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot.

Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;.

It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life.

Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life.

The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason.

Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

This book was anything but. It's nothing more than a 400 page rant about how evil wealthy people are, in contrast to the inherent goodness of the oppressed poor. He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating. As it stands, anyone looking for a time travel story is going to get little more than a meandering, endless, and plotless leftwing spiel."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Hi everyone!

There are new ideas and opinions brewing all the time. That being said, this book is a true blessing for anyone interested in making mead.I wish Ken Schramm spoke more on fermentation temperature and methods of controling it. Not everyone has the luxury of air conditioning (or even indoor brewing). Here's a bit that may help fill in this gap:For most wine yeasts, ideal fermentation temperatures should be as follows:Start fermentation - 78F/26CMain fermentation - 65F/18CNear end fermentation - 80F/27CCommercial grape wineries ferment with wines at 60F/15C - 70F/20C. I've even heard 55 F to 70 F.For practical purposes, 70F/21C - 75F/24C will do just fine for most meads, depending on the tolerance of the yeast used. The lower end of this range ensures a robust fermentation while minimize harsh fusel alcohols that affect the taste of the finished product.The best way to ensure proper fermentation temperatures is to take a somewhat high tech approach from the beer home-brewers and use a chest freezer or refrigerator equipped with a plug-in temperature controller (Ranco makes a good one) - Simple and efficient.

Mead is an ancient brew - arguably the first fermented beverage - so why not use an ancient spelling of the word? It fits.Ken Schramm has done for meadmaking what Jon Iverson, Terry Garey and Daniel Pambianchi have done for winemaking - written a book that will serve the home craft with authority for years to come. Indeed, it was a joy to read. From the historical asides to the award-winning recipes, this book was meant to educate and use. The hardest part was resisting the temptation to put it down and run out to buy some honey.\\"Mead, once considered far superior to both wine and beer, fell into obscurity as honey became scarce and expensive, and was never reclaimed from the nobility's vault in which it was laid. Through the work of many people and by virtue of the quality of the beverage itself, mead is making a comeback. This book endeavors to push that comeback along.\\" Thus, quite succinctly, Ken Schramm lays out the gauntlet he chose to run. In my judgement, he succeeded admirably.The book is divided into four parts. These are Background, Process, Ingredients, and Recipes, followed by appendices, glossary, bibliography, and a very useful index.Background: I am an historian by education. As such, I am drawn to historical accounts that support my hobbies. So it was with great delight that I read in the opening chapter a fairly good argument for mead claiming the title of oldest fermentable beverage. Indeed, the whole first chapter is about the history of mead, from accidental discovery by paleolithic or neolithic man to the great mead traditions of ancient Egypt, Europe, and wherever sailors sailed. While some would choose to skip this discussion, I hope the number would not be too large. There is serious food for thought here. A very short second chapter defines the styles of mead. I found this chapter to be too short, but I am a fan of nomenclature.Process: Four chapters compose this portion. \\"Changing Honey into Wine\\" goes beyond tradition, of which mead is literally soaked, to bring the craft into the scientific era and improve it generally. The author uses a medium-sweet, orange-blossom mead recipe to walk the reader through the equipment, additives and processes of making mead generally. \\"Beyond the Basics\\" looks at the heat and non-heat methods of integrating honey, but also looks at sparkling mead, more equipment, and more additives. \\"Yeast and Fermentation\\" covers many subjects -- from yeast choices to residual sugar -- and is, in my opinion, the heart and soul of the meadmaking process. \\"Conditioning, Aging, and Using Oak\\" covers these subjects sufficiently for the beginner. While I desired more, I am perhaps atypical.Ingredients: \\"All About Honey\\" is perhaps the author's finest chapter. As a bee-keeper, he is here in his own element and it seeps through loud and clear. I think he restrained himself by only discussing 21 types of honey, but I could be guessing. \\"Fruit and Melomel\\" is another meat and potatoes chapter, delving far beyond the superficial to discuss the subject adequately. \\"Grapes and Pyment\\" is less meaty but still adequate, confined to the more commonly available Vitis vinifera wine grape varieties. My disappointment at seeing no discussion of North American native grapes may not be widespread, but leaves room for a second edition expansion. \\"Spices and Metheglin\\" opens a door wide enough for an 18-wheeler, and he shows tremendous restraint by only discussing 51 suitable spices (of which 15 are chile pepper varieties). \\"Grains and Braggot\\" concentrates exclusively on braggots -- malted barley meads -- with only passing mention that there are other grains available. But one can forgive him for this. He does, after all, cover the malts adequately enough to open another huge realm of possible variation.Recipes: \\"Putting the Process and Ingredients Together\\" is a collection of only 11 recipes (12 counting the orange-blossom mead mentioned earlier), but they are carefully chosen to reveal an almost endless number of possibilities across several styles. I doubt anyone will be disappointed, for Ken Schramm's purpose here is to offer the models for countless variations. \\"Appreciating Your Mead\\" is a short, seemingly unnecessary chapter - until you read it. Skip it at your own peril.Indeed, if you are going to make mead at all, skip this book at your own peril. My copy is well-tabbed, and I'm not a beginner...."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"&quot;...90% of this book deals with ingredients and only 10% with specific recipes.&quot; states Ken Schramm in Part Four of his book &quot;The Compleat Meadmaker&quot;. This is true. If you're looking for a pure recipe book, this is probably not it. However, if you're interested in the history of mead, why it declined, good technique for making you first batch, good technique for making your Nth batch, a good bit of down to Earth biochemistry, and the care and feeding of yeasts (what the heck IS the difference between Epernay and Primier Cuvee?), then this IS the book for you.The book is divided into four parts: Background, Process, Ingredients and Recipes. &quot;Background&quot; discusses the history of mead, why it was probably the first fermented beverage, why beer, wine and distilled spirits have usurped its place, and the future of mead making. &quot;Process&quot; walks the reader, step by step through making their first batch of mead, from selecting brewing gear and honey, to bottling. &quot;Process&quot; also discusses more advanced mead making techniques. &quot;Ingredients&quot; goes into details about honeys, fruits for melomels, spices and herbs for metheglins, and grains for braggots. What are melomels, metheglins and braggots, you ask? Read the book and find out. &quot;Recipes&quot; contains, of course, recipes. The recipes offer samplings from the different styles of mead. Ken Schramm seems to be a proponent of experimentation, and these recipes offer excellent starting points.Ken Schramm's writing style is relaxed, humorous, and informative.

Schramm claims that your mead will take at least six months of aging to be good, \\"unless you are possessed of some meadmaking magic\\". Well, I guess I got lucky and Merlin helped me out from across the dimensions, because my very first batch was not merely drinkable at only one month after bottling, it beat out the Redstone and Chaucer basic meads hands down in a blind taste test...and they go for twelve and twenty a bottle respectively.I just tried one of my last bottles from that first batch this weekend, and at six months it is truly sublime: mildly dry, not in the least cloying, and with a clear, crisp finish. Above all, it made my brain and body feel heavenly, much more refined and subtle than all but the finest wines, grape or honey-based, that I've ever tried.I'd like to take credit, but it's really Schramm's doing. Those who read closely will find one special page where he details his own personal method and then quickly shifts back to talking about the \\"normal\\" method. That one page is where it's at. Quicker, easier, and better. That's Ken's genius right there. Well done, Sir Schramm.I've also tried various champagne yeasts and other little touches, finding a few little secrets of my own since that first batch; therein lies one of the delights of homebrewing, the personal touch.Whenever I share a bottle of my honey wine with a friend or even enjoy it alone before a fine sunset, guitar in hand, I always toast the real heroes of mead, our little winged friends (who are starting to disappear due to our insane chemical farming practices and GMO idiocy). We are only now beginning to understand how vital our insect pals are to all food crops. I have truly learned to love and appreciate and even revere our busy, buzzy little friends, for they have opened my eyes to a whole new world of mellow alcoholic delight.And thus I always salute them with every new glass of mead:\\"Cheers to the bees!\\"I will never again look at a bee without deep respect.Honey is magic, and mead is distilled magic."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"Though I had a few batches of beer under my belt, I knew next to nothing about making mead.

The recipes section excels at giving suggestions for flavor combinations that work with mead fermentation. With a wide range of mead-types covered, I found them to be an excellent starting-point for many excellent (and sometimes strange) variations.The information about the production of mead provided can easily be used to synthesize your own actual processes for making different kinds of mead. The author rightly encourages you to experiment and keep detailed notes so you know what worked and what did not.Even after making many, many batches of mead, I find myself referring back to this book over and over. It is a great resource!"},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I would really like the author to bring out a 2nd edition.

Looking forward to trying a couple of the recipes soon."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"If you are a homebrewer or professional brewer this is a must have book. Its detailed for expert brewers, but written so a beginner can read with ease. If you are a beer or winemaker this is a great book to have as well, even if you never plan to make Mead. I started making Mead last year and wish I had this book before I started."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I wish I had a read Ken's book before I embarked on my first batches of wine and mead. All of those lessons one learns through the \\"school of hard knocks\\" would have been avoided. Ken shares his experiences and tells you why you should perform a task the way that he recommends along with his own mistakes. A must read for anyone starting to brew wine or mead on their own."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"Most reviewers have already described the book, and I agree that's an interesting and well written book. Now I can say that I am able do make mead. The only thing I did not like is that sometimes the author's comments on ingredients or techniques seem to be solely based on his own experience, rather than a cientific evidence. Sometimes I felt I was reading a blog post! Overall I loved the book, it reached my expectations as a begginer."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"This is an excellent book for the experienced mead maker or the wanna be. I first started making mead when I was a graduate student over 20 years ago, and Roger Morse'sMaking Mead (Honey Wine): History, Recipes, Methods and Equipmentwas the best survey book available then. Ken Schramm has certainly updated the survey a dozen years later, but more to the point, this book is written directly to the hobbyist with an interest in making honey wine with a great take on how to execute variations in the kinds of mead one can make. If you want to make mead, buy it first!"},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"This is an excellent resource, especially for first time mead makers. It truly lives up to it's name."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I picked this one up at my local homebrew shop wanting to make non-crappy batches of mead. I've been a homebrewer of beer for the last two years so knowing the basics gave me a good leg up on the \\"beyond the basics\\" sections.I was expecting a nice introduction to the technical science of what happens when you make mead including yeast cycles and strains, spicing mead, and learning the nomenclature. I quickly found that I got much more than I expected. This can easily be called the \\"Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" for meadmakers.For anyone even remotely interested in meadmaking this is a great place to start. For those that have been doing it a while, this is a great book to take the next step."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I recently purchased this book and another one called Making Mead Honey Wine and both of these books are great for learning how to make mead. I tried mead for the 1st time at a Renassance Festival; it was very good and had a nice kick to it. I would definately recommend this book to someone wanting to make mead for the 1st time. Contains a lot of useful information."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I found this book to be very good. It covers the making of meads including: sack, metheglin, melomel, pyment, and braggot. Includes in bottle carbonating technique. It covers selecting ingredients and equipment and discusses all aspects of the fermentation process. It also includes a history of mead making. Has some technical information on the chemical composition of honey.Best resource for mead making that I have found so far."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I was impressed with the book from the get-go. A good history of honey and mead to start with, and an excellent guide to producing your first batch. That is just in the first, say, 30 pages. The rest continues with valuable advanced recipes and techniques. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in making their own mead."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"Fascinating book, covering the history, how-to and recipes of mead making. If your library space or budget only allows for one book on mead, this is it."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"The yeast and honey tables in this book make it worth the price. It gives a good history and theory of mead, as well as a good few great recipes. Definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in making or drinking mead."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I got this book because I wanted to start with mead as a foray into home winemaking (I bought a house with some terraced sangiovese vines which should produce nicely in a couple years); mead seems like a great introduction into winemaking or home brewing, because it shares similarities with both, but is simpler and has fewer steps than beer or wine from grapes.I bought this book because it pretty much corners the market as being one of the few (or only) books specifically about making mead.I like the casual and meandering, forward-plodding approach of the book, but my major complaint is this:As a novice winemaker who has never made beer nor wine, I wanted something that had great, simple, step-by-step instructions of how to do it. This book does that, but it uses words only -- no illustrations! So, only words are used to describe tools and processes, whereas a simple picture of an instrument (there are a few photos here and there) or an illustrated diagram would do wonders to improve the understanding of what is being described.Aside from that, it doesn't seem to offer a whole lot of information I can't find in other winemaking books (I have From Vines to Wines and that is a much better introduction to the winemaking process, as it has a lot of useful illustrations to assist the comprehension.)If you are aiming to ONLY make mead and you ONLY want to buy one book, this is the book to get, and if you can really comprehend and follow along with the verbal descriptions/instructions, it will work just fine. But on the other hand, I feel like any information I've gotten from this book I also have easily and quickly found on forums and websites with some simple, short searches online (for keyword phrases like \\"how to make mead\\") -- in fact, instead of this book I would recommend a decent, nicely illustrated introduction to winemaking, supplemented with some web searches on mead-making websites and forums."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"The author obviously knows this subject well, but I was dissapointed in the book. The book does contain some good information, but overall I found the writing vague and lacking detail in his explanations of process. Incomplete in several instances with some terms that came out of nowhere, with no explanation. Basically I found the writing disorganized. The author seems to be writing to a beginner meadmaker but doesn't structure his process explanations appropriately. The book does however, do a great job of disucussing ingredients; I found the sections on yeast, and herbs and spices very interesting. This book is a good reference but additional resources or experience will be needed to become a meadmaker."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I've been brewing beer off and on for over 10 years now, and was interested in making mead. While on my quest for knowledge I kept hearing about this book by Schramm??, on all of the brewing forums. I finally got The Compleat Mead Maker and was thoroughly suprised and happy at how much information was packed into this wonderful book. It gives a history of mead, some basic recipes and alot of other valuable information for someone looking to brew up mead."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I've been making mead for a few years now and bought this book as a reference. It is helpful for some things but is not the meadmaker's bible that I hoped it would be.If you are new to meadmaking, this book will teach you a good bit about the history of mead and walk you through the process of making a tasty first batch. If you are more experienced, it will help you to experiment with different yeasts, honeys, and flavor ingredients. Given the paucity of mead books, this is probably one of the best.The honey chapter has a big table comparing chemical compositions of about 50 varieties of honey, but only about 10 are described in any detail, primarily based on the author's personal experience. Some of the more common honey varieties (e.g. basswood, buckwheat, pumpkin) are not described at all. I would have liked this section to be more comprehensive, drawing on outside references to expand on the author's knowledge.The fruit chapter has a very useful table listing the amount of various fruits to add for mild, medium, or strong flavor. Unfortunately the spice chapter does not have an equivalent table; the only table in that chapter compares the relative heat of 15 different hot peppers (which strikes me as odd since no other spices are described in such depth). Some of the spices have no suggestions for amounts. That means that if I want to make a mead with, say, cardamom, I need to look up recipes and tasting notes online, and thus the book is not serving its purpose as a reference.The recipes section is too short! Aside from the basic recipes for dry, semi-sweet, and dessert meads, the choice of the ~12 recipes in this section seems arbitrary and far from complete. It would be far more useful if multiple recipes were included in the individual chapters on melomels (fruit meads), metheglyns (herb/spice meads), pyments (grape meads), and braggots (barley meads).Some fermentation techniques are covered in depth, but I was hoping to see some discussion of staggered nutrient additions and degassing, neither of which is mentioned in the text.So...this is a good book for any meadmaker's shelf, but it is by no means the comprehensive reference that the title would suggest."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I had brewed a few mead batches before this, but after reading it I am abandoning beer for mead alone. Some good recipes, historical background, and plenty of chemistry for my taste."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"While I agree with some of the points raised by the 3-star reviewers, I think the section on \\"Yeast and Fermentation\\" elevates this title to 5-star status because the advice offered can shave months off a fermentation schedule.Mead has a reputation for sometimes slow, months-long or even stuck fermentation phases. Don't get buried by the biochem jargon in this chapter: you can skim past the ADP->ATP, NADP and permease discussion to find the recommended process for adding nutrients, aeration, and pH control. The author cites research indicating the proper addition of yeast nutrients (now commercially available) are needed along with aeration and pH buffering in the range of ~3.8 using CaCO3 to ensure a strong growth phase followed by speedy fermentation. There are a lot of opinions regarding the correct numbers here, but I prefer to place my trust in people who can cite peer reviewed research."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"There's not much to be said about this text that hasn't already been said by experienced and newbie mazers alike, but let me say it again in case any of you missed it: Schramm knows what he's about, and you need to read this book if you want to get into making mead. To put it mildly, I went from never having brewed anything to making award winning meads and setting up hives in my back yard within a couple of years. OK, so I'm obsessive. But that obsessive drive feeds on information, and there's no better starting point than the Compleat Meadmaker.You don't necessarily HAVE to buy this book before you kill a bottle of Carlo Rossi and start your first batch of JAOM in a closet, but you should. Short of a meadmaking buddy who knows the ropes (or access to r/mead, who will also tell you to buy this book), this book is the best source of information you can get your hands on.Now, I don't share Ken's thing for sour cherries, but I'll tell you this: that braggot recipe, the Don't Cry for Me, Spargentina? Yeah. That's a good recipe. And by good I mean two cases of it made me the most popular and least remembered person at every event I brought it to.

This book is obviously done by an expert. He knows honey (as well as the other ingredients) and fermentation extremely well. The author's great appreciation for everything about mead from history to fermenting to enjoying is apparent. I think that this book is suited for someone who wants to understand enough about the entire process to be creative with brewing mead. There are only a few recipes, but if you understand the process and the ingredients, and you try it out with some of these recipes, then you should be able to create your own masterpieces - especially if you have a little brewing experience already.. At least, that's the plan."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I bought this book after sampling some of the authors mead at a local mead tasting event.

I have been brewing beer for years, and this being my first attempts at mead, I needed step by step instructions as well details about the history and science behind the hobby. This book fits the bill perfectly. Buy the book and then start enjoying some good mead within months! Be patient however, and do not drink all you mead rapidly, because it gets better with time! I had all but a couple bottles drunk after nine months and at 1 year it is better than ever. Good luck and happy mead making!"},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"This book is a large snap shot of how to make honey wine (mead). (Mead was the original party drink of the Vikings and Anglo Saxons while beer was basically used like water with just barely enough alcohol in it to make the water safe to drink.) This book covers just about everything and the authors well-rounded education shines through in every well-spoken and educational chapter.This is the \\"Betty Crocker Cookbook\\" of mead making... No it doesn't have tons and tons of recipes but it does have a fair number of them and tons of ideas to create your own recipes. The book covers everything from how much honey and of what kind to use, spices, fruits, sanitation and a good history of mead and chapters on honey and a bit of general Chemistry.I have found the \\"No Heat\\" method of mead making (as explained in the book) to be simple and produce wonderful results.My own notes in addition to the book are as follows. Although the book walks you through the mead making process in great detail the one error is the book doesn't tell you how to make your mead taste like mead in the chapters that explain how to START making mead. The process as the book describes converts almost all the honey to alcohol but leave few sugars to even taste like mead. The actual answer to this problem can be found in the index under sweetening but that's in a different section.The short version is convert the honey to alcohol, get fermentation to finish and then add more honey or whatever juice to sweeten it and get the flavor to suit your taste... the books instructions are more complete than mine but keep in mind you will have to look up that section it is not in the section for beginners.Lastly there is an orange red airtight cover for glass carboys that has two holes, the central hole is obviously for a racking cane to drain liquid but there are no instructions for what the other hole is for... The other hole is to blow into in order to create air pressure that starts the racking process (siphoning).This doesnt seem to be covered anywere even though theres no way for a novice to know it...The book is great overall and well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"A Must buy!

This book also contains a significant amount of history and other useful information about brewing, honey, and the mysteries of yeast. The recipes in the book are easy to follow for the beginner and allow for the advanced brewer to tweak them as they see fit. I personally have tried a couple of the recipes, my favourite being the \\"Mambo In Your Mouth\\" melomel. I have been a home-brew beer brewer for many years and only recently (in the last 5 years or so) have gotten more into brewing mead, mostly because I also a hobby beekeeper and have access to lots of honey. If you really want to brew great mead, I recommend you get to know a local beekeeper to source your honey from, I believe the author the book offers the same advice."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"I'm so glad I ordered this book from the library at the same time as I ordered a mead kit.

Sometimes you want precision, sometimes you want happy accidents and it's nice to see a text that allows for that kind of flexibility.It was very straight forward; leaning a bit heavier towards technique, but with enough recipes/examples to illustrate and inspire (a balance I've definitely come to appreciate in any instructional text).It had just enough of the hard science of brewing to further my understanding of the subject without making me bemoan my lack of an Organic Chem course during college.In the end I think the best judge of an instructional book is if reading it makes me start a mental wish-list of what to buy the nest time I play with that specific hobby, and I've already started working out the contents of my next brewstore order."},{"Title":"The Compleat Meadmaker : Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations","review":"Highly informative.

Some of the information is a bit more opinion than fact, but the vast majority is very well researched and very well developed into text. His 20+ years of experience does show.

For Christmas, my mother purchased this book for me and in the last couple of weeks, I have been tearing through it after work. If you have never tried mead, do! I remember having it at a renaissance faire in Germany one year and it was delicious... though accompanied by a barbarian costumed punk rock band with battle axes for guitars. After reading the first chapter of this book, I decided to make my own mead and am currently in the process of getting all of the ingredients I will need. (Honey on amazon is shipped much quicker than yeast nutrient from home brewery sites... yea, prime is great).Mr. Schramm explains the vintning process very well... I use the term \\"vintning process\\" because mead is a honey wine. Though it is not \\"wine\\" in the truest sense per se, Mr. Schramm explains over and over that the mead must (juice prior to fermentation) is much more similar to wine must than beer wort and actually, after studying both, have concluded that the basic steps are the same. 1) Must creation, 2) Fermentation, 3) Racking/Stabilizing/clarifying 4) Aging 5) Drinking.I am truly looking forward to creating my very first batch of mead out of Orange Blossom honey and have only this book to thank.

Through my already extensive involvement with the &quot;Language Wise Method&quot;, I am convinced that comprehension is a byproduct of verbal intelligence. I have witnessed it with my own eyes. Understanding what one reads proliferates when syntax (the categorical and functional relationship of words), vocabulary, attention, memory, logical reasoning and creativity improve. But verbal intelligence is not limited to producing comprehension, but has manufactured writing skills, communcation skills, memory and much more.The comprehensive presentation concerning what verbal intelligence is, human motivation, the nature of language, vocabulary, comprehension, attention challenges, memory, logical reasoning and creativity, make up the first section of the book and supplies the reader with a solid foundation of knowledge about the real issues. Section two presents an aggregate of about forty activities that all team-up to produce the end result, verbal intelligence or making one language wise.Having read, studied and applied this book to numerous children, I have obtained outstanding results to date. One example is a tenth-grade girl, comprehending at first-grade level who reached grade-level in 15 one-hour sessions with me.The efficacy of this program is due, in part, to the way in which children are taught. Most of us are aware that when a child discovers something, the likelyhood that she has learned it increases. Through implicit/discovery learning, children are engaged in problem solving, connecting words, analyzing, metacognition, increasing their own vocabulary, and more.I give &quot;How To Increase Your Chid's Verbal Intelligence&quot; a five star rating. It works and it's a blast.Swen Nater"},{"Title":"How to Increase Your Child's Verbal Intelligence: The Groundbreaking Language Wise Method","review":"I think that Carmen and Geoffrey McGuinness have hit the nail on the head when it comes to both teaching decoding skills and verbal intelligence. These books have been a great help teaching my dyslexic son to read and comprehend. I finally found a system that worked!But, the \\"Language Wise Support Manual\\" that goes with this book is pricey (about 3 times the price of the book) and unnecessary. While it might help a classroom teacher who needs worksheets that he/she can send home for the student to work on, a parent can just use notebook paper to do the activities.For example, to go with \\"Using Elaboration in Writing\\" page 234 in the book, the workbook simply as a sentence at the top of the page that says \\"Fill both pages on the topic of________\\", followed by two pages of lined paper. A great number of the pages are like this."},{"Title":"How to Increase Your Child's Verbal Intelligence: The Groundbreaking Language Wise Method","review":"With a plethora of ways to address reading comprehension, it is difficult as a teacher and parent to know which are really effective and why. As with Reading Reflex, the McGuinesses have led me to a deeper understanding of the familiar. The book's activites are simple and powerful and often ones that I have used before but without the accompanying understanding of why they are effective. The book is divided into two sections, the first explains the underlying theory. The second describes the activities. So many times we see activities without theory and theory without activites... here the twain have met. Understanding the logic of the activities makes them adaptable to the classroom setting. For example, there is an activity &quot;Connections&quot; where children are asked to relate not obviously related things. I used this as a prereading activity with a Native American myth, introducing some key elements of the story. The children generated connections and virtually predicted the story as they established relationships between a flute, a blanket and a branch. This is how understanding brain research can enlighten and strengthen our teaching practice, giving our students powerful experiences with written and spoken language.

I bought How To Increase Your Child's Verbal Intelligence, The Language Wise Method because of the author's first book, Reading Reflex. I wanted to improve my students' writing and language skills. I found the book informative and motivating. I have used several of the lessons from the book in my classroom. My students love the lessons and are eager to participate in them. I have noticed a dramatic increase in my students' writing and speaking vocabulary. Every lesson is taught in context and is meaningful to my students. I believe everyone who works with children should read about the Language Wise method, it has given me a better understanding of the learning process."},{"Title":"How to Increase Your Child's Verbal Intelligence: The Groundbreaking Language Wise Method","review":"Having this volume dedicated to me, one might think that a review would have biased leanings. With that in mind, I will be as objective as possible. Having implemented this program into one-on-one and small group tutoring, I can say, from experience and from a pragmatic point of view, that it works. Personally, I have had the priviledge of testing it on a 10th grader who was comprehending at a second grade level, and with astonishment, watched her reach grade level in just 15 one-hour sessions. In addition, this young lady, who was cursed with detachment syndrome, due to being left on a Korean doorstep by her mother when she was an infant, blossomed in her communication and writing skills. Her liberation from the shackles of her, then supposed, doom, has made an incredible difference in her life, as you might well imagine.But that is only one child. I have perfomed small group instruction and witnessed similar growth, proportionally.My assessment of Verbal Intelligence is that it is a masterpiece. Discovery learning has always been a great teacher, and this program allows a child (or a person of any age) to implicitly learn the English language. This volume majors on this type of learning, allowing children to uncover and grab for themselves, the valuable syntax, vocabulary, and other components of verbal intelligence.I have seen children grow wings as they learn a strategy for learning the meaning of a new word, based on the rest of a sentence, or group of sentences. And, as they learn to tackle those words, I have witnessed an atrophy in the intimidation of new words and in the strategy of skipping over them. I have seen prodigious smiles as children compose an interesting, informative and complex paragraph through the caveman activity. I have seen excitement and incredible improvement as children engage in connecting words and deduction activities.It is my opinion that Verbal Intelligence is the exact thing that parents should be doing with their children all through school, and, I would go so far as to say that if parents engage their children in this, before kindergarten, they, and the school, will be amazed. It is not optional, but should be original equipment for our preschoolers.In short, I believe that Verbal Intelligence should not be simply &quot;added&quot; to a library, or integrated into a curriculum. It should have preeminence when language is taught.Swen Nater"},{"Title":"How to Increase Your Child's Verbal Intelligence: The Groundbreaking Language Wise Method","review":"With a plethora of ways to address reading comprehension, it is difficult as a teacher and parent to know which are really effective and why.

The lessons are fantastic, and the wealth of information is invaluable."},{"Title":"How to Increase Your Child's Verbal Intelligence: The Groundbreaking Language Wise Method","review":"Highly recommended for parents of struggling, or reluctant readers. Of the dozens of books I have bought and read in an attempt to help my child with learning challenges, this is the one I have kept. This book is aimed at parents, and does not assume you are homeschooling or otherwise have unlimited time to spend tutoring your child.The first half of the book presents some useful concepts about how children (people) learn, citing studies to back up the points. This is well written, engaging, and illustrated with graphics and sprinkled with quotes and exercises to keep you going. The second half of the book is why I keep it though: there are pages and pages of language-based activities (GAMES) that you can play with your child, with a pencil and paper, or even with nothing at all. These are easy to do, and fun for both of you, unlike so many of the other exercises we have tried. Because they are fun, if they don't work, it is not a waste of everyone's time and energy. You don't need to have the book in front of you to play the games, so the child doesn't even know the game is supposed to be educational, which makes these exercises infinitely more do-able than most. Other authors don't seem to get that a child who is struggling with language is not generally going to enjoy reading and word exercises, and some of the other books and methods I tried were torture for both of us. This is not."},{"Title":"French Gothic Architecture of the 12th and 13th Centuries (California Studies in the History of Art)","review":"Jean Bony is an internationally recognized medievalist, and in this book his abilities as an historian truly shine.

Many books on black men and black male activists have lamented about how black men fare in education, the workforce, and the prison-industrial complex. This book covers those familiar (played out?) topics. However, it touches on novel topics such as black male expression in the theater and black men in journalism. This book gives a tolerable nod to diversity among black men by discussing boys, MSM, and the foreign-born.On a positive note, I think everyday readers could pick up and understand this book. On the other hand, this book is RIDDLED with typographical errors. I am almost sure that a typist typed up these articles and the editor never bothered to assign someone to proofread the anthology. As a result, black men with fancy academic degrees are made to look like freshman in high school or other people that have never had exposure to a typewriter or don't know about \\"spell check\\" in their computer programs. Trust me, there are enough errors here that it conspicuously interrupts the flow of the book.Throughout this book, the authors try to emphasize that race and gender must both be juggled; one issue can't be dropped in thinking of the plight of black males. This group is often compared to black females and white males for comparative purposes. Comparisons to white females are hardly brought up. I am sure that the editor did not want to \\"play the oppression sweepstakes\\" and imply that somehow racism is more pervasive than sexism. LatinOs and LatinAs are brought up occasionally as well.Unfortunately, this book is men's studies by naivet&eacute;. Any topic that even tangentially discusses black men is brought up here. For example, one writer details the similarities between the late artist Equiano and the living artist George C. Wolfe. Black masculinity is not brought up; this chapter is just here because it happens to discuss black men. The same is true on the chapters about foreign policy, journalism, and the sciences. Male privilege, male rituals, and rigid masculinities are never brought up. Most men's studies authors are much more conscious of these matters than the authors here. I wonder if authors approached the editor and begged to be included just to avoid the \\"publish or perish\\" rule at universities.The author provides a weak introduction and conclusion for the book. This book breaks down starkly into three areas: 1) lists of black male achievers, 2) statistics on black males, and 3) policy recommendations for black men. Thus, I wonder why the author did not divide the book into parts. The authors here are BIG on role models. Just by mentioning that black male individuals have thrived before is their proof that others can carry that torch. The suggestions at the end of the book are helpful, but unrealistic at a time when the party that \\"promotes self-reliance\\" and decries \\"big government\\" is in power.I just absolutely disagree with much of what is said in this book. One author gives Joe Jackson, father of the Jackson 5, as an example of \\"strong\\" black fatherhood. In reality, his sons have spoken openly of how abusive their father was. Later, a man celebrates Bill Clinton's appointment of blacks to high offices. He never mentions that Clinton shamefully fired Jocelyn Elders and he doesn't mention Lani Guinier (and Clinton's backstabbing of her) at all. A chapter on Caribbean and African men in the US implies that they are all PhD's and entrepreneurs. Trust me, there are plenty of foreign black men in the US who are not class-privileged or upwardly mobile economically. The chapter on black MSM never spells out if MSM are different from openly gay men and it makes a predictable statement that any person on the street could have made about preventing HIV among this populations.The book is the size and length of a required text for a college course. However, I could not imagine any professor using this as his core book on a syllabus. While it is nice that the cover does not contain something predictable like a male symbol or a drawing of Africa, I wonder why the editor chose a Mondrian-inspired cover. Did he want readers to ask, \\"What's black and white and red all over?\\""},{"Title":"Creative Cooking Desserts","review":"I HAD THIS BOOK, FOR MANY YEARS, ALL THE RECIPES I HAD TRIED WORK LIKE A DREAM, WANTED TO GIVE MY DAUGHTERS, THE SAME BOOK, I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THE 3 BOOKS I NEEDED, HOPE THEY GET OUT OF THEM AS MUCH FUN, AS I HAD"},{"Title":"Creative Cooking Desserts","review":"I love this book!

The spirit is God's dwelling place. Our human nature, good or bad is in our soul. The goal is to have the spirit govern the soul. The soul must be broken, won and mastered by the spirit.Some Scripture he cites:Luke 21:19In your patience ye shall win your souls.1 Peter 1:22Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:1 Peter 1:9receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls.Romans 7:22For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:Ephesians 3:16that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;2 Corinthians 416Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.(I always rightly or wrongly thought the outward man is the body, but he is referring to the human nature decaying as the spirit is strengthened.)All The American Standard Version which he uses.Later on he takes some liberty in translating a couple verses in Hebrews.The beginning was somewhat eye opening and I was looking forward to the book.However the book is repetitive to an extreme. He constantly reiterates how the outward man must be broken for the spirit to be able to work in various ways.He also believes there is a point where there is a sudden breaking and then the spirit is free as long as we abide by the Spirit. This is reminiscent of a \\"second anointing\\" and also reminds me of books like Absolute Surrender by Murray (I know that will offend a lot of people) and others. Although Nee says that it can be a sudden break followed by a gradual one or gradual followed by sudden, on pg 73 he says the problem can be solved. I would prefer to think of this as a life-long process with the spiritual battle going on constantly.Although God uses everything for the good (Romans 8:28) I'm not sure I subscribe to the theory that God Himself directly sends every calamity our way as he says.This is the first book by Nee that I have read. I learned some things but thought these concepts could be explained more succinctly. Despite this I'm looking forward to reading his three most popular works."},{"Title":"The Release of the Spirit","review":"Frankly, I am amazed at the author's understanding of the issue regarding spirit and soul. He explains why many Christians are not effective because of their unbroken spirits. He then describes how we can release the Spirit so that our souls are ruled by the Spirit making us more effective for the Lord. I recommend this book to all serious Christians desiring to serve the Lord."},{"Title":"The Release of the Spirit","review":"This is a small but powerful book. Don't expect the typical \\"feel good\\" Christian book that tells you God wants you to be rich and successful. Quite the opposite. God wants you to be broken so that he can release his power through you in the form of his Holy Spirit. Brokenness is not a topic you hear much about nor does it make people want to jump on board. However, like most important and true and powerful things of God it is right. The good things of God are always the opposite of what you think they are. Therefore it is brokenness, not asserting yourself and going for the gusto and grabbing everything from life that is powerful--brokenness is what God wants for you. Don't read it if you don't want the power that comes from that kind of sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Release of the Spirit","review":"Anyone looking for a deeper spiritual walk with the Lord will appreciate what this author presents in this book.

I have to admit that I read it more than once over a two year period. Everything I read in it rang true in me but I couldn't understand it. I prayed, agreed with the Truth as it was revealed in it's pages, but it was still only so much theory. Until the Holy Spirit turned my mind's darkness into light. And you know what, that Evangelist was right! SInce then, I have read everything I could find on brother Nee's writings, and have not been disappointed. He is among those saints through whom the Holy Spirit chooses to spread the sweet savor of our Lord Jesus Christ. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has a thirst after Him like a deer pants after the brook! It may take you a while until the light breaks forth in your soul but the wait is worth it.

For those who really seek to know the Lord this book talks about the need for him to break the outer man (our flesh) in order for the inner man (our Spirit) to come forth. This is a nicer way of discussing when we go through a period of our flesh being crusified. This book is not an easy read as it is one of those books that makes you take a look at yourself that will most likely make you shrink back in your chair. I would not recommend this book for anyone that has just been saved, this is pretty heavy stuff. After 7 years I am just now getting to where I can handle Watchman Nee's writings.

Recently I have begun to hunt for older books that have remained popular as I have found many contemporary titles wanting. Nee lays out a wonderful case for the disipline of Holy Spirit as a true gift to us all. I have come to believe the words of James 1:2 encouraging us to \\"consider it joy..whenever you face trials of many kinds\\" in a much more thorough and practical way. Nee explains that above all other sources of revelation God will use the hard circumstances of our life to break our outer man and release the spirit within us. Unlike some authors Nee stops short of suggesting that sickness or tragedy are sent of God to punish or teach us lessons. Rather, he teaches that these circumstances will be used of God for our good weather their author is Satan or our own sinful decisions. Nee has helped me make sense of the discipline of God, a topic I have long struggled with."},{"Title":"The Release of the Spirit","review":"There is a degree of controversy that surrounds Watchman Nee. Don't let that stop you from reading this book.It had been sitting on my shelf for a long time when the &quot;jury duty&quot; call came. Figuring I'd have a lot of reading time over my week of service, I turned my time into a personal retreat with Watchman Nee. That week marked a dramatic change in my life.Nee offers probably the very best ever explanation of the parables of the seed sown to &quot;die&quot; and the broken box of perfume. It totally revolutionized my thinking of how the Spirit of God works in us.Nee shares that our problem is we try to keep the life of the Spirit protected inside us all the while God is trying to shatter the shell to let it escape. It was an incredible concept. For me it changed the way I interacted with people we would normally shy away from. Rather than being places where we need to &quot;shelter&quot; our spiritual life, Nee helped me to realize that is exactly the place a &quot;release of the Spirit&quot; is needed.That is just one of the nuggets in this volume. If you are drawn to books like &quot;God Chasers&quot; and Dutch Sheets various titles, you will love this one.This is a book I buy in volume to give away and so should you. It is simply a classic."},{"Title":"The Release of the Spirit","review":"I hardly know where to begin when attempting to describe to you how life-changing this book truly is for the disciple of Christ. I must tell you that I would not say that about any book. So... you know that this is not just any book. This book unlocks the key to understanding true discipleship and the way by which revolution will first come to man and then to the church.This book was originally a series of lectures given to Chinese church planters/workers. However, to recommend this book only to a select few would be absurd. This book is for all of those who have made Jesus Lord. The title of the book may be a bit ambiguous. You may be thinking... \\"What does that mean?\\" Had Dietrich Bonhoeffer not already used, \\"The Cost of Discipleship,\\" I believe this would have been an appropriate title.Scripture teaches us that man is spirit, soul, and body. Nee explains how God created man to join His Spirit with man's spirit (i.e. the center of a man). The spirit is to govern the soul of a man (i.e. thoughts, emotions, will) and then the body. He calls the spirit of a man the \\"inner man\\"; the soul--the \\"outer man\\"; the body--\\"the outermost man.\\" Before the inner man is regenerated by the Holy Spirit, a man's spirit is inopperative. His spirit is there, but in fact... it is dead! The soul then tries to function as only the spirit can do. Thus, the soul produces flesh! Man is then a frustrated being.Nee submits that most Christians live a \\"mixed\\" life. The Christian life is to be a Spirit-led and a Spirit-driven life. The Holy Spirit has regenerated the spirit of a man and is to continue to be the power that controls and governs him. However, many Christians allow their soul to interfere with the Spirit's work. Again, this produces flesh! The Spirit is hindered from joining with man's spirit while the soul of a man is not in full submission to the Spirit. (For a better understanding of what this looks like, read Nee's \\"The Normal Christian Life.\\")Nee's \\"The Release of the Spirit\\" is about man's soul (i.e. thoughts, emotions, will) being \\"broken\\" in order for the Spirit in a man to be \\"released.\\" He will base his claim on Scripture to prove this point. (e.g. 1 Thess. 5:23; Lk. 1:46; 21:19; 1 Pet. 1:9;22) Jesus said, \\"He who loves his life (psyche-soul), will lose it.\\" The outer man must be continuously broken before the Spirit is released through a man.Nee speaks from experience. There is absolutely no way a person can speak on this subject with not having first identified its activity in their own life. Nee wonderfully describes the battle going on in each Christian. Our soul wants to govern, but the Spirit must rule for God to be glorified in us. The only way this can happen... is for you and I to be broken.Nee's conclusion is this: God has ordered our lives. The hardships, the trials and tribulation have passed through his hands first. They have come to us to break the outer man! Therefore, if you want to be used up... if you want God to get all of you... you must first be crushed! The one who is willing to suffer the most... is the one who will be used the greatest by God. This is the Christian life.Nee writes, \\"Only those who have learned some lessons can serve. You may learn ten year's lessons in one year, or you may take twenty or thirty years to learn one year's lessons. ANY DELAY IN LEARNING MEANS A DELAY IN SERVING. If God has put a desire in your heart to serve Him, you should understand what is involved. The way of service lies in brokenness and is connected with your accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The measure of your service is determined by the depth of discipline and brokenness.\\"I don't know about you... but I would like to learn ten year's lessons in one year. If I must be broken and crushed to be used greatly by the Lord for his glory... then so be it. Christ was bruised and crushed for me. It's the least I can do for him.This book is Watchman Nee at his best! I will read this book numerous times throughout my life. I recommend reading \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" for an even further understanding of the true Christian life. May Christ's church be broken for the release of the Spirit!"},{"Title":"The Release of the Spirit","review":"I can honestly say that Watchman Nee's book actually changed the way that I think. My life suddenly took on a new perspective, and I saw with clarity the state of many in the Church today. There is so much hurt, bitterness, and reclusiveness among believers, that it is hard to see any whole Church today. But when we realize that God is trying to work out His purpose in us, our focus turns upward, instead of inward. I think that the Church today is in desperate need of an understanding of biblical brokenness and sacrifice. We are in sad shape, when the normal experience of the early church has become the abnormal and extreme experience today.

For parents who need to retake charge of their children, he suggests a three-point focus based on \`\`rule-based discipline, supervision and emotional attachment.'' Offering sound, practical advice on dealing with provocative and manipulative verbal challenges raised by teenagers and early adolescents, he presents a convincing case for giving highly detailed \`\`job descriptions'' to teens (if McDonald's has a 600-page operations manual for its employees, parents shouldn't shy from explaining precisely how to take out the garbage). Bodenhamer directly faces such incendiary issues as sex, substance abuse and peer pressure (including that from gangs). Frequently, however, he sounds a reactionary note, as when he rails against the American Civil Liberties Union as the nation's \`\`most persistent enemy of adult authority'' and cites \`\`an inherited link between impulsive and immature unwed teenager parents and the impulsive and immature children to whom they give birth.''

He presents a step by step plan to deal with disrespectful and uncooperative kids. He, nevertheless, glosses over what some other authors have presented in their works and portrays their approach as not realistic. He states that Rudolf Dreikurs, Dinkmeyer and McKay suggest parents ignore many behaviors that are annoying or even dangerous. He purposely, it seems, does not provide the reader with the full story of the approaches that Adlerian's like Dreikurs, Dinkmeyer and McKay really present. They do not simply suggest that ignoring behaviors will work in all circumstances. They provide additional techniques to take an active approach to such misbehaviors. Bodenhamer just glosses over the entire theory these other authors tell to justify his approach. While his ideas do apply to children whose behavior is chronically disruptive, even his approach of simply staing your rules and insisting the child obey is not terribly efficacious without some sort of relationship and effective communication skills."},{"Title":"Parent in Control: Restore Order in Your Home and Create a Loving Relationship with Your Adolescent","review":"I have worked with family behavior problems for over 20 years.

The author hiked naked over a thousand miles after he ripped a hole in the back of the Indian tent where he was being held captive, attacked, killed and ate a badger with his bare hands, and was generally the toughest, meanest SOB I've ever encountered.

He records what went on at that time. These couple of chapters are a fascinating read. Then in the early 1840's, he came out with the Oregon Trail emigrants. He was a very observant individual, describing not only the climate, but also geology, flora, fauna, agriculture, etc. along the way. There was a section in the book where he talks about &quot;time and space&quot; which really surprised me about how deep a thinker the man was...he was very intelligent, also writting poetry and prose.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Blood, Sweat, and Mahjong -","review":"Ellen Oxfeld's study of the Chinese Hakka community that lives outside of Calcutta in the Dhapa district is a truly insightful and fascinating account of a little-known ethnic enclave. Members of the Hakka community primarily work as leather tanners, but also as beauticians. Immigrants to Calcutta from other Chinese communities work as dentists, restaurant owners, and shoe store owners. The common and fascinating thread between all of these professions is that they are viewed as impure since they deal with human and animal waste, and hence professions in which Hindus cannot participate. These communities are also fascinating because of their motivations for emigrating from their homelands; even though India does not traditionally appeal to immigrants the way the United States does, Calcutta provides unique opportunities for enterprise and has been home to Jewish, Armenian, and other communities throughout its history.As a young girl who used to frequent Calcutta, I was always fascinated by the Chinese beauticians and shoe-store owners that I would see in my daily activities. Oxfeld's book is invaluable in offering concrete data not only about the history of the Hakka community in Calcutta and Toronto, but also in providing an analysis of leather-working, immigration, and maintaining one's ethnic identity in a foreign land.A truly fascinating account of one of the world's most mysterious enclave communities, Oxfeld's book provides ethnographers, anthropologists, and lay-people a multi-layered analysis that is both well-written and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Mishak makhur (Hebrew Edition)","review":"Ram Oren certainly has a knack of defining what's on the Israeli society's mind, but unfortunately he does this by taking the lowest possible denominator to write his books."},{"Title":"Maritime Supremacy & the Opening of the Western Mind: Naval Campaigns That Shaped the Modern World","review":"Peter Padfield's latest work, Maritime Supremacy and The Opening of the Western Mind is unlike many traditional naval histories, and is indicative of the innovative writing style of this accomplished author. While this work builds on many of his earlier books, in particular Guns at Sea, Tide of Empires, Rule Britannia, and Armada, Padfield has made the leap - quiet successfully - of merging the importance of naval and maritime topics with the larger picture of Western Civilization and the development of societies.As its subtitle denotes, Maritime Supremacy examines the major naval campaigns that shaped the modern world. From the defeat of the of the Spanish Armada in 1588, to Beachy Head in 1690, to the Battle of the Saints in 1782, these are only some of the key battles that Padfield focuses on. Additionally he includes chapters that relate to the rise and fall of the key maritime nation states, including Spain, the Netherlands, England, and finally the United States.What separates the author from his contemporaries is his ability to examine the clash of fleets and incorporate their successes, or defeats, into the larger scheme of history. He identifies nation-states as either supreme maritime or territorial powers and it is this interaction, both domestically and internationally that provides the structure for his thesis and according to him, for modern history. The book builds extensively on his two volume Tide of Empires: Decisive Naval Campaigns in the Rise of the West, but unlike this earlier work, which is nearly twenty years old, it incorporates many new historiographical sources, while still utilizing primary resources for much of his information.The greatest drawback to Maritime Supremacy is its focus on a rather narrow time frame. While it spans nearly two hundred years, it leaves the reader questioning what other maritime influences have impacted on civilization. Also, the lack of an independent conclusion, to tie together many of the key points addressed in his earlier chapters, would have benefited the reader. Overall, Peter Padfield's Maritime Supremacy and The Opening of The Western Mind is an ideal selection for both historians and the general reading audience seeking information on the role of sea in the dawn of modern history. What the reader comes to realizes is that changes in society, politics, trade, and naval capabilities are not independent events, but forces in the development of civilizations."},{"Title":"Maritime Supremacy & the Opening of the Western Mind: Naval Campaigns That Shaped the Modern World","review":"A somewhat casual reader of non-fiction, though no stranger to history or economics, my knowledge of Naval History was extremely limited. I read Padfield's description of Philip's preparations for the Armada with newfound appreciation for the historian's insights. Padfield has the rare talent of writing in a manner that brings character and personality to the individual actors involved. His descriptions of events leading to, and battles of the Armada, Quiberon Bay and Chesapeake ... are all riveting. It reinforces how preparation and decisions of individuals truly shape history. These history lessons I didn't learn in school have helped provide a greater understanding of forces guiding the decision making of the leaders of the Western World during the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. It certainly leaves the reader with an appreciation for the impact of Naval power.The book is a gripping and compelling read that is pure fun. I've read it through twice and several chapters many times. I believe it can be appreciated, and reward the reader equally by chapter or in completion."},{"Title":"Maritime Supremacy & the Opening of the Western Mind: Naval Campaigns That Shaped the Modern World","review":"\\"Maritime Supremacy And The Opening Of The Western Mind\\" is a book that fails, although it fails for a \\"noble\\" reason: the author is overly ambitious. Mr. Padfield didn't want to write just a political/social history of the maritime powers and he didn't want to write just a naval history, either. He wanted to combine the two types of history. He also wanted to compare and contrast the maritime powers and the continental powers. Although there is certainly nothing wrong with this idea, the execution, in this case, is poor. Rather than weaving all the material together, the author alternates chapters on naval campaigns with chapters on political/social developments in Spain, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Colonial America. This \\"alternating current\\" constantly disrupts the flow of the book: just as you have settled down to concentrate on a sea battle, the author switches to a chapter on political infighting or government financing. The problem also develops the other way around: just when you've gotten your mind set on concentrating on Lord North or William Pitt or tax-farming in pre-Revolutionary France, it's time to read about broadsides and officers pacing the decks of ships, shoe buckle deep in blood. As a result, the reader feels disconcerted: you are never comfortable and you can never get \\"caught-up\\" in the narrative. Another problem with the book is that, considering what the author wants to accomplish, it is too short. The author tries to cover approximately ten naval campaigns, while also trying to explain political/economic/social developments in five different geographical areas, covering a span of 200 years. This is just too much material to cover in less than 300 pages. The specialist reader is likely to come away feeling he or she hasn't learned anything new- as everything is presented in such broad strokes. The general reader will likely be confused by the pace and the amount of information. In trying to do too much, the book accomplishes too little. Perhaps the best that can be said of this book is that, for the non-specialist reader, it may open your eyes to a particular naval campaign or to political/economic/social developments in a particular country. For example, the chapter on the Spanish Armada might lead you to read a more comprehensive book on the topic, such as David Howarth's \\"The Voyage Of The Armada\\" or the chapter on the Dutch Golden Age could lead you to Simon Schama's wonderful \\"The Embarrassment Of Riches\\". However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to read this book, which is why I have given it only two stars."},{"Title":"Always merry and bright: The life of Henry Miller : an unauthorized biography","review":"I have been a fan of Henry Miller since the early 1960's, when to read his banned work meant trekking up to the Treasure Room of Columbia University's library and having the book delivered to your carrel, a la the research scene in Citizen Kane. When Jay Martin's bio of Henry was published in 1978 I read it immediately with great pleasure. On Henry's birth centenary in 1991 two more biographies came out, which I read, and I'm writing to say Martin's is the best. Incidentally, in June 2002 while driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles on a little tour, in Big Sur I passed a Henry Miller institute/library, and did a u-turn after a few seconds of realization that this was probably my last chance to pay homage. What a throwback to the '60's (which, btw, I don't think Henry was a fan of.) Anyway, I recommend the pilgrimage for all of Henry's fans."},{"Title":"Always merry and bright: The life of Henry Miller : an unauthorized biography","review":"This was the first major biography of this great writer. Unfortunately, Miller felt it was so poor that he tried to block its publication and it stands as an UNAUTHORIZED biography. Those who are deeply familiar with Miller's later writings already know this. I suffered through it and can understand his point of view: it represents everything that Miller objected to in writing: the dry academic tone, the lifelessness of prose, the net effect of taking the magic out of his extraordinary life and making it sound boring, and paraphrasing the biographical material from Miller's own writings with some additional, mostly non-essential details. I remember how disappointed I was when I was unable to find something as basic as his parent's birth dates.In short, Miller was indeed important enough to be written about as a major literary figure, but not in such a dry academic tone that appears to completely miss the point of Miller's life: joy, aliveness, creativity and acceptance. I think it's important to illuminate Miller's character without pulling the wings off the butterfly."},{"Title":"Pages: Innovative Bookmaking Techniques","review":"I met this author at a book signing for our arts group.

The typographical errors in the book were distracting; the author/artist deserved better. However, if you've worried that you're not smart or talented enough to make your own books, or if you're wanting to introduce a budding artist to Book Arts, then by all means, this could be the book for you. It is by far better than the first book I ever bought on the subject -- but it wasn't a good use of money for me at this point."},{"Title":"Pages: Innovative Bookmaking Techniques","review":"This is a wonderful beginner's book for anyone who wants to start making &amp; decorating their own books or albums. The projects are simple &amp; the instructions are easy to follow. The type is large and all illustrations are in full color.The book starts out with a brief history of bookmaking. It then covers basic parts of a book. Papers, brushes and other material are then discussed in detail. A section on book themes helps focus your goals.Actual book construction is next. You learn to build a scroll, photo album, portfolio and a wide variety of folded books. Making a bound book with many different binding pattern options is also demonstrated.Finally, many creative paper enhancing techniques are shown. Some include stamping, embossing, spraying, sewing &amp; marbling. Several templates, a resource directory and an artists showcase are nice bonuses."},{"Title":"Pages: Innovative Bookmaking Techniques","review":"Very Inspiring! I've been making handmade books for five years and I found some clever ideas in this book. Neat bindings configurations.

I did so in order to be exempted from the big and little catechism and in order not, once grown to five-foot-eight adulthood, to be driven by this man [Matzerath] who face to face with his shaving mirror called himself my father, into a business, the grocery business, which as Matzerath saw it, would, when Oskar turned twenty-one, become his grownup world. To avoid playing the cash register I clung to my drum and from my third birthday on refused to grow by so much as a finger's breadth. I remained the precocious three-year-old, towered over by grownups but superior to all grownups, who refused to measure his shadow with theirs, who was complete both inside and outside, while they, to the very brink of the grave, were condemned to worry their heads about \\"development,\\" who had only to confirm what they were compelled to gain by hard and often painful experience, and who had no need to change his shoe and trouser size year after year just to prove that something was growing.\\"Moving about the fallible mind of the ADD/Aspergers/Legally insane mind of Oskar who moves you in and out and around his never exhausted mind. At times the introspection is almost unparalleled - reminding me often of the long and great passages provided by Joyce inUlysses. At other times, the rantings are as immature as Oskar's stature - great and beautifully contrasted to the higher and much more mature thoughts of Oskar. As Oskar gives us his opinion on most any topic that his hopping about mind conjures in hiccup fashion, we learn that his opinions, like most anyone's, are personal and strong - but not damning. He is a nice over-opinionated midget.At other times, the author brings us to the land of literature for Germanic or other European youth. Not all is pretty. Like Brothers Grimm, we have passages dealing with the wretching mother who dies of a bulimic-like death of malnutrition. All caused by her seeing a long and grotesque eel pulled out of the head of a horse lifted from the ocean on a fishing line . . . yuk. I never ate eel before and think this passage may have ended that venture for life. Elsewhere a purported father is slaughtered before the imp by machine gun fire. Another time, Oskar sees nuns hurt. And more. If you like these childhood nightmarish scenes, I recommendThe Painted Bird.Literary masters have proclaimed the story is allegory where political consciousness against the humbling defeat (if not devastation) provided by the Nazi regime, intermixed with the playful and not assuredly sane protagonist, one can simplify the strong statements as being less about Germany and more about larger issues\\" e.g. art vs war. No matter how one reads these paradoxes, they are good food for thought. And, although discussion of Hitler and the War exist in this novel, Oskar is a peripheral spectator. Like a three foot midget, he stands on the sideline largely unnoticed.Many of the statements, and many of the visions of Oskar are seemingly impressionism's literary form. Animal heads with eels jumping out of the waters - does it not remind you of a Dali topic. Wretching to death, shot to death by postal worker (before going postal was a term of art) with bureaucratic efficiency, and more can only be deemed impressionism's realism.The great story has impacted others. A short man who works with stone (at one time Oskar cuts grave stones) seems to have influence Irving's little man who grew up in stone cutting - The little Exonian eponymously creatingA Prayer for Owen Meany. FromUlyssesto Tin Drum toA Prayer for Owen Meany- a great assignment for anyone."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This was one of the big German novels of the 20th century, in a class with Alexanderplatz, or Zauberberg, or Radetzkymarsch, or Prozess. When it came out it was a sensation, mostly for its unusual openness about all kinds of things that were considered taboo or \`in bad taste'. The 50s in Germany were a time of odd prudishness, especially when compared to the 20s. Of course the 12 years from 33 to 45 had shifted all values and perceptions.Published in 1959, Blechtrommel covers roughly the period from the beginning until the middle of the century, with most of it set in the second quarter century.Its big subject is Germany and its relations with Poland. For that purpose it is ideally located in Danzig/Gdansk, a Baltic Sea port that changed its nationality a few times: it has been German, it has been a \`free city', and it has been and is Polish. This kind of shifts and changes always comes with trouble between the involved ethnic groups. And trouble there was plenty.On a micro level, we have the story of Oskar, the tin drummer, as told by the man himself. Born in the 20s, he is an early developer, intellectually mature at birth, and quickly able to decide that his \`father' is not his real father, and that he dislikes his petit bourgeois milieu so strongly that he stops growing by an act of willpower at the age of 3. Oskar is a dwarf with an intellectual mind. His father is a Nazi and Oskar is a miniature \`inner emigrant'. His real father, he thinks, is his mother's Polish cousin. He rejects the term resistance for the minor disturbances that he causes. His first skill is drumming, and he can upset any public music by imposing a waltz on a march etc. His second skill is: he can destroy glass by his voice, and he uses that for all kinds of mischief.Grass has been called one of the fathers of \`magical realism'. However, for all its imagination, I have to admit that I find the writing disappointingly dry. Grass is no magician with the German language. I am not sure, of course, how his translators handle him. I re-read the tin drum now with a sense of curiosity but little enchantment.Grass has been politically active, supporting the Social Democrats since Willy Brandt's time in the 60s/70s, but more or less splitting off since the reunification. He argued against that. His status as a moral authority has been somewhat diminished after he outed himself rather late in his life as a former Waffen SS volunteer. Had he not kept that secret for decades, his image might not have been damaged by it. It has nothing to do with the quality of the book, of course."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I read Ralph Manheim's translation which seemed excellent to me but I've heard great things about Breon Mitchell's translation so the next time I read this, for this needs to be read a few times to do any justice to the work, it will be Breon Mitchell's translation. I heard Gunter Grass on a BBC podcast saying that the newer translation is more complete."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I'm surprised Everyman's Library hasn't yet published The Danzig Trilogy in one volume, as it has done with other noted series. However, The Tin Drum does stand alone and is far and away the best book of the three. It is a marvelous display of Grass' highly visual evocations as well as a stunning parable on the impact of the War on a child who refused to grow old. With Grass' latest revelations, one is tempted to re-examine his novels and memoirs, but as a creative artist, his stature is not compromised.The story follows a boy who with the aid of his drum tries to make sense of the crumbling world around him. Grass straddles the German/Polish divide as he did in most his novels and stories, Danzig being his birthplace. Young Oskar seeks comfort wherever he can find it, such as under his grandmother's layers of heavy skirts, until he finds a way to hold onto his youth in a tin drum he receives for his birthday.While The Tin Drum has been connected to the genre of magical realism, it is not so much a fantastical journey as it is a form of escapism. Oskar is eventually forced to come to terms with his deferred adulthood in the final section of the novel, which offers an afterward to World War II. However, Gunter Grass hasn't seemed to reconcile his own past yet.The novel has been made into a movie by Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff, but it leaves out this afterward. The other novels in the series, Cat and Mouse and The Dog Years, take on different themes."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The tin drum is a great book to read. The description is poetic ad you'll find some chapters written in a very captivating rhythmic style. The story is very different and untraditional and you'll never expect the course on which events take place, the reasons behind them , and Oskar's subtle power. It would be useful to read \\"Cat and Mouse\\" and \\"The Dog years\\" after this book."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum had been on my \\"to read\\" list for the last few years. This does not mean that I was actually looking forward to reading it, rather that I felt it important to do so. I finally bit the bullet and picked it up. I have to say that I was strangely satisfied with the read. Grass really captures the duality of the characters and the \\"nations\\" that exist. In addition, memory and a refusal to move forward with time (both personally and as a society) are captured perfectly. Definitions of countries and ethnicities are shown for what they are, transient notions changing with time. Who is a German and who is a Pole and who is Jewish? What is a nation and what is does it mean to be nationalistic? Likewise, the idiocy of war and its impact on society are illustrated with a brilliance seldom seen. That being said, the novel did plod along and was tedious at times. However, the scene with the horse head makes even the slower parts worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I read Tin Drum in Spanish. I agree he's not a conventional person, but i was not expecting someone 'normal' to be the center of the story.I read it in spanish, and i have to say, even if the translator did a wonderful job, the book survives. The essence is quite illustrative, and some of the metaphors i loved very much ( Niobe, Ulla and Maria, when he met her ). So i think it would be unfair to say it is a bad book.I also agree that you are at your own risk if you expect something conventional."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This is one of that amazing books you'll never get tired reading. The not so incredible history of Oskar Matzerath is well marked in a real world where people is not good or evil at all, they are only people in his time and circumstances, nor heroes neither villaines."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This novel deserves its reputation as a landmark work. It is innovative, amusing, haunting, musical and with an impressive storyline. There is a constant shift in the narration between the first- and third-person. In an essay Grass wrote, he says that sometimes Oskar wants to talk and sometimes not. Many readers seem to get carried away with the \\"commentary on wartime Germany\\" but the real beauty lies within the prose and style. The initial setting is in an asylum and there one meets several important characters. The story is almost entirely a flashback, beginning with potato fields and the Polish region of Kashubia. The grandmother and her many skirts are memorable and some implied unusual sexual situations do keep the reader's attention. The card game skat seems to constantly come up. Indeed, this is a connection between the characters in several parts, including one in which a post office is being bombed and one player's life is ending. A scene with eels is at once revolting and arousing, with a woman accompanied by her husband, her lover and an eeler with a horsehead. Grass' skill with words is what sets the book apart. An entire chapter deals with a cat named Bismark and each paragraph begins by repeating the same phrase. This technique creates a rhythm that brings the reader sliding along. Rushdie's Midnight's Children makes use of this in chapters on snakes and ladders and saffron and green. Oskar's musical talent affects many things and eventually leads to the formation of a jazz band. This turns up in the Dog Years. His relations with his sitter who becomes his father's squeeze add another intriguing sexual aspect that is unexpected but extremely well expressed in terms of fizz powder and drum sticks. This type of thing happens often with Grass. The end returns to the asylum. The last few scenes of the novel are quite perplexing and still leave me wondering if I have followed Gunter completely. This is his first major book and later works seem to wrap up much better. This is an impressive work, in every way. One should continue with Cat and Mouse and the Dog Years. Apparently, there is more to be enjoyed when read in German, as the Kashubian dialect adds a wonderfully musical quality to the story. The translation is excellent, in my view and I would recommend this to any serious reader."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I own and have read this book many times. Just as one may freeze-frame sections of great films (Bergman, Eisenstein) and see clear evidence of genius, I am able to do so with passages from this book. The style is visionary/ahead of its time, yet so intensely influenced by it. So, even if some of you couldn't finish it for whatever reason(Do you find TV a better option?)surely you were able recognize its outstanding qualities.I am constantly awed by works such as \\"The Tin Drum\\". (ditto for \\"Lolita\\") I know of no contemporary work that surpasses this book (although there are some equally talented authors such as Amis and Self). I would be very curious to hear what nay-sayers hold superior. Are you simply too accustomed to easy, plot driven works that read like scripts? For instance, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" should make a fine film, but it is not great literature. If you disagree, compare random passages between it and a classic like The Tin Drum, and see for yourself.It's like comparing Jack Daniels with Lagavulin or Vosne Romanee with Yellowtail. Keep tasting and you'll develop better tastebuds. I think you will enjoy the process, too!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I came to The Tin Drum by way of John Irving's book &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany.&quot; This means I spent a great deal of time reading The Tin Drum with amusement on my lips as I could see many many obvious parallels between the two stories. Clearly, Irving was paying homage to Grass.But, what of The Tin Drum itself? Simply, a fanastic book. It was fantastic is the sense of excellent. But, also, in the sense of eccentic and grotesque. The Tin Drum is all of these. A great book."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Long, massive, exhaustive narrative of the life of Oscar Matzerath, an eccentric boy who at the age of 3 decides he will no longer grow and &quot;drums&quot; his feelings and passions by means of a drum. He is not a normal character, but rather a means through with G.Grass, using extensive obscure symbolism, repulsive fantasies, surrealism and metaphors, expresses the horrors of German/Polish society during the reign of nasism. O.Matzerath in fact is bizare, absurd, grotesque, and disturbing. G.Grass is a master of skilful prose revealing the poet writer as well, in a baroque/rococo style which intoxicates the reader. The book is not pleasant reading, with schoking passages. Deceptive in terms of expectations for a Nobel Prize winner. If you are willing to endure the challenge of reading &quot;The Tin Drum,&quot; take your chance!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"THE TIN DRUM is an absorbing look at the WW2 era from a different perspective than mass market popular stuff like THE READER or THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. It is hard to describe the appeal of the novel, it is rather unique in style and theme, you'll have to read it for yourself to really understand what I am getting at. I thought it was GREAT, only a flaw or two here and there --of minor importance-- kept me from praising it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"What a novel is these. Perhaps the greatest of all since Das Kapital"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I love world literature. As much as I can, I try to broaden my literary horizons and explore literature that isn't completely well-known in the Western world (esp. those by the most arcane authors that I wish were more recognized!). I have read many so far by Halldor Laxness and other authors of world literature, many which I truly love and will always have a special place in my heart. Of course I don't expect every novel to be this way, regardless if it's a classic or not a classic. At the end it's about what I get from it. The Tin Drum, for me, is the most intriguing, interesting, and unique novel that I've ever read. But it's also the most frustrating and pointless book I've read as well. I'm ambivalent. I like the book for its very original character, Oskar, an \\"eternal three year old,\\" and some vivid scenes and chapters that were heartbreaking, if not just downright bizarre (such as the horse's head filled with eels, Oskar's mother's strange suicidal attempt, etc). Also, I give Gunter Grass a lot of credit for writing a novel that takes place during Nazi Germany without having the Nazis and actual events during WWII become the primary focus of the character's psyche (in fact, because of the character's childlike and caustic narration of the events that happened, at times you kind of forget that there's a WWII!). Without a doubt, this is an original piece of work that definitely deserved all of its accolades, and yes, it's a classic. However, I feel that this is the kind of book that leaves you scratching your head. It's not a horrible novel, it's well-written, and the characters are realistic and likeable. But yet, you can't help but feel that this book is a bit pretentious (does it necessarily need to be nearly 600 pages?), some chapters aren't worth reading and feel more like filler (you can skip over some and still understand what's going on), and the character becomes a bit redundant. Yeah yeah i know, the main character is in a mental institution, and yes, he's insane, but how many times must he emphasize the significance of his tin drum? This is just my opinion of the book, some people seem to love it, and the reasons why they do are very clear. But as I said before, regardless if you are an avid reader of world literature or just a casual reader, this book is not for everyone. You either love it or you don't. Some scenes I enjoyed, and I was touched by some of the character's inner thoughts, but it's not enough for me to praise this book as some people have. Sorry, but I just didn't like it."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum is a book that shows a comical perspective on situations faced by Oskar Matzerath. This character allowed himself to live in a true reality, he does so by sacrificing a life style which in general was lived by most everybody in his own country. Oskar withholds from the temptations and goes on living through his eyes and teaches us about the rules of the world."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I just don't get the (cult?) following of this book. I read it and barely finished it. In the last couple of years there are only two books I have begun and not finished--Absolom, Absolom, Faulkner, and Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon. T.D. doesn't shoot for the rarefied heights of either. Instead Grass tries to make believable the story of a tin drum playing German guy who willfully keeps himself from growing at age 3 and remains a midget until--of course! A traumatic event occurs and he grows again! &quot;Life goes on&quot; in Germany, even during WW2. Is this a surprise or a statement about the &quot;universal human condition?&quot; There are a few excellent sections of the book. I particularly enjoyed &quot;the eel&quot; section. If you read it already you know of what I write. In the wake of books like John Irving's &quot;Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; of Katherine Dunn's &quot;Geek Love&quot;, this book, having been published long before, was influential. But they both do the unbelievable-believable thing better than Grass. The book isn't terrible, but don't waste your time..."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum is a wonderful novel, full of incredible scenes and characters. In my mind it towers over much of the &quot;literature&quot; produced today. There is something of the aura of 'genius' about this book-- it is wholly original, yet a product which represents it's era, like a 'Moby-Dick,' 'Frankenstein,' or 'Lolita.' Which is to say it's an entertaining book with many layers of meaning."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Gunther Grass' classic novel which is *ahem* NOT about a prisoner in a concentration camp is by all means one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Anyone who disagrees with this statement is wrong and that's that. After all that is settled, we can conclude that one cannot say anything bad about the actual book, but we can make more criticisms of the translation. However, the translation is beautiful, so let's clear some things up about the book.Grass's portrayal of Germany during the rise and fall of the Third Reich is probably the most original take on the subject one can easily find. This is because the entire story is told through the eyes of a man who can never progress past the age of 3. He is also quite possibly insane. Taking these considerations into account, one cannot say that this book is worse because it is &quot;unrealistic&quot; or &quot;too far fetched&quot;. If there is nothing abnormal about a situation, what kind of a story would it make? (my apologies to all you Jane Austen and/or Seinfeld fans) Read this book for an experience you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum is easily the most inventive book I've ever read.

A rare accord."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Here I go, about to be branded a low-brow. . .OK, so Oskar is insane and just about everybody else in the novel is also insane. Oskar lives through an insane time, etc., etc. But why did this book have to be so bloody long? About a third could be excised with no ill effects.I almost always finish the books I begin, however ill-advised. This one was a serious trial. I read part of it (Everyman's edition), but most of it I listened to on cassette (Recorded Books) while driving. Were it not for the excellent reading by George Guidall, I would have certainly given up on this over-rated stuff.I will say that the latter parts of the book, dealing with the post-war years had some bits that were really hysterical -- or maybe that's how Guidall the reader made them sound. Nevertheless, the tone of the novel seems to change to almost a parody or a satire, which I frankly missed in the earlier parts of the book. If it was there, it wasn't humorous to me. The postwar Oskar is laugh-out-loud funny at parts.Can people have the freedom NOT to like this book? Its reputation is secure, deemed a modern classic. But is that fair? What about people like me, who are annoyed by it, who find it to be an exercise in self-indulgence by the author? Must we be consigned to the pit of ill-educated, unhip, Tom Clancy readers?"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"It is usually said that this book is one of the masterpieces of the twentieth century,but allow me to disagree.The Tin Drum is entertaining and well written and the author strongly wants to impress and even shock his readers.It's a book about a very dark period of european history,maybe the darkest of all,but Grass doesn't want to plainly describe the atrocities of Second World War and the poverty of the subsequent period.He wants to give us a metaphorical fairytale,full of meanings that should stay longer in mind than the usual description of nazis and lagers,he wants to give us the full idea of caos,in which nothing can be judged too easily.Maybe he's a bit too ambitious,because he risks to miss something.The habit of repetition,of focusing on the mighty features of Oskar's extraordinary life can end up being boring,or also irritating.Even if the description of the four skirts of the grandmother Anna is really beautiful.In the end,sorry for my bad english!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I see that I agree with many of the reviewers here. I read the book years ago and it had a profound effect on my life and my writing. I'm listening to it on audio this time - Recorded Books, Inc. and it's brilliant.

Butthen, so does the Bible repeat and lag here and there.The effort is so passionate and creative, however, that itis worth the trip. He gave us gift."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Overall, The Tin Drum seemed to be a drawn-out laborious journey for me. I've always heard so much about the merits of The Drum, perhaps I was expecting too much from it? The first three or four chapters had me thoroughly absorbed in Oskar's ancestry, and for the rest of the book I kept waiting for someone as interesting and human as his grandmother Anna to show up, but I was to be disappointed. Granted, Oskar's mother Agnes is another consistent and great character, but besides these two... oyvay! Oskar was such an unreal personage that I found him impossible to trust as a narrator... with every beat of his drum he startled the already frightened theme of this book into a corner. I never found that corner. If you enjoy authors who tend to dive in and out of the &quot;fantastic&quot; and the &quot;real&quot; I would recommend you go to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hermann Hesse, or Charles Williams, but for goodness sakes... &quot;keep off the Grass.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"i got through it just a few hours ago.. took more than 3 days, and let me tell you.. these 15 year old had a hard time. i tried to look for symbolism but couldnt find any.. even with the witch (black as pitch)... wondering also how the german version of that song would rhyme as well (made up probably). someone help me! i just dont see it.. all i see is a story and i perceive it only as a story about a boy who grows up in germany around the existance of nazism and WWII... his struggles with many frequent deaths of friends and family.. does that say anything... i have to think about it.. read this book if you intellectual type otherwise put it off till you gain more knowledge of the history of germany and the nazis which i have... but still have no idea..

Now, having said I liked it, it took me a long time to finish this. It's LONG, and after awhile, I found I was reading this because I was honor bound to finish it as opposed to picking it up with enthusiasm. Not that I disliked it, just it wore down. It's very well structured until toward the end, and I don't know if it was symbolic of something, but it seemed to self-destruct, a lot of things start to repeat, the linear process is starting to come apart, and the over detailed life events were just described in passing. I recommend this book for people who like literature, not just reading."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I must recognize that since G&uuml;nter Grass obtained the Nobel prize, I approached to this book with some skepticism, based in the fact that the author was a refugee, or maybe a child that lost his town in a war, made me think it was a political award (the feeling I have with the current Nobel prize - I mean that I have the same prejudice about him, not that I know it was a polite award. I just have not read any of his books).Well, this book was one of the best surprises in my whole life. Grass manages the most brutal situations from a totally new point of view. The mixture of humor, sadness, nostalgia, perversity, pessimism and sometimes even optimism are utterly brilliant.I think that most of the readers that attack this book is the same group that attacks Ulysses and similar great books. I think they all are missing the point. This is a mixture of Don Quixote, magic, historic novel, epic and black humor, in a whole new form, at least at that master level, where human situation and sometimes the whole concept of an objective reality is put in question, and also a great part of all of the feelingsThis book is totally a masterwork of XX century. You will never forget it."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Long, massive, exhaustive narrative of the life of Oscar Matzerath, an eccentric boy who at the age of 3 decides he will no longer grow and &quot;drums&quot; his feelings and passions by means of a drum. He is not a normal character, but rather a means through which G.Grass, using extensive obscure symbolism, repulsive fantasies, surrealism and metaphors, expresses the horrors of German/Polish society during the reign of nazism. O.Matzerath in fact is bizare, absurd, grotesque, and disturbing. G.Grass is a master of skilful prose revealing the poet writer as well, in a baroque/rococo style which intoxicates the reader. The book is not pleasant reading, with schoking passages. Deceptive in terms of expectations for a Nobel Prize winner. If you are willing to endure the challenge of reading &quot;The Tin Drum,&quot; take your chance!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Gunter Grass' \\"The Tin Drum\\" is one of modern fiction's most difficult yet enjoyable novels. It is written in a way that forces you to read it slowly; this is not a book you could or would want to rush through. The protagonist Oscar is a symbol of everything and nothing, and his actions are true yet completely fabricated. The storyline is the work of an author working at the peak of his talents- you will not encounter more startling originality anywhere else. Oscar's world is not an easy one to understand, or like, or empathize with, but his adventures are written with such skill and beauty, the sense of humor is so thick, and the magic of the whole book so present, that at the end of the long journey you leave very satisfied. A must read for any fan of rich language and symbolism."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This has been on my \`must read, sometime' list for quite a while, not necessarily because it's a Noble winner, but actually because its written in the first person. Oscar, the narrator, starts us unsteadily with \`Granted: I am an inmate of a mental hospital', and goes on to describe an utterly fantastic (and now well-known) tale of a boy who decided to stop growing at three years of age. He gets a tin drum, which he uses as a proxy for most of his life, using it to describe his surroundings to himself, to explore new areas and to control his environment, his family and his emotions. The story is set (initially) in Danzig, a town in Germany with a Polish hinterland; the plot runs through the first half of the Twentieth Century, a time of enormous upheaval in Germany. The intermingling of Polish/German identities is nicely done through the novel, Oscar not being sure whether his real father is a German nationalist or a Polish nationalist; eventually he chooses the German nationality for the duration of the world wars, but uses his Polish backround to save himself at the end of the second. This much is pretty straight forward, I was left more puzzled at whether there were layers of analogies going on through the book - is the refusal to grow up a sign of a wider immaturity in German society? Is the drum a symbol of militarism? - Oscar discards it on the death of his German (Nazi) father,and starts to grow. If so is there a layered meaning to the glass-shattering, the eel-fishing trip which so disgusts Oscar's mother, or the dwarf-actors who reappear throughout the story, or the gravediggers work? The fact that the book is so famous, and \`literary' made me think there might be, however I wasn't deep enough to follow these unaided.If you can put these questions aside (or answer them), the book is quite a tale. The narrative is in the first person, which succeeds in the hugely difficult task of making the story interesting, but can be very authentic; occasionally Oscar slips into the third person when describing himself, however this has the effect (I think) of emphasizing his mental fragility and the unreliability of his descriptions - and lend some credibility to the great swings in his reported opinions. Nonetheless, he does come across as quite an odious character, willing to use his family and companions for his own ends -his betrayal of his \`gang' of hoodlums when they are caught for example.As you might expect, given the stories backround, there are many changes of scene and great swings between exhilaration, tragedy and farce. The characters are well drawn, and despite being an anti-hero, its possible to want to find out how Oscar progresses - especially as you are expecting him to end up in the mental hospital, but in the end you find that he is not there long, and may be released soon.. I found I was drawn into the suspending my disbelief at the basic implausibility's of the tale, and found the writing very enjoyable. I will read more of his work."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I was 7 Years old looking throught the Sunday Times when I came across a movie ad for &quot;The Tin Drum.&quot; Stareing at this scary looking kid I was curious as to what it was all about.Step ahead 20 years, I happen to see a copy of &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; so I bought it. and what I discovered was a novel of &quot;grotesque beauty.&quot; Mr. Grass Paints a portrait of Danzig Germany before and after the Third Reich, and he does it with tremendous skill. I have never read a book where the details of the grotesque made me shiver. I'm talking about the &quot;horse's head scene.&quot; Anyway, here we have Oscar, a boy who never grows in size, but his brain and intellect excells. I like to think Of Oscar as the fly on the wall. Grass uses a child someone who is the center of attention yet no one notices. I won't go into detail about the novel, I think enough reviews before me did that, but I hope that if you do read it you will look for those same nuances that I noticed. It is really a facinating work of fiction, very ahead of it's time. Just a warning...if you should rent the film, it will only go as far as the end of the War."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Grass' Tin Drum is brilliant,brutal, sardonic, cruel, and virulently grotesque, as was, indeed, the Germany for which Oskar is metaphor and persona-- peurile, pugnacious, egomaniacally mad. Grass' depiction of Nazi Germany as an insane asylum tenanted by a stunted, angry, inchoate child banging forever- but with martial fury-- on a dissonant tin drum is profound, disturbing and --as a New Berlin arises-- ominous."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have read (and I have read a few). It stands in my memory next to Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot;. No-one with some dicrimination can afford to ignore this book."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Why is it that people consider OSKAR the insane dwarf? As the book opens, we are treated to a dwarf in a mental institution, a famous jazz drummer, a sculpture, a nazi resister, and thru the pounding of his drum, the narrator-writer of this KUNSTLER ROMAN. Because GUNTER GRASS has many levels to present his hero-antihero to us, this study in contrasts. Is he an artist? Yeah, sure! But he's also an observer of a period of German history, which nearly ended western civilization with its brutality. Germany, the nation of Bach, Beethovan and Brahms, of Goethe, Schiller, of Durer, Grundewald, of philosophers and poets...what went wrong? This question lays at the heart of the novel, because when as OSKAR the crazy drawf starts to narrate, we are taken back in time to his birth, fully conscious, registering a 60 watt light bulb in his memory at birth. Yes, he's born fully aware and enlightened. Oskar is born as a symbol of GERMANY at its perfected, enlightened heights. Yet from the start, OSKAR is aware that this human condistion he's immersed in, is rank, sexually perverted, ugly, and repulsive. So, when he recieves a TIN DRUM on his 3rd birthday, he HALTS his development...physically. He becomes an eternal, perfect little boy, who will drum away against the hypocracy of his world. FIRST, from a dark, hidden, lower perspective, under his gramdma's skirts, or under the kitchen table observing the menaige a troi between his mother Agnes, her cousin Jan Bronski, and his \\"father\\" Alfred Matzerath. He tackles religious hypocracy in Danzig's cathredal, as he demains a statue of Baby Jesus to drum. Later Oskar climbs up the highest bell tower in Danzig, from which heights his VOICE breaks glass over all the city. (Was this an artistic reaction to the KRISTALNACHT riots?) He also fights the nazi hypocracy as a drummer, beating his drum \\"out of time\\" while hidden at a nazi raly, ruining the demonstration. So, this is from \\"street level\\", tho hidden. He's an artist who travels Europe with a troupe of dwarves entertaining the troups. Also, he has a secret love....his stepmother who Alfred married after Agnes eats herself to death via fish. Here is this perfect artist, fighting the arrival of Nazism, tho who fails. He also fails as a son, because he allowed his mother to die (survivers guilt), later his father to die, ultimately abandoning a child he fathered with his 'stepmother'. The first half of the book concerns this story arc, that of the perfect little 3 year old boy on the outside, who's a sexually mature 16 year old guy inside. Readers watch Oskar's unique \\"artistic development\\", walking to the beat of his OWN drum, refusing to \\"GROW UP\\". You dont get the feeling that OSKAR is crazy here, so much as he's a microcosm of Germany's pre-war \\"high\\" culture. Its only AFTER the end of WWII, when Oskay desides to grow again, just as he decided at age 3 to STOP, that you get the ugly, deformed dwarf. THis is GERMANY post war---ugly, deformed, with the high culture from its golden days seemingly behind it. Oskar leaves his beloved Danzig, and his Grandmother, and emigrates into BDR, to become a sculpter and musician.There are so many ways to enter into this book, to gain insights into Germany, its history, its people, its culture. NAturally its tempting to relate to OSKAR as a \\"real\\" person, but its obvious that he's a symbol for enlightened artists from the start. Grass offers his readers so much more, than the superficial events that transpire on the page. More than a novel ABOUT artistic development, its a novel about how Oskar (the everyman artist) LEARNS what society is all about. By tracing Oskar's development, his transformation into something ugly and deformed from what was once something unusual, artistic, and refined, we also trace GERMANY's fall. On top of this framework, rests a novel so rich in language, so unique in structure and symbolism, so philosophical, that it breaks so much new ground beyond the MODERN literary experiments preceding the work. But that doesnt hit you as you read, what hits you are the scenes which remain indeliable for a lifetime. The Fisherman on the Baltic Sea, reaching into a dead horse's head to pull out eels feasting on brain, eels which Alfred buys to feed to his wife. Or Oskar's grandfather hiding from the law under his grandmother's skirts. Or Oskar breaking the windows of Danzig with his voice, or the neighborhood kids who urinate into this \\"witches brew\\", forcing Oskar to drink it. After reading the book, it wouldndt be a bad idea to watch Schlondorff's Academy Award winning film (for best picture) of THE TIN DRUM. Or, to finish reading Grass's \\"Danzig trilogy\\", ie CAT AND MOUSE, and DOGYEARS. More than anything, I consider what Grass achieved thru this novel, in structure, symbolism, language and storytelling. I'd love to read it in German, however GRASS is challenging to read in English. If AMAZON will only offer the book in german thru KINDLE on this site, I could download the eBook, so I could check definitions via the kindle german-english dictionary. No matter HOW its read, just immerse your imagination in this world until you see DANZIG not thru OSKAR's eyes, but thru his DRUM BEAT. Then, you'll know the book's heart. \\"Bang bang bang\\", a drum beat is also the sound of gun fire. Oskar's creative world, is build on destuction. And German culture, and history, is built upon the ashes of wars and genocide. Maybe ALL history is like that. Grass, thru OSKAR,had something to tell us, it's this: \\"Better to go on as a deformed characture of what once was, than to give up completely.\\""},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"If you are a lover of great writing, read this book. If you enjoy books about a dwarf, read this book. If you enjoy ridiculous coming-of-age stories, read this book. If you can appreciate unorthodox techniques, read this book. It will be worth your time."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I have been meaning to read this book since it came out in 1959, but only did so now. My reason for delaying was that the reviews I had read of the book made it sound unappealing to me. Why did I want to read the unrealistic ramblings of an insane dwarf?Having been impressed with Mr. Grass's recent work, Crabwalk, I finally decided to give The Tin Drum a try. I'm glad I did. Let me explain why.In my studies of the Nazi era, I was always struck by comments that observers from that time made about how banal the evil of it all was. Yet much of the propaganda from that period (such as The Triumph of the Will) that we can see today makes the Nazis seem like mythic figures. What were the observers trying to say? I finally felt like I understood the point through reading The Tin Drum. Reading about distant battles while living in Germany before the bombing became great seems a lot like reading about attacks on coalition troops in Iraq now. Going to party meetings seems a lot like how people here go to lodge meetings now.In the first 100 pages, I kept wondering why Mr. Grass had chosen to write the novel in the form of an autobiography of an insane dwarf pretending to have a mental age of 3 who had been convicted of a murder he did not commit. Eventually, it hit me. He needed a narrator who could not be considered complicit in what the Nazis did, or we could not trust his voice. In addition, how can you portray banal evils as insane unless you see them through the eyes of an &quot;insane&quot; person who makes all too much sense? Once I accepted the brilliance (perhaps even the inevitability of his choice), I settled back and really began to enjoy the story. Then I began to realize that it is our childish instincts to want to control everything in our lives that leads to our separation from the richness that we can provide one another. So Mr. Grass was also sharing an important psychological point in choosing Oskar as his narrator.What made the book special for me was Mr. Grass's ability to continually show how our connections to one another are the potential for goodness, while our instincts to take advantage of one another are the evil we must overcome. Oskar Matzareth, the narrator, is a thinker . . . yet ultimately his point is that we must carefully examine what we think about. Otherwise, false ideas will lead to fatal consequences.I was very impressed by the way that the plot was constructed so that each time society acted in divided ways Oskar himself or someone close to him was harmed.What will stay with me the longest are the amazing descriptions of fictional people and events: His grandmother's skirts, the horse's head with the eels emerging from it, his &quot;father's&quot; death during the Soviet invasion, Jan Bronski's obsessive search for skat cards during the attack on the Polish post office and Oskar's reaction to the statue of Jesus coming to life will always be with me.I found myself wishing that I could read German like a native. The satirical humor is usually savage and quick to kill its object. I fully absorbed the lesson before the blood could even begin to emerge from the butt of the satire. As I read the book, I wondered how many times I missed compelling humor because it didn't translate well into English.At the end of the book, I found myself searching for a novel to compare The Tin Drum to . . . in order to help other readers decide if this book is for them. In the end I could find no one book. Instead, The Tin Drum can best be described as a combination of reverse sort of Gulliver's Travels, Candide and Don Quixote set in the context of German/Polish Danzig through the end of World War II and in West Germany thereafter. So there's a fundamental darkness to the book that is missing from the other three.I came away wondering how I can stay connected with others now while retaining the ability to see and act on the events around me as a detached, objective observer. Mr. Grass has raised quite a challenge for us all."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Western literature is full of what Germans call \\"bildungsroman\\", that is, the story of a young man's (or woman's)intellectual and emotional growth, often told from the main character's own voice. This kind of novel has adopted innumerable shapes and styles through history, and certainly this one is, so far for me, the strangest and one of the best.It is hard to summarize the plot, as it is mainly the diverse and extreme experiences of Oskar Matzerath's life. Born in 1924 in Danzig, itself a unique and troubled city, Oskar decides at age three not to grow up anymore. Or does he simply has an illness of the tyroid gland, as he hints at some point? It doesn't matter, precisely because that moment starts the style of the whole book: all the time, terrible things are happening to Oskar, to his family, to his city, to his nation and to his century, but we see everything only through the distorted glass of this unique character's view.First he tells us about his ancestors and the life they led in pre-war German Poland. Then we know the story of his parents, the infidelity of his mother and other disturbing and often sordid events. His community starts to fall apart as the Nazis rise to power. Then the Nazis come and destroy the city, phisically and spiritually. Oskar spends the whole war in Danzig as well as wandering through France and Belgium as part of a grotesque midget-troup&eacute;e. After the war, they flee Poland for D&uuml;sseldorf, where he is employed in very different jobs: as a tomb engraver, painters' model, jazz drum player. The chapter which describes the journey by train is simply horrible and scaring, as the chapter on his emotional disappointing is sad. The end is strange, confusing but full of hope.There is abundant abnormal sex, vomit, dirt, misery, but also struggle, success, and much love. Oskar is not always nice, but he remains loyal to those he loves, and that is a great strength of a character you sometimes hate, but in the end you come to love. The book is full of metaphors, obscure symbolisms, grotesque and sordid events, and, above all, the human misery of our century, especially in Europe. It is a bittersweet book, often repulsive, just because that is how life is. It has moments of joy, of glorious triumph, of utter defeat. It is very very sad, because it is the story of a distorted but extremely sane person in an equally destorted but horribly insane world, but it is also a book about the joy of life, about how we have to keep going on even in the midst of tragedy and misery. If it has a message, it should be: fight on.It is said that great works of literature depend on character development, not so much on the plot and the story itself. Well, this is a case in point. The whole book is sustained by the central character of Oskar, a wicked, depressed, desperate man seeing how his world crumbles apart and he has to build a life for himslef. As another reviewer aptly put it, he is the lonely voice crying in the wilderness. Oskar is a very solitary man with a great disadvantage, one that by sheer willpower he turns every time into an advantage, a means for surviving in a careless, cold world. Oskar never gives up, never surrenders, he finds a way to survive after every setback, and terrifying setbacks he experiences.I think this book had to be written in the form of magical realism, because the pure realism would have been insufferable: the tragedies that occur are beyond telling them.Not an easy read, it is most rewarding, for it paints a wide picture of the human experience, precisely what great literature is about."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Echoing the rise and fall of the Third Reich through the eyes of the Peter Pan like Oskar Matzerath, G&uuml;nter Grass' highly acclaimed novel, The Tin Drum paints a surreal and disturbing portrait of people in a time of great uncertainty. The story begins with Oskar's grandmother, Anna Koljaiczek, a woman who conceives Oskar's mother, Agnes, in a potato field encounter that can only be described as &quot;bizarre.&quot; Agnes, herself, grows into a woman out-of-the-ordinary and in time, forms the hypotenuse of a strange love triangle that encompasses two men who love her equally: her husband, Alfred Matzerath and Jan Bronski, the biological father of young Oskar. Oskar, himself, is, from the very beginning, an extraordinary child. Even as a fetus, he refuses to be born until Agnes entices him out of her womb with the promise of a tin drum on his third birthday.Oskar is born and Agnes keeps her promise. On the day he receives his red and white lacquered tin drum, Oskar makes a promise that rules his life for the next eighteen years: Observing the hypocritical nature of his German-Polish family, Oskar decides to stop growing and forever remain three years old. In an effort to accomplish this, he throws himself down the cellar stairs, an act that comes to haunt Alfred (he had left the door open). Oskar does manage to freeze himself in time and his tin drum becomes the symbol of his extreme youth as well as his weapon against adult intervention. It is when Alfred tries to take the drum away that Oskar discovers another unique talent: he can scream at such a high register that glass around the world shatters. At three years old, Oskar has learned the art of manipulation and control.At the time Oskar makes his decision not to grow, the Nazis are recognizing the politically strategic importance of the city of Danzig. Technically a Polish city since the end of World War I, the Germans begin to clamor for its return. Discord and disharmony erupt within Oskar's family. Alfred, a German, gravitates toward the SA while the Polish Jan, Agnes and Anna remain fiercely loyal to their Slavic homeland. Trouble is obviously brewing, yet the only &quot;ordinary&quot; resident of Danzig who seems to notice is Oskar. It is he who disrupts a Fascist rally with the overwhelming sound of his drum--an aural punishment able to drive anyone to the edge of insanity.The Tin Drum is an impressive, but complicated and complex book, as is the character of Oskar. Although Oskar and his tin drum are meant to represent childhood innocence, at times he can seem perverse, manipulative and downright malevolent. The problem is, Oskar beats his drum to literally anything and everything that upsets him, be it his mother's infidelity or the German invasion. Although we ultimately come to love him, there are times when we simply want to slap him in the face as well. Nevertheless, it is clear from the outset that the small Oskar Matzerath is the lone voice crying in the wilderness.Grass acknowledges and draws well from his Continental European intellectual history and influence, showing us the connections between Oskar and Dostoyevsky's Prince Mishkin, France's Napoleon, Goethe's Faust, Dickens' Tiny Tim and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Embracing the complexities of modern culture, Grass forms dichotomies, posing theses and antitheses. (Goethe and Rasputin, Man and Angel, Realism and Romanticism, Reason and Passion.) Wisely, he does not always find synthesis.The narrative structure of The Tin Drum, told as it is &quot;through the mouths of babes,&quot; allows Grass to distort an already-distorted reality, thereby seeing it &quot;face-to-face.&quot; Through Oskar, metonym for a maturing Germany, and through his &quot;childish ways,&quot; we see his innocence or ignorance not so much as a tool for evaluation, but rather as a looking glass through which we clearly view our century and western world. Although the extensive symbolism can be a little obscure at times, and Grass' prose is both surrealistic and baroque, The Tin Drum is definitely one of the masterpieces of the twentieth century and, as a condemnation of apathy it remains unsurpassed."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum is a crazy, anecdotal novel that chronicles the adventures of Oskar, who is a cross between Rumplestiltskin and Peter Pan. He identifies himself sometimes as Jesus, sometimes as Satan. At thirty, Oskar is an inmate of a mental hospital (as noted in the first sentence of the book) and is still pounding on the same model of drum he received when he was three. Through his perceptive eyes, we get an image of Germany in the 30s and 40s, its dissidents, its criminals, and its entertainers.Oskar is selective in what he tells us. For example, we know his alleged father can \\"turn feelings into soup\\", but we don't know his function in the Nazi party. We know about every nurse Oskar meets, but his encounters with the military are kept to a minimum. The pre and post-war situation is almost just a background, and Oskar rarely comes upfront and comments about the horror of the times. He expresses his feelings through his drum, interrupting party speeches and causing mayhem on the streets by breaking windows with his voice. The insanity of the world is not seen on a grand scale, but through the demise of individual characters.He has a great eye for catching all the little nuances of humanity, and the characters Oskar describes are unforgettable in their quirks. After reading the first paragraph about the saving grace of the four potato colored skirts, you won't be able to put it down. My favorite chapter is \\"On the Fibre Rug,\\" but you'll have to make it to the end for that one.This book is a thoroughly enjoyable and witty read. No book has ever made me laugh so much, or writhe so much in discomfort. It's magical, it's real, it's perceptive, it's a must read."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I read &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; while spending my second of eight years in Berlin (then West Berlin), and felt as though the book transported me back in time to a more dangerous place for adults and children alike. To see World War II and its aftermath through the eyes of an adult revisiting his childhood (wherein he vowed to never grow up) while actually living in the city that had been the heart of it all was an overwhelming experience, and as such, I suspect others picking this book up for the first time may not glean the same enjoyment from it as I did.By now, most are already aware that the story focuses on the narrator, Oskar, who decides to stop growing in order to keep his drum and his child-like innocence untainted forever. The drum quickly requires replacing, as Oskar constantly bangs on it to the point that the tin is worn thin and eventually punctured. While the drum can be replaced easily, the innocence that also is worn thin and punctured by the horrors of the impending war cannot be so easily replaced. As the book (and war) progresses, Oskar matures cerebrally, but not emotionally or physically. In one of the book's subplots, when his hormones catch up to his true age during a bittersweet attempt at a love affair with his nanny, in spite of himself, Oskar discovers that quite possibly he has made a mistake in causing himself to stop growing.The drum itself reaches out metaphorically on many levels; does Oskar represent Germany after World War I, with the drum being the Treaty of Versailles? Or is the drum itself Germany, damaged and repaired (or replaced) throughout history? There are many puzzles and questions left up to the reader's imagination throughout this book. I highly encourage anyone with a taste for literature, albeit at times disturbing, to pick up this book and not put it down until you have read every page therein. It is one of the ten best ever written, no kidding."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"While I was reading this book, G&uuml;nter Grass confessed in an interview that, during the last year of the War, he had served in the Waffen SS. He has always admitted to the fascination that the Nazi party held for young Germans like himself. But even though he was a draftee and, it seems, far from the horrors, he found it impossible to reconcile himself to the fact that he was a member of the same organization that, among other things, ran the death camps, and so he kept this hidden for sixty years.The outcry has been considerable, as though this invalidates Grass' entire literary oeuvre as Germany's preeminent postwar novelist, his Nobel Prize, and his advocacy for democracy and conscience. This would be true if he had ever portrayed himself as whiter than white. But the major theme of his work has been that Germans must come to terms with their Nazi past, not as something that happened to somebody else, but as a home-grown horror rooted within themselves. THE TIN DRUM, his first and some say his greatest book, is riddled with just such internal conflict. Grass exonerates nobody, least of all himself.In order to write about the Nazi period and the years immediately before and after, Grass has to invent a fantastic character, like a Velasquez dwarf. Oskar Matzerath stopped growing at the age of three, and remains trapped within a child's body. Almost autistic, he functions by beating on a toy drum, from which he is inseperable. Since others take him for a toddler and he has a tantrum voice that can literally shatter glass, he manages to get his own way, remaining as an anarchic commentator on the fringes while civilization crumbles around him.Oskar, the dwarf jester, has a fine sense of humor; much of this book is very funny. As Joseph Heller did withCATCH 22, G&uuml;nter Grass finds comedy the only tolerable means of dealing with the unspeakable, providing the distance necessary to be able to write at all. He uses other distancing devices also: there is doubt about Oskar's nationality, whether German or Polish; he refers to himself interchangeably in the first and third persons, often in the same sentence; and it is unclear at the end whether he is mad or sane.Oskar may be interesting, but Grass does not make him admirable. He manipulates others shamelessly, betrays his friends, and even aids or abets their deaths. In my view, THIS is the Grass who was seduced by the Nazis and served with the SS. You can see his conflict in every chapter of this long book. For some, Oskar's amorality may be repulsive; for me, it validates this first round in the author's lifetime's struggle to understand the capacity for evil within his countrymen, within humanity, and within himself.[I should add that this may not be an easy book to read. Most of the major events of the Nazi era take place offstage, and one needs to have a good sense of the chronology of those seismic upheavals to pick up the tremors in Oskar's world. Well-known happenings such as Kristallnacht and D-Day can be located relatively clearly, but much of the story plays against more obscure histories such as the fall of Danzig and the vicissitudes of the postwar German economy. There are even a couple of chapters which are almost unintelligible without a knowledge of the rules and terminology of Skat, a three-handed German card game similar to bridge. But the brief glossary helps, and the flavor of the book comes through even if some of its historical ironies might be missed.]"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"How do you define a book that begins with a chapter called 'The Wide Skirt'? What do you make of the narrator justifying this nomenclature by &quot;...if indeed I have gone so far as to call this chapter 'The Wide Skirt', it is because I know how much I owe to this article of apparel.&quot; What do you call a novel which opens with &quot;Granted. I am an inmate of a mental hospital...&quot;Outrageous? Inscrutable? A classic?I call it a work of genius. There have been numerous literary attempts at depicting the Holocaust. The Nazi atrocities have been written about and read many times over. But who could've thought that the era could be chronicled through the scathing eyes of a mentally retarded midget who's refused to grow up after the age of three? Well, Grass does exactly that here, but no, this is not your regular portrayal of SS brutality. Instead, Grass focuses on the degradation of values, on the way humanity caricatures itself during troubled times.John Reddick, in the introduction, reveals an interesting fact: &quot;It was not always Grass's intention to have a quasi-child as his narrator--or even to use the form of a novel. His original plan--so he has said--was to write a long poem-cycle, recounted from the vantage-point of a stylite, a pillar dweller. The limitations of this soon became clear; in particular the stylite figure proved much too static. He therefore moved to the opposite extreme:in place of a fixed observer from above, he switched to a mobile observer from beneath.&quot;This &quot;mobile observer from beneath&quot; is Oskar Matzerath--the central character, the narrator, and the perpetual enigma in the novel. He goes about the business of life with a philosophy of his own, never hesitating to modify it if the situation so demands. Hidden behind the mask of physical and mental abnormality, this protagonist is capable of any kind of action--making love, carving tombstones, or cold-blooded murder. What he does best, however, is playing his tin drum. He can drum up almost any incident to the minutest of detail on his white and red lacquered instrument; he can even hypnotize people into doing what he'll have them do. It is through his eyes that we see a strife-torn world that leaves humans less human. It is through Oskar's prurient eyes that we peep into the life of a young nurse. It is through his perspective that we see Eiffel Tower as a shelter-providing maternal skirt. Oskar takes us on a roller-coaster ride through time, sometimes making us proud of him, and sometimes making us wish that he never existed.Oskar oscillates between first and third persons, sometimes in the same sentence. &quot;I was beginning to fear that Oskar would never see what Leo had in his fist...&quot; As you would've guessed, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Oskar&quot; are the same person, at least physically. The dividing line between the first and the third personae is very thin and sometimes they tend to merge into each other.This book has had a profound effect on me. Never had I expected to read anything like this. However, this is by no means light reading. Start reading it only if you have have the time and patience to soak in the pleasure of reading a masterpiece, word by word, image by image. And any review would be incomplete without acknowledging the sheer brilliance of the translation. Hats off to the late Ralph Manheim."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This incredible first novel is the story of Oskar, who, at three years of age, decides never to grow past his current height of three feet because the world is such a horrible place. To give it justice, this is as much of a summary as I can give this novel.Oskar tells us his life story, starting with the histories of his grandparents and parents and continuing on through his own thirtieth birthday, on which he decides to write this autobiography. On his third birthday, he is given the titular instrument, which he uses to communicate instead of speaking. He becomes quite proficient at this. He also discovers that his voice, when used properly, can shatter glass. Through practice he is able to aim over long distances toward the glass he wishes to break. However, he does not do this just for fun, but only when upset (usually when someone tries to take his drum away).Grass makes Oskar a whole character. Since the story is told through his voice, we really get to know Oskar thoroughly. We follow him through nearly every detail of his life--how he is loved, then ignored; claimed, then disowned; himself claims one man as his father, then another. And through all this he remains his static three feet. We do not know how his family feels about Oskar's decision, we only know what Oskar tells us they say, which isn't much. His family, in fact, as most people would, seem to believe that it was caused by a fall down the cellar stairs, exhibiting \\"man's understandable desire to find physical justification for all alleged miracles\\"(p. 410).Oskar is one of the most interesting characters I have come across. At almost six hundred pages, this book takes a long time to read, as it is not written in such a way to be read quickly. One must take care to read every word, lest one miss an important nuance.This is an excellent novel, and one that, if you are interested in great literature, I would highly recommend. (Not only will you be treated to one of the great works of German post-war literature, but you will also be introduced to the many wonderful uses for fizz powder.)This book is not for the casual reader, fans of Grisham and Steel should stay away because it is not driven by events, but by character. Great books are as such, and this is one of them. I guarantee that, once you finish this book, you will never forget the time you spent with Oskar Matzerath."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum is an amazing novel, the kind you won't often come across in your life. It is epic in scope, biblical in intention, and peerless in its imagination.There can be no plot summary -- the novel is Dickensian in structure, following the adventures and exploits of its hero with a minute attention to detail. It is ambitious, its purpose to explore the fundamental absurdity of modern civilization with the keenest of observation, the most tragic of wit.The novel is set in Germany during the time of both World Wars. Our protagonist is Oskar, one of the most original and memorable characters in literature. Here is a personality born fully formed, every bit as rational and self-reflective at the moment of his birth as he is at the moment of his narration; he never changes, his consciousness steady and self-preserving through all the years of his life. He stops his growth at the age of three, so that he may never enter into the world of adults, which he immediately perceives as self-destructive and spiritually deprived, unworthy of his patronage.How does he accomplish this suspension of the aging process? Through the power of his will, but also through the rhythm of the Tin Drum, a gift from his mother on his third birthday. Completely indifferent to the travails of the twentieth century which seize Germany all around him, he drums our century's beat and recognizes its folly with all the detached interest of an alien visitor to our planet. This turbulent age, caught between ancient superstition and modern technologies of large-scale annihilation, is succinctly, and with painful accuracy, summed at the center of the book -- &quot;Barbaric, mystical, bored.&quot;The events -- too numerous to elaborate here, and after all better read first-hand than described -- proceed endlessly, each piling on the mountain of its predecessors, each more absurd and inspired and subversive than the last, each compounding the level of this breathtaking achievement, until the reader is left at book's close with the irrefutable knowledge that he or she is holding a masterpiece.A movie version was made in 1979, and it won the Oscar (no pun intended!) for best foriegn film. It is an amazing movie, true to the novel, and a must-see. And if you see it, you will surely want to read the book, which you will discover to be one of the most delightful reading experiences of your life."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I have just completed this masterpiece of literary fiction - of all the great works I have read, Grass's is a tour de force of imagination surpassed by few. It is a grotesque and pathetic but brilliant portrait of humanity - like Oskar and all of of the characters who become unforgettable. I could not put it down. True, the book is lacking in plot - but that is not its genius. Its genius is portraying the human condition -- and human behavior. ...I agree that it is not the ultimate testiony about the horrors of Nazi Germany that it is billed to be. This was confusing to me -- I think much of the retrospective critisicm of this novel credits Grass too much with portraying the horrors of the Third Reich. It is a more generic portrait of the evils of humanity. Two hundred years from now, a reader will not learn of the German atrocities from the Tin Drum; however it will still be a great work of literature with universal truths. I also want to strongly disagree with the reader who commented that the message is that humans are not good or evil - just a product of their situation. If we learn anything from this novel, we must learn the horrible truth that human beings have an incredible capacity for callousness, dispassionateness and, yes, pure evil. Take the Alfred Maskereth's warming his hands over the burning remains of the synogogue; the children of Danzig; the Polish looters on the train ride West; the &quot;innocents&quot; Oskar converts to petty thieves, to name a few. All of the characters in Tin Drum have knowledge of right and wrong - most seem to choose wrong - a sad commentary on humanity, but appropriate considering the period and circumstances which gave bith to this book.

Finally, I considered myself lucky when I found an old copy in my father's basement.Yesterday I finished reading the book and I no longer consider myself lucky for having found it. Bizarre, tedious, wordy. I hate to give up on books once I've started them because I know that many books only redeem themselves at the end.

I am a scholar of German literature and I've always found Grass just about unreadable, except for the novelle CAT AND MOUSE (Katz und Maus). The work has always struck me as somehow fascinated by the very fascism it wants to decry, and this novel is but another example of Grass' strange and -- as we know now -- unexpressed guilt-ridden post-ww2 narration.

UNDOWNPUTABLE!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Really a masterpiece, The Tin drum is the Human Drama in all its essence. Using an amazing language, this Nobel deserves all my admiration. Creating a whole Universe of the weirdest people and the most dramatic situations, this book is simply indescriptible. That's why it's called a &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;tedious&quot; book by the ignorant people who doesn't really see it's essence. It's a really unique book, a surrealist description of all of us. The simbolism is simply amazing. Anas skirts, Jesus playing the Drum, the death of Alfred Matzerath, Niobe. This is what I call a masterpiece, not for anyone. Some people here say it's way too fantastic, other it's too realistic and exhausting, I only see than the criticizers of this book are really lost on their ignorance. I simply fell in love with Oskar. He is so human, his mounstrous transformation is simply indescriptible, that's why it's aloyal portrait of our nature, because we can't describe it with words. This book is not simple, is not ofr anyone, it's a work of an art than we can't read, we must just feel it. Like the sound of the wild Oskar drum, the human spirit is only a explosion of senses, a moment of the real scream of our voice, is only a moment than we can live . Not a book of cold logic or mere reflexion, like many other &quot;masterpieces&quot;. It's stunning sound. You only can hear it, but you won't understand it if you don't really feel it. That's the Tin Drum."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I must recognize that since G&uuml;nter Grass obtained the Nobel prize, I approached to this book with some skepticism, based in the fact that the author was a refugee, or a child that lost his town in a war, made me think it was a political award (the feeling I have with the current Nobel prize - I mean that I have the same prejudice about him, not that I know it was a polite award. I just have not read any of his books).Well, this book was one of the best surprises in my whole life. Grass manages the most brutal situations from a totally new point of view. The mixture of humor, sadness, nostalgia, perversity, pessimism and even optimism are utterly brilliant.I think that the most of the readers that attack this book is the same group that attacks Ulysses and similar great books. I think they all are missing the point. This is a mixture of Don Quixote, magic, historic novel, epic and black humor, in a whole new form, at least at that master level, where human situation and sometimes the whole concept of an objective reality is put in question, and also a great part of all of the feelingsThis book is totally a masterwork for literature history."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"\`The Tin Drum\` is a picaresque magical-realist social-satire fairy-tale (whew!). It influencedOne Hundred Years of SolitudeandMidnight's Children, comparable works of length and complexity. It is a Pied Pipper leading Germany through and out of of WWII with a trickster drumming at the head. I can't say I enjoyed it that much as I never really liked magical realism or historically satirical novels. There is a lot obliquely happening that requires knowledge of European history to fully appreciate. I suppose one could enjoy it on the surface for the dark fairy-tale qualities, but that misses the novels bigger point: rationalism taken to an extreme becomes irrational, the novel is a satire of rationalism and ultimately an atonement for German politics and culture that lead to WWII."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I opened this page to find within it 3 different reviewers trying to characterize this work in reasonable, yet contradictory ways. My feeling is it's best not to characterize the book in terms of what it means, but rather to talk about how it communicates meaning. The 3 reviewers? They are all right in a way, but fall into the trap of reading this as a typical Modern novel, whereas I believe this novel was a move towards something a style that would not lend itself so easily to convergence & closure.Someone went so far as to say this is a coming of age novel?!! Well, not quite, but then again, thoughts along those lines are the product of a good imagination trying to piece this together. I find myself focusing on the nature of poetic unfolding in this book and how it relates to truth. Meaning is fleeting. When I read through the book, I am filled with ideas like everyone else, but found early on that you struggle with meaning a little until you are willing to let go. The method of Grass is such that plot on an emotional level can be 'read' regardless, or more often with the aid of, impossibilities in the external course of events (what is normally thought of as plot).My feeling about the moral values being applied with so much austerity to this book? When a person feels threatened or horrified by something, it's hit a nerve, which calls for introspection, the thing that for me is what keeps people from being completely immoral. The problem is, you've got a book surrounding the book and you can't get through it except with your emotions. So it seems to me that some people are not only not ready for it (completely understandable) but read as some bible of the war (vanity, I think). It's a lot to swallow and that's what keeps a lot of people from finishing this book. So what I'll say is: Oskar Matzerath is in fact an artist with words and one that is not always so intent on revealing the truth, or at least not in the typical manner. But he in fact has the gift of cutting to the core of things better than if were rattling off a bunch of gruesome accounts of Nazi horrors. Instead, the author barely has to mention the war. When the war is not visible externally, which is almost the entirety of 591 pages, the war is visible with brutal honesty in the words of Oskar Matzerath. The catch is that Oskar characterizes his own words as drumming, and under-emphasizes the power of his words, whereas Grass show how language is undeniably and always revelatory, especially creative language.Also, some people seem to forget that the first person narrative is a means of personal expression (for the author) as are all other forms of creative writing. So, don't be put off when readers say: 'these are the sayings of an insane midget.\\" These are figurations of a man worth listening to though I do not mean to suggest that Grass and Oskar should be equivocated. The people that feel the need to insult an imaginary narrator are obviously threatened. By what? Well, everyone's thoughts and emotions get twisted up. And this book doesn't let you escape an occasional hard look inside yourself. In fact, that's why many people fail to finish this book. It took me my third try, and shortly after my thirtieth birthday.I will just have to ask you to trust me about where I am going with the below argument:Why is insanity so often linked to unfathomable criminal activity in general? Take the scientist E. Fuller Torrey, who settled a suit for millions of dollars regarding the illegal possession of a brain. And, he writes a book about condemning the dead poet, Ezra Pound: The Roots of Treason, explaining that Ezra Pound was in fact sane and was indeed held in an institution to protect him from criminal charges. As far as mental illness, Torrey is of the opinion that domestic house cats carry a virus that is primarily responsible for the illnesses. What I see in his case is an extraordinary effort to draw clear boundaries where mental illness is and isn't. And to prove that where it is, the cause is biological (medical). Why? To be quite honest, I think there is an agenda (and not uncommon)to have the option of blaming certain unfathomable tragedies on biological malfunction or malformation while still retaining the rational grounds to hold individuals morally accountable. But for me it's as easy as this: A thought is a thought and it comes from the total person.That said, this book is more than what I just stated. In fact, much more. For one thing it is very artful and very fun in places. But some of the mis-charizations seem to me just another attempt to redirect some unsightly human realities by pointing fingers and calling names. Which of course sounds like something you would get in trouble for doing in Kindergarten, but just happens to be what justified much of the atrocities of the war."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Tought that this book is as someone said 'not for everyone&quot; I suggest an open minded reading at the things that the character does and think, comparing them as what we often think but not do, I've never read such an introspective and entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I read this book 13 years ago and thought it was a fantastic story. I have read numerous books in the mean time that are also literary jewels, but nothing compares to The Tin Drum. If you read nothing else in life, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"It's not that Grass is not a capable writer; his prose, in and of itself, has enough complexity, wit, and humor to keep one entertained. The problem, or should I say the difficult, with the book arises from its content; there are numerous incidents in this book that easily fall under the classification of weird, with a capital W. For instance, Oskar prays to a preserving jar that contains a ring finger, while visiting the beach with his family, a fisherman pulls a severed horse's head out of the sea, and a group of nuns is gunned down.It's an exaggeration, but not much of one, to say that this book is just a series of weird events, one occurring after the other. Given all this weirdness, it is quite a challenge to extract any meaning or sense from the text, an almost hopeless task, really. Perhaps, though, that was Grass's intent in writing the book; to show that life is meaningless, that it can't be understood; there is no reason why any of us exist and you'd be an utter fool to attempt to find or create one, given the utterly unpredictable, chaotic, and unstable world we live in. Tempting, as this interpretation may be, I think Grass's real intent in writing the book was to explore the issues of identity and mortality.Oskar Matzerath is introduced too us as a mental patient, Exactly who he is though remains unclear to us readers, because who he is, is constantly influx throughout the whole novel - at first, he's the mental underdevelopment kid, then a lover, then a member of a front-line theatre company, then a gang leader, engraver, model, musician, murder suspect, and finally, fugitive. Is it any wonder then, that in the end, who he is, is even a mysterious to him; near the end of the novel he ask himself who he is, but gives no answer.I think Oskar's lack of a sense of identity originates from the fact that foundation of his identity is negation. In order to frustrate his alleged father desire that he become a shopkeeper, he decides to injure himself at three years old. Thus, as a result of this injury, his growth is stunted and he is believed to be mentally feeble. A part which, he plays to perfection for years on end, with the result that fake Oskar becomes the real Oskar. And as such, once he begins to discard this persona, he literally becomes no one, and as such, he is forced to latch onto any role he can play, to generate any sense of self.While the issue of identity is the central focus of the book, death is ever present throughout, and at the end takes center stage; Oskar comes to realize that his own death has been a possibility all along. Oskar experiences the first death of someone he knows early on, and by the end of the book, 9 other people have died. Most of these deaths are unexpected and often occur through rather weird and absurd means. For instance, Oskar's mother dies from eating to much fish, the owner of the Onion cellar dies from a bunch of pigeons attacking his car, and his father dies from swallowing a pin.So what then is Grass up to here with having so many of his characters die throughout the book? I think it is to inform us that our own death is an ever present possibility in our day to day lives that we fail to acknowledge. And given this fact, the responsibility for the content and significance of our lives, is solely in our hands; we have no control over how and when we will die, but we can, and do, have control over the choices we make and the ends we pursue.We should live our lives authentically and choose to be responsible enough to live lives that matter. A message I never tire of hearing, but one I wish was a little more easily deciphered in the present work."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I have recently finished The Tin Drum and thought it was very enjoyable. The only lag in the plot was when he joins the Dusters and proclaims himself to be Jesus. I found a whole other side of the story besides the Nazi atrocities and the horrors of war. What I really found in this book was that it was just as much about love as it was about war.In the midst of all the war and horror, the narrator continuously moves from one woman to the next, trying to find someone who will love him back. Throughout the book is wishing he was back under his grandmothers four-layer skirts \\"with the potatoes and the smell of rancid butter.\\" He is more partial to Jan Bronski than than his father because it is Jan that makes his mother happy. He ends up hating his father because his father gains the love of Maria and takes Maria away from Oskar, with Oskar believing he is the father of Maria's son, Kurt. The book finally ends with his infatuation with Sister Dorothea.I found this book to be as much about love as about war."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I want to give this novel 4/1/2 stars, but there are no half-stars here.This novel is grander than majestic, because of the strength given to its retarded protaganist, Oskar, reflected in his fantasies and intelligences, some seem unimaginable, mad and ridiculous to a normal person, others ever so familiar to our very own daily lives. Are we normal, or are we retarded? I believe we are some of both. This book, though 565 pages long, is indeed a little too lengthy, for Oskar's recollections of events that were recorded earlier, are to some soporific. However, it is through these repetitions that one is led into and through an ever-living, ever-fighting retarded mind.Although I was a little disappointed that this book did not live up to my expectations of its writing about the history and life in Danzig from 1925-55, I came to realise that it is precisely because of the retarded mind's egocentricm, that it is his life that is the sole most important issue in this novel. And that is why this novel is powerful."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"grass is among the world's best authors!

When I read the novel I got the impression that Grass was using Oskar as a symbol for the intellectuals' role during this period. Oskar stays on his childhood, conserving the innocence and therefore, a freedom-of-mind far from the corrupted (conditioned, modelled) views from older people. His way to face the world is apparently harmless (a tin drum), in the same manner as the intellectuals only have their words. However, the drum succeeds in getting the attention of people, and its power is higher than one could expect.As other reviewer has observed, Oskar seems sometimes perverse and manipulative, as some European thinkers who didn't see the dangers of totalitarisms and supported nazism or stalinism.Absolutely recommendable, together with the works of Heinrich B&ouml;ll, to understand a historical period."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"While in college, my father gave me this book as a birthday gift. As I unwrapped it he said &quot;I'm not sure if this is actually a good book, but when I was in college I found it and got addicted to it. I skipped classes, meals and sleep because I could not put it down.&quot; Not knowing that Gunter Grass was receiving the Nobel Prize in literature, I picked up the book, read seveal chapters, and had no trouble putting it down. However, I kept picking it back up. A year and a half later, I have read it, ruminated on it, and now have read other readers' reviews. The best word to describe this book is &quot;intriguing.&quot; Who reads this book? Who gets addicted to it? Who can/cannot identify with Oskar? While reading this book I sought no symbolism, no simile, no explanation of humanity in Nazi territory. I read it as a story about a strange character set in strage times. Oskar is a crazy artist who is very critical of himself, claiming the devil won on the day of his baptism. Like all of us, he attempts to run from responsibility and yet he desires recognition as a genius. Like Jehu Hernandez (reader review posted April 24, 2000) and several others, I believe another word that adequately describes this book is &quot;exhaustive.&quot; This is not a book for someone seeking light fiction or an easy explanation.

So should you."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I don't think there are enough words to describe such a masterpiece as this book, it just left me speechless. Even though the topic is clearly a protest to life during World War II, there are passages all throughout the book for everybody to feel identified with. The strength of Grass's descriptive and narrative skills involve you through the entire story by going real deep into human emotions, from good to evil, from innocence to guilt, and from fantasy to reality. I thought the beginning was a bit slow, but don't let that discourage you, you'd miss one of the best reading experiences ever. So far, and without discussion, I can tell you is my favorite book ever. Lots of people keep telling me I don't seem like I'll ever grow up, and probably some of you have heard similar statements. Let these people take a look at this book for a good second thought. I am currently 26 years old, and ironically, my name is Oscar too."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"What an enactment! Gunther Grass is narrating Oskar Matzarat's story, a boy who makes up his mind not to grow when he is three years old, relates life in Dazing, his hometown, with full of unforgettable characters and produces a tour de force. Oskar could hardly wait to get his drum at age three, promised by his mother when he was born. With his drum Oskar can now break glass, be it may church window, his teacher's eye piece or doctor's mason jars by playing the drum or by just his shrill voice.The story is Nazi history narrated from inside seen thru Oskar's eyes, his alleged father being a party member in good standing. Gunther Grass portrays two events brilliantly, Kristallnacht, killing of innocent Jews and confiscating their property and the second, bold resistance by citizens against all odds to fight the Nazi occupation. Oakar is witness to both the events, first as he walks into his favourite toy store with hordes of drums, to find Sigismund Markus, the owner, murdered and the second, the Resistance, arguably the piece de resistance of the book, at the Polish post office where his other alleged father, Jan Bronski, is holed up with Polish fighters, defending it. After the library is demolished, Bronski along with others surrender and later Oskar finds out he was shot by the Germans.Oskar relates his biography, as a non-chalance, yet times reluctant, participant to Nazi history unfolding around him. He is there at their victory parades and gruesome defeats, when the Russians occupy Danzig and kill his alleged father Matzerath and when an errant bomb takes the life of his sweatheart, Rosarita.He confesses his involvment in both their (alleged fathers) murders, Matzerath and Bronski. He had no use for either of them, specially Matzerath, who married his beloved Maria, who begets his son, Kurt!Oscar is writing his biography inside an asylum with his keeper's help, Bruno, a kind accomodating soul. The book ends with his exoneration from murder charge, but Oskar is not too happy to get out of his safe asylum.A great allegory of Nazi horrors, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Overall, The Tin Drum seemed to be a drawn-out, laborious journey for me. I read upwards of fifty carefully selected novels a year, and I've heard much here and there about the merits of The Drum. Perhaps I was expecting too much from it? The first three or four chapters had me thoroughly absorbed in Oskar's ancestry, and for the rest of the book I kept waiting for someone as interesting and human as his grandmother Anna to show up. Granted, Oskar's mother Agnes is another consistent and great character, but besides these two, I made no friends. Oskar was such an &quot;unreal&quot; personage that I found him impossible to trust as a narrator... with every beat of his drum he startled the cohesive theme of this book into a corner. I never found that corner. I am no stranger to authors diving in and out between the &quot;fantastic&quot; and the &quot;real&quot; (as for instance do Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hermann Hesse, Charles Williams etc), but 570 pages of unending &quot;fantastic&quot; in the true dictionary sense (ie. of an odd appearance, or grotesque) left me truly bewildered.

I have never read a book where the details of the grotesque made me shiver. I'm talking about the \\"horse's head scene.\\" Anyway, here we have Oscar, a boy who never grows in size, but his brain and intellect excells. I like to think Of Oscar as the fly on the wall. Grass uses a child someone who is the center of attention yet no one notices. I won't go into detail about the novel, I think enough reviews before me did that, but I hope that if you do read it you will look for those same nuances that I noticed. It is really a facinating work of fiction, very ahead of it's time. Just a warning...if you should rent the film, it will only go as far as the end of the War."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The question asked in the book: &quot;If Christ had a hump, would he have been crucified?&quot; That's the key to the novel. Oskar is a latter day Christ; but is he? Or is Grass being blasphemous. All great art is blasphemous. Read it"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum is one of my favorite novels and, I think, one of the great novels of the 20th Century. It is profound and mysterious, funny and disturbing, innovative and original. Grass created the epitome of the unreliable narrator, yet the story he tells reveals fundamental truths about human nature: about love and betrayal, ecstasy and fear. Moreover, the story is so intense, so moving, in a sense so miraculous, the reader wants to believe it, even knowing that it comes from a delusional man who describes physically impossible events. Oskar is one of the grand creations of modern literature: a mentally disturbed man whose story can't be trusted, but who clearly suffered through tragic events that would drive anyone mad, and who arrived at a more insightful understanding of life than most \\"sane\\" people will ever know. If ever a novel deserved 5 stars, this one does."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Grass's \\"The Tin Drum\\" is a must read for those interested in a German perspective of WWII. The novel should also be read by those willing to make an emotional investment in the prose as well as devote a fair amount of time to read the weighty work. I admit I struggled with the novel's length and density. At times I thought I was going to give up and try reading it another time like I did with Nietzsche. But then incredibly beautiful, humorous, vivid, and even disturbing passages came that left me breathless, wanting more.Keeping the plot straight isn't too difficult: the main character, Oskar Matzerath, constantly reinforces that he is writing from the present as a patient in a mental hospital. Grass skillfully changes the tense, time, and story over and over; yet he makes it accessible for the general reader. Through Grass's uncanny writing ability, the reader can see how Oskar must reexamine the past to learn from it. Oskar's obsession with the past allows him to rethink events that require thought and consideration by everyone (WWII).Read the entire book. I love a chapter near the end about The Onion Basement. It's worth the struggle and commitment."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Okay, I suppose I can't write anything here that will have more impact than the book cover: \\"Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature\\". It deserves it. I've read a lot of good books-- even a few great ones-- but this is the best. If I ever read something better, maybe I'll come back and change what I said, but I don't think it's going to happen.I won't give a synopsis of the story. Read the other reviews for that. I'm saying this book is simply monumental. Ingest it if you can, because it's not a Sunday afternoon read. As you go, you'll find it makes you think.Think about the scope of tragedy that was Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century. Think about... well, you should read it, and think for yourself. It will not leave you indifferent."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Other reviewers made the comment that Grass uses his central character as a metapher for the German Society/Nation. Grass uses his central character not to portray the society, but to warn from being like the society around Oskar. Oskar is the opposite of the people in his surroundings. Grass, through Oskar, shows how superficial the general society is by using sarcasm and portraying images in the most grotesque manner. Die Blechtrommel is a warning; it is written to remind humanity of the horrible happenings in Germany during the 30's and 40's. Grass has an amazing language, and has an amazing sense of sarcasm, which he uses in an efficient manner. I do not know what the translation is like, I am German and read it in german, and for everyone who has a sense for literature, this is definitly one of the best books ever written on this topic."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This is an extraordinary book!

I enjoyed it a lot!"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"One of the most impressive aspects of this novel is Grass's wiriting style. Superstition, supernatural event constanly leek into the real world (thus this book is often called a magical realism piece). It's interesting to compare this work to those by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. While using very similar techniques the two writers (Grass, and Marquez) have obviously different cultural backgrounds. As stated before, this novel isn't for the faint of heart. However, it's worthwhile, so don't be faint of heart."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"It has been six years since I read The Tin Drum and I still have such vivid memories of it. It is disturbing, painfully truthful, and one of the most vital ways I can think of to begin to understand the horrors of dictatorship, war, and genocide. I have been appalled the past week to hear of the seizure of copies of the movie in Oklahoma City and recently heard that the same fundamentalist anti-porn group is now going to read over the book to see if it should be banned also. What a travesty that such an important book and film should be judged not for its artistic and sociological importance, but for a few sexual scenes"},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"The Tin Drum gives a portrait of a bizarre man in an insane asylum in Germany, who seems to have supernatural gifts to see through those around him. He is bizarre, grotesque and interesting, but for me the whole tale did not come together as a whole. I found myself waiting for something, but found only one little tale tied weakly to another little tale. Each were interesting, and just a little out of whack, but never came together as a whole. I'm glad that I read this portrait of Germany around WWII, but sadly, I'm glad I'm finished."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"I just finished this novel this evening and have to admit it was one of the more painful experiences that I have had in the last little while. The metaphor of a stunted Oskar (a metaphor for Weimar and Nazi Germany) who is the perpetual three year old grew tiresome rather quickly. Grass never normalizes his character in the face of the absurdity of the Nazi regime. He is absurd even in this totally absurd world. If he had been more normalized it would have been much more interesting, because it would show that in Nazi Germany even the deformity of the eternal three year old does not stand out, because it is all theatre. What was interesting about the novel was the loss of identity that Oskar felt (much like Germany itself in the Adenauer aftermath of the 1950's)when he gave up his drum. Why Grass was given the Nobel Prize is beyond my ken."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"On the outside, Oscar Matzerath, the narrator of THE TIN DRUM, appears as a special-needs (autistic, maybe) little person (midget) who processes his emotions by pounding on a tin drum. But in his narrative, Oscar proclaims himself to be a literary genius who chose to stop growing at three in reaction to family stress. This discrepancy between appearance and awareness yields a truly strange book.I was drawn to TTD through a misconception. Somehow, I had the impression that Oscar was a brilliant device that Grass created to explore human experience in the Free City of Danzig, the Third Reich, and the aftermath of World War II in Germany. (Oscar was born in 1924 and lived in Danzig.) But no, Nazism and its legacy is mostly a tangential subject in this long book--even when Oscar's mother's husband (maybe not his biological father) joins the Nazi Party or when Oscar witnesses the Nazi assault on the Danzig post office, which has an informative Wikipedia entry.Instead, what you get in TTD is a coming-of-age story that is narrated by a selfish, manipulative, and probably insane person who has no sense of humor. As in all coming-of-age novels, this youthful narrator has issues with his parents. But in this case, Oscar's answers to these issues take pernicious and negative form.These may be SPOILERS. But Oscar destroys his parents' marriage by faking a brain damaging accident, for which his mother's husband takes the blame; he is a witness and enabler to his mother's continuing infidelity, which demonstrates to him the rewards of deceit and the limits of religion; he competes with the two men who are his father figures, with terrible consequences for each man; and he takes as his true emotional father figure another midget, this one a confidant of Joseph Goebbels.This is not, in other words, Holden Caulfield, who experiences plenty of angst but never embraces deceit and to-the-death competitiveness or practices hideously misplaced hero worship. Furthermore, this coming-of-age Oscar never shows remorse for his effect on his family. Instead, he is simply obsessive and cunning, sort of an Iago in short pants.But Oscar's personality isn't really the problem, since I've enjoyed many novels with disturbing narrators. For me, the biggest shortcoming of TTD is that this impossible (in the real world) literary creation only explores the humdrum lives of people who work at the corner store, the bakery, the green grocery, a bar, and the post office. This may be Grass's point: ordinary life goes on even in the worst of times. But in TTD, this literary device simply captures a gray tedium as viewed by a highly selfish and idiocyncratic personality. There's no insight. And, there's no lyricism.In the interests of full disclosure, I acknowledge that I did not finish TTD. I made it through page 324, leaving me with 252 pages in my edition that I simply couldn't face. I suppose I miss Oscar's redemption. Or, maybe Oscar's plight eventually encapsulates the grim and twisted plight of the German people from the 1920s through the 1940s. But I wasn't interested enough to persevere and find out. I stopped because I had begun to skim."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"A tremendously well written (and well translated), original, and fascinating book. The style is absurd and ironic in the extreme. The narrator, Oscar Matzerath, provides a searing critique of petit bourgeois German and Polish culture in the period leading up to and including WWII. But don't expect to identify with or even like Oscar, as he is a tyrant and misanthrope. The Tin Drum reminded me a little of Giles Goat Boy by John Barth, but I would rate the Tin Drum as a far better written and more interesting book. Also contains very interesting historical information about northern Germany and Poland."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"&quot;The Tin Drum&quot; is so rich and diverse in ideas, themes, characters, and symbols that it almost reads more like an anthology of connected short stories than a novel. A literary cornucopia that combines whimsical fantasy with brutal reality, it contains so many details and events to recount that it defies a succinct plot summary; each chapter is episodic, with its own distinct plot line.The narration is told by 30-year-old Oskar Matzerath, who is a patient in a mental hospital in Dusseldorf. He was born in 1924 in a suburb of the Baltic seaport of Danzig (currently Gdansk, Poland). On his third birthday, the day he receives his first toy tin drum, he stunts his growth by throwing himself down a flight of stairs. Feigning mental retardation, he beats on his drum as a means of communication and expression and shatters glass with a piercing scream as a means of rebellion.As Oskar ages, he witnesses the course of Danzig's history during the Nazi invasion, including Kristallnacht and the Polish resistance, and throughout World War II. Most of his tales, however, concern the private lives of his family and acquaintances. He is a dwarven Augie March, interacting with all strata of society and offering commentary on the absurdity of his environment. He joins an entertainment troupe of midgets during the war (resulting in a rather strange chapter containing a bit of surrealist drama), becomes the leader (and Jesus) of a group of juvenile delinquents, moves to Dusseldorf after the war and becomes a tombstone engraver, an artists' model, and a drummer in a jazz band that performs in a sort of grief clinic. And that's only a small and superficial sample of Oskar's life experiences.What is interesting about &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; is that it acknowledges but is not obsessed with the atrocities of the Nazis; Grass puts human faces on the German and Polish lives that personified the tumultuously battle-scarred nations and uses the deformed Oskar as a metaphor for their blackened history. Years later Salman Rushdie was to write a very similar, and similarly excellent, book about India called &quot;Midnight's Children,&quot; and I can't help but suspect that Rushdie used &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; as a model."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"It's no small task to understand the greatest crime of the 20th century, but The Tin Drum is an important step in that direction. While Europe's mid-century descent into darkness is the most well-documented tragedy in history, few of us are able to comprehend the depth and enormity of what happened.The story of The Tin Drum is told through the eyes of a lifelong child - indulging in fantasy (as children do) and seeing truths that adults prefer to ignore. This is not a book for those who demand realism in their fiction - its fantasies and literary tricks can, at times, leave the mind reeling. But Hitler was no ordinary criminal, and Oskar's story gives new and fresh insights into the extraordinary crime at the dark center of the 20th century.A word about the translation: Manheim is a prolific translator whose works even include an English translation of Hitler's &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The art of the translator is often underappreciated - his work on this book is magnificent and very readable by a literate reader of English."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"There is so much to say about this novel -- Grass's first -- that perhaps there is nothing to say about it. It is simultaneously moving and hilarious, joking and didactic, full of joy and melancholy. Oskar is a man-child largely devoid of chronological progress: he was born fully mentally developed, and stopped physically developing after the age of 3. Oskar is, therefore, in the language of the mathematicians, held constant. Everything around Oskar revolves and changes, and he only stands and observes, screaming, and beating his tin drum. Gunter Grass is a master of being intellectual in warm, human tones, and embedding strong social morals within a lighthearted, quick-paced story. Overall, this book is immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking, more so than anything I had read in a long, long time. Grass's Nobel was well-deserved; too bad it took him so long to get it."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Grass was a young boy when World War II started (he was 11 years old when the war started). He is (if you don't know) German. So, he was old enough to have some idea what was going on, but too young to have any degree of control over his life. He was just another ordinary German civilian caught up in what became one of the greatest tragedies in world history.This book, his first novel, written in the late 1950s, is obviously a reaction to his life during the war. It is not directly autobiographical because it is told using metaphors and many things happen which (in all likelihood) never happened to young Mr. Grass. However, the metaphors &quot;work&quot; in a way that perhaps gets at the emotional truth of what happened.Frankly, this book didn't quite succeed for me. I do not rate it as one of the great novels of the 20th century. As an historian I know a great deal about the facts of the war. What was it like to be a young boy in Nazi Germany, seeing your world literally destroyed before your eyes? Seeing your older cousins going off to war and never coming back? And then, learning after the war, about the monstrous crimes committed by &quot;ordinary Germans&quot;? I'm not at all convinced that this book really gives you a good sense of that. For me, at least, it's just too absurd.Call me a foolish realist. Tell me you can only capture the horror and chaos of seeing your city burned to the ground, your whole life torn apart through forces beyond your control, through absurdity and metaphor. I'd rather Grass told the truth, or told a truthful story. To my mind, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; is not a truthful story.Still, I can see why some people like it. It has quality both in writing and in the senses it brings to life through the pages of the story. Certainly it has left an impression on me even after many years. One thing is certain, I have no desire to read this book again."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"1980: I was 10 years old the first time I came into contact with Grass' THE TIN DRUM. It was in the form of a movie on cable television. For whatever reason, I immediately found myself drawn towards the bizarre story and eccentric characters. Unfortunately, my parents didn't think it was an appropriate program for their impressionable child to watch (looking back, I can't say I disagree). The television was turned off and I went to bed dejected, disgusted, and somewhat disturbed. It wasn't until 1995 that I re-discovered Grass' work in its original form. I was browsing the shelves of a used bookstore when a dog-eared paperback caught my eye. Seeing as my parents weren't around to object, I purchased the book for a dollar and took it home where it sat on a bookshelf for nearly a year. To make a long story short, I finally read the book--then I read it again. In my opinion, Grass' novel follows in the same tradition of storytelling as Celine's JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT, or Joseph Heller's CATCH-22. Sweeping. Vast. Strange. Humor of the darkest type is employed at every turn--an uncomfortable kind of comedy that allows one to laugh when they feel like wincing. You can't go wrong with this one. Each chapter is compact, almost a short story in itself, and the pacing is superb. I can honestly admit that THE TIN DRUM is the only book I have ever read that I wish I had written myself."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This is a great book,if not the greatest of the post war written ones.This is not a happy ending kind of story. This is magic realism in its full blown beauty.Just read the \\"faith,hope, love\\" chapter to realize that Gunter Grass is not your ordinary writer. He is a master of words.This is the story of Oscar \\"the three-year-old whom no one could persuade to grow\\".He stopped growing on his own \\"in order to be exempted from the big and little catechism and in order not, once grown to five-foot-eight adulthood, to be driven by this man [Matzerath] who face to face with his shaving mirror called himself my father, into a business, the grocery business, which as Matzerath saw it, would, when Oskar turned twenty-one, become his grownup world. To avoid playing the cash register I clung to my drum and from my third birthday on refused to grow by so much as a finger's breadth. I remained the precocious three-year-old, towered over by grownups but superior to all grownups, who refused to measure his shadow with theirs, who was complete both inside and outside, while they, to the very brink of the grave, were condemned to worry their heads about \\"development,\\" who had only to confirm what they were compelled to gain by hard and often painful experience, and who had no need to change his shoe and trouser size year after year just to prove that something was growing.\\"This quoted paragraph summarizes the logic behind Oskar's resistance to grow. He was ,as you will see through the story,compared to Jesus.He was different and had certain magical powers in his childhood. Nevertheless;at the end, he despises even the slight idea to be like Jesus \\"If Jesus had had a hump,they would never have nailed him to the cross. Must I really, just because I am thirty years of age,go out into the world and gather disciples around me?\\".Germany was humiliated,raped,severely wounded and was left with no pride after the war. Grass was its Messiah, he was Oskar himself. Oscar didn't want to grow. he did bad things; he committed what later considered crimes( the death of mom,his two fathers, his lover etc), he tried to convict himself to be the murderer of sister Dorothea, he didn't want to leave prison(or the mental ward). He was deformed not physically but mentally and emotionally like any other German who lived in that troubled era.You wonder at the end of the story; is Oskar a good or bad character? do you sympathize with him, is he a victim or result, is he a human or phantom, is he Jesus or Judah, Hamlet or Yorick. Rasputin or Goethe?I don't know the exact answer to this but I think that he is a mix of all those conflicting contrasts;\\"What more shall I say: born under light bulbs, deliberately stopped growing at age of three, given drum, sang glass to pieces, smelled vanilla, coughed in churches, observed ants, decided to grow, buried drum, emigrated to the West, lost the East, learned stonecutter's trade, worked as model, started drumming again, visited concrete, made money, kept finger, gave finger away, fled laughing, rode up escalator, arrested, convicted, sent to mental hospital, soon to be acquitted, celebrating this day my thirtieth birthday and still afraid of the Black Witch.\\"This is a great novel of psychoanalysis. It is not an easy read, it is rich in symbolism and magic. It would be really unfair to rate this lower than 5 stars. Many might criticize the book either because they didn't understand the ideas or because Grass is considered in their limited views \\"just a political hypocrite\\".I tell you only one thing;if you are a good reader and appreciate the work of contemporary artist;then you won't regret reading this."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"\\"I am Jesus.\\" Without giving anything away, this single line constitutes the essence of the allegory of good and evil that is at the heart of Gunter Grass's remarkable \\"The Tin Drum.\\" The author's primary narrator and principle character is one Oskar Matzerath, a precocious and diminutive child of the fallen German empire whose picaresque adventures through the 30's and 40's present the Western world in that morally ambiguous way that is so characteristic of Modernist and post-modern fiction writing. The Nazis represent evil, to be sure, but so do many ordinary people, including perhaps Oskar himself. Characters of virtue, however, are not easily found in this novel.Despite the somber overtones of this book, \\"The Tin Drum\\" is both hilarious and very accurate in its portrayal of the human condition. Moreover, Grass's epic is filled with unforgettable characters, many of whom are possessed of unforgettable quirks and pathologies. The reader should not expect a skewering of Hitler's regime; rather, Grass provides us with the genuine article in his story of civilian life in Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"This is an incredible book. It defies easy summary, so I'm not going to even try. Needless to say, this is one of those great novels that other novels will be compared to if they too want to be considered great. It's black, vitriolic humor, coupled with Dickensian characters, biting social commentary, complex symbolism, and picaresque adventures combined to make this the best read I've head in years. Oskar Matzerath is permanently etched in my mind, right along with Hamlet, David Copperfield, Heathcliff, and Oedipus. His hilarious take on his parents (including his presumptive father, Matzerath) and just about every other grotesquerie in Germany is unforgettable. This book is only for those who need a strong dose of SERIOUS literature, a blast to their brains; no Oprah book-clubbers need apply. My only question is, Why did it take the Nobel committee so long to give their award to Grass. I would have given it to him the year he published this novel."},{"Title":"The Tin Drum","review":"Yes, this is a lengthy book to slog through, but it is thoroughly enjoyable and completely unpredictable. The general plot has been told by other reviewers, so it will not be noted here. The chapter titles alone are enigmatic enough to keep you reading. My big question is what does it all mean? I'm sure the academic literary types have had a field day with this colossus! The tin drum is one HUGE, book-long symbol of what a person needs to get through life, I suppose... A very intellectual, compelling read for those patient enough to do so..."},{"Title":"Falling in Love With Mystery: We Dont Have to Pretend Anymore","review":"Written by a retired United Methodist minister, this book challenges some of the most basic tenets of the Christian faith... ideas somewhat akin to John Shelby Spong's. The prose is actually poetic in places; but the chapter dealing with quantum physics was mostly beyond my comprehension. It was liberating, however, to finally see thoughts in print that have been stirring in the minds of many Christians, and to have these beliefs validated. I do not agree totally with all of Elliott's concepts, but allowing God and the Spirit of Christ to be a Mystery is much preferable to the fundamentalist view of fitting God into a rigid box of dogma. If your mind is open to the idea of a cosmic Christ and if you are interested in saving our Planet, this is a must read for you."},{"Title":"Falling in Love With Mystery: We Dont Have to Pretend Anymore","review":"Of thousands of books I have read, Falling in Love with Mystery is by far the single most significant body of wisdom I have ever encountered. If you don't like &quot;mystery&quot;, substitute &quot;reality&quot;, as in &quot;Falling in Love with Reality&quot;. This book's subtitle &quot;We Don't Have to Pretend Anymore&quot; accurately reflects my overwhelming relief from a lifetime of suspicion that religions are blatantly imaginary renditions of the way life really is. Talk about a breath of fresh air! For those of you who have never had such thoughts, let me put it this way. I had given up hope of ever finding a book that realistically communicates the truth that all religions seek to reveal, the meaning and purpose of life. This book makes me aware that I have cosmic permission to love life as it actually is, and points me in new directions in which to begin to see the value of the contributions of religions for what they truly are. Some may say that seeing the imaginary in religion for what it is diminishes its power to influence how we think and live. The opposite has occurred. I am now able to live in a loving, intimate, personal relationship with the infinite that continuously inspires my thoughts and transforms my daily living."},{"Title":"Falling in Love With Mystery: We Dont Have to Pretend Anymore","review":"The job of the artist is to tell a larger, often abstract, truth by distorting physical reality, i.e., by telling a lie. Viewing religion as great literary and performance art enhances, rather than diminishes, its relevance and its message. One can indeed observe and live by the noblest teachings of Christianity without sheepishly accepting that the universe was created in a timespan of six rotations of today's Earth, that Jesus got half his DNA from some nonphysical source, or that one's particular sect alone is the One True Religion.I particularly like Elliot's position that the planet is for us to nurture, rather than to subdue. The English phrase, &quot;have dominion over,&quot; has been misinterpreted far too long. We are indeed a part of Creation, not apart from it.I recommend this important little book to a wide audience. In particular, I hope it will help open up discussions among people with widely divergent religious views."},{"Title":"The Rounders","review":"I just loved this story, short but complete with a look at western experience on the range without the usual shoot outs and Indians. I really got a sense of the cowboy and the hardships even though these characters were part of a more contemporary ranch. Max Evans is an extraordinary story teller and even more special in that it is a reflection of his time on working cattle ranches in the Southwest. What a beautiful literary style and makes reading more enjoyable with his humor. Anyone who loves our western history and the cowboy culture should read this poignant and often hilarious tale. I especially loved the Forward that gives in detail how this novelette came into being and eventually became a movie with Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford. Very interesting. You gotta love Old Fooler, the horse, who is \\"no ones fool\\" as it turns out. He almost takes on \\"human\\" qualities!\\" This is a fun story for younger readers too- teenagers.

Hiding the pictures with a 'lift-the-flap' means my students are more likely to actually attempt to read the word before looking at the picture to check their reading. Also, they have fun coloring, and the cutting is a good fine-motor activity. I do frequently have to cut out the 'windows' myself to avoid crying fits from frustrated students, and I usually draw a box around the word-family 'part' (ie. 'at' for the 'cat' wheel) so the kids remember to not color over the letters. If I know students will be using the wheels for a long time, I will even laminate the wheels after everything is cut out, leaving a plastic 'window' that is sturdier. I have even reduced several 'wheels' on the copier and turned them into file-folder games. One folder is for long vowels, one is for short vowels.

Become your own best friend and take care of yourself, for you are the only person with whom you will surely have a lifelong relationship.\\"Now, Everyday Mind:\\"Perhaps the deepest reason why we are afraid of death is because we do not know who we are. We believe in a personal, unique, and separate identity--but if we dare to examine it, we find that this identity depends entirely on an endless collection of things to prop it up: our name, our \\"biography,\\" our partners, family, home, job, friends, credit cards. It is on their fragile and transient support that we rely for our security. So when they are all taken away, will we have any idea of who we really are?\\"Without our familiar props, we are faced with just ourselves, a person we do not know, an unnerving stranger with whom we have been living with all the time but we never really wanted to meet. Isn't that why we have tried to fill every moment of time with noise and activity, however boring or trivial, to ensure that we are never left in silence with this stranger on our own?\\"--Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying\\"Well, there you have it. I probably don't need to say anything but I will. Taro Gold's book is faddy self-help book totted by hoop-jumping-ninnies who want to feel better about their meaningless existences. If you can deal with the fact that you don't exist and don't want to pad yourself with even more illusions, then the better choice, obviously, is Everyday Mind. There are, however, very attractive little illustrations of bamboo in Taro Gold's book."},{"Title":"Everyday Mind (Tricycle Book)","review":"This book has a Buddhist entry for each day of the year.

There is no Biblical basis for the claims that we all have needs for security and significance, or that these needs must be met before we can live obediently before God.I HIGHLY recommend any of Jay Adams's books for a strong, Biblical perspective on the human condition.

Dr. Crabb states that a man's greatest need is significance and a woman's greatest need is security. My understanding of the Bible is that the single greatest need for both men and women is salvation and sanctification. Not only is the assessment of man's need wrong, he says that this must be dealt with BEFORE Biblical principles can be applied. A better approach would be to apply biblical principles to the lives of men and women and allow the Holy Spirit to work in them so that they will find their security and significance in Christ alone.&quot;"},{"Title":"The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples","review":"Sure it's called Marriage Builder, but I'd rename it life builder, because the things that it talks about really apply to all your relationships that are close; wife, friends, family, girlfriend, mentor.

The book can be used in the context of marital and pre-marital counseling and is organized in a way that allows the use of one chapter per session.

He doesn't even say you were MEANT to be happy.But he does give you a model, a paradigm to follow that is bound to improve your perception of your situation because it places God as the provider, just as it's supposed to be.

The author argues that there are 3 ingredients to a healthy, godly marriage. Spirit oneness, Soul oneness and Body oneness. Note I am not saying happy. I think we are just so after happiness, that we forget the whole purpose behind marriage. Marriage is not to make me happy, but to make me holy! When I am transformed into an image of Christ that's where I am most happy to be. In His presence, the pleasures are forevermore. John 15:5 Apart from Christ I can do nothing! So there are 3 bulding blocks, Grace, Committment and Acceptance. If couples understood the grace of God and the biblical principles of marriage then the divorce rate in America wouldn't be so high.

This time however, we will be including several other couples because it is too good to not share it. This is truly a manual for a biblical marriage, whether newly-married, or married for a lifetime. Dr. Crabb describes our self-centerdness so accurately, and gives such realistic examples of the pitfalls we find ourselves trapped in. Fortunately he also gives examples of how to avoid common mistakes. His description of marriage as our chance to minister exclusively to our spouses and provide tangible evidence of God's love to each other is accurate and helpful.

He also says that you must deal with people's urgent perceived needs before they can hear a larger message - this is straight out of the book of James - if you try to preach the gospel to a starving man, how could or why would he listen to you?

I think it is an excellent resource for married couples as an enrichment tool or as a counseling tool."},{"Title":"The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples","review":"\\"The Marriage Builder\\" by Dr. Larry Crabb has become something of a classic in the genre of Christian books on husband-wife relationships. In it, Crabb highlights three relational areas: the couple's spiritual relationship to God, their social/soul relationship to one another, and their physical relationship to each other. When dealt with properly, and in priority order, Crabb asserts that relationships will be healthy (not necessarily happy, since that is not God's goal nor guarantee for life this side of heaven).Discussing the spiritual relationship, Crabb explains that when God cleanses sin through salvation, His grace simultaneous quenches the deepest thirsts in the human soul. Rather than beings some new-age mantra as some claim when they critique Crabb, the concept of longings, desires, thirsts, and hunger is both biblical and historical (church history). The Trinitarian God of the Bible created humanity in His relational image. Since human beings are finite, they will always long for the infinite--for God's infinite holy love.Once a husband and wife have come to understand that all they need is God and what He chooses to provide, Crabb notes that then they can quit the old \\"tic on a dog\\" relationship of mutual manipulation. Instead, they can begin a relationship of mutual ministry.In this area, Crabb explores God's essential design for the masculine and feminine soul. He posits that males have a deep social longing for respect, which coincides with Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5. Crabb also explains that females have a deep social longing for intimacy, also correlating with Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5.As couples learn to drink fully from the God of the universe and to serve one another \\"heapin' helpins'\\" of respect and intimacy, then they are prepared to experience body oneness (not simply fun sex). One in their walk with God, one in their relationship with each other, now they move toward physical oneness.\\"The Marriage Builder\\" is a classic because it remains true to God's classic teaching on relationships. We are spiritual beings designed to worship God; we are social beings designed to mutually minister to and intimately connect with one another; and we are physical beings, designed in the state of marital matrimony, to experience body oneness.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends,\\" and the forthcoming, \\"Beyond the Suffering: The Story of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\""},{"Title":"The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples","review":"Although I have not read the book in its entirety, quotes from Larry's book are used extensively in my Promise Keeper's study, and we all agree that he is the one writer who consistently causes us to pause and reflect...and most often to change the way we view and treat our wives."},{"Title":"The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples","review":"I found the book quite a help. It concentrates on getting your head straight about a relationship that's bound to have issues. But a warning: it's not a &quot;handy fix-it&quot; for relationships. Nor is it a how-to, to minister to a spouse with problems. It focuses on personal responsibilities and ministry and (by inference) where those responsibilities cross into influence and then manipulation.As far as I could tell, there was no heavy pressuring into traditional roles in the book. What it did say is that there are limits in the marriage relationship: in what you can reasonably expect from a partner, and in what you can do to make things happen. There is no handy way of &quot;doing stuff&quot; to make a marriage perfect. But there is still a realistic approach to your responsibilities and ministries in a relationship."},{"Title":"The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples","review":"I've read quite a few marriage and relationship books during my long engagement.

He's not the first guy nor will he be the last to do so. It was actually refreshing to read about a man who didn't have the confidence but didn't fake it by being cold or what we like to label men as most, a dog. He didn't go around making other women pay for Pearl's abuse--which was also refreshing. Bobby just needed to grow up in his own time and he did that. I enjoyed this book.

Bobby found out later that he had what he needed all the time !As the saying goes he was looking for love and it was right before him but to blind to see it !Way to go Bobby ,hold on its's coming! While I gave this story 3*'s it was actually 3.5 or 3.8 * !! This was one of the better stories I enjoyed by Omar"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I am an avid reader of African-American books. I must say that this book was very interesting. It shows from a man's point of view how he feels and his insecurites. I felt that Omar showed that in this book. I was very impressed about the types of relationships that the character had in the book with different types of women and how he felt about these women. I must say that i was very surprised about the ending of the book (you have to read and find out). For you nice guys out there, you may finishg last, but you finish good."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Despite all of the negative reviews of this book, I thought it was pretty good. Maybe it has something to do with me growing up in D.C. and graduating from Howard U. I think adults, who has experienced similiar situations as the character Bobby Dallas, could relate to his trials and triumphs."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"If you are a man in search of the perfect woman, yet you don't know exactly what you are looking for (but you know you are looking for it), then A DO RIGHT MAN is the book for you. Overall, the main character was interesting enough to keep me glued to the story, however, his indecision about the women in his life gave me a slight headache. He had no specific clue about what he was looking for in a mate and it truly cast him in a slightly wimpy light. Overall, his rise to the top and his adventures in radioland held my interest and rooted for him when he finally made it. A leisurly read on slow days."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I LIKE ALL OF HIS BOOKS BECAUSE I READ THEM ALL BUT OTHERWISE I THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE KNOWN AS A VERY GOOD WRITER AND AN ALL TIME FAVORITE FOR EVERYONE I RECOMMEND HIM TO ALL THE PEOPLE THE BOOKS ARE GREAT. BUT AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO JUDGE FIRST AND THIS BOOK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO THINKS THAT THEY ARE WEAK OKAY IF YOU ARE OFFENDED IM SORRY BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONFUSION PROBLEM I MEAN THIS BOOK IS A GOOD LAUGH AND SETTLER ITS MAINLY ABOUT DECISION MAKING OK THANK YOU"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"the book was boring. the doright man need to get right"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"the book was boring. the doright man need to get right"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I loved Flyy Girl, so I was expecting more from Tyree's second novel. Instead I found a generic, the-one-who-got-away type read. I didn't particularly like or care about the main character, so it was difficult to get into the book. It actually put me off of Tyree's work, and I haven't read any of his since. So don't read this, if it's your first Omar Tyree. Read Flyy Girl."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Well, after reading Flyy Girl i was compelled to look for more of Omar's work.The title of the book really took me by surprise, but the thickness of its content really discouraged me from reading. I'm a straight to the point, type of woman, but I decided to give it a chance. When I started reading it all my friends were like you are too young to be reading a book with this title. I'm looking at them like, you can never be too young to read about reality. To me, Bobby Dallas represents a goal oriented brother, with a heart of gold, looking for his soulmate.All of his actions taught him a valuable lesson and I was really pleased with how he described the different women. His descriptions made me laugh because theres different types of women/men and he definately touched base with this.The ending, crucial. I was glad Faye &amp; him got together but at the same time, it didn't come as a surprise to me. I was't disappointed in the ending, but I didn't like it being obvious. Faye represented all the qualities of a good woman, and she was the perfect mate which was why it was all to easy to figure out.I'd like for him to follow up on a part 2!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I loved fly girl and could not wait for A DO RIGHT MAN to come out. and when it did the store is where it should of stayed."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"What was he thinking about when he wrote this one. Bobby was such a ridiculous whimp it was pathetic. He acted like he was scared of his new girlfriend \\"PEARL\\". Then he was scared of Faye finding out about Pearl.Don't writ e anymore books like this one ever. I love some of his new books. I have all of his books this one did nothing for me.I LOVED FLYY GIRL."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This was the first book that I read by Omar Tyree. The story seemed to drag on and was difficulty to get into and stay focus. It took me about three months to finish it, but I was determined to do it. The story line was too slow, and some it seemed far fetched. Especially, when Bobby's income hit the hundred thousand dollar range as a talk show host. I was glad that he got back together with Faye, but her being pregnant was unnecessary. They should have just gotten married."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I didn't get into Fly Girl that much. I did pick up on Omar Tyree's writing style. He is a bit wordy and very discriptive. Sometimes it seems like a waste of paper...but this novel was pretty good. It was a thick and wordy book, but once you get to the end, you will appreciate it. Omar is very descriptive when it come to sights, sounds, and feelings, and it is very easy to get into the book and put yourself right in scenario. Booby Dallas is a funny man who does make the wrong choices even though they point him to the right choices. A very good book, but if I were Omar's editor, there were a couple chapter that weren't necessary and would've made the book a pleasent, intermediate reading book. How long did it take me to read? 4 weeks. Way to long...but the ending kind of made up for that. OMAR, YOU SHOULD REALLY WRITE A FOLLOW UP OR SOMETHING TO THIS BOOK. BOBBY DALLAS' LIFE IS ONLY BEGINNING."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I'm usually not a critic to many authors, but this is the first book I read and it took about a month to read and that's only because I'm in a book club. It was nice to hear a man's point of view and see that he came to some positive conclusions on how he should take chances with women, but all that it took to get him there. I'm glad he doesn't speak for all men because I would never find a mate. It just makes me wonder if Mr. Tyree is speaking from experience."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"A Do Right Man was an okay book. It was kinda boring, especially all those radio interviews. I also thought that Bobby was a huge punk. Mostly throughout the book I was just thinking &quot;I wish it would hurry up and end&quot; 'cause it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Flyy Girl was definitely much better. Anyway, check this book out from the library, but don't waste your money on it. It's not worth it. Believe me, after reading it, you'll thank me. To Mr. Tyree: Flyy Girl was great, but you got a little lost in A Do Right Man. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I think the book was alright, in the beginning it looked like it was going places, it just got so lax, to where I felt pressure to finish reading the book. I can't just pick up another book and start reading it, so it took all my might to finish reading this book. OOOH, Bobby Dallas was a &quot;Do Right Man&quot;."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I did not like this book at all!!! I only finished it b/c I paid money for it and didn't want to waste my money. Bobby was the biggest cry baby that I have ever seen (or not seen since I read about him). All he did was make excuses and blame everyone else for his lack of a spine. It is possible to be a MAN w/o being the whimp that Bobby was and w/o being a dog. I was very disappointed in this book, especially b/c I loved Mr. Tyree's debut novel _Flyy Girl_. I gave the book 2 stars b/c it was well written, but I hated the story and the main character."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"All the right elements were there: the NY, Washington DC/ Howard Univ. settings, an interesting career, NBA players, and more. Unfortunately, Tyree didnt seem to know what to do with them. The result was a flat, boring and one dimensional story with a weak, naive and frankly, stupid main character. I hated Flyy Girl and thought that this book might change my perceptions of the author and his work. Unfortunately, it only served to confirm what I already thought. I don't think I'll be reading any more of his books."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment. I read Flyy Girl and I thought that is was really a great read. When I purchased A Do Right Man little did I know I was wasting my time and money. The characters were unimaginative and boring. I don't know any men like Bobby Dallas. What a wimp! I hope that Mr. Tyree's next book Single Mom is better, however I have learned my lesson with this book and I'll wait for the paperback to come out."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This was my first time reading a book by Omar Tyree and I'm not sure I want to read something else by him!! It left a lot to be desired. The main character, Bobby Dallas was not fresh or exciting. I have met a few people like Bobby, but NO ONE I would ever want to read about. The title does not fit the book. From the title alone I expected a lot more. If you're looking for good books from good african-american male writers, try Eric Jerome Dickey and E. Lynn Harris."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I was extremly disappointed in this book. I really enjoyed Flyy Girl and waited anxiously for this book. I thought this book was slow and the main character was boring. I could barely finish it. I didn't care about the characters and cared even less about what happened to them."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Before I read this book, I had never read a romance novel by a male author. For some reason, I always thought they could not possibly &quot;understand&quot; women and write a good story without making men look like &quot;the almighty&quot;. A Do Right Man, proved me that I was wrong about male authors. It was a great story and I could relate to many of the characters. I recommend this book to anyone who believes in second chances."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The last Omar Tyree book i read was &quot;Flyy Girl&quot; and i loved it, so i thought it would be a good thing to keep reading all of his books. And what do you know i stumbled on &quot;A do right Man&quot; on sale for ....at a local book store. To start with i was already looking for the book and second of all i was thrilled with the price. But when i started reading it i was quickly turned off. It was so boring from the beginning and i didn't even finish it because i just couldn't keep reading it. And maybe it was above my level i'm 16 and i've read &quot;Chocolate Star&quot;, &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot; and so i'm not sure if age is an issue here i just think it was a boring book. I know not one of his best works."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"In what seemed like a lifetime, I finally finished, \\"A Do Right Man.\\" I will admit, I grew quite attached to the main character, Bobby Dallas, but it became increasingly difficult to finish the book. Overall, I found it quite interesting to learn about love and life from a man's perspective. We do need to have more books like these from author Omar Tyree and E. Lynn Harris."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This was the first book I read by this author. It had so much promise in the beginning.Maybe it's me but it appears to me that at the end of the book Mr.Tyree noticed he was down to his last 7 sheets of paper and had to wrap it up ASAP. Get my drift?In addition to that the main character was a wuss. He was way to soft. Now HE was someone who needed to see the Wizard of Oz to get an immunization against being a wuss."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The introduction was okay, but totally misleading raising my expectation of the story a little too high. By the second chapter I was sorely tempted to put the book to one side. It wasn't that it didn't have a good storyline, it did, it was just how it was written, too much detail on areas of no relevance i.e. type of drink, and after a while it seemed like the author had digressed and kept struggling to get back to the plot. It started getting better towards the end of the story, but for me that was too little too late. Omar Tyrees' other novel 'Flyy Girl' was recommended to me, as I couldn't get hold of it in time I picked this one, I'm still going to give it a second try and get my original choice and see how that goes."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The character of Bobby was definitely one of the more recognizable characters I've seen in a book. He is intelligent, yet lacks confidence and the drive to really get what he wants.Not only in his relationships, but also in his career, he takes a back seat and just watches what happens. It's when he finally takes control and defines his goals, things start to happen.Bobby Dallas is truly a portrait of a &quot;good black man.&quot; Someone who agonizes over his mistakes, and ultimately doesn't like to rock the boat.I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a decent read. If you are looking for a typical sistahgurlplot, you will be a little disappointed. This mostly a study in character."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This book was certainly worth my time to read it and the money . The character of Bobby Dallas was somewhat realistic and I think that most women have come across someone like him intheir life the good guy who usually gets no play, but you know that he will treat you the way you would like or at least claim you want to be treated but in this book the good guy seems to come out on top. Definitely a good follow up to Flyy girl."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Look out Tom Joyner, The Radio Man is Comin"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"IT'S ABOUT TIME TO READ ABOUT POSITIVE BLACK MALE.

Once you start reading it, you have to keep reading till the end. This is an interesting look at the male side of dating. This book takes an interesting look at a young man and the way he is treated by woman and his becoming a responsible man. This book should definitely be read by males and females."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The book was great. I read the entire book in one rainy weekend. I resent the comparisons to Flyy Girl. While it was a great book also, these are two entirely different stories. Frankly, I appreciate a writer who diversifies his lead characters and themes. Also, the book gave a really good realistic view of the ups and downs one encounters in the communications field and the inner workings of that field. I appreciate a book I can learn something from as this. It takes a caring,sensitive man to tune into the feelings of the lead character. I can hardly wait for Mr. Tyree's next book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I read Omar Tyree first book flyy girl and it was truly flyy. This book a do right man is not what was no way near the excitement and fun that was contained in flyy girl.

What was so do right about Bobby Dallas? He was the typical black man IMO. He ended up with a great job and salary and only THEN did he decide that HE was ready to settle down and Faye was supposed to be with it. NOT!He played a couple of different women, was dishonest, and less than \\"right\\".I only finished the book because I spent my hard owned money on it. This book was ENTIRELY too slow. It's like, please get to the point Omar Tyree. After this, I believe I am finished supporting him and his less than stellar novels. I only wish that I hadn't spent money on a black man writing about how hard it is for another black man out there in the dating and professional world when I can get that same sob story at any local hangout. SAVE IT and SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT BOOK. TYREE SHOWS US THAT WOMEN ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO GOES THROUGH PAIN. MEN DO THE SAME.

In college Bobby and his best friend Faye had a liking for one another okay why they didn't get it on? At the end of the book they finally get together! The details about working in the radio industry was really interesting and I guess Omar was trying to get across how hard it is to be a &quot;black male&quot; but it failed in my opinion! The character just came across as simple not as struggling to learn he didn't have the backbone he was a gentleman but at what cost? I loved Single mom but I haven't picked up anything else by Omar."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Since this was the first time I read something by Mr. Tyree, I found this book to be very good. I liked the writing from the male perspective. I also like the fact that Bobby realized that the key to a good relationship was a good friendship, which was what he had with Faye and that a good relationship can't be based on looks and the other stuff that Pearl was about. I loved the conversation he had with Abdul in the restaurant when Abdul was talking about making things fit when they really don't, which is what a lot of men do.Excellent read. Can't wait to read Flyy Girl and Single Mom."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Its about about time an author wrote a good book about a regular around da way guy. Bobby Dallas was portrayed as that type of guy , but he had to learn how to be a man thru the ups and downs of his radio career and with his experience with women. I also liked how his younger brother Brad played a role in how he became a man; he became more responsible and finally realized that the only way he could ever be happy was to settle down with a REAL BLACK WOMAN .

It was interesting near the end how Bobby finally met up with Pearl and how her attitude and life changed. What amazed me most about the story was that Bobby finally realized that his true love was Faye and how they finally realized that at the end. Bobby had a lot of maturing to do and by having his younger brother settle down earlier than him taught him how to be a real man."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I liked &quot;A Do Right Man&quot; just as much as &quot;FLyy Girl.&quot; I found it to be tremendously entertaining. At a few points in the book I think I even developed a crush on the main character, Bobby Dallas. Bobby Dallas' &quot;coming of age&quot; was filled with realistic ups and downs. This story showed that men actually do have feelings, plus it gave us (women) some insight as to how and why some men handle relationships."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I like to get into the lives of characters and Mr. Tyree gave me a chance to do this.

I found the story extremely slow, and the main character, Bobby Dallas, rather boring. The book needed an editor to &quot;punch up&quot; the story line, ie add some conflict, tension, scandal, etc. to engross the reader. As is, it was a challange to finish the novel, simply because I didn't care what happened next.I also found it hard to believe that this was the authors' fourth novel.

Omar Tyree is definitely a master at his craft, he gets into his characters minds and gives us well rounded males and females. I was very interested in Bobby Dallas, his career and relationships.

He was a pushover and he was boring. I went to a HBCU and there weren't any guys like that, I guarantee. The book was a good go-to-the-gym-and-ride-the-bike kind of book. Omar Tyree has done much better than this."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This book was totally delightful in its portrayal of colorful, yet down to earth characters. The book manages to gain and hold your attention. I could not put it down. It was interesting to read about a man facing common dating issues that woman also face. Especially Black woman -- looking for a good, true love. It is good to know that there are still men who have goals and ambitions, yet they share a common denominator with women --insecurites and fears along the journey to discover self and ones niche in this world of confusion and miscommunication. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a laugh and feel an honest soul along the way."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This was my first time reading Omar Tyree's work. Although I feel Bobby's character was well developed. I did tire of his whiny attitude. It got somewhat boring!!! It's like this, Bobby, did not miss his water until the well ran dry. In other words, he realized after turning away from Faye for Pearl that he had made the wrong choice. Hey, we all do sometime. However, I am happy he realized who his soul mate was and got it together!! O.K.!!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The development of each character in this story was presented smoothly and right on time. There was not one question as to who was being discussed or the need to place them in the story when they appeared.I'm waiting for the next book by Mr. Tyree with great anticipation."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"'Do Right Man', Bobby D was typical, a little naive and confused. I never really got the feeling that HE knew what he wanted in a relationship. I didn't think he a was wimp, his character displayed a warm and sensitive man, just unsure about the best direction for his personal life. Some people take longer to mature than others, it was as if he was waiting for something to happen. The story was a little slow in spots, I was surprised since he determined that Faye was his 'soulmate', that he never even tried to locate her. Don't know if I like Faye's getting pregnant but, realisticly things do happen. The book showed a lot of strong Black men, that was a plus. I really did enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The amazing thing about this book is that I felt thay I truly understood Bobby Dallas. His trials and tribulations (although certainly not his naivete) are a good view of the other side of relationships. I laughed, cried, and even fumed when he didn't seem to be able to see Pearl and Faye for the women they were.I agree with the reviewer who was thrown off balance by Faye's pregnancy--it sort of gave a rushed, and-they-lived-happily-ever-after ending to what was otherwise an engaging, funny, and timely story. I especially loved the fact that despite what he went through professionally and personally, Bobby never lost that modest quality that grabbed me from the first page and kept me enthralled to the last word. Good job, Omar Tyree!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This is the second book that I read by Omar Tyree and I will say that it was better written and had a lot less cursing in it than Flyy Girl but the plot moved along very slowly. Omar told an intesting story of how Bobby Dallas climbs the ladder in the radio industry while having to &quot;watch his back&quot; from some of the other people in the radio business. The other sub plot involved his feelings for Faye, the lady in his life that he let get away after falling for another woman (Pearl). I found the book worth reading but parts of the book just seemed to drag on taking away from the overall enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This book was so so so so good. My aunt put me on to reading books, with my first one being Flyy Girl. That book was great too. I picked up this book in the store saying to my self, I sure do need a do right man.

His name is Bobby Dallas. Bobby graduates from college in he profession of radio talk show. Bobby has everything a good man could ever want except a good woman by his side. After the heart-shattering breakup with his first love he is running in between jobs and woman for along while. As Bobby becomes more successful in his career he starts to make a lot of plans for his future in his professional, as well as his personal life. With those intentions he tries to mend broken relationships but he finds out that being a man that does right is not at all easy.I like this book and I would strongly recommend people to read it. This book is well written and even though its fiction the kind of situations that the character in this novel runs into is things that we can experience in everyday life. Once you pick this book up it will be hard to put it down."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Granted, this novel deserves props because it centers a GOOD black man--something African Amercian fiction, and society in general--seem to avoid. The subject matter is fine. It is the book itself that disappointed me. I'm not even going to compare it to his better novel, Flyy Girl, because the mark of a good writer is being able to write about different topics. But &quot;A Do Right Man&quot; seemed to be lacking something. Perhaps it is depth. I mean, Bobby's whole basis on becoming a man stemmed from his career and relationships with women. His situation with his disapproving mother is glossed over in favor for his love life. The old (and effective) writing tool &quot;show, don't tell&quot; isn't used at all. We can tell Bobby is successful; there's no need for the author to spell it out. We can tell Bobby has bad luck with women; we don't need that spelled out, either. There isn't any descriptions of settings; in fact, there is a great lack of description of any kind. And yes, Bobby has career struggles, but they last about the length of two pages. And his relationship with Faye pre-Pearl is so short lived, how are the readers supposed to feel bad when their friendship breaks down? Sure, we are told that they were close, but it's hard to believe considering we never get to see it and decide for ourselves. My imagination was so inactive during this book. It is not one of those &quot;can't put down&quot; reads. I had to force myself to finish it just because I paid for it. It is a tedious read. More like &quot;can't pick up!&quot;"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"&quot;A Do Right Man&quot; was a great book! I couldn't stop reading! Bobby was the man thru out the WHOLE book just like in real life you have your ups and downs with careers and relationships. I guess I can really relate because I've been divorced for 3 yrs now and haven't found that &quot;Soul Mate&quot; yet and I think about past relationships that I let slip right on by! So, Omar keep up the good work about the good single men that are still out there and for now I'm getting ready to read &quot;Single Mom&quot; which that I am. GOOD LUCK!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Well, first the compliment. I really appreciated knowing some of the insecurities that men go through. That part of the book was ok. But, overall, the book moved too slow. Those of you who have not read the book, don't worry, nothing I could say will spoil the ending. At first it was ok, I figured that eventually he would get to the good parts. I kept turning the page expecting something exciting to happen. I was truly disappointed in the way in which he handled Pearl Davis. That relationship truly got on my nerves! The ending of the book was very uneventful. Also, I did not have to know, word for word, about all of the radio interviews that he conducted. That was sooo boring. And, what did taking vacations by himself have to do with anything? We didn't need a blow by blow of what he did on vacation, especially since he didn't take anyone. Needless to say, something was definitely missing. I haven't read Flyy Girl and I don't know if I feel like reading it. I'm hoping that the latest book will be a lot better. I have been keeping a journal for 15 years and I've had more twists and turns and exciting things happen than Bobby Dallas. The minute details of cigarettes and types of drinks (that he was unfamiliar with) were totally unnecessary. I am surprised that his editor or agent didn't ask him to redo some sections to add some spice to the book. I now know that I could use my journal and make the bestseller's list. Again, thanks for the insight on a good man's thoughts (though sometimes he was TOO weak, yes I said it!) but no thanks for the uneventful 10 years of his boring life!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The \\"Do Right Man\\" by Omar Tyree was good, but move rather slow. However, I did enjoy the book thoroughly, because it dealt with some reality that other books do not address. The reality I am speaking of in which I can relate to is the main character Bobby Dallas whom is struggling with the development of his career and finances. So many authors create this perfect utopia where nobody has problems with money or their career, and their biggest problem is finding that perfect \\"soulmate\\".I was interested in how Pearl Davis would finally get what was coming to her for dumping Bobby the way she did and not really giving him a second thought. However, the author did not go into that which I wanted to know more than anything."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"After reading a lot of books that portrait the other side of brothers, it refreshing to see one came along that got the positive side. Omar really tells it straight, You can be cool and still be a good man. Hip-hop hooray. You would find it hard to put this book down once you started."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I am usually a fast reader (a book a day)when not working. But this book took me forever to get through. The main character was just too tempermental and just didn't appeal to me at all. I thought it would NEVER end. Not a good effort at all."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"After hearing so much about Mr. Tyree, I was anxious to start on the novel as soon as I got home from the bookstore. Unfortunately, about 3 chapters into the book, I was already disappointed in what I was reading. The author has no real lyrical style and his dialouge was mundane. Since the majority of the book was dialouge, it was extremely slow reading for me. All in all, a disappointment."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I read this book a while back and decided that I finally had the time to write about it now. This was one of the slowest moving books i have ever read. T he plot was decent but te author spent a good 10 pages elaborating on every detail of Bobby's life and his rise to fame. After a while it just became unbearable and I had to stop. If you have a hig patience novel and like reading roundabout novels then this one is made jst for you."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This was a good read, I liked the ending even though the storybegan to slow down in the middle. I am not sure if I would read it again."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life.I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down. I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him. I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a \\"Do Right Man\\" at all, but rather a wimp. During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did. From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job. This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"YOu know a book is good when you can put it down. Its nice to know that E.J.Dickey is not the only brother who can write!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This book started off slow. But it had its good parts. Bobby an inspiring radio host is so confused. He has a girlfriend that he is scared of and she just does him wrong. I don't think the males would agree with the way he handled it, until the end. But the book was ok to read. I don't want to say it was bad but it was cool."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I really loved this book.This book takes you through a ride of trying and going after dreams.I enjoyed reading this book.Excellent book,with a very happy ending."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"As a black professional male, I can truly relate to the career and relationship struggles of the main character (Bobby Dallas) of this book. I commend Omar Tyree for portraying a brother who does have aspirations of wife, family, and the house on the hill. Certain portions of the novel are slow and should have detailed the family and female relationships of Bobby Dallas' life versus the caveats of the radio industry. However, this was a pretty good book and I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"It has been a very long time since I have been fortunate enough to read such an excellent book about African-American males. Omar Tyree is a great writer and this book really speakes to the community. I think he should keep up the great work and continue to write some more great books like this!!!!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Bobby Dallas is a hard working man who makes all efforts to do the right thing. Bobby faces career challenges and dating obstacles. Despite what is happening in his life, Bobby is on that quest for the right woman who will love and appreciate all that he gives to a relationship.This is a well written book with a plot that keeps you entertained."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I loved this book!! Omar Tyree is a truly gifted and intelligent writer. As a black woman, I can identify with the &quot;changes&quot; Bobby Dallas goes through in the book. As Tyree skillfully guides Bobby through all of the trials and tribulations that life often brings, you realize that Tyree is an author who does not need to uplift his male character at the expense of the opposite sex. Thank you Omar!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I thought that this book was an improvement on Flyy Girl. Tyree gives his readers characters that are believable and human. Inconsistency is a common human characteristic so I don't understand why so many people were put off by Faye's actions. Bobby Dallas is not only believable, but likeable as well. Good job!!!!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Do Right Man&quot; by Omar Tyree. The male perspective of the story, was especially refreshing to me considering most of the books especially about black relationships are from a female perspective. And many women readers know, Men (esp. Black men)in literature, are not always portrayed in a favorable light.I do agree with my other &quot;sistahs&quot; in the respect of Faye's character (since everyone's else's review gave away the ending.) beoming impreganted at the end of the story was not at all what I would have expected and kind of threw me off but all in all it was a good book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Omar Tyree sheds a great deal of light on the male perspective of interpersonal relationships. He reveals the thoughts and feelings of a man merely looking for what we all want; happiness. His character, Bobby Caldwell, is not perfect. Its refreshing to see inside a man's struggles with his decisions and choices, his guilt in choosing between what is right and what feels good and to see what he is thinking as he wrestles with the conflict between his heart and his hormones. I think his exploration of the emotional growth of this college student into a grounded and centered man is well worth the cover price. I read it in three days and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys books which explore relationships."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I read this book a while ago and felt that it could not compare to his first book. I loved Flyy Girl!!!! This book moved entirely too slow and by the end I had to force myself to finish it. I did not like the character Bobby Dallas. I wish you better success with your next book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Overall, this was a good book. I really enjoyed reading the man's side of things for a change. And yes people, there are people out there like Bobby Dallas. He was a good man but messed with a few too many woman at one point of the book. And like many others, I feel that Faye's character was too strong for her to end up pregnant before they were married. Please don't stop other viewers comments to discourage you from reading this book. It really was good."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I found it very hard to put down. Omar Tyree's style and content kept me turning the pages. He admirably covered various aspects of relationships between friends, lovers, co-workers, family and soulmates. I going to go back and read all his books now. I don't care what they say in Columbus, Ohio, this book was the bomb."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Tyree did a wonderful job of portraying this black man's story. It was a rare opportunity to get a male's insight on the woes of being young, black ,and single. Stories like this give hope that there are still good men and you can find your true love. Tyree also does an amazing job of capturing the intricacies of having a carrer in media. The book holds insight for both men and women."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I don't think Omar Tyree's depiction of Bobby Dallas was very realistic. He seemed to be a real wimp. My bookclub read this book and none of us liked it. Furthermore, Faye was a very strong, independent character. Why did he have her character get pregnant before they were married? Was she trying to trap him or was she just plain stupid when it came to birth control? The ending seemed to be thrown together, not very well thought out. Better luck next time Omar."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The book was great. I read the entire book in one rainy weekend. I resent the comparisons to Flyy Girl. While it was a great book also, these are two entirely different stories. Frankly, I appreciate a writer who diversifies his lead characters and themes. Also, the book gave a really good realistic view of the ups and downs one encounters in the communications field and the inner workings of that field. I appreciate a book I can learn something from as this. It takes a caring,sensitive man to tune into the feelings of the lead character. I can hardly wait for Mr. Tyree's next book."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I read this book a while ago and thought it was nothing compared to his first book, Flyy Girl. A Do Right Man moves entirely too slow. I had to force myself to finish the book. I did not care for Bobby Dallas. I wish you better success with your next novel."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I thought the author wasted his readers time w/a character like Bobby Dallas. If the author thought Bobby was a 'Do Right Man' he needs to go back and talk to some 'real men'. I felt his character was a chump and didn't deserve Faye. When she turned from a smart, intelligent woman to an idiot by getting pregnant, he compromised her character. Since his main character was such a dismal failure the two of them deserved each other. Next time I'll wait on the paperback if or when it gets to the library."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"My Book Club just finished discussing this book and overall we were disappointed. This book is really pegged as a book dealing with relationships from a male point of view but it really dealt more with Bobby's Radio career than anything else. We initially liked Faye's character because she was very strong, independent and career oriented but at the end when she was suddenly pregnant, that didn't sit very well with us. She certainly didn't need to trap Bobby at that point and it didn't make sense that she would intentionally get pregnant before they got married. It seemed as if the ending was just thrown together with very little thought. I hope the next book is better."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"What Happened Omar? Flyy Girl was great but this one left a lot to be desired. Poor Bobby Dallas does not represent the men I know. Where did he come from? The land of the spineless? Stick to what works for you. I still look forward to Single Mom, (your next book) so hurry and redeem yourself because as of now, I want a refund and an apology for wasting my time!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"After reading Flyy Girl, (which I enjoyed) I was curious what Mr. Tyree would do with a book strictly involving adults. I wasn't too disappointed. I liked how he showed a more vulnerable side of black males, in contrast to the way many of them were portrayed in Flyy Girl. Also I went to an HBCU, so I could totally relate with the whole New York vs Down South vibe between Pearl and Faye. On the flip side, the tedious explanations and conversations surrounding the radio industry really slowed the plot down for me. As a former broadcast major, I agree Mr. Tyree gave an accurate description of the business. However, in-depth analysis of it made for a less enjoyable read. Otherwise, the main character was likable, and I was definitely invested in his journey throughout. Not so sure i'll read it again, but glad I finished it and saw Bobby's progression all the way to the end."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Flyy Girl and A Do Right Man are his best novels. Pecking Order is good too, but I'd read A Do Right Man over again."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This is my 2nd book by Omar and I was not impressed at all. I read \\"Leslie\\" sometime last year and didn't like it but I thought that I would try another one of his book. This story was very slow moving, to many details regarding \\"Radio\\". Did not like."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I thought this book was not as bad as some of these reviews suggest. I didn't think there needed to be a \\"point\\" Tyree needed to prove but that it was interesting enough just following this man's life story.I bought it at an airport and read most of it on my roundtrip flights. It kept my attention, except toward the last 1/4 of the book.It is nice to see a book about black people just dealing with relationships, life, and managing themselves. Much better than having to use graphic sexuality to maintain reader's interest as I've noticed a lot of authors doing."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I got this book on audio and i must say it was a great listen. I didn't feel like having to read through the whole thing i figure that would take about a week, but i finished the audio tapes in 1 day. It was like you could see everything that was happening unfold right in front of your eyes by listening to it. THis is a great portrayal of the dating scene at times i found some of the situations he went through were some of the same as the ones i went through."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"couldnt get into this one , and i am a fan. disappointment!"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS PRETTY GOOD. IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO UNDERSTAND WERE HE WAS COMING FROM. I BELIEVE FAYE WAS A GOOD PERSON FOR HIM."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"I'm not much of a book reader, but \\"A Do Right Man\\" shook me up. After reading the first few pages it I couldn't put it down. Bobby Dallas is a young black man in search of love and happiness. Although he gets a few set backs he ends up right on top. Despite his love losses, his money problems, he did what he had to do. Omar, you're doing a great job. We need more positive black authors that we can relate to. I look forward to reading more of your work."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"The author does a good job of showing us why Bobby is a &quot;do right man&quot; while keeping him human. The most enjoyable part of the book for me was the truly honest thoughts that went through Bobby's mind. It was interesting to see things through the male perspective.I would definitely recommend the book"},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Contrary to the negativity of other reviewers I think this is an excellent book. Not all books have to be page-turners, keeping us running from one romance or love scene to the next. Those who want that, or who want to savor romance will be disappointed. But this is a great read of a young man moving from school age to maturity and marraige. I think its a MUST read for young men. It throws in many gems of advice along the way. This is needed. Back when I was coming up there was nothing like this around, although there were the classics: James Baldwin, Malcolm X, Richard Wright, etc. But Omar's book is contemporary and very easy to read. No, the sudden surge in the subject's income is not something that happens every day, but it does happen. There ARE young people who make fabulous incomes. Unrealistic? What about the livestyles in Waiting to Exhale? And remember, this is a novel. If the subject of a light novel is struggling financiallly all his life do you think alot of people would be reading it? Remember the dittie: Romance without Finance is a Nuisance! I find it great that this tells the story of a young person working in a particular industry - in this case Radio. There are analogies and comparisons and contrasts to be made with other careers or industries. I would like to see a novel such as this involving other fields as well. Finally, I would say that our subject doesn't provide a surfeit of detailed page-turning romance throughout the novel since he was waiting for his &quot;soul-mate&quot; before giving us the close-up. Had he examined and described in detail each of his 30 prior affairs then he would have been merely bragging, and cheapening the meaning of real romance. Perhaps if I had read Fly Girl and/or Single Mom as did many of the other reviewers I would have a different perspective. Or perhaps the gender is the determinant of the perspective here."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"This is the first book I read by Omar Tyree. A Do Right Man, featured many obstacles and complete details on how rough it is to face society with all of its ups and downs. The main character Bobby Dallas is a senior at Howard University, who is in love with the most sophisticated, and popular girl on campus; Pearl Davis. Bobby Dallas also has a long term friendship with a fellow student, Faye Butler. Faye has a deep secret crush on Bobby, but can't bring herself to tell Bobby how she feels. After graduation Bobby moves to The Big Apple with his sweetheart Pearl and they come across some hard and difficult times. Bobby is having a hard time with the economics of his dream job. His girlfriend Pearl is not around when he needs her, ever since her modeling career took off and came into action. Bobby cannot keep up with Pearl's whereabouts and he's worried about the type of life she's living (The Fast Life). After Pearl breaks off the relationship between her and Bobby, Bobby is broken hearted, but he was expecting for this type of situation to happen sooner or later. Bobby Dallas was wondering how he was going to live without Pearl, keeping up with the rent and handling living alone in a big city. Bobby decides to quit his job and move back to Washington D.C to reunite with his long lost friend Faye Butler. After returning, Faye is not at all interested in Bobby, and Bobby's disappointment takes over him. Bobby is faced with temptation that he cannot resist, but in the end he gets his life together and everything he wanted and dreamed about comes into reality, including Faye. Omar Tyree did a wonderful job in writting this book. I enjoyed the way he went into a lot of details and explained all the actions of the characters. This book deserves two thumbs up. It has charisma, charm, good details and plenty of humor."},{"Title":"A Do Right Man","review":"Yes, this book seemed to drag on.

I read Flyy Girl, which was excellent, but this book wasn't as great. I liked it, and it took you on the main character's journey, and how he grew up from a boy out of college to becoming a man. I have a boyfriend from DC, and that was how I understood the references (A LOT) to the cities he traveled to. You grow to like him, and the end was great...I found myself wishing that he was a real person with a real radio show.

Despite the multitude of books written on and about James and his ideas since, no serious student of William James should be without or ignore this one. It is the Genesis-text, as it were, of Jamesean studies.Perry organizes and effectively analyzes the whole array of James' diverse writings (including reprints of some tremendous and now otherwise difficult to find selections), enabling any reader to obtain a comprehensive and detailed understanding of James' philosophy. At the same time, Perry infects his analysis with a solid and enduring illustration of James's personality, without ever becoming either trite or merely philosophical biography.Perry's own skills as a writer are evident in such passages as the following, which is a most memorable description of the breadth and depth of Jame's character: &quot;[James] called himself empiricist, pluralist, pragmatist, individualist, but whenever he did so he began at once to hanker after the fleshpots of rationalism, monism, intellectualism, socialist. He liked body in his philosophizing, and he hated to leave out anything that had either flavor or nutritive value. He was much more afraid of thinness than he was of inconsistency.&quot;In one or two places, the serious James scholar might have a difference of opinion with Perry's analysis, whether historical or philosophical, but all philosophy texts are susceptible to such criticism, and Perry's is less susceptible than most. Indeed, it will be by treating Perry's text as a sound starting place that the inexperienced or unfamiliar reader might become such an adept analyst and capable of interpreting James' life, character and thought so well."},{"Title":"Thought and Character of William James Briefer Version","review":"William James was as incongruent as his philosophy; and I don't mean this sardonically. He was a lover both of art and science; both of the unity of the whole and the plurality of parts; both of the rationalistic and the sentimental parts of life. It is always suprising to me not that he could be all these things, but how well he balanced them all. Whenever one trait would come to the forefront, James almost instinctively checked it with an equal and opposite impulse.This book gives us a front-row seat to watch James's balancing act up close! By my estimates, a little over half of this book's text is letters either from or to James (by frinecs such as Perice, Holmes, Dewey, Bergson, and his brother Henry). The author does a good job weaving these letters together with biographical infromation; with this mixture, he does two things. He puts James's life in the context of his philosophy (philosophies?) and puts his philosophy(-ies)in the context of his life. The best part, to me, was the author's ability to discouse on each book James wrote integrating its philosophy with the events of James's world at the time.As with most biographies, this one does have a tendency (too much so in my opiinion) to psychologize in ways that, to me, seem stretching. The last two chapters, for instance, on James's &quot;Morbid Traits&quot; and his &quot;Benign Traits&quot; are like a psychological summary of James, often identifying traits James posessed as ones that are hinted at in his works (particularly the Varieties of Religous Experience). While sections like these can be interesting, they can also (as these two are) become overkill. I read the rest of the book (which psychologizes but keeps it to a minimum) and skimmed these two chapters.Otherwise, this s a great biography. Not so intellectual as to be inaccessable to general readers, but not to watered down that we don't both learn new things about James and the philosophic landscape on every page. To put it strangely, to me, James is like a great jazz ballad - the more you come into contact with its intricacies, the more you grow to cherish it. And, I suppose that James is like jazz - emphasizing the individuality of the parts rather than a pre-determined whole. And like a good jazz tune, James's philosophy was never finished - always open ended.So go read the book already."},{"Title":"Thought and Character of William James Briefer Version","review":"Perry's text is the original, definitive expression of William James' philosophy, outside of the writings of James -- a founder father of the philosophical genre of pragmatism, contemporary American social thought and modern psychology -- himself.

While researching the archives of a middle-of-nowhere town called Jericho Flats, she tries to make her path cross that of the long-dead, Gaden Lockyer.&quot;I am compiling a research diary on Gaden Lockyer, a private project since the research on Jericho Flats finished some time ago. I am involved in correspondence with the historical societies of at least six country towns, parliamentary record departments, three coastal newspapers whose morgues I wish to mine and, on a more personal level, an eighty-year-old shearer from Dingo with eyewitness anecdotes.&quot;Her mother is a drummer in an all-women band. Her father is a professional trumpet player who has left Belle's life ever since she was a foetus.From a rather hastened and early marriage, Belle and Seb eventually gains a cold relationship. Soon, Seb starts attracting other women to go in bed with him. Belle calls it the &quot;marital schism&quot;.I find the short and vague sentences of what I considered as the major parts of the plot quite intelligent but sometimes irritating. An example is, the relationship between Belle and Seb wasn't written as important as Belle's obsession with Gaden Lockyer, that is very unique with authors because courting is usually a major focus of most authors.&quot;Seb and I began a relationship of sorts. He takes me to plays and concerts and gallery openings and concerts and gallery openings and lobster dinners at the Gold Coast where my virginity submits at last to his fifteen years seniority at these matters. Thinking I might at this point find my missing centre we achieve a quiet marriage attended by four other archivists and six cataloguers. Mother attended the wedding but in a plaster cast. She had broken her leg falling from the roof of her bush hut as she cleaned the gutters.&quot;However, after rereading some sections over again, I managed to capture the storyline again. It is a well written Australian colloquial novel that attracts the reader from the first paragraph to the last.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good read and doesn't mind a strange plot, a unique style of writing, and difficult obscene descriptions."},{"Title":"Reaching Tin River","review":"In this impeccably controlled novel, prize-winning Australian author Thea Astley combines her irrepressible good humor and wry view of people and the world, telling an offbeat story of feisty characters in search of their spiritual &quot;centers.&quot; Main character Belle grows up on her grandfather's marginally successful sheep farm, Perjury Plains, &quot;outside a lost townlet called Drenchings.&quot; Her assertive but impractical mother Bonnie works as a drummer in an all-girls' band, playing gigs at local church halls and sheep-farming conventions, her absent, trumpet-playing father having sought his own career in the United States.Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, this lonely but remarkably self-sufficient child grows up longing to know what it is like to have a family, a solid, emotional center in her life-&quot;I want love,&quot; she says. As Astley follows her from her birth, at which her grandmother &quot;only just managed to intercept grandfather as he dialed the vet,&quot; through her childhood and eventual marriage, we see Belle choosing friends, forming relationships, and making decisions, always attempting to find someone, real or imagined, who will serve as &quot;a center in which [she] can merge.&quot;Humorous but pithy observations fill this novel as feisty Belle, Bonnie, and their friends make do the best way they can, always hoping that happiness is just around the corner, if only they can free themselves from their present circumstances. Astley astutely manipulates the tone and point of view to match various stages of Belle's life. Belle's flippant and youthfully cynical point of view as a child changes gracefully to a more serious and conventional point of view when she becomes an adult, and to a controlled magic realism when she fantasizes about a character she is researching in her role as an archivist. Unique descriptions abound: Belle describes her mother's alternative lifestyle as &quot;like living in a Longfellow ballad,&quot; and, when she is tired of her husband's smiles, devoutly wishes that &quot;Seb's teeth would go black.&quot; Filled with literary delights, high spirits, and much good sense, this is a novel to savor.

(Volume two which covers the 1941-45 period is in the works).Though much was expected of the Bf 110 - Goering thought of the Zerstorer units as his elite - realistically the twin-engined craft could never compete with modern, single-engined opponents. Nevertheless in the attacks on Poland, Scandinavia and France, Bf 110 crews turned in credible performances in air combat and ground attacks. Used as both a fighter and fighter bomber (with Erpr. Gr. 210) in the Battle of Britain, the 110's inadequacies were brought painfully to light with various ZG units suffering heavy losses.Vasco's book follows the Classic Colours template with many first-hand accounts of air combats, dozens of rare wartime photos, 14 color profiles by Fernando Estanislau and several color photos as well.If you're a fan of Messerschmitt's twin-engined destroyer, you'll enjoy this book.

I wish however it was written by her parents."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This book talks to you on a number of levels from each family members perspective of life to the coming of age of the main character. The author takes you through each event to the point that you live the events yourself. The historical aspects are incredible. How the members of the family survived are a testament of strength. The author inspires you to look at your own life. I could not put the book down and have read it more than once!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Though this is a best-seller, it wasn't really what I expected and did not live up to my expectations. Although the story itself is somewhat captivating at times, the author asked many questions but left them unanswered. Flashing from the past back to moments in her own life was also confusing at times. It was a good book, but I was hoping for more. It was like the author uncovered all of this information about her family, but never found out everything. These gaps led me to ask more questions and wonder what really happened, and left me yearning for more. The story of her parents' lives during and after the war never actually came to an end because not all of the questions were ever answered."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"From today's perspective, it is difficult to comprehend just why a couple who survived the Holocaust would hide their Jewish identify from their daughters for years, insisting that they are Polish Catholic refugees in the USA. This memoir, however, explains how their fear of a repeat pogrom drives them to deny their heritage, keep secret their loss of religious identify, and assuage their horrific memories and guilt at surviving.Fremont and her sister's quest to discover the truth causes their parents much pain, but the author is clear that the family's pain had dominated their lives since birth."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"It has been said that it will still take a long time for modern civilization - and the Jewish collective psyche - to come to terms with the Shoah. Efforts to create a compelling account of something that is utterly unimaginable (and which we would rather not imagine) are inevitably limited by the storyteller's ability to relive the experience and relate it at the same time, as well as the reader's ability to deal with it.Helen Fremont tells the story of her parents' survival as she stitches in together in her minds' eye - based on their cursory accounts and her own imagination. By telling her own story at the same time, she demonstrates the generational effect of her parents' trauma, explaining through example the fact that these things can not be forgotten. And so this becomes a story of identity - of how she learns to integrate her relationship with her sister, her parents' bizarre behavior, and her own sexual orientation into who she is.It is telling that Ms. Fremont's account is so captivating that we find ourselves judging her decisions, especially around other people's privacy. Whether or not we agree with her choices has nothing to do with the quality of her literature, but the story begs an ethical issue: Do we have the right to withhold from our children facts that are important to their sense of identity?After all, the wrong that must be made right is that Ms. Fremont's parents ever felt the need to deny their identity - even as they did so halfheartedly - not that Ms. Fremont decided to reclaim her Jewish identity."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Like peeling an onion! Each page reveals another teary layer of secrets as the author discovers her family's past. What an incredible story of determination and love. I wonder what silent secrets are entwined in my family tree? Highly recommend Ms Fremont's book to all readers."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This book is a story of a daughter and her two parents who were raised in a Roman Catholic family, but she, somehow always felt different. She goes on to find that her parents were Jewish holocaust survivors. Reading about their lives, it put my daily problems into perspective. Her parents were constantly acting and surviving on a daily basis for thier live and and their actions made for a strange childhood for the author, because anything could happen.Her father was a prisoner of war and her mother moved around in other nationalities all because she wanted to survive. After six years, and lots of barriers between them, there parents finally find each other, but they were not the same people that each had fallen in love with because of the war--it had changed them dramatically.The results of their ordeals and the family they raised proved to be some very interesting reading."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I have not yet read this book. I am still amazed how many people survived such horrible times. I am looking forward to another good read."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"After Long Silence by Helen Fremont is the story of how she and her older sister Lara realized over time that both of their parents were Holocaust survivors. The parents, for their own reasons, never told anyone of this fact, especially not their daughters. I found this to be a very interesting book, lots of intrigue and stories you wouldn't believe. It also shows the very destructive power of secrets in a family and how it can affect the relationships in a family. It is amazing how parents don't realize how much information kids can pick up on in a family without specific information. Kids really notice quite a lot. I got quite a lot of feelings from this book, especially lots of anger, but mostly it was quite a story and a good read."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"After Long Silence was recommended to me by a friend who knows that I've been thinking a lot lately about shamed silence. What I'm mulling over in my mind has nothing to do with restraint; restraint suggests self-discipline and control. Shamed silence is not a carefully measured response to a situation, it's what happens when a person is faced with a situation that is incomprehensible. It's cognitive dissonance. It's what happens when fragmented, incomplete thoughts get banished to our psychological dungeon to rot.In After Long Silence, Helen Fremont carries a flickering torch into the dungeon of doom where her family history smolders and fumes, a history that includes her Jewish relatives and the mind-blowing atrocities they were subject to during the WWII holocaust. She interlaces her personal present life as a reluctant Boston attorney and partially-out lesbian with fleeting glimpses into her parent's lives and the lives of lost friends and relatives. But this memoir is not only about the shattering inhumanity that annihilated her family or her sexual orientation. Her chronicles are also about baring witness to the unspeakable.Without sentimentality, in this memoir, Fremont presents both historic and current details as if laying out a case for the reader to judge. What are we being asked to judge? Not the Nazis, the jury has long ago delivered on that horror. Not the choices and sacrifices made by those around her. We are being asked to judge ourselves. Fremont presents through one incisive portrait after another a spectrum of courage that inexorably challenges her readers to place themselves on the continuum.This is a brilliantly crafted memoir. It's sobering, enlightening, infuriating, tender, mysterious, gripping, and it is also funny in parts. She hits on so many human emotions, and that's it's gift to the reader. We get to feel. I believe it is my right as a human being to feel my feelings, to think my thoughts, to speak whatever truth I can. This right becomes a higher calling when considered in opposition to shamed silence.Pearls My Mother Wore"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I applaud Ms Fremont's &quot;out-ing&quot; of the secrets and lies that surrounded her childhood and young adulthood. As a lesbian and an adoptee, my own early life has been replete with secrets and lies -- but no longer. As well, I am closely related to both Holocaust survivors and children of Holocaust survivors. While I agree that exposing these details is painful, it can also be a freeing experience.Those who have castigated Ms Fremont for revealing family secrets probably have secrets of their own they wish to keep hidden. And as for those who see no connection between Ms Fremont's lesbianism and her family's silence, I can only presume they are singularly repressed and/or uninformed."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I'm so glad I moved this one up on my &quot;to be read&quot; pile.

Would highly recommend!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"True, for the first 75 pages I could not put it down. Then the memoir ended and the fiction began. I struggled on for another 100 pages at which point I decided that Ms. Fremont was masquerading under false pretenses and gave up. A lively imagination does not a memoir make. It needed to be reclassified as fiction. I have rarely read a book that initially engaged me so thoroughly and then disapointed so totally."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This is a fascinating book. As for accuracy, this book is creative non-fiction and does not matter if it is accurate according to history-- but rather what does a person remember happening?The silence surrounding the whole idea of who the author is devastating, and how it ties into her own identity of how she is a lesbian is even more interesting. The parent's silence about who they are is sadly enough, understandable, if not damaging to their children who suspect for years that something is not right.As one person wrote previously, why did the author write this? This subject of silence and suppresion of one's own identity is certainly a far-reaching theme and one that most everyone could relate to. Why does anyone write, for that matter? She tells a fascinating, tragic, and beautiful story and I certainly don't think she needs a reason to share it."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

They live with the price of their survival everyday. Theirs is an amazing story, very poignant."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This book has inspired me to go looking for my herritage, it is amazing how the Holocoust survivors can stand to hide what they have been through, and hide it from their children? I don't know, but I would be hurt inside, and I would need to tell someone! I hope people like this book as much as I did. It is incredibly good!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"The story was riveting... I was amazed at what the characters (who had been silent) went through to survive. Being a contemporary of Ms. Freemont, I was humbled to be reminded that the Holocaust was within my parents' lifetimes. I would think of my American parents and how old they were when these horrific events were going on. Ms. Freemont was & should have been deeply affected by this enlightening discovery. Yes, I can imagine recording all the details down and 'investigating' their lives... after all, that is why so many are interested in geneology. However, I fail to see what possible good-intentioned motive there was to making it into a tell-all book that was admittedly not encouraged by her parents or her aunt. I was so ticked off at the author for her betrayal. I feel similarly repulsed by those adopted children who come barging back into the lives of those who gave them up years ago without fully investigating how much these peoples' lives can be affected by 'a blast from the past.' Like other readers, I felt the book should have been given a 'Novel' listing... perhaps I would have liked it better if it was a story based on the revelation the author had in her 30's of her family's Holocaust heritage.... rather than airing all the dirty laundry. Also, if her parents had been deceased I wouldn't have been as bothered. I was probably the most angry when Ms. Freemont selfishly divulged this Jewish revelation to her 50 year old cousin. I can't imagine how Ms. Fremont's parents can ever trust her again... I also can't imagine spending a lifetime being unable to trust those anyone... including those you love the most. Shame on you Ms. Fremont."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Why is this book labeled a \\"memoir\\" when it is so clearly and explicitly fiction? Helen Fremont clearly wants a heroic/tragic/pathetic history for her family, all buried in grim silence... so much silence, in fact, that she had to make the entire history up.Good grief. This book is a waste of both Helen Fremont's considerable storytelling talent and my time."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont's \\"After a Long Silence\\" (New York, Delacorte, 1999) readslike fiction, like a thriller, like a melodrama written for conversion intoa screenplay. But it is not fiction. It is the story of two daughters' slowrealization that their \\"Roman Catholic\\" parents, who always left Massbefore Communion, were really Jewish.The father was a physician in Lvov who ended up in the Gulag, where he allbut lost the use of one arm..The mother was smuggled out of Poland to Italy dressed as an Italiansoldier to join her sister in Rome (who was married to an Italianaristocrat and pretended Catholicism).But, to protect the \\"Italian\\" sister, the mother went into complete denial.She denied her Jewishness, denied that Helen Fremont, a Boston lawyer, was a lesbian, denied her entire life.Helen and her sister Lara went about proving all the falsehooods quitemethodically. And in their voyage of discovery they slowly learned not only their parents' secrets but also came to understand why the \\"Italian\\" aunt spoke Hebrew, vacationed in Israel alone, and was a staunch opponent of Holocaust deniers.All this being said, there are flaws in the book, based partly on thefailure of American schools to teach geography and to teach history.In one section of the book, the mother is smuggled out of \\"Yugoslavia\\" into Italy (during the war). Once again, my research into writing my own novel, \\"Comrades, Avenge Us,\\" enters the scene.Yugoslavia was invaded in 1941 by the Germans after Yugoslav nationalists broke the pact with the Axis that had been signed by the Yugoslav government. The Germans and Italians immediately partitioned Yugoslavia. At the time the mother was moving from \\"Yugoslavia\\" to \\"Italy,\\" the area she crossed was part of the Third Reich (Slovenia became Oberkrain, Upper Carniola, a part of the \\"German\\" province of Carinthia). So she was not in Yugoslavia at all.This makes the imagined border crossing totally unbelievable.She crossed to Postumia (site of the world-renowned caverns), which is just outside Trieste, but which Helen Fremont somehow thinks is high in the Alps and covered in deep snows. In fact, it rarely snows in Postumia.There are other instances of such egregious errors, but they do not detract from the basic story of denial and rediscovery."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I have given this book as a gift to at least five friends. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont's book has the ambiance of a freshman term paper on \\"The Proselytization of Shylock.\\" Winding its way through an interminable examination of her parents conversion to Christianity she slashes through her parents privacy like a modern day Richard the Lionhearted while creating the illusion that she is a victim of the holocaust. Finally she confronts true evil in the Popes backyard, forcing her Italian cousin to come to grips with his Jewish heritage. For why? God known what this woman would have done to Saint Paul if she had caught him by the toga. A strange preoccupation with Judaism for a woman whose lifestyle is distinctly non-Jewish. Unfortunately we have become a society where economic benefits and social dividends accrue from victimization. Who would better understand this fact than an attorney? It is sad that a young, well-educated woman should choose to use her time and money to pursue victim-hood. I can think of a thousand more useful projects. Yes, it is a sad truth that if one takes a path other roads are denied. It is also true that the decisions a parent makes influences the lives of their children. Parental influence is a legal and moral obligation. I can personally find little fault with Ms. Fremont's parents. She and her sister were raised to be successful, literate, individuals by mere mortals who had been to hell and back.. What more can anyone ask? Do we really need 319 pages to deal with whatever?

You read one, you have a feeling like you read them all. Boring..."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being \\"A Nazi\\" or a \\"Homophobe\\".I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to \\"come out\\" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.Read it if you want and form your own opinions.

Actually I really wanted to email the author after reading this, I am truly saddened that she did not give any contact information. At the end of this book, she has become such a friend, you know her thoughts and feelings, and share her bewilderment and pain. Being such an objective narrator, we learn so much about her parents and sister, and are able to make our own judgements. The one thing that is so amazing is that this is a story told through learnt bits and pieces, from survivors of whom it is too painful to cut into the details, in order to maintain their sanity and sense of well-being they must only touch the surface. It is like they will break if it is cracked. We can't begin to imagine what has not been told. It was hard for me to connect with what it is like to kind of be lost in your sense of past and family and self, but anybody I think can emphasize with the dysfunctional conversations that encompass our everyday life (i.e. her parents reactions to their fighting)."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont's \\"After Long Silence\\" is a study in contrasts; written in clear, unexaggerated prose, it tells of story of secrets, an opaque tale of muddled identities and long-repressed memories. Without meaning to, perhaps she has captured a significant difference between life in the U.S. and the old European culture. Here, if one does not practice Catholicism, often one is not labeled a Catholic. In addition to the tale of her parents' struggles, some puzzling tales of her own American life emerge: How could she go through religious instruction, and specifically the preparation for First Communion, and not question her parents' attitude, that communion is not an important part of the mass? Any child who is preparing for First Communion will be able to tell you that communion is the heart of the mass....Perhaps this reinforces an underlying theme of her book: She has been held captive in the tight knot of her family's past, and only by finding the truth of the events that shaped her parents' life, can she become free to be herself."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This book is captivating; I could not put it down. One of the best books I've read in a while. After Long Silence is engrossing, fascinating, turbulent, and hopeful. Helen's writing style is excellent, clear, and vivid.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont discovers that she's not Catholic, as she'd been raised, but Jewish. As she explores the secrets within her family, explores her parents' experience as Jews in Poland during WWII, and unfolds their history--her history--she also explores and discovers herself and the secrets she's held onto.After Long Silence is page-turning exploration of the tangled dynamics of one family, but it's also a book about strength of spirit and survival. Helen Fremont pens a story that will stay with you long after you've finished the last page."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"To keep this review short and sweet, this book was amazing. I was gripped from beginning to end and my view of life has been changed. The strength that Batya and Zosia showed throughout the war seems surreal, and I wonder if I could ever do the same.

It was very self serving of her to use their experience in such a way as to satisfy her own identity search/emotional work and publish during their lifetimes."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Imagine as a young adult, passionately involved in your career, you start pulling away the pieces of the facade your parents had created to protect you and your sister fom the truth about your own family. Like pulling a thread and unravelling your entire wardrobe to show your nakedness, Helen Fremont knew whe was dealing with sensitive, even explosive issues, but he could not stop pulling that thread.What she has done with this remarkable memoir is show her family's roots and branches in ways she never knew existed before she and her sister began discussing the \\"What if's?\\" It is a moving story packed with complicated relationships and the true history of her parents' lives and the terrors they went through during the Holocaust era in Europe. You finish the book wondering how such a powerful story could be supressed, and cheering for Helen Fremont for unearthing it. As with so many memoirs, you are also left wondering, \\"where are they now?\\" and hoping for a sequel."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I found this memoir to be a deeply personal account of a family's hidden history. Ms. Fremont's use of language brings images into clear view. Her insight into human nature with its secrets and hypocrisy is well depicted. Her courage to write, and then publish the book, despite family opposition to do so, is indicative of her committment to having the truth be told. She is a writer with a special gift to reveal herself while remaining objective and level headed."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"While the style was easy reading, the book is flawed in several ways. In her Author's Note Ms. Fremont tells us that she has &quot;...imagined details in an effort to convey the emotional truths of my family's experiences.&quot; So, what was real and what wasn't? If some &quot;facts&quot; are fictionalized, how can we believe any of it? In addition, Ms. Fremont's sexual orientation had absolutely no place in this book. After a while you got the impression that she wrote her family's story as a way of coming out, of being accepted as a lesbian by way of revealing their &quot;dark secrets.&quot; She kept asking the family members if it was all right with them if she was gay. Ms. Fremont, either get a new therapist or GET OVER IT!In the end I have enormous respect for Ms. Fremont's family whose secrets I belive she should have kept to herself and hope that she finds some way to deal with her own turmoil."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"As a daughter of a survivor myself, I admired the skillful way Fremont knits together the bits and pieces of stories she gets from her parents about the war, and uses her imagination to fill in the rest. I can very much relate to her feelings of never being able to live up to her parents' seemingly impossible survival stories, and wondering if the parents she knows are really the same people who fought to survive war-torn Poland. As a child of a survivor, I can relate to a lot of this story, and as a writer, I admire the tightness of the writing, despite the vignette style it is written in. Congratulations, Helen Fremont! I hope that my father's story can be told as poignantly, one day."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Like Helen Fremont, my parents are also Jewish Holocaust Survivors. However, unlike her, my parents never hid their past. Even with our differences, she does a remarkable job of showing something most children of survivors have in common - how truly difficult it is to &quot;ask&quot; our parents about their past; I label it &quot;a difficult dance&quot; - we, as their children, feel we must know about their past, but we don't want to hurt them by making them spill their guts about the utter inhumantiy they lived through. This is a difficult topic to capture, but Fremont did it magnificently. I also felt tremendous sympathy for her. I truly understand how she felt. The incredible &quot;jolt&quot; (and this is putting it mildly) when she learned her real identity is probably one of the hardest things she has ever had to live through. I hope that committing her story to paper, in the moving way that she did, will help her resolve her background. She should be commended for opening her life to the rest of us."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"As the son of a survivor, I read this book differently than most. I understand the author's parents need for silence. I also understand the destructiveness of it on the survivors and their children. Ms. Fremont has created a wonderful framework for the telling of HER story.Those who read this just for the story of her parents are missing the point of writing the book. The silence of her parents - like many survivors of the Shoa - cannot be completely broken, so admittedly the author \`fills in' or \`imagines' details so painful that her parents are unable or unwilling to remember.This novel is an exploration into the author's movement OUT OF SILENCE. She skillfully represents this personal growth by sharing with the reader her journey into her family's and her own past. It is during this journey as she questions why her parents kept so silent that she puts herself to the ultimate test and breaks her own conspiracy of silence to her parents and family about her sexual orientation. Bravely she works to stop all the silences of her family - silence of Shoa experiences, silences of avoiding one's true identity - so that they may no longer live in the shadow that silence casts.The book is to be applauded as a journey to self truth. A journey we are always on and must always work at.Read the book as a tool to remove your own silences."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont writes of her struggles uncovering the truth about her family and their past. Raised as a Roman Catholic, she finds out in her thirties that she is actually Jewish. Armed with this knowledge, she, with some help from her sister, begin to look for answers to her family's past. The story that unfolds is remarkable. She finds out how her parents and aunt survived during World War II and how they eventually came to America. But, unfortunately there are many loose ends and holes in the story...information no one would tell her and that she could not find out on her own. Because of this, the book, though riveting, leaves the reader hanging, wanting more facts. One can only hope that Fremont will eventually find out more and be able to write a sequel, to complete her story. This is not just a story of survival, but of the will to live and go on. All in all a good book, proving the adage: Truth is stranger than fiction."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I could not put this book down for several reasons. My father's experience was much the same as the author's father. My father was born and raised in Lvov and was conscripted into the Russian army shortly before the Russians evacuated. He left behind five siblings, his parents and a family of 200 people. They were all murdered at Belzec.What particularly intrigued me was her father's life in the gulag. My father was also incarcerated in a place called Aktubinsk in Middle Asia and shared many of the experiences described in the book. I know that what Ms. Fremont is describing is truthful because it is the same as was described to me by my father. He also acknowledged that although the camp was hell, he probably would not have survived had he remained in Lvov.The description of the pogram on Petlura Day had me in tears. I can only assume that my family endured that horror also.I can understand some of the criticism leveled at the book by those who are not the children of survivors. Growing up as the child of survivors is not the same as growing up in a &quot;normal&quot; household. Even if parents are not reticent, as mine were not, there are certain boundaries past which you do not wander. You do not need to be told not to ask; you just know.I do not think that one can compare Ms. Fremont's discretion with respect to her friends and her &quot;outing&quot; of her parents. Ms. Fremont's parents, I'm certain with the best of intentions, denied her her heritage. This denial is part of the heitage that scars the first generation of survivors' children. I'm sure that a variation of these scars will be handed down to our children. Never knowing your grandparents, your aunts, your uncles or you cousins but knowing that they once existed and were murdered for no reason, gives a perspective that cannot be understood unless you've actually experienced it. I know for a fact that Ms. Fremont is not the only first generation child who has tested herself with hunger or cold. I've done it myself. It gives you a different scale on which to measure life. It also makes you stronger."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I was originally intrigued by the basic story presented here: a search to find one's family tree, one's genealogical background. However, as I read more and more I got an uneasy feeling which eventually turned to outright alarm. The author was &quot;outing&quot; her parents as Jews, completely against their wishes and request. With a daughter like that, who needs a treacherous neighbor to turn you over to the Gestapo? Aside from that (and that's a *major* aside), the bulk of the book - the dialog, the details of events - is in fact NOT fact, but supposition by the author (which she admits in one shocking example - a simple one sentence statement by her mother regarding her escape turns into a full-blown paragraph about what *might* have happened, created wholly from the imagination of the author). In the end, I felt like some kind of voyeur into her parents' most intimate secrets and it wasn't a good feeling. The author tries to put a &quot;feel-good&quot; twist to all this by telling us about the family reunion she had with all her newly-found relatives - a reunion her parents did not care to attend. The author had every right to know what her true background was, but that didn't mean she had the right to expose her parents' carefully constructed post-war identities and lives."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"After Long Silence is no kitchen-table memoir; Helen Fremont is a skilled student of the writer's craft. How would you like to find out, as an adult, that your heritage was completely different than you had been told as a child? Helen Fremont did what we all yearn to do--to find out the truth. This is a tale of catharsis and of conflict, and will leave the reader drained, but in a good way. The tales of Jews struggling to survive are remarkable, and one learns from them to be willing to reinvent oneself, and to help others. The tone is bittersweet, not cloying. There is romance, and Helen's honesty about herself burnishes the work nicely. My only complaint was the lack of an index with which to follow the European locations in which most of the book takes place."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"it takes the author a long time to allow herself to write freely about her subject. it seems to me that she is largely the victim of her own need to control her narrative. this takes away from the impact of her story and often turns her report into a lukewarm listing of events. only when she describes her mother's narrative and steps aside to let her mother speak and when she gains a deeper understanding of her own identity does this narrative take wing and become lyrical at times and moving most of the time. the book will appeal to students of the Shoah (Holocaust) and those interested in Jewish identity. Ruth Tenenholtz Haifa Israel"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"As I read some of the other reviews in this section, I couldn't help but wonder if I had read the same book. Fremont is a beautiful and gifted writer with a true sense of her craft. I had just finished the book when I turned to the reviews here, and was surprised by several of the lukewarm responses. It seems that those responses evolve mainly from 1) the readers' discomfort with the blur between so-called fact and so-called fiction; 2) the writer's own involvement in the story; and 3) the writer's revelation of herself as a lesbian. All of these, however, are what made the story so moving and rich for me. First of all, can we be so naive as to think that we can ever completely fill in the past with pure &quot;facts?&quot; Think of what happened to Zosia in her lifetime: she was obviously traumatized into forgetting, and thus her story, not remembered, almost became a big gap in the larger construction we call &quot;history,&quot; until Fremont revived that story, and breathed life into it as well. Besides, what are memoir and history if NOT presentation, performance, and construction? No one author/historian/memoirist knows all facts, and authors choose to include some material and omit other material for a variety of reasons, oftentimes as a result of unconscious (or conscious) bias. Our only hope is that people like Fremont come along and reconstruct the stories and fill in the gaps with lost voices and narratives. Her use of fictional techniques allow us a three-dimensional look at particular people, times, places, and actions. As far as the ethics of &quot;outing&quot; her parents go, I hardly think Fremont does not struggle with this throughout her story. I think she writes about them with respect and tenderness. However, as she says about her father at one point, it is HIS story too, and so, by the same token, it is Fremont's as well. This is, after all, very much an autobiography and which one of us can construct our lives separate from our family's? We live and build our lives in relation to others and those relationships form us. So, of course, Fremont had to, and had every right to, find out about her parents' lives. I think, yes, the question of ethics enters into this and that is a question I hope we keep trying to address. It is also a question that adds a deeper dimension to this work. As far as some reviewer's disdain of Fremont's disclosure of herself as a lesbian, all I can say is: GOOD GRIEF!!!! Of course this is pertinent to the story! Quite frankly, I am tired of folks who cannot see the violence done to gays and lesbians who may feel compelled to conceal their identity for fear of bigotry and physical harm. Fremont's need to &quot;come out&quot; to her family parallels her cracking open of secrets in her family's lives. It is a prime example of the kind of identity concealment and hidden existence that she pinpoints in her family. The connection is so clear to me, I cannot help but wonder if there is (albeit unconsciously, perhaps) a homophobic element to these responses. And once more it's important to remember that this is a memoir as much about the author and her journey towards identity as it is about the author's parents. In short, this is a first-rate book that honors rather than disparages the author's family. Do not deprive yourself of THIS one! A good and textured &quot;read&quot; from beginning to end...."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont is such a talented writer that I hated for thebook to end. Don't discount it if it's a story you have no interestin; if you love words this woman knows how to make them sing."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"After finishing this book, I really couldn't help but wonder why exactly the author wrote it. First and foremost, I thought, she wrote it for herself, as a sort of therapy. At points she offers that she has opened up a bag full of deeply held family secrets so that the ENTIRE family could confront who it is and where its roots lie, but I still couldn't help thinking that as the author's aunt (Zosia is the aunt's name in the book) says to her, &quot;You are obsessed with the Holocaust.&quot; Now, this isn't a terrible thing to be obsessed with, really. I, myself, have done a lot of research on the topic. But, this author goes further with this other strange obsession that stems from the fact that through her research she finds out her entire lineage is Jewish, and NOT in fact Catholic (as she was raised to believe).The author's Polish parents have raised her as a Catholic, albeit, a rather weird Catholic who isn't supposed to take communion and has to sit in the back pew with the family. The family is not overly religious and by the time the author is 8, she doesn't even have to go to mass on Sunday and stays home to watch The NFL Today instead.But in their early thirties, the author and her sister realize, through some fairly thorough research, that their parents are actually Jewish and lived through a great number of atrocities during the Holocaust. And I must say that Helen Fremont gives a rather moving picture, and a descriptive account of her parent's and her aunt's lives during WWII based on her research and discussions she has with her parents after finding out about their past.The sad part of the book is that she feels such a need to dig into her parent's pained hearts. Her mother, her father and her aunt had put the unbearable pain they suffered during that time away and most likely didn't want to relive it. Oddly, but somewhat understandly they chose to raise their children with the understanding that while they had lived through the Holocaust in Poland, they had only lived it as Catholic onlookers and NOT as the Jews that they actually were. But, the author and her sister feel this burning need to dig deeper, and deeper and display the family's secrets, to reach into their family's recesses and pull out horrendously painful memories. It made me wonder if she wasn't just doing it for the same reason that a motorist slows down on the highway to view a car accident. But, perhaps I am ignorant in this respect - maybe, she REALLY needed to know that she was Jewish and her family was one made up of Holocaust survivors so that she could understand herself more clearly (but I can't help but feel that she dug too deeply, hurt her family in the long run just so she could display to everyone what she found out about herself).Ultimately, however, I found it a good read (except for some of her own musings about herself, which didn't seem to add much to the story)because of the detail she added and the way she was able to draw you into her family's lives in Europe during WWII. I only wonder: what was her motive?"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I enjoyed this book immensly. The author works in my office, that made me want to read it. Once I opened it, the words grabbed me and pulled me through. It is very well written, it's one of those books that you can't put down, you just have to know what happens next. It's a fascinating and extraordinary life story! Read it, I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This is a stunning memoir that works on many levels simultaneously and interweaves the past with the present to unforgettable effect. Fremont tells the harrowing story of her own parents' survival, and, along the way, tells her own story as well. She does both with love, humor, and some of the most exquisite writing I've seen. I found it absolutely riveting and simply could not put it down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This book's cover caught my eye in the bookstore as well as its description. It took awhile to get good unfortunately. The author seems uncomfortable in the first few chapters, it doesn't flow. for example, she uses the detailed description of food during important conversations with her parents...it was distracting & annoying! Enough with the milk swirling in the coffee, the turkey juices sputtering out of the turkey...get to the point! I almost gave up on the book. Once the family's history began to be unfold, I couldn't put it down--it was like a whole different book. But I was disappointed as I kept flipping through to look for photos! Where are they...I wanted to piece together the puzzle pieces visually. In perhaps protection of family, there are none! Doesn't this conflict with the whole coming out in the first place. I wanted to know more about the haunting photo on the front cover, I felt ripped off. There is one photo of Ms. Fremont hiding towards the back, she looks as uncomfortable as the writing about herself that appears randomly in the book, most predominantly in the first few chapters. Her outing as a lesbian seemed like it should be a whole other book. The family history part is very good...you will feel great sympathy for what they've gone through & a little guilty that the author outed them all...The author told an exciting,vivid tale of her parents' struggles to survive the war and the attempted extermination of their people/heritage."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I totally agree with all those who said that this book is an outstanding peace of art. One more example of that there cannot be too 'MANY\\" books about the Holocaust subject. I understand,however the reluctance and even hostility of Helen and Lara's parents(as well as some of the readers) about the exposing Helen's parents life story.It is definetely painful, as well as possibly embarassing to let the whole world to know their very private life.(even though they have nothing to be ashamed about).But to that you can also add that Lara and Helen have a RIGHT to know about thier roots and their family. So in that respect I agree that their parents made a big mistake by SUPRESSING it all. It seems that they mostly defnding themselves rather than their kids about the truth.When our children are small that is understandable. But it is WRONG to hide the truth about the family once children are all grown up. Amazing story and I wish Zosia and Helen's mom would open up and tell everything. Once they die... no more memory...(...)"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"She was hungarian and jew like me, but older.

If you like &quot;Silence&quot; you'll enjoy &quot;House.&quot;"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it was easy reading ( I really like her style of writing, it reminded me of Mary Karr's in the Liar's Club) It was amazing that her parents were at all sane (particularly her father) after what they had been through. My only criticism is Ms. Fremont's claim to have been raised Catholic. She was no more raised Catholic than I was raised Jewish! Going to Church once in a while does not make you Catholic, and she was clearly not part of a genuine Catholic community and all of the cultural and social aspects that go along with it. If she had truly been raised Catholic it would have been more traumatic for her to leave it behind. By the way, I think this would make a GREAT book club selection - there would be lots to talk about."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Although this book has some fascinating aspects, I can't help but find the style to be mediocre. It lacks the strong cohesion and polish that writers such as Angelou and Duras display in their memoirs. However, if you are interested in European life during WWII, particularly the Jewish experience, then you will gain insight from this novel."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This books fails on so many levels that reading it was a chore. First, as the New York Times critic noted (and as the author freely admits), a great deal of this &quot;memoir&quot; is an imagined past. In truth, this book is not a memoir at all; it is a novel that is loosely based on facts. It might be an interesting introduction to Holocaust literature for newcomers to the genre, but the majority of the book has been made up. Secondly, Ms. Fremont's writing, while clear, is by turns sophomoric and pretentious, with a lot of not very original imagery thrown in for good measure. Finally, as another customer reviewer has observed, it's interesting that Ms. Fremont is much more solicitous of her lesbian friends' desire for privacy than the similar desires of her own parents. It also bothered me greatly that Ms. Fremont, who seems to have led a privileged (perhaps even pampered) life, somehow fancies herself a victim of the Holocaust. Now that Ms. Fremont is in her forties, it might be a good time for her to eschew victimhood and take responsibility for her own life."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"It seems to me that this book is about betrayal on many different levels. The writer betrays her family by sharing their secrets with the reading public for the sake of a best seller. The women in the family betray their spouses by prostituting themselves in order to survive; they feel that they betray their parents when, unlike them, they do survive; they betray their children by hiding their origins from them; and they betray their Jewish heritage by denying it. As a reader I feel betrayed: the book waffles and is inconsistent. Quality of writing is inconsistent: many elaborately written descriptions exist for no purpose while we are never given a sufficient description of the mother, father and aunt. The writer portrays herself as a selfish yuppy and, as others have pointed out, her lesbianism seems to be totally irrelevant. There are several books she could have written: about the relevance of her mother's sexuality to her own, about sisterhood and what it means, about what it means to be a &quot;hidden Jew.&quot; This book is presumably about all of these issues, but it is really about none of them."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen and her sister Lara had Jewish parents; their mother Batya (nee Marmorstein) and their father Kovik Buchman barely survived WWII and the Holocaust. After six grueling years in a Siberian gulag, Kovik escaped. After much suffering under Russian occupation, Ukrainian brutality, and German occupation, Batya escaped with forged documents, changing her name to Maria. They eventually managed to immigrate to the United States to build a new life and start a new family, and eventually settled in the state of Michigan. Motivated by fear of the past, and to protect their offspring from possible persecution as they had experienced as Jews, Helen and Lara's parents decided to conceal their past from their daughters and bring them up as Catholics. However, as the daughters grew up, they suspected that their parents kept secrets about their past history. Lara said once to her sister: \\"It's about us, about who we are!\\" Eventually they did find out from their parents' acquaintances (Elsa Sonderling and Mendel Goldberg) that their parents suffered a great deal. That their Mom's parents had been gassed, upon arrival, in Belzec and not killed by a bomb as Mom had told them. At one point, against their parents' wishes, the daughters went to the Ukraine for two weeks with a group of Holocaust survivors to see the home and schools where their parents lived, studied and were persecuted. Consequently, their parents could no longer keep their secrets. Helen and Lara insisted to get answers directly from their parents. Eventually they revealed some of their family's history to their daughters but insisted that Batya's sister, Zosia, should not be aware of that revelation. Zosia married an Italian Catholic and became an Italian countess.In \\"After Long Silence,\\" the drumbeat of persecution reverberates long after the horrors of the Holocaust have ceased. It proves that memory is powerful and, in most instances, you can't run away from it. Batya was adamant to conceal her past, her heritage. Still, when the Helen and Lara gave her a Christmas gift, the illustrated book \\"A Vanished World\\" by Roman Vishniac, Batya burst into tears. \\"This is my home; these were my people, our neighbors! (p.104).\\" In 1992, half a century after the event, Batya told her two grown-up daughters how she and her sister Zosia had been raped by Ukrainians in June 1941, between the Russian and German occupation of Poland. \\"We were two very close sisters exposed to the same horrible event; one cannot forget it and the other one cannot remember it (p.137).\\"As a Holocaust survivor, I know how difficult it is to deal with post-traumatic syndromes. The unhealed hole in my heart doesn't let me forget. An American WWII veteran, being plagued by nightmares, can't forget either. He said to me: \\"I was an officer in a U.S. battalion that in 1945 had liberated the infamous concentration camp Buchenwald, in Germany. With tearful eyes he said, \\"Mr. Wiener, for my children and my grandchildren you must have your life story in print.\\" I listened to him and wrote my autobiography \\"From a Name to a Number.\\" The horrific images are etched in my memory and the physical scars are still visible. My past is always present. Parents keep a lot of secrets from their children. I feel that parents who had suffered the horrors of war have an obligation to share their life story with their children and the children need to hear and listen to their parents' life stories. The terrible effects of war on parents or grandparents is a story that should be passed down to their offspring. Perhaps the new generations will realize how to be more appreciative of peace among nations and peoples; how painful and senseless wars have been.\\"After Long Silence\\" is a brilliantly crafted, gripping memoir. It reflects the effects of the social and psychological disruption on top of the human and physical destruction in WWII. Ms. Fremont has the courage to tell her family's story and her personal story, especially her sexual orientation. Wise are those who learn from everybody and from everything. I wonder why some reviewers deem \\"After long silence\\" to be fiction while the Author's Note states, \\"This is a work of nonfiction.\\" In essence, the author narrates her parents' trauma during the Holocaust and the ramifications of its aftermath. Some people have difficulties believing the unbelievable atrocities perpetrated against so many innocents. I do believe; I was there."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I thought that this was a very well-done, brilliantly organized memoir of Helen Fremont. But to enjoy the book, I had to keep reminding myself that this is HELEN's memoir, and not a biography of her parents/family. She was telling her life story, which was shaped by her parents' (understandable) need to hide their past in order to move on with their lives. Helen's strong desire to discover her roots ended up changing her life, and she felt a need to remember her family and piece together her family's past. My personal opinion is that remembering the Holocaust and its victims brings them honor and promotes understanding...however, I wrestled often with the desire to perpetuate the Holocaust Legacy and the desire to respect Helen's parents, who so strongly felt the need to hide it.Helen did manage to piece together the story of her parent's experiences during the Holocaust, but only in a general sense. She used what she knew about her parents to paint a more detailed picture, often simply guessing at the details and telling it as she imagined it must have been. I would have taken issue with this, but Helen was up front about it, even including the actual story as well as her embellished version. In the end, I was OK with it because the act of writing the details for herself seemed like another part of her journey of finding out who she is.I thought that the way Helen wove together her own journey of self-discovery with her parent's journey was extremely smart and well-done. Discovering her parents' past was just as much a part of her own personal growth as being able to tell her parents about her sexual identity. Both elements were about shedding a veil of secrecy and being comfortable with who you are. It's inspirational and a lesson that anyone can benefit from."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"My father is a child survivor of a Japanese concentration camp on Java during World War II when Indonesia was still a Dutch Colony. My father's father starved to death in a forced Mitzubishi tin mine labor camp outside of Tokyo in 1942. I grew up similar to Ms. Fremont, hearing these mythic stories of war and dealing with the unknown mystery of post traumatic stress that the war imposed. I was always fascinated by my father's story and needed to know more. For me to read Ms. Fremont's astounding literary work of art was truly healing and powerful. I connected with her amazing words as if she were sharing with me like a sister that which most people cannot comprehend - the terrible effects of war and how it is passed down for generations. Reading her work helped me make sense of my own childhood and realize how important telling these stories is. The similarities of our childhood dealing with our parents was astounding - hearing the stories, dealing with the post-traumatic stress, the depression, upset and wanting to forget. I too was amazed to find out that we do repeat our family's stress and survival, as Ms. Fremont did with her own life, and I do with mine. I also was astounded to find out as an adult that my paternal grandfather was Jewish, and that my maiden name of Straub was Jewish. Things I never knew yet were essential to my understanding of the mystery of our lives. I believe these forces are unconsciously driven because of the events, unresolved grief and the intense need to find our place and identity in them when we are so obviously different from our peers around us. There is this powerful need to tell the story, find ourselves in it and make meaning out of it and have it witnessed. There was the similarities of food and starvation, gold and survival, unspeakable brutality and terrible loss, unspeakable loss. For I remember asking my aunts about their version of the camps and refused to speak where my father was copious in the narrative. I think this is one of the most important books and should be required reading for teenagers, so that we do not forget, as our country has and now dumps out thousands of fresh vets traumatized by America's numerous wars only to have its horrors visited upon their children for generations to come. New kids are living with parents who suffered the horrors of war and are trying to make sense of it and searching for a guide. This book is it. Let us not forget. Let us read Ms. Fremont's courageous and brilliant work and raise our voices to tell our stories, to end war, brutality and evil in the name of children and healing. May we all have the courage to tell our stories as Ms. Fremont did. Brilliant. Brava. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont, raised as Catholic in the Midwest with her sister, learns in her 30s that her parents are Jewish and furthermore are survivors of the Holocaust and the Soviet Gulag. Fremont's tale is about learning and documenting that truth, but more so of getting her parents to admit to it as well. Over the years, the web of lies and subterfuges the parents have woven to protect themselves and their family proves almost too difficult and socially damaging to dismantle. But Helen and her sister persevere.There are hints in the book that the story Helen tells about her parents and grandparents is mostly reconstructed from clues and fragments. At one point she describes having worked a story over and over in her mind until it had the feel of memory. This lack of hard, documented narrative may put some people off, but I found it to be the only way the extraordinary story of her parents could be told. Helen's parents were in love in Lvov, and separated for years by war and the Soviet justice system. Her mother and her sister waged an epic battle of deception and guile that saved them and sought to save their parents, Helen's grandparents. Helen's father, locked away in the frozen gulag, survives deprivation and a broken body and fights back to find his love and start a new life. Given their hardships, it's no wonder they wanted to bury the past and to hide the grave with lies, obfuscations and deception.\\"After Long Silence\\" is a book that describes how the drumbeat of persecution can reverberate in human lives long after the horror has ceased. It also tells of the hidden cost of secrets. Helen's parent's secrets saved lives, but at the cost of their children's identities and souls. The parents sacrifice is enormous and heart-wrenching; the children's struggle is a titanic battle against the impulse to forget and reinvent in order to stay alive.Helen's writing is lyrical and compelling. I recall one line about certain strains of \\"shipwrecked\\" notes from a violin washing up against her father's ears. \\"After Long Silence\\" is gorgeously written -- a testament to the need to know who one is, and where one has come from."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I keep picking up this book and reading it over and over again, it's that good. Yes the author embellished the book with imagined details, butit serves it purpose. Parents keep a lot of secrets from their children,and their children do believe what they are told by their parents.I feel for Helen's parents and aunt for hiding as catholic's to protect their children from the long history of the persecution of the Jews.Helen's parents probably had survivors guilt, but also still had that fear that they could be taken away at any time.Helen's quest to find out her past is admirable, but I don't think she handled the whole situation very well. Her sister Lara was working on a project about their family history for college, so I think that is one of the reasons both sisters were motivated to ask their parents about their real past. I think one reason I find this book fastinating is that I am half Norwegian and half Polish, I was raised as a Norwegian Lutheran by my mother when I have Polish/Catholic roots too. My mother told me when I was young not to tell anyone that I am half Polish, so I pretended to be Norwegian/Lutheran for years.Helen had been keeping her own secret about part of her identity, her sexuality. So, for me her sexuality doesn't take anything away from the story."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This is a very interesting memoir of Jewish holocaust survivors who bring up their children as Catholics, hiding from them their Jewish heritage. As the children grow up, they begin to suspect they are Jews and try to piece together the story of their parents' lives.The book is poignant and painful. The stillness and guardedness of the parents' inner world is like the silence of blue in a glacier - and as chilling. It is a great portrait of survivors' guilt and motivation by fear of the past."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"After Long Silence by Helen Fremont is a second generation Holocaust memoir. The author's mother and aunt survived the Holocaust by disguising themselves as Polish Catholics in Italy. Her father escaped from Soviet Siberia and walked across Europe at the end of the war to join the sisters in Rome.What makes this story so interesting is that, after the war the sisters never came out of hiding as Catholics and convinced the author's father to maintain the pretense as well. They migrated to the USA and had two daughters that they raised as Catholics. It is only when the daughters are in their 30s that they start to suspect that their parents are keeping something from them.Helen Fremont blends together the two stories of her and her sister uncovering their parents Jewish past and their parents Holocaust survivor tale in a wonderful way that shows the intergenerational impact of lies and deception in a way that is still sensitive to her parents' desire to put the past behind them."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont and her sister Lara had a typical post-War childhood. Raised Catholic, their lives were not unlike so many others recovering from the war. Or were they? As the girls grew they began to ask questions. What happened to their grandparents? What happened to their father's arm? Why were so many of their friends Jewish? They became driven to understand their history and themselves.&quot;After Long Silence&quot; is a remarkably well-written, compelling story. The author takes us with her, into her own life and that of her parents and aunt. Through her writing we come to know that what she seeks -- what we seek -- is unknowable.Three times through the course of the book I found myself stunned by the impact of simple dramatic moments. Not the excitement of escape or the fear in hiding, but moments of realization that we will always be outsiders, always removed from the depth of the truth. We can never understand.The characters in this true story create an impenetrable armor, each in their own way, revealing only what is needed, leaving the reader to wonder just what we still don't know.Best book I've read this year. The author has a gift for descriptive language -- I hope to read more true stories from her. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I found this book to be engaging and well-written, but without being there, and from the way Fremont has described her research, it is clearly of the new journalism that can only be called \\"fictography.\\" I was fascinated by her parent's lives, and find it interesting that so many people of that generation --- my own, American-born parents included -- maintain huge secrets, and of course the children of those parents know on some level what the truth is. But by the end of the book, I wondered: Did Fremont learn NOTHING from her parents? Because to them, this \\"secret\\" which was basically right out there and not too hard to figure out -- was LIFE and DEATH matter to them. Survival, at its most elemental. And Fremont blabs it, being in one of the few countries in the world where you can blab your or your family's secrets and live to blab and blab some more. Telling her cousin was reprehensible--she would have figure it out, just the same as Fremont did. When Zoshi screamed at Fremont that she was being just as bad as Hitler in telling her family's story, I understood her completely. It was someone else imposing their will for your survival, deciding for you if you would survive or not...for that was what the fiction was for. Survival. And bringing up her own lesbianism in the face of her parent's persecution...It makes me (upset).I would, however, read novels by Helen Fremont. She sure has a way with a story."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"It's not until Helen Fremont is an adult that she discovers that her Polish parents, whom she always believed were Catholic, were in fact both Jewish by birth. Because surviving World War II had been so difficult for them, neither wanted to share details of their past with Helen or her sister Lara until the daughters started researching family history for themselves.AFTER LONG SILENCE is a fascinating story of survival against great odds, yet the focus of the story keeps coming back to the author and her sister. Throughout the heartbreaking story of Helen's family, it somehow seems as if it's told through the eyes of the author instead the mother. Much of the historical context is missing, such as a thorough description of the town in which her parents lived, a closer look at extended family and friends, and a clearer picture of wartime atrocities. It's agonizing to realize the extent to which Helen's parents, at first very unwillingly, had to open up to share theirpainful past with her. It's also disturbing for the reader to learn that the book is about family secrets rather than a clear picture of one family's history. Nevertheless, as a gripping saga of survival in World War II Poland, this book should be read to learn of yet another way one particular family was able to get through a most gruesome time in recent history."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I am an avid reader and I can honestly say that this is the first book of my life that cries out to be nominated...awarded...a Nobel Peace Prize. It is more than a memoir. It is an epic tale of tragedy, mystery, heroism, romance and identity for all people, of all backgrounds. After all, this discussion of &quot;roots&quot; is primal to every human being.Although I am not strictly a survivor of the Holocaust (though as a Jew and a member of the Twentieth Century I believe I am) this book got me in touch with my Jewish roots. I believe that my parents were assimilated, and brought their children up to eschew their religion, out of fear. One day, while my brother was studying for his Bar Mitzvah, he kissed the little velvet bag that held his tallus (the Jewish prayer shawl). Our mother was walking by his room, came in, and struck him on the back, scolding, &quot;Don't ever kiss an inanimate object. It's disgusting.&quot;I used to hold this against my mother, who was in her twenties when victims of concentration camps were emerging after the war. Now I believe that she must have been terrified to be Jewish herself, even though she never went through what Helen Fremont's parents did.I remember some lovely 'Jewish' moments from my childhood - going to the Orthodox shul (synagogue) with my religious, old-world grandparents; celebrating Purim, dressed as Ruth from the Bible; finding the matzoh my grandfather had hidden on Passover, and receiving a dollar for it; leaving the room to open the door for the angel Michael, then returning to find the wine glass mysteriously drained (by the angel, of course).As we grew up and especially after my grandparents died, we were not encouraged to continue or be identified with these rituals.Reading Helen Fremont's book has brought them back for me, and made me yearn to know more, to feel that warm, delicious feeling of connection with an ancient past, so rich, so interesting. Her parents should be proud and grateful - she gave them back their past, and she made the reader see them as unbelievably heroic people. They will be forever etched on my mind as magnificent examples of humanity.Another thing this book has done for me is to give me permission to be open about the book I am writing about a tragic secret in my own family, and my search for meaning."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"&quot;Skillfully written.....a personal and painful testimony of the horrors of the Nazi uprising and how our parents' pasts intrinsically become ours. I highly recommend this book to all who try to understand the essense of survival before and after the Holocaust.&quot;"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"The story was excellent - it was engaging - I couldn't put it down. Why, oh why, Ms. Fremont did you have to use this medium to come out of the closet? I don't care if you're a homosexual - I'm neither pro-gay or anti-gay.It was the wrong place. I wonder if that is why your parents &quot;did not approve of [your] book . . .

Now I remember! This book pulls you in and spins you around and around. Lovely writing and an unbelievable but real story."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"A wonderful memoir. It has everything. Drama, Action, love, and most of all, it has history. Without books like these, the people would forget the atrocities that happened. Especially with what is going on in Kosovo, this is a poignant reminder of life, and the incredible voracity in which people hang on to that life. This is a must read for anyone interested in histories. Helen Fremont lends such a poetry to her writing. It has a flow that makes you feel as though she is in the room telling you the story. Give yourself some time to read it, though, becuase once you begin to read, it is difficult to stop. This one is one that mothers will want to share with their children, and vice versa."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I was unable to put this book down. Helen Fremont tells this story with such insight, imagination and truth...I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"I eagerly read this for the first half, even the first three quarters, then it turned increasingly dissatisfying, and now I am left feeling really dirty for having read it. Because as the story came to a close it became more and more apparent that the real heroes of the book, the author's mother and her aunt, did not want the public as voyeurs of their history of personal struggles. The author shared it even though it is clear to anyone that they certainly didn't want it told to the world. I'm embarrassed that I read it, knowing they would rather I hadn't. I think Helen Fremont writes well but something is seriously morally lacking in her. She has a huge honor void. You would think after learning all that about her family that profound respect would prevent her from dishonoring their wishes.Zosia's tirade against the author is telling. At first I was as shocked as the author must have been, but as it sunk in I realized how much truth there was in her outrage. Clearly, the truth never sunk in for Fremont. The worldly success of having a book published mattered more than respecting her own family. I feel sorry for Fremont. At the end of her life, will she wish she had honored her parents, or published a book? I say she will be sorry. She failed where it mattered. At the moral crossroads, she took the low road.I understand her wanting to understand her past. I would have understood more if she at least put the book aside and published it after her parents and aunt's death. I feel sorry that her aunt, particularly, after all the hardship she endured, could not live out her days as she chose, her secrets intact.I have a curious mind myself and this book has been a real lesson for me. I hope my own curiosity never takes precedence over respect for the dignity of others.Helen, reign in your curiosity and from now on do the right thing. Your curiosity is there for a reason, but it shouldn't rule your life. Someday we will know ALL things. In heaven you will know all your ancestors and all their thoughts and motivations and actions and it will all make sense. Patience is a virtue. You will wish you had lived your life better (we all will); most of all you will wish you had loved everyone in your life better. Your time to do the right thing is now."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This was a really well-told story interweaving a number of different plots--the childhood of the author, her father's experience in Siberia and his later escape from it, her mother's escape from occupied Poland into Italy, her aunt's life in Italy before WWII broke out, her parents' and aunt's childhoods, and events from the present day. Ms. Fremont says in the beginning that she has filled in some gaps in her parents' and aunt's story with imagined details which she feels conveys the emotional truth of those experiences, which kind of seems like authors who make real-life characters be composites of multiple people involved in the story--sure it tells the story, but how well or accurately is another matter.I'm glad that the author and her older sister found out their true identity (though it's surprising it took till they were in their thirties, given how many obvious clues were out there all throughout their childhoods), and that they found all of their new relatives at the end, people who were able to clue them in on other people in their family tree. What I didn't like how they broke the news to their parents (and later to their aunt, against their mother's stern warnings not to). Many survivors of tragic events, not just the Shoah, hid their true identities for decades, even their entire lives, to protect not just themselves but their children from possible future persecution. Their daughters have no way of knowing what was going inside of their heads to make them make this huge decision, but certainly it wasn't done out of meanness or spite, to purposely keep their future children ignorant of their true history. They had their reasons which they firmly believed in and shouldn't have to explain or justify them to anyone. And the parents and the aunt doubtless reacted so angrily and emotionally to finding out the cat was finally out of the bag because of the way in which the news was conveyed. It's like they didn't think ahead far enough to how these aging survivors might take this shock to the system. Would you angrily confront your mother because, for example, you found out you had been fathered by a rapist and not the man you thought was your father? That's like saying that it doesn't matter why the other party kept this secret; it's all about how you and you alone feel. Zosia, the aunt, said that she was so traumatised by the events of the War that she literally forgot everything that happened before she escaped from Poland and back into Italy to her husband, even forgetting her sister's own name. The mother even mentioned in passing that the day of the Petlura massacre, her period stopped for nine months; it's a wonder her children didn't grill her about that too, asking if she'd been raped and had a child. Haven't these three elderly people been through enough? No wonder they didn't approve of this book.Some family secrets do need to come out of the closet, and this was certainly one of them, but the subject could have been broached in a way that was more sensitive to what the parents and aunt had suffered through. You may feel better after finding out the truth, but exposing a painful family secret is about everyone involved and thinking ahead to how this might disrupt a formerly happy family inalterably. The parents and aunt didn't even seem to have come to terms with what happened or achieved any sense of closure or inner-peace; indeed, Ms. Fremont reports that now they don't even speak about it anymore, after the initial period when they were telling them what had happened to them."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"To me, heroes are big, big people - people of great characterwho suffer, who stumble, sometimes fall, but pull themselves up and goon. Often, they sacrifice everything in pursuit of life, love and truth. Helen Fremont has many of these characteristics, and it is not a surprise, with such incredible parents. Everyone in her family is lucky to be in that family.Why did reviewers nit-pick about Ms. Fremont's decision to come out as a lesbian to her parents, and in this book? I felt she explained herself perfectly on this score: she had to risk something very personal herself in order to &quot;even the score&quot; of vulnerability with her parents. Besides, I think it's fine that she came out in print. Once again, not surprising - courage runs in her blood.However, after putting the book aside for a few days, I must say that I understand her parents' fear and denial. They probably feel that there are still enemies out there who want to harm them. After all, Ms. Fremont alludes to a wave of anti-Semitism in Rome recently that resulted in damage to synagogues. The terror continues, readers, and could rear its ugly head at any time again.I always think of anti-Semitism as a giant bear claw that sweeps across the sky, suddenly, a monstrous shadow over the people below. It swoops, and there is blood and destruction of life and limb.I was not born in Europe, and neither were my parents, but still there is a built-in fear. All my life I have been prepared to run, if necessary. No wonder her mother and her aunt became so hysterical when confronted by exposure of the darkest time of their lives. Still, it must be told. This book is liberating for all Jews."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"As a student of Holocaust survivor stories, I am surprised by my disappointment in this book. I had looked forwarded to reading it. By now everyone knows her family's story. At the book's end, has the author just switched one family for another? To me, at mid-story, she'd decided to push on and not just solve the mystery of her family, but to betray her family's confidences and wishes. And to what end? She does this over and over again. She betrays her aunt to her cousin, and her parents in print. How her sexual orientation comes into play makes no sense to me. Her mother and aunt are the true stars of the tale -- while she, the author, comes off as a rather selfish, not-very-kind person. I wonder what damage this book caused to her parents, her Italian aunt and that family. They seem so unimportant to her -- as, on the last pages, the author extols the &quot;...bagels and table of deserts&quot; served at her new family's reunion."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"A heart rending as well as hopeful book about the search for truth, identity, and family. The story of Ms. Fremont's parents, her search and research, is a triumphant achievement. Clearly a courageous daughter of courageous parents. I empathize and identify in so many ways as I am researching my own ancestry. Part of being human seems to be this yearning to know where we come from so we can better understand who we are, heal the past, and get on with life."},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen and her sister Lara had always known there were things their parents wouldn't discuss about their past. Their parents barely escaped WWII Europe with their lives -- their mother from Poland, and their father from grueling years in a Siberian gulag.Years later, raised as Polish Catholics in the U.S., Helen and Lara start to ask more questions about their parents' experiences in Europe during the war. The parents' cheerful but persistent subject-changing makes the girls wonder what is being concealed, and they start to search and ask questions of other people who knew their parents during the war. Soon they begin to realize that their parents actually were Jews, disguised as Catholics in order to save their lives. Yet, unlike other similar stories, the Buchmans clung to their frail religious facade as though Hitler were still alive and could yet order their extermination.The process of the girls' digging and poking and questioning, ripping off the curtains that had concealed 50-year-old horrors, is painful for the Buchman parents, who had buried the memories and never wanted to think of them again. Some of the things that they had had to do to survive were truly horrifying, and others deeply humiliating. Why would the girls want to torture their elderly parents by discovering and discussing - much less publishing - what their parents obviously did not want revealed?The answer probably partially lies in the second, parallel story of the book -- Helen's eventual pulling back of the curtains and revealing her own homosexuality. Perhaps she felt that by exposing her own private life, she had the right to expose the private lives of her parents.Whatever the reason, the reader is left with conflicting feelings. One is glad that the girls know their Jewish heritage, but their relentless pursuit of private, embarassing details just seems cruel. Some of the book could not be documented, and could indeed be fiction, although presented as fact. Obviously Helen wanted to come out of the closet, but her elderly parents did NOT want to be outed from their concealed transgressions. Not only did Helen discover her parents' humiliating secrets, but by publishing this book, she broadcast them to the world. As another reviewer said, \\"She and her sister were raised to be successful, literate individuals by mere mortals who had been to hell and back.. What more can anyone ask?\\" Indeed. Why ask or expect more?"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Helen Fremont's book was compelling, and for the most part interesting, but brought up many questions in my mind. At the forefront of my consideration of the book was the issue of Ms. Fremont's lesbian orientation--where I have no problem whatsoever with lesbians, it seemed so discordant to the story of her parents and the Holocaust that it jarred with each reference. The need for \\"outing\\" in general is one that I don't understand--personally, whatever orientation one's sexuality might be has no interest or relevance to me. Who cares? But, in particular in this tale of life and death, it palls in comparison of importance--except to Helen.The second huge question in my mind would be the morality of revealing a history that the parents spent a lifetime concealing. Seemed bordering on cruelty to broadcast it to the world in a book. An action ever so selfish--perhaps healing for Helen, but not helpful to her parents and her aunt, who it seemed to me suffered quite enough.I would advise friends to read the book, and see what THEIR opinion might be. Would be an interesting book group book, to air the differing opinions that might crop up in that setting. Am sure that many would not agree with me, and it would be fascinating to hear other presentations. I didn't read the other reviews, but will after I post this--rather like a huge book group!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"Ms. Fremont's After Long Silence tackles her family's deeply buried memories of their experiences with the Holocaust. To do this it was necessary to confront her family - a family in denial of their heritage - and cause unspeakable memories to be laid open like wounds. It would have been extremely difficult to face these memories, yet the remembering itself seems to have been therapeutic for both generations. My children simply do not realize the depth of the suffering that occured during the holocaust, nor do I wish that for them. Yet, having endured this suffering, they have created character that would otherwise been impossible. They say &quot;What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,&quot; and this is certainly true for this family. After Long Silence is extremely readable given the subject matter and you sometimes forget that you are in the middle of a non-fiction memoir. Great book!"},{"Title":"After Long Silence: A Memoir","review":"This is a wonderful book. It reads like a well-crafted novel. It is rich in language, story and characters. I am astounded by the anger expressed in some of the customer reviews here. I wonder where it comes from. It reminds me of a woman I once knew who whispered the word \\"Jewish\\" every time she used it to describe someone, as if being a Jew was something shameful. I wonder if the unfair criticism of an obvious work of literary merit hides a foolish and insulting notion that everyone would embrace Christianity over Judaism if given the chance. Why the secret you ask? What chance did Batya and Zosia have not to hide the truth? They were forced by savage violence to deny who they were in order to live. Choosing life is requirement of Judaism, incidentally. L'chaim, the traditional toast means \\"to life.\\" So by choosing survival over certain death they were fufilling a Jewish commandment nonetheless. The Bocards were victims of unspeakable terror. They started their marriage with what must have been enormously painful survivor guilt. Of course they kept it secret. How could Batya admit to her own children that their grandparents died because they couldn't \\"pass\\" for non-Jews with the same ease as she and Zosia could. Imagine the guilt they must have felt. Batya and Zosia loved their parents. Their parents wanted them to survive. The great tragedy is that all this sadness affected the next generation. I applaud Helen and Lara and the elder Bocards for their courage to seek truth for themselves.

While this is an interesting story, which is much more common than many people realize, I felt disappointed by the book. The writing style was weak and the filling in of details from the past was distracting. Furthermore, I was infuriated at the author's need to &quot;out&quot; her family's Judaism to members who would have rather stayed &quot;in the closet&quot;. I felt particularly incensed by this, given the fact that she apparently respected her lesbian friends need to make their own decisions about whether to share their identity with the world."},{"Title":"Jobs in arts and media management: What they are and how to get one!","review":"Jobs in Arts and Media Management provides a wonderful overview of the arts management profession.

Twenty-five years ago, when I was hired to direct my first art center, arts management was not yet a recognized academic program of study. It was that year that the Association of Arts Administration Educators (AAAE) was formed. Today, AAAE boasts over 35 domestic and international institutional members (colleges and universities). Over 80 other higher education programs in arts management exist across the U.S. How I wish that I had access to them as I pursued my education! In today's competitive marketplace, arts organizations are increasingly searching for managers who have been prepared in theory and practice. A combination of life or academic experience as a practicing artist, plus strong communication, technology, research, interpersonal, development, and business skills are now required for successful arts management. This book covers the breadth of possibilities available to those who aspire to combine and apply a passion for the arts with sound business management. This is a no-nonsense, articulate, and useful &quot;how-to&quot; book.

Learning how to make a hamper from split oak, or skinning and cooking a squirrel may not be lessons that the average citizen needs in this modern time of plenty, but you may be inspired to try some of these projects yourself; everyone will be moved and entertained by this living bit of history.I only wish that every nonfiction book were this simple, this original, this readable, and this brilliant.Thank goodness this project happened in time to immortalize many of the contributors."},{"Title":"THE FOXFIRE BOOK Hog Dressing, Log Cabin Building, Mountain Crafts and Foods, Planting by the Signs, Snake Lore, Hunting Tales, Faith Healing, Moonshining, and Other Affairs of Plain Living.","review":"For generations people of the Appalachia have been practicing sustainable lifestyles.

It did. One thing that meant much more to me as an older man are the verbatim words of the people spoken about in the books. They even use the vernacular of the old time Kentucky mountain people. But it is what they are trying to pass on to the newer generations that means so much to me, and I suspect this is the very reason the Foxfire series of books was written in the first place. I highly recommend these books to anyone who is interested in the history of this part of America, and especially to anyone who is interested in learning how the old timers did things. This can be essential information if the country ever collapses into the chaos of economic self-destruction or governmental collapse. I am going to purchase the entire series of books again, and this time they will be kept on bookshelves and saved for any future contingency. I highly recommend these books to you.

And even though this is the work of high school students, the writing is clear, concise, informative, and very readable. Good writing is good writing.Each volume is like a time capsule, capturing the wisdom and know-how from individuals born around the turn of the 20th century. And while the focus is based around the inhabitants in and around Rabun County, Georgia, this information shows life as it was in America circa the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.After reading several of these volumes, I think what appealed to me most of all was the fact that these older folks in the 80s and 90s weren't viewed as forgotten relics of a bygone era. They were treated with respect and dignity, and their memories treated as the treasures that they indeed are. It's a shame nowadays that we don't have more publications like Foxfire that highlight the knowledge gained from our older population. So many folks in the 70s, 80s, and 90s sit alone at home, or nursing homes forgotten and alone. They are untapped resources of great stories and wisdom. Fortunately for us, the people at Foxfire realized the value of these individuals and preserved some of those stories for future generations to cherish and enjoy.If you have an interest in 19th century knowlege and an appreciation or an interest in how things used to be, you cannot do without this series."},{"Title":"THE FOXFIRE BOOK Hog Dressing, Log Cabin Building, Mountain Crafts and Foods, Planting by the Signs, Snake Lore, Hunting Tales, Faith Healing, Moonshining, and Other Affairs of Plain Living.","review":"My great-grand parents and my grandparents and even most recently my 97 year old aunt did live and think like this.

My mother's mother was part Cherokee indian and they too passed along a lot of what was in the book.

My car at the time was a 1973 Plymouth station wagon that got 12 mpg on a good day. Downhill. With a tail wind. Because fuel costs were eating up a good part of my check, I began to explore the possibilities of fueling the car with alternative fuels, mainly moonshine.

Needless to say, I never got around to building my still, but my interest in the tradition of oral history was fired in a big way.

If you've ever been interested in how rural Americans survived before the days of Wal-Mart and Shoprite, you only have to look to the Foxfire books.These books are very useful and informative. They come with plenty of diagrams and photos to teach you how to live off the land. Before the advent of trailer homes and double-wides, rural Americans had to build log homes. Before satellite TV and Playstations we had banjos and ghost stories.

Golden Age SF tales were often (though not always) stereotypical space operas and high-tech adventures. But occasionally you'll come across an unconventional and head-tipping gem, like this one. C.L. Moore's extra creepy and incredibly inventive works in both SF and horror really demand greater respect from modern fans, and her husband Henry Kuttner was a deservedly respected Golden Age bard himself. This book offers an incredibly creepy and disturbing tale of four WWII spies from both sides, who have somehow been transported billions and billions of years into the future. They arrive at a time when Earth is environmentally devastated and humans are nearly extinct, after an eons-old invasion by aliens who are themselves nearly extinct. In addition to the melancholy state of this really distant future world (way beyond the near-future or sort-of-far-future of most SF), Moore and Kuttner's aliens are inventively evil and horrifically \\"alien\\" in every sense of the world. There is also an effective subplot in which the humans from our age try to cope with the fact that their ideological disputes have become meaningless, but they still can't get over their personal animosity. This novel is recommended for fans of literary and speculative SF that rises above trends and stereotypes. It was so far ahead of its time in 1943 that it has become timeless today. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Earth's last citadel","review":"This story begins in the deserts of Tunisia. World War 2 rages over the country and Alan Drake, an American Army Intelligence man, is struggling to complete his latest mission. His job is to get the Scots scientist Sir Colin Douglas out of the hands of the Nazis and to Allied safety. The two fugitives are making their journey cross-country be foot. They are pursued by two Nazi agents: Karen Martin, a sly, ruthless but charming woman of mixed races, and Mike Smith, an Americanized German with a history in racketeering and a strong instinct for killing. All four simultaneously pass over the crest of a ridge and come upon each other, but more importantly come upon a strange ovoid-shaped craft, which is half buried in the earth in a crater. The craft is glowing with heat like a meteorite, but its surface is perfectly smooth and unpitted as if its furious plunge from the sky has left it unharmed. The two parties draw weapons and a standoff occurs, but suddenly, as if commanded by telepathic control, all four walk into the strange craft. The craft buries itself in the ground and Alan Drake is dimly aware of strange 'dreams', of an alien creature hovering in a doorway, and of time passing. When all four awake they find themselves transported far into the distant future. What strange adventures and what dangers await the four twentieth century travelers? Will they ever return to their own time?C.L. Moore and Henry Kuttner are two famous authors of the 'Classic Era' (1930s to 1950s) of science fiction writing. Neither is remembered much today, though they are both well worth reading. The two authors independently established their careers as fiction writers, then married in 1940, after which they often wrote as a team. This novel is one of their early team efforts and it manages to successfully combine Moore's high-adventure style with Kuttner's \\"more cerebral storytelling.\\" The story moves along at a quick pace: we hardly get used to one circumstance before we are thrust into some new occurrence. But there is depth also, especially when we read the brief, but interesting, descriptions of the various strange 'mind-states' that the hero, Alan Drake, experiences. Also of depth is Mike Smith's descent from cool, confident agent to fearful, crazy-man.At around 150 pages this book is a quick read, and indeed it could possibly be describes as a novella. Moore and Kuttner wrote for the pulp magazine trade which, because of the limit of physical size, encouraged shorter works. &lt;Earth's Last Citadel> (1943) is just the right size to curl up with for a weekend's entertainment.Of course each book takes a place in the history of literature and this novel shows a number of similarities to the famous earlier bookThe Moon Poolby A. Merritt (1919). The chief of these similarities is a non-corporeal, 'energy' monster with mind-control capabilities. Moore and Kuttner have definitely put their own spin on these details and thus made the monster 'their own'. Anyone who has read the earlier book would not be disappointed by this one.If you are interested in books which provide a lot of adventure with some depth of description and characterization this is the novel for you, but if you are looking for something like Nobel Prize winning fiction you should skip this one. This is basically good quality pulp and I found it very entertaining and am happy to award it four stars."},{"Title":"Earth's last citadel","review":"I wish I could find more of C.L. Moore's books because she's an amazing writer. Despite some typos, the book seems very ahead of its time for science fiction. The characters are fun, the setting is creepy yet interesting, and the plot is perfect for the genre. C.L. More and her husband Henry Kuttner deserve more attention."},{"Title":"Earth's last citadel","review":"Catherine Moore and Henry Kuttner, generally acknowledged to be the preeminent husband-and-wife writing team in sci-fi history, initially had their novella \\"Earth's Last Citadel\\" released in the pages of \\"Argosy\\" magazine in 1943 (indeed, it was the very last piece of science fiction to be serialized in that publication). It was finally published in book form 21 years later. This is a pretty way-out piece of sci-fi/fantasy that reveals its debt to a handful of writers who had been major influences on the pair, particularly the florid early works of Abraham Merritt. In it, four participants in the conflict known as World War II are shanghaied from the beaches of Tunisia and brought billions of years into Earth's future. The quartet includes Alan Drake, a U.S. Army Intelligence officer; Sir Colin Douglas, a Scotch physicist whom Drake had been rescuing; Karen Martin, an adventuress working for the Nazis; and Mike Smith, an Americanized German also working for der Fuhrer. The four are forced to put their differences aside when they reawaken and discover a moribund Earth, populated by giant worms and wailing flying creatures and shrouded in perpetual mists. This early section of the book is very well done indeed; a bravura piece of outre and descriptive writing that really makes the reader feel the desolation of the landscape. Later, our band of confused heroes becomes involved with the jewellike, underground city of Carcasilla, the barbarous Terasi, AND a sentient, alien vortex of energy that is trying to suck the life out of Earth's last survivors. It is in the authors' descriptions of the fantastic, gravity-defying city of Carcasilla that their fondness for the hyperadjectival purple prose of A. Merritt is most noticeable, but nobody tops ol' Abe in this department. There are also tips of the chapeau to the works of H. Rider Haggard, the so-called \\"Father of the Lost Race Novel,\\" not least of all with the inclusion of a fountain of light energy that bestows virtual immortality; only a very slight variant of Haggard's Fountain of Life in his classic 1887 novel \\"She.\\" Kuttner's love of the works of H.P. Lovecraft, with whom Kuttner corresponded in the 1930s, is certainly hinted at in his descriptions of the life-draining Alien, a nameless entity so very different from terrestrial life that it might as well have leaped gibbering from the pages of the Cthulhu mythos. \\"Earth's Last Citadel\\" is a brief, fast-moving tale, and at 128 pages can easily be consumed in a few sittings. Typical for Kuttner and Moore, it is a perfect blending of their respective talents, and should satisfy most lovers of Golden Age sci-fi and colorful fantasy. As for me, I was a tad dissatisfied with the book's refusal to answer all my questions (such as why and how our heroes and the central Alien got into this mess to begin with!), and with how difficult it is at times to visualize certain aspects of the Carcasillan landscape. (The city's architecture is almost surreal, with its waterfall steps, liquid towers, etc.) Still, forcing a reader to exercise his/her imagination to the full certainly isn't the worst fault a writer can be guilty of! And to be completely honest, \\"Earth's Last Citadel\\" had me fairly riveted throughout..."},{"Title":"A Tiger Among the Jungle","review":"This book was rather sickening. The author first bragged about forming coalitions with people that raise fighting roosters in order to fight against humane society groups. Cockfighting is illegal in 48 states and a felony in 32, but this guy had no qualms working with people that put knives on roosters and have them fight each other. He also talked about \\"partying\\" in a strippers trailer park home while in Toronto to, again, fight against a local humane society. In that chapter he even admits to going through city council chambers on the weekend and photocopying their private files without their permission.The author seems to have a grudge against anyone he worked with that didn't do things his way from start to finish, and he lets his anger pour forth in this book.He also attempts to defend the abuse of elephants in the circus by completely avoided subjects such as the use of electric shock or food deprivation to make these wild animals do tricks.All in all, this is part propaganda sheet, part sleazy bio, part hit piece on many people he has worked with. I give it two thumbs down."},{"Title":"A Tiger Among the Jungle","review":"This book is so poorly written that PETA is undoubtedly pleased with it - the author's ignorance is showing with every grammatical error and every poorly constructed sentence.

This volume is the first of five (the next three also published by Da Capo Press) that the author uses to describe and prescribe the art of war. In this inaugural book, Dodge effectively defines his terms, principally the term strategy. This is important because this theme is progressed through the times and actions of Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, and Napoleon.Dodge's unique contribution to the subject comes from a few persepectives: first, Dodge was a soldier in the Union Army. His books were all published before the turn of the 20th century. He has often physically walked the terrain, studied the topography, and diligently compares the ancient accounts with common sense observation, with some surprising conclusions. Second, Dodge concentrates on what he is qualified to judge, military operations, tactics, leadership, and morale. He is not interesting in court politics, who loved whom, or how much it cost to outfit an elefant for battle. Many times these aspects are presented, but the author makes pains to state his inability to interpret such events. What he does do is to bring to life the man, his armies, battles, and campaigns. Most of all, the reader gets the sense of the Great Captain's position in the military story of man.There are some weaknesses. There is a sense of &quot;post holing&quot; as Dodge attempts to cover 3000 years of military history and innovation. At times, the military aspects receives more attention than it should, and the books ends rather abruptly instead of leading into the next volume: Hannibal. With these weaknesses in mind the reader will have an enjoyable experience. Dodge's style is crisp, entertaining, humorous at times, and always provocative as he inevitably compares ancient military practices with those that he was familiar with, 19th century America.The whole series is worth its weight."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"Alexander by Theodore Dodge is a beautifully written book that delves into all relevant areas relating to Alexander's fight to spread Hellenism. The book gives detailed and unequivoval accounts of his great battles. It also gives one a good understanding for what military technology was available to Alexander at the time. It also focuses on the enemies of Alexander and their military strengths and developments. Theodore Dodge is a military historian and thus he does not go into the culture of both greece and Persia as much as I would have like him to. It is amazing how his work can still remain an authority after 100 years since its first publication. This shows what a great book it is and what an objective writer Theodore Dodge truly is. I have also read Hannibal and Caesar by the same author, and I find them equally great."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"Its good to see the works of Dodge in print again. His six volumes chronicling the history and development of warfare were classics of their kind. Written in the 1880s, these books still have a lot to say about this subject. Granted some of the information on the organiaztion and tactics of ancient armies may be somewhat dated. Also Dodge's somewhat jaundiced view toward Asian non-western armies may seem a bit out of date in these hyper-politically correct times, but his opinions are always insightful and interesting.What makes this history of Alexander different is the background development of ancient warfare leading up to his time, as well as the purely military analysis. The reader gets a first-rate discussion of military development and innovation before his time which places the Macedonian army and Alexander in greater perspective. You won't find this kind of depth in many other histories on Alexander. Other than JFC Fuller's analysis on Alexander's generalship, there are precious few works that devote much time to this most important aspect of his life. Whatever else Alexander was, and he was, and remains many different things to different people, he was, first and foremost, a great military genius. This is what we should remember him most for. Many more recent works often forget this important aspect, and place too much emphasis on his character. Many biographers try to read too much into his actions, and have their own agendas to pursue in discussing Alexander's actions. This must have been so in Dodges day as well as he often comments on this tendency.One of the great things about Dodge is his often candid and frank observations. His writing style is also smooth and elegant. Too bad more historians today don't have this style of elegance anymore. Dodge avoids most of the controversial aspects surrounding Alexander's life, although he will often mention them in passing and offer a brief opinion. The reader is constantly reminded that this is a military analysis of the great Macedonian, not a biographical one. While Dodge's view is decidely pro-Alexander, he does acknowledge some of the darker aspects of his character. The reader is left to make his own judgement about these matters. Like Arrian, Dodge tries to stick to the matter at hand, and throughout maintains a solid and consistent narrative. The maps and diagrams provided may seem inadequate by today's standards, but they are numerous and very helpful in trying to understand Alexander's battles and campaigns. More works on Alexander should have maps like this.Dodge provides a fine military narrative of Alexander. You won't find any mention of the deviant sides of his character, which is so popular today. For those aspects the reader should turn to the fanciful works of Mary Renault who freely discusses such things. Dodge's work is an excellent companion to any modern day biography of Alexander. You won't find any better discussion of the military aspects of his life than in these pages. Highly recommended for all interested in ancient warfare and the development of military conflict in general."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"Here Mr. Dodge has broken down Alexander into the general that all can understand. I myself have been to Granicus, Issus, Tyre, and Gugamela I consider myself luck to see where Alexander won great victories and Mr Dodge show how these battles unfolded and how Alexander exploited the Persians at every battle they met.' Shows Darius as he really was, a coward and no true leader. Alexander is complex but very shallow in according to Mr. Dodge To the average reader I reccommed this book.

He doesn't focus on the personal peculiariaties of the people involved as do modern books. Excellant primer on Alexander's conquests and warefare of the ancient world."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"In an admirable work,Theodore Dodge,a soldier for the Union Army during the American Civil War,narrates in detail the campaigns &amp; exploits of who is perhaps the greatest soldier &amp; general of all time.Highlighting Alexander's strong points,&amp; his weaknesses,one cant help but admire &amp; be overwhelmed by the amount of information Dodge offers for the reader.Illustrations &amp; maps help &amp; illustrate for the readers information &amp; pleasure.As the previous reviewer pointedly said,this book is not so much about the personal or political life of Alexander,but his military one.Any criticisms lodged at the book concerning the former would be faulty,to say the least.The only flaws of this book are the less than detailed maps showing the battles movements,&amp; the authors perhaps all too glowing praise for the subject.But since Dodge was a soldier,he most likely knew more than what a common layman does.Comprehensive,exhaustive,detailed,&amp; admirably contemporary,Dodge's work is an admirable effort for military students &amp; readers alike."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"This is a great book which I would highly recommend for the casual student of ancient history. Mr. Dodge wrote the book shortly after the American Civil War. Some of his facts relating to marginal issues are incorrect, such as ancient Egyption timelines, but this does not detract from his compelling narrative and analysis of Alexander the Great. You'll probably find yourself rereading the chapters on Alexander's stunning victories in battle. Although the book is somewhat long, I can bet you'll soon be scouring Amazon.com for related texts. Check out Dodge's books on Caesar and Hanibal, as well as Fuller's book on Alexander."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"In the last few months a film by Oliver Stone has released based on the life of Alexander of Macedon. It is interesting to compare the character portrayed in the film and the character portrayed in Dodges book. In the film the success of Alexander arises because of his charisma his ability to influence his troops. The book tells a different story.Dodge explains in detail every step of Alexander's campaigns and he tries to explain the logic and reason behind every move. Some have suggested that Alexander's success was the result of his superb and highly trained army. Something bequeathed to him by his father. However others had invaded Persia before without success including the Spartans.Alexander thought carefully through the problems of conquering such a vast empire as that of Persia. The first part of his campaign was devoted to building a logistical base for the conquest. He thus defeated two Persian armies and then set about the conquest of the Ionian coast, Palestine and Egypt. The reason being to destroy the Persian navy and to ensure that when he moved against the heart of the Persian Empire he would have a steady supply of men food and horses to keep the war going.The general impression of a military genius is a person who the impulsive movement of troops is able to conquer. Dodges book shows how much Alexander's genius was based on the mastery of detail. At the siege of Tyre he built a land bridge out to the city which was on an island. As the defenders developed means of impeding the work he developed counter measures. As he moved through Asia he ensured the loyalty of the areas he moved through not only by leaving garrisons but building relationships by the giving reductions in tribute by promoting popular rulers and when necessary by shows of brutality and force.Perhaps the most impressive battle he fought was against the Indian King Porus. His victories against the Persian King Darius had been assisted by that Kings flights from the battle fields. Porus was a lot braver and not only did he have a highly trained army he over 200 war elephants. Alexander to defeat Porus not only had to deal with these issues but he had to cross an enormous river in the face of a well lead and well equipped army. Dodge's account of this battle is probably one of the best in the book. The manourvering and Alexander's skill come out well in Dodge's account.The negative side of the book is that the social attitudes and world view in the book are those of another age. Dodge was an American veteran of Gettysburg who lost his leg in that battle and in later life made his living as an author. He writes from the perspective that Alexander was not only a military genius but a person who represented the western way of doing things whilst his adversaries represented the Oriental way of doing things. This gloss is a bit unhistorical and occasionally mars the narrative but this is a minor quibble in reading a book which by and large is still readable today and is good. Broadly because of his military experience Dodge is able to understand and to explain the issues of logistics and marching and movement of an army such as Alexanders.And in comparing the book to the film one can see that the key to Alexander's charisma and place in history is not due to the fact that he was good looking or that he carried himself in a certain way. Rather the charisma is something which grew from his mastery of detail and his ability to be a successful commander."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"What a great book.Although the first part may come off as superficial or like an empty shell beside the brilliant account of Alexander's campaigns,it still is informative to the reader lacking the knowledge of such.Next we go to the man himself.In one of the most easiest &amp; most substantial prose styles ever seen,Dodge admirably narrates in breathtaking detail the campaigns of perhaps the greatest general &amp; soldier of all time.Indispensable."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"This and the Hannibal and Caesar books in the series provide very detailed descriptions of the battles. What is lacking is any kind of analysis of events and battle tactics and, more importantly, there's no synthesis whatsoever that addresses the Origin and Growth of the Art of War, the theme of the series. For that, the first volume of Delbruck's series is more insightful and the four books by Connolly, Hanson, Goldsworthy, and Warry on greek and roman warfare have more illustrative maps."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"Theodore Dodge&#8217;s publication Alexander chronicles the military history of the world from the &#8220;early history of war.&#8221; Dodge stresses the importance and value of military history and how it has been the base for strategy on the battlefield ever since military conflict has been recorded. Although the writing may be a little straight forward and boring at times , it is full of useful and interesting information."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"This is an interesting book to read. It was written in the late 1800's by a former soldier with an eye toward conveying the military aspects of Alexander's achievements (Dodge wrote an extensive history of the development of the art of war of which Alexander represents a significant component). As such, there is much attention to the details of topography, troop locations, attack alignment and similar information that will interest those who enjoy such things, but will not be enjoyable for the reader looking for a history of Alexander as a person, a ruler, or a diplomat. In short, if you're interested in Alexander's military career, this book will fascinate, but if other parts of his history are appealing, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"The book's strong points are its detailed maps and illustrations,but it suffers from an unconvincing analysis of Alexander's motives,plans and their results.Dodge has a tendency to take many things at face value and is a modern day victim of Alexander's own propaganda campaign.this is clearly seen in Dodge's failure to implicate Alexander in the assassination of his father Phillip despite overwhelming evidence,his lack of understanding of Alexander's long political struggle against Parmenio's clan for dominance over the army[motive enough for their eventual purge] and of Alexander's shaky relations with the subjugated Greek citystates.Even Dodge's analysis of the key battles of Granicus and Chaeronaea and the siege of Thebes are suspect.As for the most readable part of the book, the narrative of Alexander's conquest,credit is better given to Arrian's primary text.For a far more interesting and convincing look into a man as brilliant and complex as Alexander I would reccomend Peter Green's 'Alexander of Macedon', Fuller's 'Generalship of Alexander ' and Arrian's 'Campaigns of Alexander'."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"I've bought Theodore Dodge's books: Alexander, Hannibal, Gustavus Adolphus and own Vol. I & II of Napoleon and I will order Volumes 3 & 4 soon enough.Mr. Dodge wrote from a 19th century perspective but his version is an authority indeed.Very compacted information about military campaigns & battles!This IS a military history, not a biography.This is not a nitty gritty tactics book nor extensive describer of Alexander's army.Theodore Dodge does include info. here that is pre-Alexander as well.What this book is, is the chronicling of Alexander's military career via warfare.Buy this book, I doubt you'll find a better one.P.S. Michael Grant, who did the BBC (I believe) special (Circa 2000, maybe) journeyed to the places Alexander went. He also wrote a book on Alexander and said that Dodge's book was WAY more informative and complete than his own written book.If possible watch Grant's documentary & read this book concurrently!Steve K."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"I won't cover in detail what many of the other reviewers have already noted: very interesting work before 1900, done by a military man, emphasis on military history - not primarily a biography, a bit dated - with things interpreted from a rifled musket/cannon/cavalry era point of view. Dodge is also a bit biased with his own social/religious notions creeping in at time - more so later in the work on Caesar and Hannibal. Of the \\"Great Captains\\" series, it is clear that he thought Gustavus Aldophus was the ideal Great Captain from as much a moral/religious viewpoint as from a military one. Modern historians would probably rate Caesar and Napoleon far higher given our appreciation of the logistics and the political nature of large scale warfare.If you are interested in the military history of Alexander - this is a nice work and reads quite smoothly. Unlike many military histories which emphasize the big name battles (Arbela, Issus, Siege of Tyre, etc.) this work discusses the little battles and struggles as well - notably Alexander's Danube campaign and how he wended his way through the mountain passes and addresses how he kept his rear areas under control. I had the pleasure of reading an original 1890's era copy and this one is an excellent reproduction."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"This book has helped me get a feel for what was happening between the era of 1)Babylonian Empire's dominance followed by Persia; and 2) the later era of Roman hegemony. I knew the Ptolemies and the Seleucids figured in there, but needed this book to contextualize Alexander. Asia Minor, and modern Turkey, now seem to make more sense. The movies &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; and the more recent &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; also fall into place better."},{"Title":"Alexander","review":"This book is out of date on two fronts. First, if you are interested in a history of the life of Alexander there are many works of modern scholarship from which to choose. If these do not suffice, you can cut out the middle man and read Arrian, Quintus Curtius or Plutarch in excellent modern translations (or the original if your Latin isn't too rusty). Second, as a work on military tactics, it is written from the perspective of the Civil war era. Thus we get discussions of cavalry techniques which apparently hadn't changed much from Alexander's day to Dodge's.That said, this is still one of the best histories of the Alexandrine age I have read. It is written with clarity and force and doesn't skimp on details. It concentrates mostly on military matters although it gives enough political and social background to provide an understanding of the strategic significance of events. The book opens with a discussion of military force predating Alexander and tries to make the point that, prior to Greeks, there had been no real use of tactics on the battlefield - a questionable conclusion, I think. There follows a discussion of Persian and Greek arms and tactics and then, at about two hundred pages, it begins a discussion of Alexander proper. The battles of Granicus, Issus and Arbela are all discussed with considerable attention to tactical detail. Dodge then follows Alexander through Persia to Afghanistan and ultimately India. Small maps detail this journey and the myriad small, mopping up battles that ensued. The maps occasionally seem a little suspect given that the first-hand knowledge available to a Civil War veteran of that part of the world was probably small. It seems unlikely Dodge really knew much about the places he describes here. In his two works on ancient generals, Caesar and Hannibal, he visited most of the places he describes. This seems unlikely for the passes of the Hindu-Kush or the courses of the Oxus river. Its hard to get there these days, never mind in the 19th century.For the most part, however, I really enjoyed Dodge's use of small and very clear diagrams throughout - both as maps and as drawings of equipment etc. These hand drawn items greatly improve the clarity of the book and help you to follow the tactical details of the actions described in the text.The book closes with a discussion of the Indian campaign, Alexander's return to Persia and his eventual death and sucessors. Dodge clearly thought highly of Alexander - and perhaps rightly so. He does, however, excuse many of his errors, personal and tactical. Alexander's choice of route for returning to Persia is not seen as the tremendous strategic and tactical blunder that it was, for example. An final interesting question raised by Dodge is whether Rome would have stood against Alexander. His answer - no.If you want great depth or modern scholarship this is not the place to find it but, while the book has its flaws, it is a great read for those unfamiliar with Alexander or those wanting a basic understanding of the tactics and strategy that made him so successful."},{"Title":"Gods Gifted People","review":"This little book takes the information from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality profile and applies it to how people's personalities might be most effectively plugged in to congregational life.A short version of the indicator is included in the book, along with information on how to obtain the full survey. All sixteen types are listed, their type described, and possible &quot;fits&quot; in church life suggested. The author, a psychologist, consultant, seminary teacher, and author, is careful in his application of the MBTI results-- more suggestive than prescriptive.A very helpful book.

I read it to my 4 and 6 year olds, and they were quickly bored. There is a lot of information and detail that will leave little ones distracted.However, the book should prove very interesting to older children because of its excellent illustrations and interesting story.Follow Professor Curious as he tries to figure out how dinosaur footprints could be found at the top of the Alps. Especially since dinosaurs were, &quot;big, fat, and somewhat lazy.&quot; and, &quot;They hated hiking.&quot; The author uses humor, scientific theory, good examples and illustrations to answer the questions how dinosaur footprints arrived at the top of the Alps."},{"Title":"Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden","review":"Another Jane Ray book full of artwork that delights the eyes and the soul."},{"Title":"Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden","review":"Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, written and illustrated by Jane Ray, is a basically a retelling of the story in the book of Genesis. However, although the author includes all the elements of the Biblical creation story, this version differs from the Biblical story.As the publisher says in a blurb on the book's jacket flap: \\"Jane Ray's beautiful version of the familiar story takes into account creation myths the world over.\\" Thus, her story includes features never mentioned in the Bible, such as a fountain in the middle of the garden. Also, in this version there are two trees called the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life; the Bible says there was one tree called the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.After Adam and Eve are banished from the garden, the text says: \\"God gave Adam and Eve warm clothes to wear. He handed them some seeds and cuttings from the garden. Then God sent them out into the world.\\" When they leave the garden it says, \\"IN the bear earth beyond Eden, Adam and Eve planted anew garden for their family.\\"The illustrations in this book are truly beautiful. They provide a feast for the eyes with a plethora of colors and shapes. All of the pages have borders, some of which are greatly detailed with line drawings, pieces of musical scores, etc., giving the edges a quilt-like effect.What I Like: The artwork is my favorite part of the book. Be warned, though, it might be considered by some to be a bit sophisticated or inappropriate for children, as both Adam and Eve are clearly naked until they are removed from the garden. In one of the illustrations, one of Eve's naked breasts is rather prominent.What I Dislike: I like the different approach to the creation story, but I'm uncomfortable with the idea of the author using ideas from different \\"creation myths\\" for the book, as this implies the Biblical story is not true, it's just a myth.Overall Rating: Good.Christine M. Irvin - Christian Children's Book Revew"},{"Title":"Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden","review":"Ray's illustrations are lovely - colorful and luminous, with gilded touches to make everything everything in Eden seem newer, shinier, and more wondrous. Certain pages are framed with smaller, detailed pieces including maps, old-fashioned line drawings from scientific illustrations, and pieces of musical scores - that give them the appearance of sophisticated story quilts. Ray's people and animals are a wonderful example of the naive art style.The story follows Adam's creation, the formation of the Garden, the creation of the animals as (not entirely satisfactory) companions for Adam, Eve's creation, and then the Fall and exile Adam and Eve's separate punishments are lumped together and made less sexist and more palatable: \\"Now you will learn what it is to be sad as well as happy,\\" God said. \\"You will work your fingers to the bone growing food to eat and raising your children. And when you die, you will return to the earth from which you are made.\\"Interestingly enough, the book's final illustrations make Adam and Eve's eventual fate look not as bleak as traditionally pictured with the two of them venturing off into a dull, dusty earth and making a respectable home of it for themselves - a garden outside of the Garden or a piece of Home - a redemptive task in and of itself.Adam and Eve are nude - and funkily enough, tattooed - throughout (except in the final pages), but they blend in naturally with the varied patterns and coloration of the numerous animals surrounding them. Perhaps I myself fall a little on the laissez-faire side as regards nudity, but I think any parent who gets upset at the tiny peek we get at Eve's nipple here has perhaps a few issues to work through.In any case, my three-year-old son likes it and I think it's beautiful and well told, so thumbs up from us."},{"Title":"Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated and the story of Adam and Eve is touchingly told including their Fall from God's grace. However, be aware that there are several pictures that show some things that may be inappropriate for younger children. For instance Eve's nipple is quite apparent in one picture and there are several naked back-sides. Overall though this book is beautifully done with some of the prettiest illustrations of nature I've seen."},{"Title":"Civis romanus: A reader for the first two years of Latin","review":"Practice reading in Latin while diving into the private and public life of ancient Rome. This reader is a compilation of Latin pieces on topics that first and second year Latin students will find appealing - such as Roman legends, historical figures, famous events, and daily life in ancient Rome - and can be used in conjunction with any textbook series. The table of contents offers not only a list of readings, but outlines what grammar the student should know before attempting to read the passage with confidence and ease. These readings can serve as a contextual grammar review as well as the basis for a paralinguistic lesson.

What one might have expected to be an event-driven adventure story is actually a series of thoughtful human interest pieces.Each chapter unfolds gracefully, linking easily with the next, although each one stands well on its own, without having to rely too heavily on the others in order to be comprehended. The art style isn't &quot;cartoony&quot; by any means...Lutes is a shrewd observer of the human form, and his figures reflect his keen eye. He's also a tireless researcher, and you can rest assured that when he draws an automobile, or a cocktail dress, or a phonograph player, it's appropriate to the time and place. Artistic drama is heightened by his clever use of inking; indeed, his employment of sheer black compares favorably to that of Milton Caniff, although in more subtle ways. It's worth noting that Lutes seems to prefer dealing in strict black and white; there are no zip-a-tone grays here.But what makes &quot;BERLIN: BOOK ONE&quot; so compelling is the writing. Lutes has created a handful of characters whom we follow chapter after chapter; sometimes, their lives intersect, but in other instances they never meet with one another. Some are Bolsheviks, some are Nazis, some are just survivors in the rapidly shrinking middle. They are all fascinating, and the drama, the humor, and the uncertainty of their fictional lives against the very real historical backdrop of their era gives &quot;BERLIN&quot; its true power.This is the first volume of what Lutes promises will be a three book saga. One can only admire his audacity, and marvel at the success he has achieved so far."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"The Weimar presents a set of profound issues for an artist or historian to grapple with. Lutes has done a more than admirable job beginning a graphic narrative that does justice to the myriad issues the period dileneates for contemporray readers. He has a point of view, an ability to transmit nuance, complication and contradiction, some compelling characters, a drawing style that to my eye pays some homage to Masereel while taking a more realist turn and big ambitions. The problem here is that we only have 1/3 (now some new chapters have been produced) of a much larger work. It's hard to judge just how successful this project will be with only one third of the story arc completed. I for one appreciate anyone who grapples with the set of questions Lutes is engaged with here and think he's off to a fascinating start but it is kind of like judging an entire play by its first act. We can get swept up in the action in the first act, but at the first intermission we can only hold out hope the rest of the play rewards the promise we just had take a hold of us. It could be a classic or a disapointment. I eagerly await the answer to that."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"This is a graphic novel for people who like to think -- a complexly connected set of stories that move together in productive, thoughtful ways. Lutes takes full advantage of his spare, generous style of drawing in the creation of this graphic novel ... once you read it, you'll be dying for the next one to come out. It's historically and psychologically rich; a tremendous addition to this growing genre."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"The first in a project trilogy, Lutes' fictional attempt to recreate the confusing period of the tail-end of the Weimar Republic in Germany rambles and doubles back just a bit to much to satisfy. In trying to show how inter-war Germany was pulled to extremes by the Communists and National Socialists (Nazis), he creates a handful of characters and follows them from September 1928 to the violent May day clashes of 1929-with occasional flashbacks to World War I and the months following the armistice. The two main characters are journalist Kurt Severing and art student Marthe Muller, who meet on a train en route to Berlin (yes, they do eventually fall into bed together). Through his savvy and intelligent eyes, and her newcomer's naivet&eacute;, Lutes presents the political scene, one where the middle is disappearing, and every citizen is forced to pick a side. Ultimately, however, the book is far too ephemeral to work as a history lesson, and the relationships presented aren't compelling enough in and of themselves.As for the artwork, Lutes' style is what might be called \\"European\\" in that it's all clean black and white inks that bring to mind H&eacute;rge. Architecture, automobiles, and wardrobes are all skillfully executed, however Lutes has difficulties with faces. Many of the characters' faces are either oddly formed and proportioned, or are too similar to one another. Still, the publisher has to be commended for the beautifully designed and produced book."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"I picked up \\"Berlin: City of Stones\\" and immediately fell in love with it. The art is outstanding and the human interest is unsurpassed. Even minor characters who have but a few frames seem to have Tolstoy-novel vividness to them. For instance:1) A traffic director whose intestinal constipation makes him see the vehicles he's directing as loathsome insects.2) A physically vigorous fifty-ish newspaper distributor who likes making fun of the Nazis.3). A schoolteacher who faces down her dochstoss-spouting student by telling her pupils that November, 1918, was a good month for the German people, as it was the month that brought democracy.The book is full of these, along with major characters you'll care deeply about. The end - involving a single mother's vision of her now-estranged husband - very moving.I can't wait for the second installment of a story of individuals in this politically ablaze city. Mr. Lutes, please hurry!"},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"I love Berlin - there is something about the people, the pulse and rhythm of life in that city more than any other that speaks to me. Therefore I had to read Jason Lutes' triology of the city, set in the waning days of the Weimar Republic.In the winter of 1928 and spring of 1929, Berlin found itself still suffering from the war and increasingly divided between fascists and socialists. Historically, Lutes is dead-on: the bohemian days of the early 20's are gone, replaced with economic depression and a sense of desparation as the Weimar Republic began to implode. With this backdrop, Kurt Severing, a journalist and Marthe Muller, a young art student find themselves caught up crises both personal and part of the larger upheval of the times.Yet what really pulled me in wasn't so much the plot around Kurt and Marthe, but the broad cast of minor characters who pop in and out of the story. In this, Lutes does the city - and its inhabitants - justice enriching the story as Berliners wrestle with a haunting sense of loss from the war while facing their own small frustrations and the larger dissatisfaction with the political and social status quo. Added to this rich narrative tapistry is Lutes' clean drawing style, that for me, captured the spirit of that time and place.My enthusiasm about the book is certainly influenced by my fondness for the place and my professional interest in the time period. With that said, one could do much worse for a graphic novel in terms of art, story and attention to historical detail. Recommended."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"Lutes makes history human. He shows it doesn't just happen to people - people do it themselves. 1920s Germany comes alive, and Lutes shows politics wasn't something separate, left to politicians: it was life & death to everyday people. Lutes' Communists & fascists are real, and we feel their motivations. The love affair brought a lump to my throat. City of Stones is proof that education and emotion don't have to be separate.Finally, as a student of socialist history, I can vouch for Lutes' accuracy. The fascist street gangs with their wealthy backers, the communist cooperatives, rising anti-semitism set against revolutionary fervour - it's all there, drawn in beautiful, spare lines."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"This book is totally incredible. I consumed it in 2 late night sittings. The detail of each picture is so intricate, and the character portraits are fabulous.The novel follows several different people through their daily lives in 1928-1929 Berlin. Although I'm a history buff, I do not know much about the period, however prior knowledge is not necessary to become completely engrossed.The ending is stunning, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next of the Berlin books.This is a must-read for fans of graphic novels!"},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"If drawings, animation and other graphic froms of expression make you think &quot;For kids&quot; then don't bother. You're missing out though.Adult cartoons (not Fritz) are a great blend of media...you can tell a cinemtatic story that would never get produced as a film, and lend a type of visual detail to a tale that is hard to create in books. Jason Lute is great at picking up these details, and for those of us who grew up reading comics, we recognize a master at work."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"Give Lutes a lot of credit -- he's done his homework with this project. His cityscapes are impeccable; he packs a lot of historical detail into these stories in a creditably unobtrusive manner; he manages to make ordinary Germans of different walks of life come alive; and he captures -- to an extent I would've thought impossible in a graphic novel -- the nascent combustability of Weimar Germany. This is an especially difficult trick to pull off, since much of the conflict was ideological rather than, say, structural.He gives relatively short schrift to the middle classes and the sort of folks who would've been aligned with the Catholic Center Party, but this is really just nit-picking. It's totally fair, at this level of generality, to dissolve the conflict into one between the Nazis and the Communists. And while he humanizes and renders sympathetically the Communist characters (which he does not do for the Nazi ones), he nonetheless manages I think not to whitewash too much their flaws."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"This book starts the series Lutes has devoted years to creating, the story of Germany between the wars. The story follows the lives of several people, a journalist riling against the rise of fascism, a young art student conflicted with her feelings of love for other women, a married woman who is thrown out of her family by her husband for her leanings toward communism, as well as others. The story shows rallies for various political parties as well as peoples' feelings for Hindenburg and of course the first showings of the fledgling Nazi party.The drawings are beautiful with Lutes adopting Herge's line and crafting detailed panoramic views of the city as well as amazing crowd scenes and convincing period detail. There isn't a plot to the book, just a meandering toward the inevitable start of WW2.My only criticism is that it's boring. I'm sorry if that sounds like a shallow dismissal but there's no getting around the fact that nothing much happens in the book. Mostly all you see in this book are the poverty, the disabled soldiers begging on the streets, money slowly becoming worthless. I was hoping Lutes would do something different given the material, take a different angle perhaps, but he's just retold what happened. I've studied this period of history both at A-level and university level and I'm well aware of what went on. As a comic book series it's very dry and unfortunately Lutes cannot bring out the drama of the situation to make a gripping read. Mostly it's as dull as a history lesson populated with unconvincing characters. I wanted to like it but couldn't get into it. I struggled to get to the end and won't be looking at the next in the series. There are better comics out there."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"I'm not easily impressed by graphic novels (I hate the term \\"graphic novels,\\" but will use it until a better one comes along). Partly this is because most of them--like most conventional novels (and films, for that matter)--are mediocre. But mostly it's because the genre is an extremely difficult one--more akin to poetry than prose fiction, because the author/artist necessarily must convey meaning through a word or two, or a facial expression, or a single panel--and thus is hard to pull off.Jason Lutes' Berlin: City of Stones is, hands-down, the very best graphic novel I've ever read. Lutes is a poet who's able to express a world of meaning in just a few words and his incredibly evocative drawings. A raised eyebrow, a clenched fist, a look of wonderment or anxiety on the faces of his characters: these are all he needs to tell his story.And what a magnificent story it is. Using the early, turbulent years of the Weimar Republic as a backdrop, Lutes introduces a cast of characters that grow on the reader in an incredibly powerful way. There's the love story that involves the rather world-weary but still idealistic journalist Kurt Severing and the still-youngish but emotionally wounded artist Marthe Mueller. There's Anna, the boyish lesbian, who falls in love with Marthe, her fellow art student. There's jaded, cynical Margarethe, who's either Kurt's wife or his longtime paramour (it's not clear which). There's David, the young Jewish boy who escapes from an increasingly unfriendly world by hero-worshipping Harry Houdini (the consummate escape artist). There's Otto and Gudrun, a working class couple barely able to keep their two kids, Heinz and Silvia alive. Otto and Gudrun react to the economic and political chaos of the Weimar Republic in opposite ways: Gudrun is a Red, while Otto becomes a follower of the up and coming National Socialist Party. Their separate choices are representative of the greater political and cultural choices each of the novel's characters must face. They're also not unlike choices faced by contemporary readers of Lutes' Berlin. And there's another Otto, a dedicated Red who befriends Gudrun and who obviously is in love with her.The second volume of Lutes' projected Berlin trilogy will be out shortly, and I for one can't wait. There was a bit of a cliffhanger at the end of the first volume (I won't say what it is so as not to spoil things for those who haven't yet read it), and I'm anxious to see how Lutes follows up on it. But most of all, I'm eager to re-enter a world that, although presented in the minimalist way that's characteristic of graphic novels, has become astoundingly real, thanks to Lutes' genius."},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"To many people, the city of Berlin represents the seat of power for the Nazi government. While it is true that officially Berlin was the Capital of the Third Reich, it never really was the heart and soul of this criminal enterprise. Nazism emanated from Southern Germany.Since the end of World War II, Berlin has been the center of Cold War diplomacy, espionage and a center of a showdown between Democracy and Communism. Being a large metropolis which holds a large eclectic population, most people see Berlin as an evolved city that has transformed itself away from it supposed Nazi heritage. But the question in fact must be asked and that is, was Berlin the hotbed of Nazism? I really don't think it was. In the end it followed the rest of German politics and acquiesced to the Swastika.What Jason Lutes has created shows us a Berlin which many people don't know about. Through the eyes of Lutes' two main characters artist Marthe Muller and journalist Kurt Severing, we see a city splintered and very much in political and cultural transition. Lutes creates several subplots to show the reader the true mindset and essence of these turbulent times. The historical background of the effects of World War I and the subsequent disasters caused by the Treaty of Versailles are shown in the actions of the people residing in Berlin in 1929.Mr. Lutes' use of black and white graphics captures the feeling of this Prussian Capital in transition. The background of buildings and city scenes are images which truly reflect a true Northern Teutonic setting of the times.This graphic novel reads and images very well. It represents a genre classic to be savored. 5 Stars! No Problem!!"},{"Title":"Berlin: City of Stones: Book One (Part 1)","review":"Great writing with wonderful dialogue and fantastic artwork.

So much occurs in this format! It was highly enjoyable to read, unlike a regular novel that I might not have read on this subject. I immediately ordered Book Two and have started on that.

This makes it hard to sink into the story and lose yourself, as you're constantly being brought up short to ask yourself, \\"Is that a real word, or is it a scan-o?\\" The problem is made worse by two things: First, Buchan really does use an unusual vocabulary, including terms from hound tracking, Nordic words, terms from falconry and duck-hunting, and the like. So there are genuine additions to your vocabulary waiting here, and that makes it harder to pick out the scan-o's. Second, the scanning software they used apparently was linked to a dictionary and always fills in a real word instead of nonsense, where often if it just filled in nonsense, the original word would be easier to de-code. Example--it used \\"all\\" for \\"till\\" in one case. That took me a while of puzzling, and something like \\"tlll\\" would have been easier to figure out. \\"The\\" comes out as \\"me\\" several times. One of the funniest is \\"domes\\" for \\"clothes,\\" which is repeated every time the word \\"clothes\\" should appear.Buy this book, but buy it used and in some other edition. The editors at Elibron should be scolded and shouldn't sell another book until they can do some actual work to publish their books instead of scanning and selling without editing."},{"Title":"The island of sheep,","review":"Although The Island of Sheep is not the last time that Richard Hannay appears in a work by John Buchan, it is the final novel where he is an actual participant in events, and in some ways it is a fitting close for the little saga that begins with the classic The Thirty-Nine Steps and then moves through Greenmantle, Mr. Standfast and The Three Hostages -- much of the focus shifts to Hannay's son Peter John, and there is a sense of passing the torch on to a new generation. (Perhaps someday someone will write pastiches with Peter John as an agent during the Second World War?) Still, while I'm giving this book four stars, though I probably would prefer to assign it 3.5 instead. For me it took longer than usual to get the plot really going, and while the story line is compelling, it's to me more compelling on a personal level rather than on an international one, and the sense of reduced scale tended to limit my interest, I think. The absence of Sandy Arbuthnot and John Blenkiron may also have had something to do with my relative lack of enthusiasm. Still, I would recommend it even for the casual reader; for Hannay fans, it is of course a must."},{"Title":"The island of sheep,","review":"Richard Hannay and his doughty friends, including our hero's young son, take on bad men on a remote island off the Scandinavian coast (presumably the Faroe Islands)in this most readable adventure story. Buchan's stories are not complex; right is right and wrong is wrong. His writing, though, is quite poetic as he describes the Border Country of Scotland or the sea, and his stories always end with the reader's regret that the adventure is finished. His son, Peter John, is a teen-ager with interests in nature and living creatures that suggest the potential for a virtuous and productive manhood in the natural sciences. Unfortunately, this is the last of the Ricard Hannay series. Buchan died four years after writing The Island of Sheep, and his duties as Governor-General of Canada in the interim limited his writing output.In an era of moral relativism, it is refreshing to read Buchan's stories, with their hero who doubts not the nobility of his cause."},{"Title":"The island of sheep,","review":"I'm bit surprised that Buchan's Greenmantle seems to be more popular than this little gem. I put this book as a better read than 39 steps and Greenmantle, while the latter was a study in jingoism, advertising imperialism to all and sundry and dismissive of those of us with more melanin as savages, the former is dished with a plot that is quite unbelievable and over the top, really! This one, though peppered with lots of \\"Scots are great\\" and Scotland \\"a paradise on earth\\" and full of \\"burrrns\\" and glens is still a fast-track novel quite reminiscent of Don Brown's of our times. A good time pass and an interesting plot keep your interest till the \\"lived happily ever after\\" climaxPS:Somehow I have a feeling that the writer wanted to take the story to China and maybe because of lack of time or dearth of requisite material he had to end the tale in \\"Norlands\\".

I have recommended it to every other student in my laboratory. The photographs have amazing clarity and consistency. The text beginning each section and descriptive text following each photograph provides indispensable additional information for identification and understanding. It is very rare to see the backgrounds for each of the photographs a pristine white, so that the fine details can actually be distinguished. Each section is written with great care and with complete forethought. Even though this may not matter to many, but to me, the fact that is was spiral bound shows the amount of consideration to detail the author put into this atlas. There is nothing more frustrating then trying to keep a book open to the correct page, the ability for a book to be able to be lain flat on a table, and the having no problems with binding (e.g. broken binding resulting in loose pages). The comprehensive index helps you find a cell's information and/or photograph with just one quick glance. The amount of pages doesn't even begin to show the amount of knowledge that is encompassed in this book.

This however, is the first extensive, wide-ranging, and representative study of patronage as it relates to Shakespeare and the theatrical culture of his time. Twelve distinguished theatre historians address such questions as: What important functions did patronage have for the theatre during this period? How, in turn, did the theatre impact upon and represent patronage? Where do paying spectators and purchasers of printed drama fit into the discussion of patronage? The authors also show how patronage practices changed and developed from the early Tudor period to the years in which Shakespeare was the English theatre's leading artist. This important book will appeal to scholars of Renaissance social history a s well as those who focus on Shakespeare and his playwriting contemporaries.\\""},{"Title":"What Everyone Should Know About Islam and Muslims","review":"A GREAT book, the information is very well structured and it targets every non Muslim and I think many Muslims could also benefit from it.It proceeds in a very logical manner, first by setting the reader's mind to remove all the false media pictures about Islam away and start again from scratch.

Right to Left format. About 150 pages. A Haggadah filled with directions, Hebrew, English, explanations, reflections, and English transliterations. Heavy on the English. For example, Ha Lachma Anya is just one Hebrew paragraph followed by several English readings. The Four Questions are titled The Four Puzzlements. They are in Hebrew, English and transliteration and bookended with two English reflections. I found it very easy to use. Rather than presenting the text as-is in a linear fashion, the editor has broken up the paragraphs to make them more understandable. For example, the portions after Avadim Ha-yino and before the ten plagues are subtitled as \\"we were slaves...\\", \\"the rabbis of bnei brak\\", \\"the four praises...\\", \\"the four children\\", \\"a midrashic dialogue: how the Torah text shapes the Haggadah text\\", \\"our degradation: not slavery but idolatry\\", \\"god's promise to abraham\\", reflections on the wandering aramean, and each of the four verses of Deuteronomy 26. These provide a better understanding of the teachings than the standard haggadah. The ten plagues are followed by a reading on the modern plagues in our society. The haggadah closes with a Counting of the Omer and Hallel that is rich with explanations, and traditional songs, such as Ki Lo Naeh, Adir Hu, Echad Mi Yodea, Chad Gadya, Lo Yissa Goy, If I had a Hammer, Follow the Drinking Gourd, Down By The Riverside, and We Shall Overcome, and explanations as to their allegorical natures"},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"Although I am not a native speaker (in English of course), I decided to buy this book in the original version. I have been to Big Sur several times and always wanted to write something about it just because it is so beautiful over there. However, when I first noticed Henry Miller (he was named in a TV documentary, so TV does not always have to be a bad thing ;-)) I ordered this book. It is easy to read, although some vocabularies are rather uncommon to be used nowadays. It gets 5 stars because it exactly describes the region around Big Sur and the feeling you have being there. So; buy it!"},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"In many ways, this is Henry Miller's most upbeat book - a patchwork portrayal of episodes and characters in his newly-found home on the wild Big Sur coast. The prose flows very well - generally, it is a mellow narrative, although there are plenty of instances of the wicked humor and sarcasms left over from his TROPICS days. As Miller settles into his mid-life, hermetic lifestyle in this coastal paradise, it seems that his roamin' days are pretty much over. Yet, his notoriety soon catches up with him, with so many unannounced vistors seeking out the famous author of his once-banned books.This is an entertaining book, a mulligan stew of philosophical musings on art and living; of sketches of Miller's neighbors and wayfarers just passing through; of vignettes of the natural history of Big Sur and its pioneers; and, finally, of details of his very palpable everyday life with friends and family. It is Miller's insatiable love of life that pulls the reader into his portrait of this unique spot, the one he is immersed in as his home.The writing itself is some of Miller's most evocative I think; and yes, it rambles and strays a bit. But this is what makes for such an engaging read. These narrations are from a Henry Miller still searching for meanings to the Big Questions; yet now, the ramblings are being done through the immensity of Big Sur's grandeur instead of the streets and cafes of Paris and New York. It is here that Miller feels he can flourish as a writer, with a fresh freedom and outlook as he stares out at the vast western horizon each day.Hieronymus Bosch used oranges and other fruit in his painting to symbolize the delights of Paradise; Henry Miller has used his words as symbols to reveal to us what he has found in this enduring version of paradise. A most highly recommended read.ParataxisThe Cloud Reckoner\\"Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I am thinking there is something here I am not grasping. According to my Kindle I am 70% of the way through this book and it is incredibly boring. There were some brief points of profound observation, and some brief areas where the author did a nice job of describing the landscape and the people who inhabit it, but overall this book is boring."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"I first read Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch in my early twenties, soon after moving to California from the East Coast. During that first reading, I came to know a Henry Miller I'd never known from his fiction; I was impressed, and inspired. I also met a lot of people that I'd never heard of previously (can you imagine, never having heard of Robinson Jeffers? An east coast woman of 21 years had not!). It was a great read at that time. Many years later (I'm not going to say how many), I've decided to reread it. Once again, I am enjoying this book, and I'm discovering new things (or perhaps rediscovering things I'd forgotten) this time around.It's a ramble, however. There is no plot, there is no consistent train of thought, and there is nothing essentially sensational about it. If you're looking for the Henry Miller of the \\"Tropics,\\" or any of his other fictional writings, don't look here. This book is broadly philosophical, filled with anecdotes and personal revelations.Quotes that I feel summarize the theme of Big Sur and perhaps Henry Miller's motivation for living there are the following:\\"Surely every one realizes, at some point along the way, that he is capable of living a far better life than the one he has chosen.\\"\\"We create our fate everyday.\\"If you're a Henry Miller fan, this is the book to read to come to understand the man and the writer. He also draws a vivid picture of Big Sur era before it became heavily trafficked and overpopulated to the north of it. Definitely worth the time it'll take to read it."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"Miller's review of life in the 50's on Big Sur is engrossing in so far that it is separated from our contemporary lifestyle (for most Americans) where all needs are met quickly and without much hassle. He doesn't speak highly of being a recluse in the woods, cut-off from society like going into the wild, instead he favors moments of companionship; in visits from guests, sending and receiving mail. His appreciation for the quiet and grandeur of the country is full of compassion that resonates beyond our modern notions of conservationism, it is about the nearness to God and finding heaven on earth (and hell). This is Miller's testament to living simply and loving it."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"Henry Miller is one of my favorite writers. I love the title of this book and the cover art and I was hoping for something dreamy, imaginative, provocative. Not so. This book is long and tedious and I trudged through it and can't explain why. Besides a few bright and cutting views on the nature of art and being a writer, this book is downright boring. Here's why: Henry Miller struggled through a lot of his life and development as an artist and his adventures early on and the path to his success are exciting. By the time he moved to Big Sur and wrote this book he was in a different mindset. He was looking for some relaxation and good life and especially a sense of community. This is very clear through these insipid pages.So...here it is: Henry Miller moves to Big Sur and every single one of his new neighbors is fascinating to him- one likes to cook, one works on cars, one takes care of the kids. He describes all of his neighbors as if they are the best at whatever they do and they all had a heart of gold and other cliches. I got the impression he was writing this book in order to make better friends with his neighbors so they could see all the nice things he wrote about them when it came out.Instead, there are of course the tropic books, but the rosy crucifixion is a great series- particularly the first half ofSexus: The Rosy Crucifixion I. Read this instead. He just doesn't have it anymore with Big Sur."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"Clearly, this person hasn't a clue.

Miller has no equal!"},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"&quot;big sur and the oranges of Heronymos bosch&quot; is just the ramblings of an old henry Miller trying to remember different things that have happened to him. A complete waste of time."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"I first read this book exactly ten years ago when I was struggling through a profound period of depression. I don't want to say that the book cured me, because that would be too facile and too drastic a declaration, but I will say that Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch was the first real beacon, the first glimmer of light to lead me out of a suffocating psychological cave. I don't know why, exactly, but when I began reading the book, a deep sense of peace came over me for the first time in several months. The book seemed to open up my eyes and my ears and my throat and even my lungs; I found myself sucking in big sweet gulps of air, and I started to detect a freedom and a limitlessness in the world that I had previously failed to recognize. Of course, there is no way that I can promise that you will have the same reaction. Over the years I have passed the book along to various friends: Some of them have fallen in love with it and some of them have been utterly bored. That is understandable. The book has no plot; in fact, it doesn't really pretend to have any forward momentum. The narrative just floats. As other reviewers have noted (both enthusiastically and bitterly), Henry Miller delivers in this book a seemingly random swirl of philosophy, wit, character studies, soaring observations of topography and weather, literary and arty musings, puzzles, koans, epigrams, aphorisms, scripture, historical trivia, astrological forecasts, and jokes. It does not, upon first glance, have any point whatsoever. But that, friend, is the point. What Miller is laying out here (in a unique way, free of the usual hippie jargon) is a meditation on how to live a different life, a vibrant life, a life of the spirit, which is, by his definition, a narrative that refuses to conform to the usual numbing standards of conduct. So if you are looking for a &quot;story,&quot; per se, keep driving until you get to Monterey. And if you are looking for some of Henry Miller's famously invigorating foulness and fury, pick up Tropic of Cancer instead. If you are looking for peace, stop here.Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch is for any reader who is in the mood for a beguiling rumination on how a man once tried to bring peace into his life. The story, as such, is this: Henry Miller moves to Big Sur, one of the most beautiful places on the planet, and sets out to create a new home infused with energy, creativity, a sense of community, and an appreciation of nature, while at the same time he copes with intrusions and financial pressures and the charisma and creepiness of other people. That's it. If that sounds dull to you, steer clear. If it sounds seductive to you, plunge in. Because if these are issues that gnaw at your soul (and maybe they should, since our media-saturated culture is becoming more programmed and conformist every day), then you might find this book to be a page-turner as gripping as any of John Grisham's potboilers. I could not put it down. I read it straight through, and afterwards, I felt like every step I took was charged up with a new vitality. Crazy, huh? The way I see it, Henry Miller's big lascivious grin was one of the bravest acts of American rebellion, because it came roaring out of his heart, and the heart is where all true liberation takes place. That's the appeal of this book, for anybody who cares to explore it. In my case, this book said to a depressed man: There is another way to live. Choose it."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"In the 1940's and '50's, long before the New Age gurus and their guides to better living, author Henry Miller was letting his soul run free and writing about it high above the Pacific Ocean in remote Big Sur, California. This book is his account of that experience after his return from Europe and subsequent car tour of America. It is a refreshing, joyous, insightful, touching, humorous and often profound book that challenges our acceptance of today's hectic world while also being essential reading for those who have read the two Tropics and would like a better understanding of the man behind these books, two of the greatest and most controversial of all time.&quot;This is my answer!&quot; states Miller in the book's opening pages, and in this regard Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch is his Walden. Because it was here, in the far West, far removed from hs native New York, that Miller found the only home he could abide by in America, a place where he fe! lt he could live peaceably as a creative artist apart from a way of life he saw as thin and meaningless and which he had long since turned his back on.It was not easy living. The convict shack where Miller initially stayed, a thousand feet above the crashing waves, had neither electricity nor plumbing. There was also the intense isolation. At that time, Big Sur was strictly for the adventurous, a small colony of artists and individuals seeking to live and raise families freely, simply, and close to nature. Highway One had yet to bring the tourists.But despite these difficulties, and probably because of them, Miller came to see Big Sur as the first real home he had ever known. Creatively, he flourished, finding everything his spirit needed in the friendship of the community and the brilliant light and beauty of this road less traveled. He would live there for 15 years, writing, painting, raising a family, making friends, and suffering the occasional, unannounced fan! .It is clear in reading this book that the awesome beaut! y of Big Sur affected Miller deeply, as did Paris in the 1930's and Greece afterwards. He came to see the people he met there as kindred spirits in a timeless sanctuary conducive to reflection, perspective, and inner peace. This new found consciousness found its way into his writing.As with many of his books, Big Sur is not a strict linear narrative, but a collection of thoughts, reminiscences, hopes, dreams, loves, stories, and reveries. The core of the book -- what shines through most -- is the reality of the man, his viewpoint, and a wisdom born of spiritual freedom and real experience. This is not to be found in much of anything written today.Unlike today's authors, Miller knew what it was like to live without money, to be hungry on the street, to be maligned, to turn against convention, and to subordinate all to art. Not all of what he did in life can be considered honorable. But he refused to be a pessimist or give up on life's possibilities. Optimism and ho! pe were diamonds at the heart of him. Art, his salvation. The best of his character, his view and love of life, his being driven to create and express himself, his transcending what others accept blindly, his pursuit of individuality and a spirit enlightened and at rest, is this book's gift to readers.For those ready for it, this book inspires, and we are made better for knowing the truths Miller lived by and the paradise called Big Sur that nurtured his wandering soul."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"This book, and a couple of others by Miller and L. Durrell, was responsible for my husband and me quitting our jobs in LA and going to Greece for a year. And several times in the past decades, I've made pilgrimages to Partington Ridge/cove/trail/creek down the coast of Big Sur to revisit the place Miller lived and to pay homage to a great writer, a great spirit, and a great human being. Each time I stop and look up the trail toward the ridge, I swear I can see stringy, rangy Miller, sweating as he pulls a goat-cart laden with mail and groceries from the drop-off spot by the highway back up to his convict shack near the top.The book has no real plot; it?s just a rambling and random collection of philosophy, character studies, literary/artistic commentary, and journaling - all delivered with Miller's completely unique and quirky mind. I don't believe a more open-minded, curious, brilliant writer has ever lived, and for me, this is his best book, written perhaps during some of his best and most peaceful years of his long and joyful life. At its core, it's a recipe for Life."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"My first glimpse into the world of Henry Miller has brought me a new highly admired author to read. Though 'Big Sur' is reputed to be one of his more 'tame works'...Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn having been banned works for years due to their highly sexual content, the mind of Miller is indeed a wonderous place to explore.I came across this title while searching online for info about Kerouac's novel 'Big Sur', and decided to indulge in this one as well. And a happy treat awaited me.Having only recent begun to enjoy 'biography as fiction' works, it takes a rare author to put one at peace with their words, when they are simply a recounting of thier own life and adventures. Miller wrote 'Big Sur' not so much as a 'novel', since there is not a conventional thread to follow, other than the location and himself as protagonist, but more as a memoir of the 15 years spent in this California 'paradise' of artists, bohemians, and eclectic characters. Through describing his tranquil, ambling days spent walking back and forth with supplies from town, meeting the thrice-per-week mail delivery, or simply writing, the reader gets to experience the serenity that Miller enjoyed throughout most of his time there. Being a Virgo I look for structure, order, sense, etc., in most things, especially literature. Little of that is to be found here, really, but Miller's style is so captivating that you can't help but read on. His serenity at Big Sur easily becomes your own.But be warned, that serenity is interrupted by the arrival of an oversees acquaintance, Conrad Moricand, who turns Miller's idyllic home upside down during his stay there. Moricand, an ailing, miserable, curmudgeonly man comes to Big Sur upon Miller's request, and had the term 'houseguest from hell' been utilized in the days this novel was written, it's easy to say that Moricand would have received this title.For anyone thinking of exploring the works of Henry Miller for the first time, perhaps avoiding his more famous works until gaining a bit of insight into something a little more 'platonic' such as this book might be well-advised. It will pave the way of interest into this fascinating author, and hopefully spark further investigation, as it has with me.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"Henry Miller was an American original, and one of the most memorable personalities among American writers of this century. In 1930, at the age of 38, he left He left New York City to go to Paris, determined to become a great writer. He had very little money and lived on the largesse of his friends, including Anais Nin.Some ten years later, after having written the &quot;Tropics&quot; books that made him famous, he settled in Big Sur, California, an area with some of the prettiest and most spectacular coastal scenery in the country -- and maybe even the world. At that time, real estate was still relatively inexpensive in this small village, and artists and other interesting characters abounded.This book recounts his life in Big Sur, and succeeds admirably in evoking time and place. The narrative is somewhat disconnected at times, and launches into asides that may not interest some. But the quality of Miller's prose -- and the passion for Big Sur and its people that it expresses -- more than make up for that.Incidentally, if you make it to Big Sur, and have any interest in Henry Miller, check out the Henry Miller library, assuming it is still open."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"After writing The Air Conditioned Nightmare, Henry Miller had almost given up hope on America. This book, Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, recounts how he feel in love with the country all over again. Set in Northern California, Big Sur is portraitized as being no less than a paradise to this influencial writer. He was seeking to eke out some peaceful lifestyle in the mountains, and for a while he found it. But it did not take long for groupies, love children, and any other manner of lost souls to begin knocking on his door. They were looking for the \\"cult of anarchy and sex!\\" and they thought Miller, who had already published and gained notoriety with The Tropic of Cancer, would be the one to lead the way. This book has a definite buoyancy that the reader thrives off. His descriptions of writers, artists,children,and vagabongs is top notch. I would also advise anyone who is seriously interested in the subject, to pick up a copy of Hunter S. Thompson's The Proud Highway. It includes an excellent essay on his take on Miller's \\"sudden\\" fame. So pick up this book! Other quick Amazon picks would be Tropic of Cancer, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"I must say that I am biased. Henry Miller is one of my favorite authors of all time. I have sought out the rare and out of print editions in libraries and bookstores throughout the US and Europe. I first found this book in a small used bookstore in Bisbee, AZ. I was on my way to Spain. The opening sentence in the book caught my attention because it opens with a similar intention. &quot;In 19** I set out for Spain. I never made it there.&quot; I would make it to Spain, but only after a struggle that would challenge Prometheus himself. Certainly, this is one of Miller's finest efforts. He discusses life, art and writing and relates it all to the peace he found living in his small eutopic cabin in Big Sur, making use of the denizens as characters, reviving other specters from previous works, and detailing the fanatics who would camp at the doorstep of the 80-year-old author in search of the Cult of Sex and Anarchy. The most interesting, most poignant differe! nce between this and so many of Miller's works is his clarity of thought. The ramblings are present as only Miller can present them, but they exude a definite cognizence, a undeniable consciousness of a man who has lived life to the utmost, and now seeks only the solitude under which he might write his final notes on the strangest journey of all -- that of daily existence. There is something for the artist in this book, something for the writer and something for the philosopher. You will not go away disappointed, or even dazed. Miller strikes out at his usual targets: passion and the root of creativity, with undaunted focus and a genius of his own creation."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"This is a satisfying read if you appreciate language and character. It is a collection of views and vignettes of the author's life when he lived in Big Sur. Miller's unique personality and interests come through in his language that makes even ordinary things come more to life. It was interesting to discover what seemed like proto-new age thinking in some of this, written in the 1950's. His evocations of character are great and so is the feel of the environment. I read part of the book during a trip that took me through Big Sur, and it deepened my enjoyment of being there. The Henry Miller Library is worth visiting."},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"This one is slightly different for Miller, more laid back, but as usual he is the most brilliant and intensely unique writer ever to come from America (at least to my knowledge). He's a Walt Whitman and a Mark Twain and a William Blake rolled into one genius. I say read ALL of Henry Miller you can get your hands on, and be glad!"},{"Title":"BIG SUR AND THE ORANGES OF HIERONYMUS BOSCH.","review":"For fans of Henry Miller this is a great book. For those that aren't, yet still bother to read this review: Henry Miller is conversational in all his books (early 3rd person attempts aside), what you are doing when you pick up his books is to sit and listen to him speak, his conversations are always interesting and can fly off into any direction: He wasn't precious, and that's why many of us like him.I enjoy where he talks about being withdrawn, sullen, and bad company when he writes, yet a glowing talkative companion when painting."},{"Title":"Rememories: The Music and Memories that Shaped Our Lives","review":"Just finished reading this book and found it became more and more interesting as the interviews went along. I especially liked Bruce Bond's tea with the Queen &amp; Prince Charles, Jane Calverley &amp; her mother in the UK and Elliot's own, particularly the photo when he was 17...The great thing about the book is you don't have to be a baby boomer or a yankee to appreciate the history, the music or the culture - you can feel the essence of the era. The emotion and feelings people have tucked up in their heads and how a simple prompt gets all those emotions roller coasting back as if it were yesterday."},{"Title":"Rememories: The Music and Memories that Shaped Our Lives","review":"This is a charming and witty book. You will especially love it if you are a baby boomer. Elliot Gold is right - music does evoke strong memories of all those intense emotions. And Tina Lynde's comment was so true - there was a touching innocence about it all. I felt like my teenage self again recalling along with the book's contributors my own growing up years and the laughter and heartaches that were a part of them. I Wanna Hold Your Hand - my 7th grade crush; Red Rubber Ball - after my ninth grade boyfriend and I had broken up; Going to the Chapel - driving around the first summer I had my license with the top down and singing along with my girlfriends at the top of our lungs; A Whiter Shade of Pale - slow dancing on Bastille Day in a steamy club in Normandy; Mr. Big Stuff - dancing with the kids in the juvenile detention center where I worked on summer; Bad Moon Rising - the excitement of an SDS demonstration at Columbia; Dance in the Smoke - well, that's too personal... What struck me was how much we all have in common despite considerable geographic and social differences. This book is a lot of fun to read. Just don't forget to have your old 33 1/3s playing while you read it!"},{"Title":"Rememories: The Music and Memories that Shaped Our Lives","review":"What a fun book! Like everyone else in the book, the music of 'our time' never dies - everytime I hear one of those songs, I'm back!"},{"Title":"Rememories: The Music and Memories that Shaped Our Lives","review":"The book illustrates how music has made an impact on our lives... it confirms the fact that we all have similar experiences and hearing the &quot;old song&quot; puts us on the road to REMEMORIES. Reading the book made me feel like I was a part of it all, I became bonded with Fabian, Andrew Young, and several other famious people, knowing that their thoughts and feelings were similar to my experiences. The final chapter (the reunion) made me want to be a part of that little group, they shared life together... the funny thing is... I am a part of it... I am the one the group accepted!"},{"Title":"Poisoned Dreams: A True Story of Murder, Money and Family Secrets","review":"As I'm reading this I'm thinking, these people are allcrazy.They have loads of money and they spend it on status flashingand conspicuous consumption. The lie constantly to themselves and those around them. Their behavior is duplicitous and blind, within insight. They use each other and in turn are used. They make a big deal of going to church but have the spiritual sensitivity of hyenas. They do volunteer work for charity but rob each other and society every chance they get. They have the sexual behavior of gutter trash. They do drugs, drink themselves into stupors, and kill one another. And I wonder, am I like that too, except that the circumstances of my life are different? Had I been in their circumstances would I have resembled them?And the answer is, who knows?The scene is the Park Circle section of Dallas where everybody has lots of money. The principals are Harvard design school graduates, but any difference between them and your standard USC grad is not noticeable. The husband either poisons the wife or she poisons herself. The court found him guilty. She's something of a nut case, wallowing in the narco-guilt of a sister-brother incestuous relationship when she was eleven and Bill Jr. was thirteen. Her husband, Richard, a sexual addict (according to her) has a steamy affair with a shallow blonde. Her father has mass bucks and is called \\"Big Daddy\\" although he's a bantam of only five-seven. He uses his money to control his family, but of course it all backfires. Bill Jr. takes the cocaine/alcohol cure at the Sierra Tuscon drying out farm and then Richard attends briefly for both sexual addiction and alcoholism, both sent with Big Daddy's money. Nancy, the wife, is semi-frigid, but does get it on at strategic times, enough to be pregnant five times (two miscarriages and an abortion, two kids). Reading between the lines, one might guess that she is a semi-conscious furtive tease. They all abuse one another in various ways. Would I have done the same thing?You know, I think (a) I wouldn't have had the energy and (b) I would rather stay home and read a book, any book. The above was written after reading about half the book. It is amazing how good this book was near the end! Which only goes to show, it's the material that counts. I think Gray was padding it out a little. The truly amazing thing is how inadequate at getting the truth is our legal system. It's a statement about human kind: truth really is just a word: what counts is social, political and economic power. Or should I say forensic truth is a secondary consideration.Poisoned Dreams is written in a quick and slightly dirty style that suggests that Gray believes the dictum from literary agent Evan Fogelman, quoted on page 270, that good writing doesn't count for as much today as it once did. Yet, I wouldn't call this bad, or anything of the sort. What really works for Gray is the story, and he does deliver that. Furthermore, he presents both sides, which is something he believes in, and he keeps us guessing until past the end. So nice job, but perhaps a little seasoning, a little polishing, and a little editing would have made this an outstanding piece of work."},{"Title":"Poisoned Dreams: A True Story of Murder, Money and Family Secrets","review":"I desperately wanted to read this story after watching the made for TV movie. I searched all over for a book about it. I finally found this one, and even though it wasn't written by an author I knew of, my desire to read the story won out in the end. What a mistake. This is the worst book I have ever read. It is not true crime, in any sense of the word. It rambles on incessantly about things that have absolutely nothing to do with the book as well as legal nonsense that I know about. I mean, how to pick a jury? Come on, the author wasted at least 5 pages talking about that. Then there are these weird interludes throughout the book where some \\"interviewer\\" is talking to a random player about their thoughts on the case. Really? It was so pathetic, I only got through it because I wanted to know what happened to the husband. In the end it didn't matter because the author seemed not to really know either. Ugh. What a waste of money. Save yours and watch the movie. It's better."},{"Title":"Poisoned Dreams: A True Story of Murder, Money and Family Secrets","review":"The book is extremely dated. It opens discussing the murder of JR Ewing of Dallas, as if anybody cares. It goes on and on about the rich neighborhood that the characters lived in, going off on unrelated tangents - a crazy woman lived in the neighborhood, and also interjects the story of Sandra Bridewell (\\"and there she lives to this day\\" - well, not to this day, she's in prison now, probably out soon though). We also have to read too much of his personal opinion and problems - he's an alcoholic (when he talks to someone he refers to himself as \\"the interviewer\\" - so we won't guess who he is?) and how much he'd like a drink, also how Chinese food is NOT his favorite. I DO NOT CARE I want to read to the STORY of the victim and the murderer, not about YOU, AW Gray. Geez, what an ego this guy has. Of course he was raised there too, he tells us. Zzzzzzzz.Anyway, we're told that Richard, the husband convicted of killing his wife, had a perfectly normal childhood, and was not beaten by a crazy uncle and nothing terrible ever happened to him at all, nothing in his childhood made him this way...to grow up to be a compulsive liar and murderer. And how does AW Gray know this? Well, maybe the mother and father told him, maybe not, he doesn't say, but there was no need for him to do any research at all into Richard's childhood. So Richard's childhood is wrapped up into one small paragraph. Meanwhile, complete chapters are devoted to the history of Dallas (zzzzz...okay, Dallas exists, we know, please get on with the story), the prosecutor and HER childhood, and anything else Mr. Gray would like to expound upon.When we finally get to court, Mr. Gray refers to the persons coming to the trial as \\"the slobbering public.\\" He seems to be slobbering himself over the beauteous (according to him anyway, no pictures of this woman) \\"legal assistant\\" of the defense attorney, and the perfect earlobes of Richard's mistress's sister. Zzzzzzz again.Then at the end, he tells us he's changed everyone's name, and if we are so inclined that way, it's a matter of public record and if we want to know so badly, we can just go look it up for ourselves. \\"Whatever turns you on.\\"What an arrogant, self-absorbed person. The author, not the murderer."},{"Title":"True North in Alaska: Memories of Indians, Eskimos, Bush Pilots and Us","review":"I was amazed at all the detailed descriptions and photos in this book. If you're a fan of early Alaskan aviation, this will keep you very busy. I'm a fan of Wien Air Alaska history and this really is a great snapshot of the late 30's and through the 40's in Alaska."},{"Title":"True North in Alaska: Memories of Indians, Eskimos, Bush Pilots and Us","review":"Strange things can happen when one looks under the stairs of an old log cabin. What started out as an effort to help an aging father clean out some boxes, ended nearly ten years later with a comprehensive book of memories, photographs and letters. Jack Webb interviewed his father, Dick, as they went through the stored treasures; then, with wife, Susan, he researched the events, places, and people referenced. The recollections, letters and over 450 photographs progress chronologically and geographically in seven chapters, from the newlyweds' 1937 move to a remote Alaskan village to teach for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, through their travels abroad during the Sixties. An Epilogue with family history prior to 1937 and a thirteen-generation genealogy follow.On the most basic level, this is a story of two young people from Oregon who made life an adventure in a frozen frontier among Arctic natives, gold miners, and bush pilots. What makes this book special are over thirty years of newsy letters from Dick (and occasionally wife Milly) to his family. An avid photographer, Dick made hundreds of images, no small feat in the pre-digital-era. Detailed descriptions of how the couple lived, worked and played, raised two sons, and coped with the hardships and challenges of a vast, cold, semi-civilized land, were enclosed with photographs and apologies for the lengthy interval between letters - not that things \\"outside\\" (in the lower 48) were so wonderful: a worldwide economic depression followed by World War II. Then, a Cold War broke out, thisclose to Alaska. Dick's mother Bertha, saved it all, perhaps knowing how well they would document pioneer life in a mid-20th century frontier.The volume of material assembled is astounding and will be of greatest appeal to those interested in Alaska, early commercial aviation, native populations, and especially to those who were there (and their descendants). That said, the story is compelling also to anyone who has faced the challenges of being really far from family and familiar surroundings, never mind extreme weather, great distances, food shortages; travel by steamship, dogsled, small aircraft; winter weather starting in August; no SUV's, HMO's, phones or FedEx. Life was harsh, yet Dick and Milly survived, even thrived, as did their two Alaska-born sons: a major accomplishment anywhere. They worked long, hard hours, first as teachers, later in aviation, broadcasting, banking, and in the newly established tourism industry. In between building and repairing things, doctoring, reindeer herding, fishing, trapping, and hunting walrus, caribou, moose and whale, and writing endless reports for the government, they found time to have fun, travel, and write letters about it all. Jack's generous sharing of his father's reminiscences is like hearing a great uncle's gee-whiz stories of life in the old days: fascinating, fantastic, sometimes fearsome and yet heartwarming. What an adventure!"},{"Title":"True North in Alaska: Memories of Indians, Eskimos, Bush Pilots and Us","review":"Great Glimpse of Alaskan HistoryReviewed by: Walt Pfarr (8/24/2004)Untold stories of Alaska in the depression era and beyond.

Very useful for plant biologists and ecologists."},{"Title":"In mathematical circles;: A selection of mathematical stories and anecdotes","review":"The three hundred and sixty anecdotes collected here by Howard Eves deal primarily with mathematical trivia. Most of the tales are stories about individuals--what foolish claim did Alhazen make about the Nile? Did you know Thomas Carlyle had a mathematical background? Sometimes he adds a little research to a well-known story. For example, there is a famous tale about a meeting between Euler and Diderot at the Russian court. Eves includes De Morgan's early version of the story and compares it to his source, Thiebault, concluding that, sadly, the anecdote as it's usually told is mostly wishful thinking. There are also some notes on odds and ends--the origin of the word &quot;sine&quot; was new to me.If you like popular mathematics books you'll have heard quite a few of these before, but many will still be new to you. My own favourites are the last few in the book, about Norbert Wiener, the famously absent-minded MIT professor. Here's one, to give you the flavour: one day Wiener was asked in class how to do a certain problem. &quot;He thought for a moment, then wrote the answer on the blackboard. The class was nonplussed, and finally a bold spirit asked, 'But, Professor Wiener, is there any other way to do the problem?' The professor thought again for a moment, then brightened up and said, 'Why, yes, there *is* another way.' Then he wrote the same answer on the board.&quot;...

Just reading the table of contents will be enough to suck you in.&quot; unquote. It's all true. This is a delightful little book that will provide hours and hours of informative browsing. For instance, did you know that at one time Mickey Mouse was banned in the United States? Well, he was, back in 1932. There's a list of 51 banned books and one cartoon. Examples of banned books are The Bible in the Soviet Union as late as 1926 and The Merchant of Venice in the US in 1931. In Spain in 1720, the book Robinson Crusoe was denoted as a banned. These are only a few examples of the titles listed. The book contains various sorts of lists that include 40 euphemisms for the Devil, including Old Harry, The Arch Fiend, Scratch, and Queed. There's 195 names for the penis, including Mr. Happy; 75 aliases for female breasts such as The Upper Works, Hooters, and Begonias. For sexual intercourse we are exposed to no less than 228 different names that are used for this activity, including Boink Someone, Dance the Matrimonial Polka, and Parallel Park. Do you know the 9 types of angels? Well, it seems they are divided into 3 choirs and under each choir are the names of each category. There's a list of 22 things invented by Leonardo da Vinci hundred's of years before they were 'reinvented' to include the alarm clock, the flying machine, and the telescope. Under the 31 Peculiar Tourist attractions are listed a urinal once used by JFK, and Hobbiton, a life-size reproduction of Bilbo Baggins' hometown. There are 36 really long movies listed that have running times from 5 hrs-2 min to 85 hrs! The 8 levels of IQ evaluation are listed with a score of over 141 being in the Genius category.

Booo-ring! We just don't need a list of a couple hundred euphemisms for having sex, which didn't even include some of my favorites, and some of which haven't been used in a couple hundred years. I did like the preliminary commentary to this particular list, though, pointing out that many of the euphemisms are far more explicit than the bare-bones phrase they were meant to replace.Trivia about religion and death is interesting. I enjoyed reading about the steps in a medical-legal autopsy; if you are a murder-mystery reader, you'll like that too. Other lists I enjoyed: 20 alleged cases of backwards phrases in recordings, along with an explanation of how such phrases might occur. Reasons to believe that Paul was dead. (If you don't understand that phrase, you're the wrong generation anyway.) Movie anachronisms. Longest movies ever made.The lists about sex will probably appeal more to some people than they did to me, so my reaction shouldn't discourage you from buying this.

I recommended this book with no reservations."},{"Title":"I Only Like What I Like","review":"Written and illustrated by Julie Baer for children ages 3 to 8, I Only Like What I Like is the story of Dewey Jackson Braintree-Berg, a young boy who is strict and severe in his personal preferences. Dewey only likes apples that are red, one certain black-and-white cat, noodles shaped like letters on Monday, and so forth. But sometimes Dewey is faced with new foods, new things, and new challenges that he has never seen before - what is a boy to do? A distinctive style of slightly discordant color illustrations enhances this entertaining and very strongly recommended parable about learning to adapt to change."},{"Title":"Viral Diarrheas of Man and Animals","review":"I haven't read this book yet, but I was wondering.... Does it have pictures? If so, how do we distinguish the human diarrheas from the animals? Do they lable the poops?THis book just seems too bizzare. I'd love to know what was like from someone who read it."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"This is a sound and thorough description of the principles and practices underlying a shift from the hierarchical, bureaucratic mode of managing to one based on recognition of the talents of the people within the organisation, which seeks to enhance and release those talents for shared ends.Having said that, it is a bit difficult to see why the book has been given such extravagant praise. Nearly everything in it was anticipated by the Pinchots in 1993 and the themes covered are very well established (and were already established when it was first published in 1997). Although it is not new, the principles are still not widely followed, so any additional material that may serve to spread the message is welcome.The material is good. The reliance on a lot of examples makes it very discursive, but the sub-heads through the text are useful. There is a slightly breathless air of 'discovery' through the book that would be acceptable if the ideas and prescriptions were in fact new."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"&quot;In 1682, English astronomer Sir Edmund Halley had the good fortune to be at the right place at the right time. His observations on the spectacular comet that now bears his name helped earn him the prestigious title of Astronomer Royal.More important to this professional scientist was the fact that this fortuitous opportunity inspired a flurry of other research activity that led to new and important discoveries about the nature of our universe.&quot; Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher A. Bartlett write, &quot;While hardly on the same grand scale as Sir Edmund, we, too, have been fortunate to have had a front-row seat at a once-in-a-lifetime event- the collapse of an outmoded corporate form and the emergence of a new management model that we believe will propel today's companies well into the twenty-first century. At the heart of the emerging model lie not only some very different organizational practices and processes but also a fundamentally different management philosophy. In this book, we describe this new management model and illustrate how some of the pioneers of this new approach have implemented it in their companies&quot; (from the Introduction).They divide their book into four parts. In the first part, they present the concept of the Individualized Corporation. In the second part, they describe the organizational characteristics required to develop three core capabilities that distinguish the Individualized Corporation. In the third part, they explore the managerial implications of these new organizational characteristics and focus on how companies can go about building and managing the Individualized Corporation. Finally, in the fourth part, they step back from the details of defining the characteristics of the Individualized Corporation and describing how to build and manage it, to examine the more profound issues of a new managerial philosophy that underlies this new corporate model.In this context, in the third part, after introducing the new corporate model, they examine new management roles and tasks of this new model that are radically different from the classic ones:1. Operating-Level Managers* Changing role: From operational implementers to aggressive entrepreneurs.* Primary value added: Driving business performance by focusing on productivity, innovation, and growth within frontline units.* Key activities and tasks: Creating and pursuing new growth opportunities for the business. Attracting and developing resources and competencies. Managing continuous performance improvement within the unit.2. Senior-Level Managers* Changing role: From administrative controllers to supportive coaches.* Primary value added: Providing the support and coordination to bring large-company advantage to the independent frontline units.* Key activities and tasks: Developing individuals and supporting their activities. Linking dispersed knowledge, skills, and best practices across units. Managing the tension between short-term performance and long-term ambition.3. Top-Level Managers* Changing role: From resource allocators to institutional leaders.* Primary value added: Creating and embedding a sense of direction, commitment, and challenge to people throughout the organization.* Key activities and tasks: Challenging embedded assumptions while establishing a stretching opportunity horizon and performance standards. Institutionalizing a set of norms and values to support cooperation and trust. Creating an overarching corporate purpose and ambition.Finally, they say that &quot;Halley's comet will return to our corner of the solar system in the year 2062. When it does, we believe our successors will look back at the Individualized Corporation as the revolutionary new model that brought business organizations into the postindustrial, information-intensive age of knowledge.&quot;Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"Sumantra Ghoshal is Professor of Strategy and International Management at the London Business School, UK. Previously he was Professor of Public Policy at French business school INSEAD. Christopher A. Bartlett is Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. They are both prominent authors of numerous management books and articles. This book won the 1997 Igor Ansoff Award. The book is split up in four parts, each consisting of 2-to-4 chapters.Part I - Birth of a New Corporate Model serves as an introduction, describing &quot;the most profound change in management in a lifetime&quot;: the move from organization man to individualized corporation. &quot;In this book, we will describe this management model and illustrate how some of the pioneers of this new approach have implemented it in their own companies.&quot; The first chapter, The Rediscovery of Management, frames the historical context and describes the authors' research motivation. The second chapter, Rebirth of an Organization Man, provides an example of how the transformational changes at one company affected the activities, motivation, and performance of a &quot;classic organization man.&quot; In Part II - From Organization Man to Individualized Corporation, the authors describe the organizational characteristics required to develop the three core capabilities that distinguish the 'individualized corporation'. The first core capability is its ability to inspire individual creativity and initiative in all its people, built on a fundamental faith in individuals. The second core characteristic is the ability to link and leverage pockets of entrepreneurial activity and individual expertise by building an integrated process of organizational learning. The third core feature is its ability to continuously renew itself. Each core capability is discussed in detail. The third part of the book - Building and Managing the Individualized Corporation - explores the managerial implications fo above mentioned characteristics and on how companies can go about building and managing the individualized corporation. The authors use the final chapter of this part to discuss the transformation process that has taken at various companies, such as Philips Electronics, ABB, ISS, 3M, McKinsey &amp; Co., and General Electric. In the fourth and final part - Toward A New Corporate Era - the authors examine the new managerial philosophy behind this new corporate model. By using the case of Swedish company IKEA, they explain the redefinition of &quot;the role of corporate management away from its classic focus on strategy, structure, and systems to one built around purpose, process, and people&quot;. This redefinition is really the main message of the book.I have a mixed feeling about this book. Yes, I believe that the authors are right in the sense that we have now entered the era of individualized corporations. But my main feeling is that I either read this book too late or that it was published too late. Some other great management thinkers, such as Peter F. Drucker, Charles Handy and Henri Mintzberg, have covered this subject/trend several decades before. Also, the book does not provide us with enough tips and checklist to enable us to manage these (new) types of organization. The book is also rather long and I recommend other readers to go for the three authors' Harvard Business Review-articles covering this book, starting with &quot;Changing the Role of Top Management: Beyond Strategy to Purpose&quot; (1994)."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"Management thinkers over the last 8 decades have been trying to come up with the perfect structure, whether it's the functional structure, the matric, the SBU structure and it is generally felt that if this problem is figured out the rest of the pieces of jigsaw will fall in place. Ghoshal and Bartlett differ, and drawing from the thoughts of other thinkers make a case that structure does not matter so much unless your processes make your company a place where the people love to come to. Where the control, compliance paradigm of organizations are replaced by the discipline, stretch, trust paradigm.The book is packed with examples but an area that is not stressed which crops up again and again is that of leadership. Whether it is Percy Barvenik of ABB, or Welch of GE or Rajat Gupta of McKinsey, or Grove of Intel. They all perfected the art of &quot;cooking sweet with sour&quot; or combining the O and E factors for development (as Nohria and Beer put it)...The authors could have stressed more on that factor."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"Okay, I admit it. The title intrigued me: The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management. In screaming red letters across the top of the book jacket, it professed: \\"Great companies are defined by Purpose, Process and People.\\" Yep. I agreed with that. So I tucked it under my arm and took it home for some light, bed-time reading....They said up front: \\"While not offering either universal solution or a quick-fix prescription, we believe we can provide managers with a perspective that will allow them to make sense of the revolution in which they find themselves, as well as suggest some ideas to help them manage successfully through it.\\"I don't believe in quick fixes either, so I kept reading. And before I knew it, two hours had passed.The Individualized Corporation is interesting reading. I found it similar to Collins & Porras' Built to Last, with lots of examples from companies who have been successful. Similarly, this book compares and contrasts the Individualized Corporation and the definitive Organizational Man.I don't think there is anything profoundly \\"new\\" in this book, but I did think that the book provides a great context in which many \\"new\\" concepts can be much more than just the \\"program du jour.\\" They simply are great ways for companies to do business.They maintain there are three core capabilities that distinquish the Individualized Corporation:* The ability to inspire individual creativity and initiative in all its people, built on the fundamental faith in individuals.* The ability to link and leverage pockets of entrepreneurial activity and individual expertise by building an integrated process of organizational learning.* The ability to continuously renew itself.I agree with much of the book - in theory. I think the challenge, however, is in implementation. The leadership and management have to have faith in individuals - and each other.The book develops a \\"new\\" model of the organization as a \\"portfolio of processes\\" rather than a hierarchy of tasks. It describes the new roles that frontline, middle and top-level managers must play and examines the personal attitudes, knowledge, and skills they will need in order to succeed.It gives some (not lots) of examples of companies who have successfully evolved. From these examples, we might be able to figure out what will work within our own culture.Clearly, a program of the month strategy won't work. Leadership must be committed to a set of core values around purpose, process and people -- and behave consistently and systematically.While this is a great book for forward thinkers -- I am not sure mainstream corporate America is willing to have as much faith in the individual as Ghoshal and Bartlett have."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"A very well researched book with plenty of grounded case-studies on the subject. Content has been nicely laid-out in a logical fashion which makes the book very readable. Authors have taken a holistics view of the subject with appropriate references to other current literature.

However, empirical proofs should increase their creditibilty on their breakthrough suggestions.How to use these concepts in contexts that differ than those appeared in this book is worth to further study."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"Without doubt, Ghoshal and Bartlett have captured the essence of good management and, in particular, they have numerous examples from the \\"real\\" world that back up their assertions as to what good management is all about.Having said that, I am not quite sure why the book has an introduction titled: \\"Birth of a new corporate model.\\" Just about everything they are recommending has been said before, many times. Thirty-seven years before the publication of this book in 1997, McGregor published his findings in The Human Side of Enterprise and labelled two sets of assumptions espoused by managers as Theory X and Theory Y. This book of Ghoshal and Bartlett is recommending the assumptions put forward by McGregor as Theory Y.Even so, although little is new, the principles are not widely followed today, so any additional material that may serve to spread the message is very welcome so, despite the criticism, it is a good book on the subject.I have a problem, however, with the sub-title: \\"A fundamentally new approach to management\\". Is this a marketing ploy? I really can't believe that an author of the calibre of the late Sumantra Ghoshal could honestly believe this! Pity, because it could give young, aspirant leaders and managers the impression that it's all new when it is not."},{"Title":"The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management","review":"This book simply does not live up to its hype.

A tremendous athlete-track and field star-she finds out she has cancer and has her leg amputated. As if this loss isn't enough to contend with, Meghan is also in mourning for the loss of her mother, who died when she was younger, and for her brother, Killian, who was sent off to fight in Viet Nam and came back from the war a broken man. Meghan has a bad attitude. She's angry at the world, and after a while, even those who love her are pretty sick of her temper tantrums. It's clear that her father loves her, but doesn't understand her, her sister loves her, but doesn't know how to help her, and her best friend loves her, but Meghan won't have anything to do with her.The person that Meghan does reach out to is Abraham Lincoln. Yep. That Abraham Lincoln. The 16th president of the United States. She sends him a series of postcards. What may seem a weird premise turns out to be a wonderful addition to the plot as Meghan looks to Lincoln, whose life was pretty miserable, as a source of comfort, inspiration, and ultimately strength to start over.I don't want to give too much of the book away other than to say that this book is incredibly rich with meaning. While the chapters are short and the prose sparse, the emotional effect is powerful. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Postcards to Father Abraham","review":"Meghan is full of rage. First her mother died. It was hard and it turned her father into a very strict man who doesn't seem to have sympathy for his three children anymore. He pushed Meghan's adored older brother Killian into going to Vietnam, which destroyed Killian. He pushed Meghan to take a running scholarship at a prestigious boarding school, saying it would help her future.The last straw is when Meghan loses one of her legs to cancer. Running is the one thing in her life that she loves and that calms her when she needs it. Now she is stuck in a hospital bed, trying to recover from her surgery and not wanting to use the prosthetic leg that will eventually help her to walk again.Meghan spends her time in the hospital reflecting on her life, visiting with her younger sister, thinking about her brother and becoming angrier and angrier with her father for all of the things she thinks he has ruined in her life. She also writes notes to her idol, Abraham Lincoln, who lived in her Illinois town and is a huge part of the history there. Will writing these notes help her to come to terms with herself and her life?I liked learning about Meghan's life little by little and seeing what the events were leading up to her being in the hospital in the state of mind she was in. I also liked the history of Lincoln woven into this story, and the history of Vietnam also playing a part in the book.I didn't like that Meghan was so angry at her father that he never had a chance to explain himself or his point of view."},{"Title":"Postcards to Father Abraham","review":"This is the best book i have read in a long time. 16- year- old Meghan is angry with the world.

She is angry at Dr. Take-more, and Dr. Take-less, for taking away her leg. She is mangry at the nuns in her old school for expelling her. She is angry at her day nurse for having somebody ele's baby. She is anry at Sam for trying to help her learn to run again. Throughout her hard times, she turnes to her hero, Abraham Lincon who has been dead for a while.

Buber's assertion that what the Genesis story is about is Chaos and Order is completely supported in context by the science of Archaeology.
