DixonReviewed by S. TeranPeriod 5In the beginning of this book, the Hardy boys and their father were trying to get to their house in Bayport after they accidentally took a wrong turn. As they were going through a field, they heard a low pitched droning. They decided to ignore it. A few seconds later, out of no where, a plane came flying at them. They tried to dodge it but the wheel of the plane hit the roof of the car. The car flipped and everyone was knocked out cold. After about 10 minutes or so, they woke up unhurt but their car was almost totaled. Since the Hardys were used to the unexpected, they just went on. The next day, the Hardys flew a helicopter back to the area where they got hit by the plane. They found a shack that would normally be hidden to the naked eye in the forest. Just as they found it, a weird voice came over the radio speakers. It eerily said, \\"You can not escape the dead person, you know who this is, this is Clint Hill.\\" The next day the Hardys got jobs at Stanwide, a computer/plane/helicopter industry, where Clint Hill last worked. Their jobs were to deliver notes and packages to other parts of the plant. After work and with permission, the Hardys took a helicopter out to the same location. Just as they were about to land, a tornado came towards the helicopter. The winds were too strong and forced them to crash land. No one was hurt but the helicopter was damaged beyond repair. The boys looked for clues until they saw a camouflage tarp covering a cave. Behind it, they found Clint Hill's plane. The Hardys flew to an island off the shores of a lake in Montana. There they found barrels of aviation fuel. They also found a shack like the one at Bayport. At the shack, they saw two people, Anchor and Barney. They were pilots for Stanwell. These two men were up to no good. Before they knew it, the Hardys were captured and thrown into a shack. Once the trap door opened, sleeping gas filed the room which knocked out the Hardy boys. Anchor called all the other pilots who were involved in the smuggling to come to this Island. The pilot, who flew the Hardy boys to this island, got worried and went looking for them. He found the shack and he also fell into the trap door. He was only stunned by the gas. He was able to get the boys out and call for help. He called Mr. Allen, the president of Stanwell, to come to the island. Upon arriving, Mr. Allen was shocked to see platinum and Clint Hill's crashed plane. This plane had crashed off the Cuban shores about 10 years ago. Meanwhile, the police were chasing Anchor, Peterson, and Rodax. The police eventually caught them and interrogated them for 3 days. They told the police of their hide out, the platinum and of the rest of the people who were involved in the smuggling. Mr. Allen had congratulated the Hardys on their findings and was told that someone wanted to talk to them back at Stanwell. They walked into the office and saw Clint Hill. He told the Hardys that 10 years ago, Peterson, who was the command pilot, left him stranded after the plane crashed. He was stranded in Cuba all this time. He explained that the eerie message over the radio wasn't him. It was just Peterson trying to scare people.I liked this book so much is because it is a Mystery book. I really like Mystery books because the authors always keep you on the edge of your seat. For example, when the mysterious voice came over the radio, it said, \\"You can not escape the person you have killed.\\" That part crept me out so much. I also liked this book because once I started to reading it, I couldn't stop. Before I knew about Mystery books, I never wanted to have anything to do with reading a book. The only time I would read a book is when one of my teachers would make us read or if they were instructional books on how to play Nintendo games. Franklin W. Dixon, the author of these Hardy boys mysteries, always seems to write amazing storylines.There really was nothing that I didn't like about this book. If anything, it was just too short of a book.My favorite part of this book is right in the beginning. It all started when the Hardys were taking a short cut through the plains when they heard a low pitch sound off in the distance. They decided to ignore it and continue as usual. The low pitched sound kept on getting louder as if it was getting closer, but of course, they still ignored it. Finally, Mr. Hardy got scared and turned off his headlights only to find another pair of lights going overhead. Something hit the top of the car to make it flip. Then the headlights mysteriously vanished."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"You'll love it - it's a way of life.This is where Dixon bounces back from the disappointing \\"Secret of the Caves,\\" the installment immediately preceding this book. Yes, there are still caves in this one (perhaps \\"F.W. Dixon\\" is really \\"the mole\\" from Dick Tracy). However, the \\"great airport\\" is truly a mystery.Despite well-lighted and established signage (white helvetica letters on a dark green background), the \\"great\\" airport of the title does not seem very great. When Frank and Joe leave their flivver in long-term parking, a plane lands on top of their car and they are knocked out. A few questions:1. This is not the first time that they are knocked out. How is it that they both wake up at exactly the same time after these repeated assaults?2. Given how often they are knocked out, where is the evidence of permanent loss of cognitive function?3. What was used to knock them out? A truncheon? A sap? A broken tree limb? An artificial limb?Anyway, it's nice to see Dixn back in mediocre form after the last disaster. It's like spending Christmas with an unwanted relative."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"The Hardy Boys have an adventure that takes place partially in the air this time. Someone is stealing parts containing platinum from Stanwide Mining Equipment Company. The problem is that no one can seem to figure out how it is happening. The Hardy Boys get involved when they are taking a short cut through the country and a plane almost crashes on the roof of their car. Soon the Hardy Boys are trying to learn the source of ghostly whistling and voices.The Hardy Boys' investigation takes them to an island in the Caribbean Sea, a cave with multiple secrets, and a cabin in Montana. This adventure also contains some of the most dangerous villains the Hardy Boys have encountered yet.The author continued the use of caves as an integral part of the story. This book is the eighth that uses a cave. In this story the cave is quite large. I am imagining that the United States is filled with caves, at least as far as this author is concerned.The author paced the last couple of stories nicely, keeping the action going and with sufficient mystery to make a reader want to continue onward. I am impressed with the author's ability to write ever more interesting stories as this series has progressed. I am looking forward to the next novel, \\"What Happened at Midnight.\\"Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"It's amazing how Franklin W.

People who are poetry-philes--which in today's world probably means other poets--will also really enjoy the clever word play and intense explorations of today's moral and emotional quagmires--from romance to familial relationships.However, I think his greatest gift with this book is toprovide a good place for people who are afraid of poetry because they think it's too abstract, too difficult, or too dull. His language is vivid and gripping, and his topics are vital to everyone interested in that most overused of phrases \\"the human condition.\\" Above all, what sets Morris' poetry apart is his genuine wit and startling sense of humor. I can't remember the last time I laughed while reading a poem.If you have anyt interest in current poetry or if you have been intimidated to read poetry because of bad experiences in your English classes, Matt Morris is an excellent choice. You will be surprised by poetry that is at one and the same time alienating and familiar, funny and serious. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Healing the Wounded Heart: Removing Obstacles to Intimacy with God","review":"I had no idea who Thom Gardner was before picking up this book. I've read several books like this recently and was pretty disappointed with most of them. This book however was different. I found this book to be incredibly insightful, convicting and helpful.This book deals with a variety of issues including rejection, worthlessness, fear, shame and others. First, it tells the story of a Biblical character who experienced this barrier.Then Thom exposes the lie underlying each barrier. Then he gives an emotional profile of each. Then, carefully each lie is refuted with biblical truth. This book will open your eyes and help you take a good look at yourself. This book will be life-changing. I know it definitely was for me. I still have a long ways to go in the healing process, but I feel this book has helped me take a giant step forward. This is a book to read, ponder, re-read and ponder some more. This book is practical and offers no quick fix.There is also an excellent resource in the back for dealing with painful memories. I haven't done it with all the barriers yet, but I have done a couple and I can tell you, this technique works. I also like that this book avoids the psychobabble and self-help philosophy so common in books on healing, even Christian books. This book is soundly and solidly biblical.If you are in need of spiritual and emotional healing and long to have a deeper, more intimate relationship with God, do yourself a favor. Buy a copy of this book. You won't be sorry. I highly recommend this book. It is one of the best I've ever read on the subject of emotional and spiritual healing."},{"Title":"Healing the Wounded Heart: Removing Obstacles to Intimacy with God","review":"I spent years reading self-help books and was able to get some benefit from them, but Gardner's book approaches the subject of healing the wounds within us from a different angle. He goes to the core of the issue - not the addiction, not your present life problem, but the lies and wounds that have been obstacles in your life. He leads you back to pictures that you remember and then to God's presence which is where the real healing takes place. Gardner deals with 7 core obstacles: fear, rejection, worthlessness, shame, insecurity, defilement, and hopelessness. I also have the journal that he put together that takes you through a process that deals with these 7 core obstacles using scripture meditation. It's also a powerful resource that can be used alongside this book. I happened to meet the author recently and I was impressed with his sincerity and authenticity. I encourage you to read and use his resources. They are helping me on my journey to healing and wholeness!"},{"Title":"Healing the Wounded Heart: Removing Obstacles to Intimacy with God","review":"This is a wonderful sensitively written book on the issues that can unknowlingly hinder us. We all have certain beliefs that formed early in life. We may have inner unseen traps within our hearts. Tom Gardner's teaching is based from the Bible. He is transparent with his own life and others that he has ministered to, helping us to see. Through reading and prayer one can see why we do or don't do, achieve or don't achieve in our personal lives. Read with openess, let Tom show you how you are loved and accepted. The choice is yours to stay where you are, or be released."},{"Title":"Healing the Wounded Heart: Removing Obstacles to Intimacy with God","review":"THis is a great book; it opens one's mind to see things the way in which God sees things.

Thom names the Jebusites and Hivites and all these parasites as real enemies of our souls and how to identify them and defeat them. Here's the thing, some people have physical ailments resulting from a wounded heart. Once the heart is healed, all sorts of healing can take place."},{"Title":"Healing the Wounded Heart: Removing Obstacles to Intimacy with God","review":"4 am is not the time i want to be awake reading this book, but when the spirit leads i guess i follow, it was a wake up call"},{"Title":"Healing the Wounded Heart: Removing Obstacles to Intimacy with God","review":"in his book, healing the wounded heart, Thomas Gardner reveals the truth of God's heart when he created man.

At that facility, she met Bobby, who became her husband. However, shortly after they married, Bobby died in an accident. The widow Annie was alone and pregnant at that fatal time. Paul Black Raven, owner of a ranch that borders the Tiwa Pueblo, provides Annie a place to stay and work on her art in exchange for clerical assistance.A father-daughter relationship forges that ends when someone murders Paul, leaving Annie heartbroken for the second time in her life. Just before his death, Paul summoned his estranged son Jake to come home, but he returns too late to reconcile with his father. Upon the moment that Jake and Annie see each other, an attraction occurs. However, Jake fears commitments and Annie needs a long time relationship. Though their love for one another appears to be going no where, they work in tandem to uncover the identity of his father's killer.Annie Thurlo, well known for her Native American romances, scores again with her most poignant novel to date, CHRISTMAS WITNESS. The beauty of the tale is observing the growing love between the lead protagonists' struggles to overcome grief, other circumstances, and the couple's personal phobias. The compelling mystery works as the number of suspects are limited, but their motives fully developed in a misdirected manner. Ms. Thurlo's latest book is a holiday treat."},{"Title":"Christmas Witness (Harlequin Intrigue)","review":"\\"Christmas Witness\\" begins two weeks before the winter holiday, on the night Paul Black Raven is killed. The only witness is recently widowed, 8-months-pregnant Annie Sandusky, who spots a man running from the scene disguised as Santa Claus. Only moments after the incident, Paul's 30-year-old estranged son (Jake) mysteriously shows up at the ranch. He, along with his twin brother Nick and a handful of other loyal friends and neighbors, gather together to solve Paul's death and the many threats, poisonings, burglaries, and arsons that follow. During all the turmoil, the leading Tewa native (Jake) and the ever-so-womanly leading lady (Annie) somehow muster enough time and hormones to romp in the hay and pretty much act like giddy teenagers to satisfy any romance-hungry reader.However, the main thing that didn't really seem believable in this book was Paul's clause in his will--that Annie, Jake, and Nick all live at Black Raven Ranch for one year before anyone could receive their inheritance. It was planned too perfectly for the two lovebirds (Annie and Jake) and wasn't really necessary in the plot.Still, if you enjoy romantic intrigues, particularly involving interracial (Native American and Anglo) couples, then you'll more than likely enjoy this Harlequin Intrigue addition."},{"Title":"Christmas Witness (Harlequin Intrigue)","review":"Not as emotionally intense as I would have thought but extremely satisfying.This is #1 of a pair of brothers stories that introduces us to Jake Black Raven and his twin brother Nick.Annie Sandusky is very heavily pregnant and living with the rumor being spread about the San Esteban Pueblo that it is Paul Black Raven's child.She is almost a front line witness to Paul's murder and is asked to help Jake find the \\"evidence\\".

Martin also became a near victim.Thomas Ray wanted the diary of his sister Saya Black Raven, the wife of Paul Black Raven and mother of Jake and Nick and he would do most anything to get it. So many people trusted Saya with their secrets.Iris Ortiz had a grudge against Annie for having alienated Paul's affections or so she thought.

Now the murderer was after her. And only the victim's son, Jake Black Raven, was man enough to protect her...Tall and pround, Jake Black Raven became Annie's shadow. He'd returned to the ranch only to settle his father's affairs, but he couldn't leave when Annie was still in danger. Not with her baby due any minute. And not when he would trade a thousand days for just one night in her bed. Her father had left him a dangerous legacy, but he would lure out a killer if it meant saving Annie--and the child he'd begun to consider his own...And my review:I will admit, the Intrigue line is not my favorite Harlequin series. But I've still read enjoyable books from this line, and since I'll buy just about any Christmas romance, I grabbed this when I found it in the thrift store.I think that the mystery was pretty well done, and there was a fair amount of Christmas woven into the plot. There was also heat between the hero and heroine, but I never really felt much love between them. This was a book that never engaged my emotions. Can't say exactly what the problem was, it simply didn't click with me. I know it's not a story I'm going to remember for long.Good to pass a few hours. Not a stunning work of literature, but then, it's a Harlequin romance.

To my knowledge, it is the only book which is dedicated solely to this process. Although the subject is hardly worthy of entire texts, the author does a fine job of creating a short and simple guide to a VERY important subject. Musicians should know just as much about the design/printing process as they do about the recording process. After all, the package is almost as important as the music itself (even though we don't always like to admit it!). With this in mind, 'Compact Disc Replication' teaches the reader, in easy to understand language, all about the design, printing, and CD duplication process. After reading this book, you will be much more comfortable choosing a disc duplication service, and being involved in the process from beginning to end. The result...a final package that is in keeping with your original ideas, vision, and style. This is a very quick and easy read, and is well worth the time. My only complaint is that the price is approximately double what it should be. For that, I might have given it 4 stars.

The lectures, which repay repeated reading, range over an astonishing amount of religious and philosophical territory. In this respect, Muller was far ahead of his time. While there has certainly been a retreat into narrow orthodoxy - in some areas of society, there is a growing tendency to discard the outer shell of religion, in quest of the vital kernel.Muller spoke of 'Theosophical' or 'Psychological Religion' - and thus, all the many and varied topics which appear in this book, touching on the inner core behind all religioustraditions - and religious philosophy. Early Christianity gets consideration, Gnostic ideas, Neo-Platonism, Hinduism etc.Originally published at the turn of the last century, in the series 'Chips from a German Workshop' (meaning woodchips from a carpenters bench), this title summed up the situation, for here we have the fruits of mind which had whittled away at religious questions, in half a dozen languages, over decades.This isn't a beginner's guide to meditation or a 'how-to' book. If that's what you want - well, look elsewhere. Rather, this is the sort of book which will appeal to people who have already staked out a religious path, but retain a healthy interest in the greater nexus of religious and spiritual ideas which have nourished the human race as a whole. There are some beautiful anecdotes and pithy comments to be found in this book - snippets of Greek, Sanskrit etc., which seem to sum up the quintessential spirit of a whole civilisation."},{"Title":"The Piano Works of Claude Debussy","review":"This book is a must have for any serious pianist.

Does a real, personal devil actually exist? If so, where did he come from, what is he like, and how does he operate?The late Bishop James A. Pike, grieving over the suicide death of his son Jim, observed strange occurrences in his Cambridge apartment which led him to think that his son was seeking to communicate with him. He attended a number of seances in which Jim allegedly spoke to him. Can the spirits of the dead send signals to the living? Are mediums able to establish contact with the souls of those who have gone to the \\"other side\\"? What really happens in a seance?Mrs. Jeane Dixon is considered a prophetess by many people, and top leaders in government and industry consult her for information about the future. Does she really receive messages from God through tarot cards, the crystal ball, or astrological readings? What about astrology? Is it reliable? Is it a harmless pastime? Or is it a practice Christians must avoid?Sybil Leek calls herself a witch, and believes she is able to contact and utilize powers from the invisible realm. She has gained an international reputation, and says that over eight million people in the world are witches. What about witchcraft? Is it merely a game some people play? Is it beneficial to humanity? Or is it evil and dangerous?Universities are offering courses in occultism, and teams of scientists are investigating reports of mysterious magical phenomena all over the globe. They are baffled by some of the amazing incidents they encounter, and admit that present scientific knowledge cannot account for them. What should be the Christian's attitude toward magic?In this book a sincere effort is made to give Biblical answers to questions like these.The first three chapters are a study of the explicit teaching of the Bible about Satan, evil spirits, and their battle strategy. The remaining portion consists of a report and analysis of current occultism in the light of the Scriptures.It has been impossible for me to investigates the large amount of available information on this subject, so I assigned full responsibility of the last three chapters to Herbert Vander Lugt, Research Editor of the Radio Bible Class.The Word of God may not provide a specific explanation for every problem one may encounter as he studies Satan, Satanism, and witchcraft, but it sheds much light on these subjects and offers practical guidelines by which God's children can avoid the dangers inherent in occultism.This volume therefore is sent out with the prayer that it may instruct and help many people in these days of unrest, confusion and fear.Richard W. De Haan"},{"Title":"Maison Ikkoku, Vol. 9: Learning Curves","review":"Our lovesick, long-suffering hero, Godai winds up teaching at an all-girl high school where the object of his yearning desire once attended (and attached her first husband in the very first place). This heart-rending irony continues when a lovestruck young student decides to chase the handsome Godai all the way to the ends of the world. In fact, this stinking rotten little girl even denies her own self-respect and the respect from others when she cornered her victim wearing only a bra, forced her way into his room, manuipulated and abused her dear old father into giving him a job at his company, and plain just drove poor young Koyoko (and Godai as well) up the wall. The kid's dad seems like a gruffy, heavy-breathing orge who looks ready to eat up any male who would dare to go near his only daughter, - but actually, he turns out to be such a docile piece of putty in the dainty hands of that mean little creature. A real nice touch of Lolita-complex twist in the endless mating ritual between the ever-hopeful young Godai and the lovely dark-eyed Koyoko."},{"Title":"Maison Ikkoku, Vol. 9: Learning Curves","review":"This is a very funny manga.

After all, how can he take care of Kyoko unless he's got a good career....doing something. After pursuing various options with his family, he gets a part-time gig at a resort, not knowing that the whole Maison Ikkoku gang is coming to visit! The main part of this volume deals with Godai becoming a student teacher at Kyoko's old high school, and ironically, just like Kyoko fell in love with her teacher, Godai too picks up a female admirer among his students, a girl named Ibuki Yagami who's willing to do anything to wiggle her way into Godai's life and usurp Kyoko from his heart.Rumiko Takahashi is not only a master of action manga like Inuyasha, she is a master of realistic romantic comedy. There were some scenes in this book that made me just outright laugh, which happens very rarely when I read. Rumiko has a expert sense of pace and storytelling and her layouts really flow. Most people can relate to this volume because everyone at some point has experienced or been the target of a crush. I don't know for sure whether Yagami really loves him or not, but I think not. I also like this series because it illustrates a lot of Japanese culture. Classic manga."},{"Title":"Maison Ikkoku, Vol. 9: Learning Curves","review":"This perverted little girl named Yagami keeps throwing herself at Godai throughout the story.

While some researchers have proclaimed the two to be separate diagnoses (e.g., Tantam), Wolff proceeds to give a detailed account of a group of children who were labeled 'Schizoid Personality of Childhood.' Furthermore, she extensively reviews the psychiatric literature in examining such children previous to Hans Asperger's account of Autistic Personality Disorder of Childhood, overviewing the evolution of the Schizoid Personality diagnosis. Wolff especially stresses the inadequacy of the current Asperger's diagnostic criteria because it often fails to include minimally impaired/gifted 'Schizoids'. Finally, Wolff expresses her conclusion: the majority of her Schizoid children, although many do fit the current DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for Schizoid Personality Disorder, would be more appropriately accounted for as having mild Asperger's Syndrome with some Schizotypal traits; also, although there was some overlap between High-Functioning Autistic children and the Asperger/Schizoid children, a distinction was made between the two groups."},{"Title":"Loners","review":"Austism, schizoid personality traits, what do they have in common?

Sula Wolff provides a rich discussion of people who by many are labelled &quot;asocial,&quot; providing anecdotal accounts with children seen in her own practice, as well as a wealth of information from formal studies.

My ob/gyn smiled, ran tests for three months, and insisted upon surgery, instead. The accumulated billing:$5500. I released her to her tennis match.Hemorrhaging for nine months taught me how feeble the world felt at below 7.2 hemoglobin. Sometimes before rush hour it was crucial to cover the driver's seat with a plastic garbage bag. On one occasion, gross clotting deposited what appeared to be a hatchling from Alien onto the floor of Macy's Department Store. I carried an extra change of clothing, always.Prior go our first visit, my present M.D. suggested reading Elizabeht Plourde's Gruide book. I quickly began flowering into an informed patient. The authors knowledge, experience, presentation, and easy writing style fascinated and motivated the me to begin making better choices. My first visit with my new M.D. became less costly and more productive as a result.Two months of topical bioidentical progesterone-$10 per month from Womens International Pharmacy-and I returned to my tennis loving ob/gyn for a recheck. The hemorrhaging and hair loss had ceased, but the fringe benefits made me the office marvel. The left ovariean cyst was gone, the septation on the right ovarian cyst disappeared, the right ovary need not be removed , and uterine fibroids showed a marked size reduction, as did my distended abdomen.Good information, good questions, courage and carefully chosen doctors and healthcare providers create miracles.

I would gladly go back to that. At least I knew what to expect every month--pain. Since the hysterectomy my health has gotten WORSE, not better. I never knew that there were consequences of hysterectomy accept loss of periods. Had I known what was in this book, had I read it beforehand, I might have made a different choice. No doctor ever gave me a balanced view of what a hysterectomy might do. Women must be given adequate information in order to make intelligent choices."},{"Title":"Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal, & Hormone Replacement: What All Women Need to Know","review":"The review below by a gynecologist simply proves Ms. Plourde's point: with little or no honesty from the medical profession, a woman is left to fend for herself when there are problems. Plourde points out that removal of ANY \\"female\\" organs affects them all, and the other body systems as well. I was a victim of this surgery, believing my doctors and continuing for many months to believe that the attendant shut-downs of other systems (notably thyroid) and development of other illnesses (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome) were unrelated.Plourde's book is not negative, but honest. EVERY woman considering a hysterectomy should read this book!"},{"Title":"Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal, & Hormone Replacement: What All Women Need to Know","review":"This book contains a wealth of information that every woman should know, women contemplating hysterectomy or oophorectomy AND women who have undergone either or both surgeries. I completely disagree with earlier post about \\"scaring\\" women unnecessarily- the information in this book is real, solid and based on the most current medical research out there.As a woman who underwent a completely unnecessary hysterectomy and oophorectomy based on a misdiagnosis from an outdated doctor, I cannot stress enough, the importance of being fully informed of all possible consequences before consenting to any kind of surgery.I myself have suffered horrendous side effects, some of them life threatening and all of them life altering. My quality of life has been significantly impacted and I am certain that had I read this book before my surgery, I would not be in the position I am now.For several years after my surgery, I was passed from one doctor to another who seemed to share the same opinions of the doctor who reviewed earlier. Then I read this wonderful book (and also \\"The Hysterectomy Hoax\\" by Dr. Stanley West) and began my quest to find more enlightened doctors.My quest ended with wonderful, world renowned doctors who totally validated the information in this book and have done their best to help me recover as much as possible from the harm that came to me from outdated, misinformed, medical practices that are, unfortunately the \\"standard level of care\\" in the USA. (Hopefully, as the truth is brought out into the open, this will change.)What happened to me is NOT rare, it is much more common than we are led to believe and the chances of this happening to you or a woman you love is very high. Therefore, I would put this book at the TOP of my reading list for all women.As for the comment about the \\"mind/body connection\\"...I couldn't agree more. But in order for the mind to connect with the body, it needs the neuro transmitters to work, and those need chemicals from the body. ALL the chemicals (hormones) from ALL of the body! If you read the book, you will understand this connection."},{"Title":"Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal, & Hormone Replacement: What All Women Need to Know","review":"I agree with previous reviews that this book is largely anti-hysterectomy, but the book is a needed corrective to the unfortunate trend of unneeded hysterectomy. I appreciated the honesty of the book and it helped me to make my decision to have my hysterectomy. I never felt the author was against the procedure, only against unneeded surgery. The book might have been more careful about establishing the fact that hysterectomy is indeed necessary sometimes and perhaps it could have been more respectful of women's choices and fears; at the same time, &quot;Your Guide&quot; does show that hysterectomy is no &quot;walk in the park.&quot; It's tough and no one should undergo the procedure unless she needs to. If a woman is told she needs a hysterectomy, she needs to do her homework and, if necessary, get another opinion. Hysterectomy is not a simple operation, it is major surgery, and it is a life-changing surgery. This book is very clear about that. Readers need to put the book into the context of their own experience, and if they do that, they will likely find the book useful."},{"Title":"Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal, & Hormone Replacement: What All Women Need to Know","review":"I ordered this book because I needed some help with Hrt.

Hysterectomy or bleed to death due to an advanced case of adenomyosis. I had spent over five years trying every other treatment available to me. I needed help to move on and make the best of it. This book is venomously antihysterectomy. In just reading the few pages I read, I was truly depressed and scared. The author lists a zillion different complications women have after this surgery, saying that every woman will come down with them. She says its not if the woman has them, but when.It would seem the author is totally unaware of the mind/body connection which has seen so much research lately. You can literally think your way to many illnesses just through fear and obsessing over what \\"might\\" happen. I refuse to allow the fear and anger of the author to affect my recovery. I am sending this book back!!"},{"Title":"Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal, & Hormone Replacement: What All Women Need to Know","review":"In her first book, Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal & Hormone Replacement, Elizabeth Plourde dared to express what is sadly often inadmissible in our culture - the outrage, pain and loss she experienced when waking from surgery to find that necessary and vital feminine organs were removed without her consent. She, like untold numbers of women, was launched into an challenged existence of physical disability, when unnaturally deprived of her critical hormone-producing ovaries, in particular.During her recovery, she began an unprecedented process of research into the effects of complete hysterectomy, that spanned 16 years, coming up with valuable information on the potential long term effects of ovary removal, which are rarely available to women who are seeking to understand all dimensions of this surgical process.Sustaining a hysterectomy, or deciding to have a hysterectomy, is monumental - although the numbers of this procedure done in this country defies that fact. Elizabeth Plourde is valiant in challenging the normalizing perception of this surgery, and in doing so, may spare countless numbers of women untold and unexpected suffering, help to shift the limiting paradigms in modern medical thought,and validate women's rights to be educated about their bodies and make informed health decisions. She also provides critical information for hysterectomized women regarding promoting and maintaining their post-surgical health and well-being.Thank you, Elizabeth Plourde, for your courage, dedication and perseverance! This is a book that has desperately needed to be written, and gives a critical voice a precious value,and much needed guidance to countless many."},{"Title":"Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal, & Hormone Replacement: What All Women Need to Know","review":"Elizabeth Plourde's book contains the \\"informed consent\\" that I deserved, but did not receive prior to undergoing my total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy 15 years ago, at the young age of 35. At the time of my surgery I was a vibrant, happy mother of two and actively practicing registered nurse.My physical and mental health deteriorated immediately post-operatively. I knew that I was \\"not the same\\" person as I lay recovering in my hospital bed. The physical changes were noticable within the first few days of recovery. Like Elizabeth, I also struggled with bewildering acute depression, hormonally induced physical aches and pains and anguish over the loss of my former glorious, God-given, sexuality as the immediate post-operative months progressed. Even today,15 years later, I still struggle with adequate hormone replacement.The horrific physical and mental anguish I experienced led me to my own research postoperatively. Within 4 years of having this surgery, I successfully sued the doctor that performed it. The foundation of my suit was based on the lack of informed consent about the well documented long term negative consequences of being castrated. I settled my suit out of court for a substantial sum of money.I encourage any woman contemplating this surgery to read this book and seek alternatives at all costs. Elizabeth's frankness and honorable, well-documented research may be offensive to some women.

Most of her problems were due to removal of her OVARIES, not her uterus, and her difficultiues with finding a physician who knew how to manage her hormonal deficiency. Her problems had nothing to do with removal of her uterus. She doesn't acknowledge that many women suffer a great deal from problems that are solved by hysterectomy and that many women benefit from the surgery. She of course gives no alternatives to surgery, but instead needlessly frightens women who have had surgery or need surgery.

I guess my hope is that a memoir by an author is for his readers. If you are hoping for this, you'll be disappointed. It seems this memoir was for Harrison and probably his family and a few close friends listed toward the end. As for people who have been reading his work, maybe we're just better off reading his work. When a writer writes a memoir, I am interested in understanding what he/she reads and how he/she reads. Harrison mentions a number of writers but he doesn't say much about what he got from them (except near the end when he reveals a bit of what Notes From the Underground meant for him). I am interested in how events shaped writing and thinking. What we get are anecdotes. Harrison knew many writers who I like to read but we learn nothing of interest through his encounters. Ultimately, this memoir seems to me self absorbed. As if it were time to do the \\"memoir\\" thing. I guess I was nave enough to think that writers consider their readers, but I don't think Harrison knows anything about his readers except as schmucks who go to his book signings that he was trying mightily to get out of. (I've never been to a book signing.) Is Off to the Side entertaining? Yes. Is it well written in Harrison's distinctive voice? Yes. Did Harrison have a life interesting enough to write about? Yes. Do we learn anything about his writing or reading or his take on other writers and their ideas? No. The rating is higher than it probably should be, but like Harrison, I hate to admit that something I spent time on reading wasn't worth my time."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"When I finished this book, I felt much like the other reviewers. I thought the first half was great, and it finished strong in the very end, but my perception of Harrison was tarnished as one Hollywood name after another was trotted out during the screenplay writing phase. It was as if, caught within a pseudo-fame, he had to ensure his readers (or moreso himself) that he was in the game, whether we knew it or not.Then, as the book settled in a bit, I began to realize that this was probably a relatively candid look at the man's professional life (I don't know him - I'm only guessing). True to his persona, he didn't fall into politically correct pressure - this time by not being modest about who he knows. Maybe this reveals just another one of his addicitons. The only difference is that the other addictions he talks about have a mythological romance to them, evoking endearment in job-shackled readers and probably selling a lot of books for him. This particular vice repels people.Nevertheless, whether he intended it or not, I felt the book revealed a man constantly torn between the seduction of Hollywood's powerful, fast pace and his cheap cars and favorite dogs rolling out to a fishing spot before hitting the local northern Michigan watering hole. I can relate.His language is, as always, poetically beautiful and you can truly feel the passion of somebody who seems fascinated by the simple fact that he's alive.Out of morbid curiosity, I would have liked to understand more how he maintained his family life with so much wild and carefree excess. But, then again, that's really none of my business."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"It's one of the most uniquely American career paths in literature. Boy grows up in the hinterland, discovers that he has received the divine ray of talent, follows his dreams and scrabbles for decades, then finally hits the big time in Hollywood.The difference is that Harrison never lost touch with the land, much preferring to repair to his favorite hunting and fishing spots, and drink with the locals back home in Michigan, rather than toil away in the studios. Oh, he did lose his church unbringing, and G. K. Chesterton would surely call Harrison's idea of a private religion mere weakmindedness, but Harrison has undoubtedly consumed an adult portion of life, and he's here to tell us all about it.As a biographical account of his life and career, this is much too misty. The reader must swim open seas of random impressions, interesting anecdotes, and barstool wisdom to get from one fact to the next. And they are not especially sequential, either. I guess that job will have to wait for a professional biographer.But taken for what it is, this book is enjoyable. There's too much name-dropping in the Hollywood phase, though he is sincerely grateful to Jack Nicholson for his help breaking into pictures. But really--eating sandwiches with Art Garfunkel while betting on which skiers on a slope are going to wipe out? And there are dozens such little passing mentions. Maybe I'm just jealous...His love of the land, of the countryside, of his hunting dogs, and his unsparing accounts of his own shortcomings and addictions and mistakes make this book one to respect. It may be a mishmash, it may not be the whole or unadulterated truth, but it is visibly a labor of love."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"You're at a bar in an airport hotel late at night. The guy next to you has been talking about himself for an hour. At the beginning of his rant, he was sort of interesting, sort of not. He actually says things like &quot;Orson Welles told me once over dinner...&quot; and &quot;My books have been published in twenty languages.&quot; And &quot;I stay with Jack Nicholson whenever I'm in LA...&quot; and on and on. At first you were delighted and certainly impressed with who he appeared to know and where he'd been. But after a while as he pompous'd on, you began to look at your watch wondering when you could politely escape.That's what happened to me reading Harrison's memoir. An interesting life? Sure. But he sure wants you to know it and there's the rub. Way too often he drops the names of the famous like boulders and makes sure you know how glad they were of his company. Or he tells you how thousands of the faithful gather to hear him whenever he speaks in France. And afterwards he's invited to a many course meal at the Crazy Horse in Paris by the owner(of course) and is surrounded by the (naked dancing) girls who want to have their pictures taken with this famous writer... and on and on.By the end, you're pulling your tie away from your neck and glad as hell when you can finally get away from him and back to the silence of your room."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"I've greatly enjoyed many of Harrison's novels and novellas (I'm not much of a poetry fan), and although the other reviews were mixed, I picked this up for cheap and started reading it with low expectations.Harrison is just too good of a writer, and too interesting a person, to write a truly boring memoir. Those who find his references to celebrities intolerable name-dropping may perhaps be envious, or haven't read many memoirs by those who happen to have associated with famous people. If your life has included relationships with such types, so be it; no need to hide it or be self-conscious about it. I didn't find Harrison partularly abusive in his mention of those with whom he has palled around.Unfortunately, I didn't find him particularly enlightening, either. If you're going to mention, say, Jack Nicholson, who strikes me as potentially intriguing, what's the point, unless you're going to tell me something about Nicholson other than the mere fact that you know him, or that in a certain situation he made some comment that anyone might have made? I didn't learn anything about any of these other people, since Harrision seemed to have no inclination to tell me anything. Is this offensive? Not to me -- just much less interesting than it might have been. But then, it seems Harrison wants to maintain his welcome at the Nicholson digs, which is like trying to have your cake and eat it.The organization of this memoir is, well, mostly absent. Harrison's initial effort to start from the begining and tell the story of his life quickly degenerates into more or less random vignettes Harrison, or someone, later cobbled together into something book-length. Often he repeats himself in a manner that suggests he wrote one piece either before writing, or without any recollection of having written, the preceeding section, and jumps from one period in his life to another like Billy Pilgrim.Ultimately, the theme of the book seems to be \\"How I went from starving Artist to screenwriting Big Shot and then dropped off the merry-go-round -- after I'd made a bundle so I could afford to be an Artist again.\\" Harrison seems not to be fully aware that there's a limit to how much sympathy he can expect from readers who will never earn in a lifetime what he made in a year after he hit the big time with Legends of the Fall; his honesty about his inability to handle all the money is refreshing, but I suspect more than a few readers will feel \\"Gee, woulda been nice if he could have done something with all that dough besides drink two hundred dollar bottles of wine and pick up thousand-dollar tabs after lunch with the Rich and Famous.\\" Disappointingly, he really does come off as something of a pig, as well as a Hollywood hanger-on who parlayed his obvious, but limited, talent into an opportunity to party with celebrities who were frankly in another league.Harrison is oddly selective about what he chooses to discuss. He's under no obligation to tell me about, say, his marriage or experiences as a father, but it does seem odd that he'll go on, and on, confessing his weakness for booze and rich food and strippers but say next to nothing about how someone who seems to have spent countless days rambling about, drinking, stuffing his face and chasing skirts, managed to stay married to the same woman for over forty years.Harrison also tries way too hard to present his musings as something more substantial than they are. I don't demand timeless philosophy from every memoir, but Harrision tries for it, with very spotty results. In the manner of Montaigne, Harrison often makes a series of one-line, abstract pronouncements of purported Truths he's discovered, but too often these would-be gems are obtuse, vague, and frankly pretentious. In fact, Harrison's manner throughout has a touch of pretention about it, with frequent use of words that he rarely, if ever, would use in any of his other works -- lots of \\"quite,\\" \\"indeed,\\" and other overly refined language that may be entirely appropriate coming from someone who actually speaks or writes that way, but sounds incongruous from a writer who's made his fortune playing, and portraying, the rough-hewn backwoods rascal. Harrison has written several very entertaining novels (and a few that, IMHO, are unremarkable), but he's no literary giant. One suspects, in reading his memoirs, that he's torn between humility and believing the blurb-hype.Notwithstanding any of this, though, it really isn't a bad read. It moves along, and Harrison is about as clever as a reader of one of his better writings might imagine. One might be a little disappointed to find, however, that he's not the modern-day Thoreau one might romantically have supposed."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"Jim Harrison, Off to the Side: a MemoirAtlantic Monthly Pressreviewed by Sean Aden LovelaceJim Harrison has often said he's horrible at titles. I'm not sure that's true (excluding his novel SunDog, neither of sun or dog, and possibly A Good Day to Die, which smacks of Elmore Leonard, or one of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns), but then again few writers have had such literary prolificacy (28 volumes and counting), and thus an ongoing need for titles. And so what of Harrison's 2002 memoir, Off to the Side? I suppose it depends on your definition of title. Is it a key to a door, or the door itself, opening into the rooms and hallways of a writer's memory? Or more a structural device, a textual map, guiding us along? Or is it simply a disarming introduction, a gesture of the hand, an invitation to pull up a chair and gather round the fire, to sit right by the storyteller-right off to the side.I'd say the answer is yes.The book does indeed begin with memory, section one, \\"Early Life,\\" a brief review of parental courting, family life, Harrison's youthful days of fishing and hunting and scraping by in rural Michigan, and though admittedly a life of poverty- \\"catsup sandwiches\\" and \\"plates of beans\\"-never a hint of self-pity. Primarily through lively imagery and lyrical description (Harrison is also an accomplished poet), the author expresses a certain calm and simplicity in a caring family and rural environs. He writes of waking in the morning: \\"There had been a little rain in the night and I could smell the damp garden, the strong winey smell of the grape arbor, the bacon grease from the kitchen below.\\" In short, his childhood embodies the poetic idyll, and Harrison never takes for granted this fortunate reality.Yet, like childhood, Harrison's Eden quickly gives way to the pain of knowledge, and \\"Early Life\\" shifts in tone and mood. Off to the Side becomes a title of the artist's first identity as outsider, and this alienation is no garden variety adolescent angst-Harrison's abstract loss and longing can be traced to a concrete source. At age seven the author is partially blinded when a playmate jabs a glass bottle into his left eye, permanently disabling him. (Interestingly, the writer James Thurber also suffered a childhood blinding in one eye, and was likewise a prolific and imaginative writer.) Harrison must now adjust, not only physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. His perceptions change; his life now a type of inward synesthesia: \\"You have the idea you can actually hear color.\\" Later, Harrison spends the money he has saved for months-$1200 earned at the rate of $1.50 per hour-on a quack physician who promises to repair his eyesight. Harrison's eyesight is not repaired; in fact, he is totally blinded for a time, as he feels a \\"hot nail in my eyeball.\\" To put it plainly, he feels foolish, hopeless, and alone. He yearns for escape, \\"for the places you read about...\\" And so he leaves his home, and childhood, behind.Section Two of Off to the Side is clearly segmented, a sometimes forced arrangement of heavily modified deadly sins, the modification a bit ironic (and playful-a Harrison trait), in that the sin is to omit these activities from a full life. Harrison labels these topics as \\"Seven Obsessions.\\" At this point, the book's title might refer to a whiskey chaser on the side (obsession one: alcohol), a woman on the side (strippers), a sidearm, or sidearm cast (hunting and fishing), a spiritual side (private religion), a side of roast pheasant and truffles (a tour of France), the side of a highway shoulder (the road), or possibly an empathetic and holistic side (nature and natives). To summarize this delightful section of writing would be akin to wading through one of Harrison's famous (or infamous) 37 course gourmet meals, yet I would implore the reader to never dismiss the seriousness the author allows these sensory pursuits. Each \\"obsession\\" is followed with insightful reflection, its demerits and merits, even the likely consequences of excess. All of Harrison's activities-from the primarily hedonistic to the often spiritual-are undertaken with one purpose: \\"a willingness to be conscious.\\"Memory knows no true chronology, and the final section, \\"The Rest of Life,\\" is an often random medley of recollections: some tragic, some elated, some a bit repetitive, some fresh and startling. We get the soaring events of Harrison's first literary success, and also the sodden (and brief) days of his teaching in academia. We experience yet another sudden act of devastating violence, a list of the author's pernicious phobias, but then gentle, often intimate, reflections on the role of husband and father. We eavesdrop on the intellectual subtleties (and often intriguing arguments about the state of writing today) of living among artists such as Brautigan, Auden, Lowell, Capote, and Ginsberg, but also the freewheeling immediacy (as in partying) of Harrison's screenwriting days in Hollywood, with the likes of Orson Welles, Jack Nicholson, Jimmy Buffett, Danny DeVito, and Sean Connery. (Harrison has been criticized for dropping names; and for mimicking the life of Hemingway, a man who was himself a celebrity. Both complaints are, of course, absurd. A writer of memoir has the right (the duty?) to mention his fellow human beings. And I've never understood an attack that uses a Nobel Laureate as its foundation.)Memoir-if written with skill, care and seriousness-surpasses and transcends the life of any one writer. Jim Harrison's finest wisdom is found midway through: \\"What you get in life is what you organize for yourself every day.\\" Well said, and yet another way of nudging the reader to embrace life, but never just with the physical, always with the cerebral along for the ride. Jim Harrison engages life in all its arenas, and then he writes what he sees and hears and touches and feels, with all of his considerable energy and ability, either head-on, or yes, Off to the Side. Yet another point of the book's title? Possibly. Does it matter? Possibly not, but you should, if paying attention, already know the answer; and you won't find it in a book review. Go outside, get the book, read it, and then you decide."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"I remember walking into the Crawford County library in Grayling, Michigan over thirty years ago and reading a poem by Jim Harrison, thinking that he had completely restructured the way I thought about language. That began a thirty year obsession with Harrison and his work, especially the poems which I read almost daily.He has illuminated my own writing career, such as it is. When I thought I was paying attention to the natural world, his work would remind me that I truly wasn't as perceptive as I imagined. Now, his interior life, which has always ridden close to the surface of his work, has been exhaustively mined and offered up to those of us who use Harrison's work as one might use a compass.For me OFF TO THE SIDE is like getting a topographic map of a heart I have long admired. Poet, shaman, Zen fool in the tradition of Ikkyu, Harrison is the best antidote to a world ever-filling with greed, stupidity and blindness."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"After falling in love with Harrison's fiction (True North, the novellas in Legends of the Fall,) I was eager to read this memoir that a friend - another Harrison lover - loaned me. Why is it, when we are taken with an author's writing, we wish to know more about his/her life and background? Sometimes it confirms our speculations, sometimes it adds new insights to the writing, and sometimes it sort of muddies our ideas of \\"who\\" this author is. This memoir did all of this for me.In his fiction, Harrison artfully spans years and generations, sometimes within a paragraph. You do have to pay attention, but you never feel lost or plunked from time to time or place to place. In the memoir, he trawls all over the place and goes off on tangents, sometimes returning to his running narrative with an abrupt \\"Back to the early days.\\" Luckily, his tangents are interesting and worth the ride. He also switches back and forth from his first person telling to the \\"you\\" of second person. I don't know if this is a technique of distancing himself or if it is meant to make his experience more universal, but I found it a little jarring, as it pulled me out of the storyline.But those are just quibbles. This guy has lived an extraordinary life of art, has traveled and eaten and drunk widely and gloriously, and his body of work - fiction, poetry, essays, memoir, and children's fiction - is just as wide and glorious. His most famous book is probably Legends of the Fall, made into an award-winning film. Harrison writes of his years as a screenwriter, trying to adapt his books. After many years of living and supporting his family on roughly $10K/year, he's suddenly in the money (and then out of it again), and offers his version of being swallowed by the Hollywood machine and spit out the other side. Dude knows a lot of actors, directors, producers and other industry types, and seems to have become close friends with many of them, most notably, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson believed in Harrison enough to bankroll his living expenses for a year, and their friendship seems authentic, a relationship between men who like to live large (in living experience, not necessarily in buying it).I have thought of Harrison as an extremely \\"male\\" writer, as a man's man, and this memoir confirms that. There is a long and honest section about his \\"Seven Obsessions\\" - alcohol; stripping [watching, not performing]; hunting, fishing (and dogs); private religion; France; taking solo road trips; and his immersion in nature and identification with American Natives. These preoccupations are carried throughout this book, and I've noticed his fiction abounds with these same thematic touchstones. Interestingly, he talks about hunting and fishing not as manly pursuits, and how that judgment came (from others) as our country became more urban/suburban. He offers many, many of these kinds of anthropological/sociological insights. I'd say the guy is a true observer, hence his chosen title.But I'll stick with my sense of his &uuml;ber-maleness anyway. The man is exceedingly well-read, but of the dozens and dozens of authors he has read, met, admired, obsessed over, or otherwise referenced, the ones he names are nearly all male. Reminds me of an older male professor I had who worked at the public library in his town during the summers. He said women would read anyone, male or female, while men would only read other men. However, Harrison does note Native American author Linda Hogan, and mentions the novellas of Katherine Anne Porter and Isak Dinesen as influencing his decision to write his own novella, Legends of the Fall, so I'll give him points for that and bump it up to four stars."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"Another great read from Jim Harrison, certainly one of our finest and most accessible writers. Every time I return to one of his books, and I often do, I always find fresh perspectives, new insights, and fine writing."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"Jim Harrison passes on reflections on his life to readers of Off to the Side. I don't think he tries to accomplish any goals of self revelation or sequential order in this book. He merely shares episodes of his life and work, as well as thoughts on a wide range of topics like strippers, religion, nature, literature and Hollywood. Harrison could write a description of a coke bottle and make it eloquent and enjoyable to read. His writing skill and literary talents are at the top of the bar, so readers will appreciate even his writing about day-to-day events.Harrison writes in-depthly about his childhood and early family life, but then departs from writing much about his adult family to share more about his Hollywood interactions. Similarly, he shares early inspiration by literary giants and unknowns, then later in the book delves into episodes with drinking buddies and Hollywood cronies.This book is at its best when Harrison is revealing significant stories about family, nature and literature. It devolves as he spends considerable pages repeating the frustrating stories of trying to turn novels and novellas into successful screenplays. He drops many big names but rarely reveals much about them.It seems like Harrison writes some of this book to cater to what he thinks readers will want to read about like Hollywood and drinking in Key West with Jimmy Buffet, but the real richness is in Harrison's tales of writing and trying to make it as a writer in the solitude of his cabin or small home with a young wife and new baby. He returns again and again to his calling and his passion for writing that sometimes comes to him in dreams and visions. I think the treasure of this book lies in his accounts of the challenges, rewards and heartache of responding to the deep call to write.I would like to know after reading this book about the author's family life as a husband and father while he was continually off on hunting, fishing or Hollywood endeavours. Did the wife and kids come or were they content to let him go for months at a time each year?These questions may have to wait for answers from a biography of Harrison written by someone else. For now, Off to the Side serves as an enjoyable and at times revealing and enlightening memoir of a called and committed author who did the work required to bring his gift to life.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"Harrison's memoir is well worth reading.He manages to keep the reader's interest, even if a person has no interest in his interests.I am not familiar with his works but I know of his great success with Legends of the Fall.

Besides his love of hunting and fishing, Harrison shows a contempt for academia...sort of the Hemingway slant.He has an abundance of friends and he mentions them.

As a person who is recovering from alcohol abuse, James gives guidelines and talks honestly about the issue, and it really gave me insight into this disease that nearly killed me.This is one of the most honest and human book in my collection.I have given this book to many to my friends.Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Off to the Side","review":"Jim Harrison's memoir, Off to the Side, is just as gritty, scrutinizing, and lush as his novels and novellas. Harrison's life of the mind makes excellent reading, and he doesn't seem to make any excuses for his failures or take too much credit for his successes.Harrison's work in Hollywood gave him access and interesting insight into show business during the eighties and nineties. His reflection on those times and his utter distaste for his life then is filled with witty observations and candid appraisals.His writing has always been filled an intoxicating blend of wine, food, sex, and natural history. Harrison's descriptions of his life and his process will be valuable and heartening to any aspiring writers.

I can relate.I'm a huge Harrison fan and love Sundog, Farmer, and Legends of the Fall the best. I just don't get much enjoyment out of is name dropping and arrogant attitude. He mentions his wife and family rarely and there's just a couple references about his writing and approach.

Since the cause of procrastination lies principally in our thinking, the &quot;rational&quot; techniques work especially well. I also found a number of behavioral tools that worked well for me. Among these are the profit-penalty system, reminders, bits and pieces (which NLP authors term &quot;chunking down&quot;), and the five-minute plan. I've used this book several times over the past few years when I've found myself procrastinating.If you're procrastinating, I suggest that you buy this book and start using it...now. As you're working with it, you might also augment your procrastination-fighting skills by using David Burns' &quot;The Feeling Good Handbook.&quot; (I have found it more useful than its predecessor, &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,&quot; and you can easily use it without reading the latter.) And then, until you realize that you've made the progress you wanted, stop looking elsewhere for more books and more tools. That's just another procrastination pattern!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Procrastination: Or How to Think and Act Rationally in Spite of Life's Inevitable Hassles (Signet)","review":"As the book repeatedly says though, the battle is not over yet; reading the book merely provides one with the tools and knowledge one needs to overcome this habit that many of us share. The book stresses that overcoming procrastination is a lifelong battle; however, in reading the book, I realised that as a battler of procrastination, I am amongst millions. All of the justification I had ever used for my procrastination was covered in the book; justification equals excuses. On a humorous note: I gave this book to a friend of mine who suffers from procrastination; she still has not found time to open it up!

He instructs us in his A-B-Csystem of mental health. We have the Activating event (A),the Beliefs that we hold (B), and the Consequences of thosebeliefs (C). (A) for me is writing this review. (B) is my Belief that it must be a perfect review. (C) is the Consequencewhich I experience from that belief. Which is anxiety. Whenwe procrastinate, according to Ellis, we are holding irrational(B)eliefs. The more we (D)ispute these beliefs, the more healthy(E)ffects of mental health we will experience. Ellis also givesus behavioral tools to help us eliminate our procrastination.Such as a reward system. Nevertheless, his system dependson disputing the irrational beliefs. There are two things that you might want to remember before you buy this wonderful book.First, you have to use REBT (Rational-Emotive-Behavioral-Therapy) all the time. It has to become a powerful philosophy in and of itself. If you counter your procrastination ten minutes daily,but then whip yourself with irrational thoughts and ideas the rest of the time, it won't work. For this, you might want to go to the REBT website (...) for more information. The second thing is that you might want to employ a Tibetan Buddhist technique to really dispute your irrational beliefs and to burnin rational ones. To do this, you sit in a chair. Count to ten. And after you have counted to ten without losing your count, you THEN dispute your irrational beliefs. This is howthey burn in rational thoughts in the Gelugpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Regardless, I hope that you enjoy this littlebook. And I wish you all the happiness in the world."},{"Title":"Overcoming Procrastination: Or How to Think and Act Rationally in Spite of Life's Inevitable Hassles (Signet)","review":"...To readers familiar with Ellis's R.E.T.(Rational Emotive Therapy)theory(also called REBT), this is already a familiar book, a variation on themes Ellis expounds upon elsewhere, most notably in \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\", written back in the 60's, where he lays out the basics of his theory. Readers unfamiliar with Ellis and R.E.T. might see his approach as similiar to television's \\"Dr Phil\\"(McGraw), and if you see the latter as something of a scold, you're likely to experience Ellis the same way.Ellis's approach emphasizes \\"self-talk\\", and asking you to question your motives in avoiding anxiety-provoking tasks. He prefers behavior-oriented and pragmatic thinking over \\"what-happened-way-back-when\\" depth psychology. If such an approach strikes you as what you're looking for in a book about this topic, then I'd recommend Ellis. He's very straightforward and easy to comprehend."},{"Title":"Overcoming Procrastination: Or How to Think and Act Rationally in Spite of Life's Inevitable Hassles (Signet)","review":"This book is about using REBT to combat procrastination. REBT (rational emotive behavioral therapy ) was the first type of cognitive therapy invented, some say the most effective type.The authors of this book seem to write like they speak and it did not seem to help the book.

I didn't think the authors described rational emotive behavioral therapy well in this book.Despite the poor writing there is a significant amount of useful information for overcoming procrastination in this book.

Those approaches are applications of Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT). As Ellis says in his other books, application of REBT can be difficult. To benefit from this book on procrastination without having a therapist will probably require at least one more reading. However, it will be worthwhile. Some or all of the recommendations can be applied without a therapist's help.One thing that I like about this book and Ellis' other books is that he includes quotations of conversations with clients. Sometimes, I can relate to what the client says and, as a result, I am receptive to the advice given to the client.I think Ellis and Knaus wrote this book primarily for college students in the 1970's. It includes many comments on procrastination by college students and what should be done about it. I don't think this detracts from the value of the book. The REBT approaches that the authors advocate can be applied by anyone who wants to reduce procrastination."},{"Title":"Overcoming Procrastination: Or How to Think and Act Rationally in Spite of Life's Inevitable Hassles (Signet)","review":"Do not let the unassuming book-cover advertised here fool you. This book is gold! I read this book 10 years ago when I first started doing my masters and it changed my life. I knew then that I couldn't do school and work while procrastinating. After a long search for a year, I finally found it again. This book turned my life around back then. Before reading this book, I really thought I was a lost case and that I would never change my old ways. I just fined reading it again and I wish I had picked it up as soon as I felt myself slipping again.His explanations are well organized by chapters. His style of writing is fun and engaging, but mainly he digs deep into the irrational procrastination way of thinking and ways to overcome it.This book like no other, and I have read two popular ones out there, explained to me precisely the reasons why I procrastinate. It gives step by step ways of how to change that thinking. And it works!! In the first two chapters he explains what is procrastination and what are the causes. The third chapter he discusses his rational approach to procrastination. On the next four chapters he explains that there are 4 causes of procrastination. In the next two chapters he gives a behavioral and emotional methods for overcoming it. He then goes on to discuss impediments to over coming procrastinations and how to overcome \\"legitimate\\" reasons for procrastination. The final chapter is one of his sessions with a patient written verbatim. As you read this book, you know you are reading something that is life changing.

There is nothing wrong with piety or devotion, but it is wrong to link it with anti-intellectualism or an insufficient appreciation for the achievements of the secular world. This book of course does not make this error; it is meticulously well documented, cogently argued, and written by a true scholar and Doctor of the Church.Having said this, after reading this book, I do not feel the grace or presence of the Holy Spirit nearly as much as when I read the other less detailed and less documented devotional works. There seems to be much less that feeds the soul in this work. It is a responsible and scholarly work, but I much prefer St. Louis de Montfort for motivation and growth in holiness and piety; this work, by contrast, is a helpful scholarly reference but for me at least did not stimulate the heart or soul."},{"Title":"The glories of Mary","review":"I did not buy this book, but downloaded the PDF version on line.

No man can worship any other god.De Ligouri wrote: But what should especially persuade us that our pious opinion is conformable to the common opinion of Catholics, is the declaration of Pope Alexander VII., in the celebrated bull, \`Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum,' issued in the year 1661, namely: \`This devotion and worship to the mother of God again increased and was propagated, ... .so that the universities having embraced this opinion (that is, the pious one), almost all Catholics embrace it.' And, in fact, this opinion is defended by the universities of the Sorbonne, of Alcala, of Salamanca, of Coimbra, of Cologne, of Mayence, and of Naples, and by many others, in which every one who graduates binds himself by an oath to the de fence of the immaculate Mary. The learned Petavius rests his proof of the immaculate conception mainly upon this argument of the common consent of the faithful.\\"On page 201 God's power is attributed to Mary: \\". . .

Saint Alphonsus Liguori analyses with great detail and precision, but always using a perfectly clear language, the decisive role of Saint Mary in the salvation of human souls and her essential contribution to keep them away from sin and eternal condemnation. It is deplorable that the post-Vatican II modernist Church has almost forgotten these fundamental teachings."},{"Title":"The glories of Mary","review":"St. Alphonsus Liguori (1696 - 1787) uses very intense language in this long love letter to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It's a work of beauty and devotion, with stories and legends meant for the edification of people from another place in time; parts of \\"The Glories of Mary\\" may not resonate with some modern ears, but it resonated with mine. Although there are serious (and very excellent) Church teachings scattered throughout, it is not fundamentally a theologic or apologetic work: it was written more to move the heart than the mind.There are 7 parts to the unabridged edition I'm reviewing (Liguori Publications; Revised edition October 1, 2000):1. Line by line commentary on the Salve Regina2. Prayers to Our Lady (including The Rosary of Our Lady's Sorrows, covered in more depth in Part 4)3. Sermons on the Principle Feasts of Our Lady4. The Sorrows of Mary5. The Virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary6. Practices of Devotion in Honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary7. Further ExamplesSt. Alphonsus follows a four-step formula in covering most of the material: (1) theme, (2) exposition, (3) example, and (4) prayer. He introduces a topic, develops it in depth using the devotional writings and sayings of the Fathers, Doctors, and saints of the Church, and then provides a story or two to illustrate his point, and a specific prayer for Our Lady's grace pertaining to the particular topic.As mentioned earlier, this is primarily a work of devotion and therefore not the book I'd give a Protestant to explain the Catholic veneration of Mary; just as I would not give \\"The Imitation of Christ\\" to an atheist to explain the rational underpinnings of Christianity. This is the book you read after the light goes on and you realize that for Christ to be King, His mother Mary has to be Queen. That's the way God chose to do it.If you're Protestant and want to try reading this book with an open mind, you have to have a proper rational foundation for the veneration Catholics give Mary. It's vital to understand that there are three modes of veneration or worship we, as creatures, can render. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, these are latria, dulia, and hyperdulia. Latria is addressed directly to God. It is superior, absolute, supreme worship, \\"the sovereign worship due to God alone\\"; addressed to a creature it would become idolatry. When worship is addressed indirectly to God - when its object is the veneration of martyrs, angels, or saints - it is called dulia. Veneration of the Blessed Virgin, who has a \\"supereminent\\" rank among saints, is called hyperdulia. Dulia and hyperdulia are given, therefore, with the knowledge that we are offering it *to* God *through* the creature: praising God's creation in this framework has always and forever been but praise for God Himself.For those outside the Church who put little stock in its whole Deposit of Faith, and choose to use only a part of it - the holy books chosen and approved by that same Church, otherwise known as the Bible - there absolutely is a basis for venerating Mary. I'll explain just one of them here, but if you really have a heart to find out more, there are plenty of books and resources on the subject.In Chapter 1 of Luke, we have the Annunciation: Mary is full of grace; she is highly favored by the Lord. So highly favored in fact that the Holy Spirit will come upon her and the Son of God will be incarnate in her womb. The implications of this are staggering:* All of Jesus' humanity - his DNA - comes from Mary.* Jesus, the ultimate source of all grace, whom God could have formed from the dust as he did Adam for his human nature, instead comes to us through Mary - she was chosen to be the channel through which comes all grace.* God honors Mary like no other creature; as He must: it is his own Commandment (the fourth.)* Remember what Jesus' saliva mixed in mud did for the blind man; Mary's very blood coursed through the Son of God, thereby consecrating her as no other creature, not even the Angels in Heaven.* She was without Original Sin, protected by the Fall at the moment of her conception: she had to be, as the Son of God could not be made of flesh that was at any time held captive by Satan. Why would any Protestant want to refute this point? It only impugns Christ to say or think otherwise.* The Holy Spirit is married to Mary in a mystical but very real manner (unless you would prefer to believe He would impregnate her out of wedlock), and the Song of Songs is to be read, on one level, in this light.* The Mother of God is a Queen; for who else gives birth to a King but a Queen?There are many more conclusions you could draw from this one scene in Luke on the fact of the incarnation. There are other scenes, especially the Wedding Feast at Cana in John. Once you begin to follow these threads you will, with prayer, eventually be led to the truth of the Catholic understanding of Theotokos."},{"Title":"The glories of Mary","review":"This book is a great source of meditation on the BVM.

Parts of it are incredibly entertaining and it is interesting to view Bosch through the eyes of another character (McCaleb) and the idea of weaving together two murder cases is good, but, for me, the story gets a bogged down by both the solving of the two cases and the courtroom scenes. Reading so-called \\"courtroom drama\\" for me is incredibly boring. Apart from some clever word-play and maybe a \\"gotcha\\" moment, it's mostly just hot air...no action, no enjoyable writing, very little character development. Still, this doesn't deter me from wanting to read all of Connelly's books b/c those moments with the dark-hearted Bosch are worth it."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Modern noir doesn't get any better than A Darkness More Than Night, as Michael Connelly delicately creates a full literary development of personality of his avenging detective character, Harry Bosch, while accurately portraying ordinary peace officers as the frail humans that they really are. Those who realize that FBI profiling of serial killers is more pseudo-science than science will be amused by Terry McCaleb's misreading of the clues he's given to inspect.Those who like a novel's progress to be very opaque won't like this book. You'll see where it's headed pretty early on. The pleasure in this plot is to see if the good guys can outmaneuver some very obnoxious bad guys.I was impressed the way the plot's design cross-cut between police investigations and a trial. I did find that Mr. Connelly's portrayal of what prosecutors do to be more than a little stilted. Janis Langwiser, co-prosecutor, is more incompetent than any first year law student I can imagine.Those who are familiar with Mr. Connelly's earlier works will be impressed by how smoothly he combines characters and references from several books. Robert Parker could take a lesson from Mr. Connelly in this area. If you don't know the earlier books, you'll still have a fine time with the story . . . the references are well explained before the book's end.If you like this book, you'll want to be sure to readThe Narrows (Harry Bosch)."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Connelly covers everything in exhaustive detail, from the process by which Terry (the initially reluctant investigator) profiles the killer---and Bosch, his unlikely suspect---to each moment of the courtroom testimony in Bosch's high-profile case. It rides a fine line between fascinating and dry, illustrative and dull, and I think which side of the line it falls on depends very much on the individual reader. It certainly gave the story a great deal of authenticity, and for people who particularly enjoy following each and every detail of investigation and trial it's ideal. For me, however, the courtroom material in particular stepped over the line into overly-dry, using short, staccato sentences that evoked a court transcript more than anything. I imagine for some people that's a plus, but for me it was a minus.Connelly also has a tendency to go off on extended tangents about one or another past event. While he does tie them all together in the end and they do all become relevant, it does give the book a rather slow, meandering feel at times. Again, something that some will enjoy while others won't.This book is obviously very carefully constructed, and I fully believe that each of the things I wasn't entirely thrilled with were done very deliberately and will appeal to some segments of Connelly's audience; I mention them primarily so that you can choose for yourselves whether they're characteristics you'd be likely to enjoy or not. The plot itself is extremely well-constructed and interesting, with several interesting red herrings of various types and quite a few well-detailed characters that I certainly enjoyed spending the length of a book with.If you enjoy highly-detailed mysteries and procedurals with plenty of detective-work and courtroom drama, then A Darkness More Than Night makes quite a good read."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I've read most of Michael Connelly's work and found this one on par with all the other excellent reads. There were the usual plot flaws that reviewers and I agree on (why wasn't it obvious to McCaleb that Harry was being set-up?) BUT, once again Connelly's great writing helped me easily downplay stuff like that.Being a fan of the Bosch series, it was cool to see Bosch being observed, scrutinized and analyzed by the main protagonist ex-FBI agent Terry McCaleb (he from a previous Connelly book \\"Blood Work\\"). Easy 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A new major character is introduced. Harry Bosch is downplayed early, later is brought into the story.

I read it on a beach vacation at it was perfect for that purpose. Not too demanding of a read. Connelly really kept the pages turning, right until the very end. This is a good intro to Connelly as he uses Harry Bosch and Terry McAleb as the main protagonists of the novel. One complaint, even from a first time reader, the notion that Bosch committed this murder was not very believable.All in all I highly recommend this book as a great way to pass the time at the beach. However, certainly not a great work of literature."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Having discovered the fine mysteries by author Connelly about a year ago, we're catching up on his (lengthening) booklist. While \\"Darkness\\" is another entry in the LAPD Homicide Detective Harry Bosch series, it really features as protagonist ex-FBI agent Terry MaCaleb, leading man from the earlier tale \\"Blood Work\\", later turned into the Clint Eastwood movie. Terry has started life anew as a heart transplant survivor, and is happily retired as a new husband with a new baby girl. When Det. Jaye Winston consults with him for a quick profile on a murder she's working, Terry not only gets involved, but is soon deeply engrossed in a deed that many signals point to Bosch as the potential killer. Along the way we're treated to a lengthy exposition on the Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch (our detective's namesake) - indeed his art provides many of the clues pointing to the perpetrator.Meanwhile, Harry is a key witness in a trial of Hollywood producer Jack Story, who looks to get off for the murder of an unfortunate party girl unless Bosch and the DA's office can prevail. As McCaleb and Winston continue pursuing their case, suddenly events begin to converge, and in a climactic denouement, we finally discover the genius behind multiple crimes. In an intriguing prologue of sorts, will McCaleb and Bosch toast success and discuss some realities that never do come to light?As usual, Connelly has plotted a fine tale. As if the court case didn't create enough tension, the new murder under investigation, with almost too many clues with which to track various police theories, get us flipping those pages until the final chapter or two. The surprising twist at the end was the cherry on top of an already sweet sundae - one that entertained throughout. We can easily see why these stories have found such a faithful following, and highly commend this entry in the Bosch/McCaleb set to your attention!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A sequel to the brilliant Blood Work although can be read without reading the former. This book is not as good as Blood Work but is still worth more than the money you'll pay for it.This time ex-FBI profiler Terry McCaleb who now has a family helps the LAPD track down a serial killer. What makes this book brilliant is that the hero detective from Connelly's other books (Harry Bosch) is McCaleb's main suspect.This book breaks boundaries. It would be like the question could Alex Cross actually be a serial killer himself in James Patterson novels? Could he? Could Harry Bosch? Think about it? You'll need this book to answer that question."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"The bad news is that compared to some of the other Connelly books, _A Darkness More Than Night_ is a bit of a disappointment. The good news is that a disappointing mystery by Connelly is much better than the best of most other writers.While combining McCaleb and Bosch was an intriguing idea, it never quite worked out in terms of plot. The contrast between the two men and their different philosophies is striking (probably what captured Connelly's interest about the idea) as is the difference in approach that they take to the demons they both specialize in hunting. McCaleb has chosen for a new life, a baby daughter, a different way. Bosch walks the same dark roads he's always walked-- his marriage in ruins, his actions often heavily limned in shadow.Unfortunately, it seems as though Connelly gets so caught up in his characters that he takes his eye off the ball-- the ending was predictable to the point where I think most readers figure the angle way too early to be able to effectively maintain interest. It's also straining credibility to add McEvoy to the mix-- a reunion of former characters is just a little too precious.So, while Connelly fans may enjoy despite the flaws (I did!) this review should serve as a note of warning to first time Connelly readers-- don't begin with this book. There are better books to start with if you're going to start with either Harry Bosch or Terry McCaleb as characters. For Harry Bosch (bitter avenging cop), pick up _The Black Ice_. For Terry McCaleb (retired ex-profiler, pick _Blood Work_."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"... like one of the reviewer said, &quot;Not Enough Bosch&quot;. And when he appeared, he usually on the court ... not spending his time investigating. Compared to the previous one, &quot;Angels Flight&quot;, this one is a little behind.

Connelly has a gift of pulling from previous books and developing top notch plots. This book has Harry in the midst of a trial against an arrogant Hollywood show-off. McCaleb, from Blood Works, is asked to look at a murder book on a victim who Bosch knows well. McCaleb is lead down a road where Bosch becomes a prime suspect. The 2 plots then come together at the end.I really liked the reference to the painter Bosch's pieces. I found them very interesting.This story kept me on the edge...I was pleased with the resolution, however, the only thing that puzzled me was the ending. I had to read the last 2 pages to figure out if there was something I missed....I hope I didn't."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly hit a home run with this installment of Harry Bosch. This is his best book since the &quot;Poet.&quot; I highly recommend it to all Connelly fans."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"If you are familiar with the characters Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, there is really no mystery here. But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"At least this is what an ex-FBI profiler, Terry McCaleb, believes after he starts looking at allot of art books as a result of a homicide that the someone in the LA Co. Sheriff's Dept. has brought him.......right from the start I was disappointed that Connelly dragged out this character AGAIN......he was boring enough in &quot;Blood Work&quot; and I was disappointed that he is featured prominently in his newest book particularly as Harry nemesis. As the book progressed I found myself leafing ahead to see how much was left of McCaleb.......I have read all of Harry adventures and like him very much despite all of the baggage that he hauls around....but that is what makes him human.....unlike McCaleb who has all the answers apparently to everything.......perhaps the most hilarious aspect of this book was at the end where McCaleb declares, when he goes to Bosch's home, that he no longer wants to be his friend!!! EXCUSE ME?????? I was never aware that they were bosom buddies......infact I think Bosch says &quot;What?&quot; also......if I had to depend on a friend like that I might start thinking about how I select my 'friends'.......I feel the way Bosch does about him......I hope McCaleb stays on Catalina island PERMANENTLY swallowing his bottles of pills everyday, taking out fishermen in his little boat, and sitting on his front porch.......PS: Can I give 5 stars to Bosch and 1 to McCaleb in this book??????? LOL"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is the eighth book I've read from Michael Connelly and it was just okay. The concept of strangulation for sexual pleasure is disturbing and the movie director is very arrogant. Harry Bosch is also falsely accused of interfering in the case."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I just came off the unbelievably atrocious The Pelican Brief by John Grisham and I needed an author that would make me a fan again of this genre, make me believe again that there's still good writing out there. Sure enough, Michael Connelly came to the rescue. Yet again. This guy is amazing. He is so much more talented than Grisham it's not even funny, it's actually sad, because Amazon reviews are the most deceptive thing since someone wanting to know about the quality of this writing will think Grisham and Connelly are basically the same, based on the reviews. Don't be fooled.I'll be selling all my Grisham paperbacks, even give them away, heck I'll burn them if I have to in the end just to rid myself of that tripe. But my Connelly collection will remain on my bookshelf in a prominent place, to be read again in the future."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is my first Michael Connelly book and I am speechless. I could not put this book down once I started. The story begins with a retired FBI profiler, Terry McCaleb, getting a visit from an LA County sherriff's homicide investigator to assist her in profiling a murderer. All clues point to his good friend, Harry Bosch, as the main suspect because the \\"victim\\" was a criminal with a long rap sheet and had literally gotten away with murder on more than a few occasions while Bosch was involved in the investigations. McCaleb thinks that Bosch is possibly some kind of \\"avenging angel\\" but still wants to look at other possibilities.This book has fewer action scenes than what I usually like in a book but the dialogue was so real and intense, that it did not really need lots of action. I am now an official member of the Michael Connelly fan club and can't wait to dive into more of his readings."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"In a Darkness More Than Night, Michael Connelly inserts a character from Blood Work into his Harry Bosch mystery series to create a powerful thriller. In fact, this book has become my favorite Connelly book out of the nine that I have read thus far.Terry McCaleb is a retired FBI agent whose specialty was behavioral sciences (profiling). LAPD homicide detective Jaye Winston seeks out McCaleb's help on a murder case that is going nowhere. The victim, Edward Gunn, was accused of killing a prostitute six years previous, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Gunn's murder scene includes ritualistic symbolism with religious ties. McCaleb misses the excitement and challenge of his bureau days and quickly agrees to help. But what he discovers is very disturbing. At the same time, LAPD detective Harry Bosch is preparing for the trial of the famed Hollywood director, David Storey (who is accused of killing a young starlet and making it look like an accidental autoerotic death).When the FBI takes the Gunn case away from Winston, McCaleb is left hanging with important evidence. It is possible that Harry Bosch may or may not have killed Gunn (he was the lead investigator when Gunn killed the prostitute). Reluctantly, McCaleb and Bosch join forces to discover what they're missing in the murder investigation of Edward Gunn. At the same time, clues in the Gunn case start pointing to the David Storey trial. A Darkness More Than night was so exciting that it kept me up late into the night.I have enjoyed all Connelly's mysteries, but Darkness has become my favorite. The story is suspenseful and moving. It is definitely darker than previous Bosch books (which all have an element of darkness to them). What is especially fascinating is McCaleb's profiling of Bosch. There is also much about the Renaissance painter, Hieronymus Bosch and Harry's namesake. Connelly calls the painter \\"a tortured soul, tormented genius\\" and the same can be said of Bosch the detective. McCaleb describes law enforcement- types as being men on a mission or avenging angels, and has determined that Bosch is the later. \\"There was a sacred bond cast between victim and cop that formed at the crime scene and could not be severed. It was what ultimately pushed them into the chase....It had been his experience that those cop/angels were the best investigators he ever worked with. He also came to believe that they traveled closest to that unseen edge beneath which lies the abyss.\\" McCaleb must determine whether Harry has gone over the edge, or not.As I've mentioned before, the only bad thing about my reading Connelly books is that I haven't read them in order. Even non-Bosch books should be read in order, as it would have helped me understand more about McCaleb if I read Blood Work first. There are also some minor characters that came from other books, including The Poet. So I will definitely go back and start reading Connelly's other books--not just the Bosch series."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I really enjoyed this!

He has brought great characters from past works and interjects them into this book. I am very impressed.

However,I did not find the plot as credible as his usual plots...not his best but a fun read anyway."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm a fan of Harry Bosch, so I enjoyed this. I really like how Michael Connelly shows how Harry has grown. He shows all sides of Harry also. This book led me to read Blood Work about Terry McCaleb. It was interesting comparing the two characters, but Harry comes out on top in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"As the title suggests, this is one of the darker Bosch novels.Several novels into the series and I still can't put them down!The crossover with another character/story-line was fantastic. Seeing Bosch from a third person perspective at times was a nice change.The backstory to the title was interesting as well."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"While they are usually intriguing, I have found team-up stories to be generally disappointing. When an author takes a couple of different series characters and puts them in the same book, the result is ofteen mixed; the characters often work well on their own but don't complement each other.With Connelly, however, there is nothing but enjoyment in his team-up of Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch. This is because this is not really a team-up: although both characters are in the novel, they have very different roles; in addition, Connelly does not evenly balance the two; this is really a McCaleb book.In this story, McCaleb is recruited to look into a ritualistic murder; his evaluation comes up with an unusual suspect, Bosch. It doesn't help that Bosch's behavior and comments are not above suspicion, but then again, Bosch has little sympathy for the victim; in addition, he is entangled in an O.J. Simpson-style high-profile trial in which he is the key witness.McCaleb and Bosch have two different agendas in this book. McCaleb's are rather evident, but since Bosch is a suspect, his motives are more ambiguous. As readers familiar with the half-dozen other Bosch novels, we know that the killer is someone else. Don't we? Then again, Connelly is quite adept with the plot twist, so even Bosch isn't above suspicion.It is not essential to have read the other books in the series to enjoy this one (but it doesn't hurt either). Connelly has had quite a string of top-notch thrillers and this continues the string. If you enjoy mysteries, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"An excellent idea to write a book about both McCaleb and Bosch. The two characters are very different and alike at the same time. And it is not really a confrontation. Both guarantee that the story is again very exciting. Connelly has been known as an author who is one of the best when it comes to giving life to very sophisticated characters, and two of them in a book make it all the more readable.But apart from the two individuals the author focuses on a more general problem: a cop who may take justice in his own hands because the legal system has obviously failed. And I do not see any problem with Harry Bosch's being in the center of interest in this respect as we have already seen some of the darker sides of his character in other books. We as readers are not married to this hero and have to keep our distance as to any other person in real life. Anything might be possible.Nor do I have a problem with the fact that McCaleb is watched a bit more closely by the author. He is as interesting a character as Bosch, and, in fact, I would like to read more about him.In contrast to other reviews I feel the courtroom scenes in this book are very revealing because between the lines we can observe the author when he criticizes scenes that show that for quite a few people a courtroom is not a place of justice but a wooden and old-fashioned stage for egocentrics who do not care at all about justice.I, personally, am looking forward to the next Connelly novel. I am sure it will be another thrilling experience."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read. I couldn't put it down. I found the fact that Harry Bosch was a suspect interesting probably because I didn't know he was the central character in Michael Connelly's other books. I love the Terry McCaleb character and found myself looking for more Michael Connelly books with Terry McCaleb. Found &quot;Blood Work&quot; and also read it and loved it. I'd like to see more &quot;Terry McCaleb&quot; books."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I've read a review here that acclaims Mr. Connelly as the best writer that reviewer has ever read (excepting Scott Turow). Well, Connelly is good, but that (semi-easily) impressed person needs to go back and check out the old school before he starts declaring the masters of the field. Hell, even the title of Connelly's new book comes from the grand master of hard-boiled fiction: &quot;The streets were dark with something more than night.&quot; --Raymond Chandler, &quot;The Simple Art of Murder,&quot; 1944. Everyone great stands on the shoulders of giants (and Turow ain't no giant)."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"With each novel Connelly writes he continues to prove he is amoung the elite writers of the genre. His prose is flawless as is the character development. Darkness is a book very hard to put down once you start (I was up most of 1 night ). I thought it was a nice touch how Connelly weaved together characters from his previous novels, and still keep them in believeable roles. The only reason I give the book 4 stars is I was able to solve the mystery about 100 pages from the end. But this novel is still WELL worth the read."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A bizarre torture killing brings together two series detectives, retired FBI serial-killer profiler Terry McCaleb (&quot;Blood Work&quot;) and the brooding LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch.Ritualistic elements in the murder of a sadistic drunk, trussed up so as to slowly strangle himself, prompt LAPD detective Jaye Winston to consult McCaleb, whose heart transplant forced his retirement. McCaleb's immediate and intense focus on the case threatens his tranquil Catalina Island idyll as new father and husband. His wife, Graciela, views his work as inviting darkness into their lives, while McCaleb sees it as a crusade against darkness.Bosch's attitude is more sardonic. Having once arrested the victim for the murder of a prostitute but unable to make the charge stick, Bosch would as soon congratulate the killer as arrest him, an attitude which reinforces the horrifying profile McCaleb is compiling. The artfully constructed murder scene points to Bosch himself, whose motive - vigilante justice - is plain.The prime witness in another murder case - an arrogant Hollywood producer accused of the murder of an aspiring young actress and suspected of another - Bosch spends his time tracking down reluctant witnesses and shoring up the prosecution's shaky case. Alone and cynical, it's almost possible to believe he's crossed the line into darkness.Though intricate and diabolical, the plot is ultimately incredible. But this takes little from the reader's enjoyment. Connelly's attention to forensic detail, character and setting, his well-developed portrait of depravity and his assured writing successfully drive the story, no doubt to Connelly's next stop on the bestseller list."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Harry was more of an extra in this story. This novel was more of a Terry McCaleb story. While it was good, it was not exactly as billed."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I really enjoyed this book even though I thought it had a slow start. Harry Bosch really showed his stuff."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Really a good book. Exciting, held my interest through first page to the last page. Bosch is strong and then shows he weaknesses."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have read a few Michael Connelly Harry Bosch books. I cannot say I am a great fan. But this finally just turned me off. The secondary hero, McCaleb, is supposed to have been an FBI profiler. Makes you wonder, when he suddenly decides that his friend, or at least long time colleague Bosch has turned into a bizarre killer.This McCaleb is an idiot in other ways, or I guess Michael Connelly has never checked on baby behavior: McCaleb has a 4month old child that needs almost hourly feedings through the night. This is utter nonsense. Not even a newborn needs hourly feedings at any time, much less a 4month old one. A doctor should be called, for the parents!Way too much boring filler in this book."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I agree with other reviewers, that, to appreciate Connelly, you need to go back to the beginning &amp; read his books in order. For airport shop readers, that's not good news, but if you consume books like wildfire, you're always looking for a series to last you a few weeks.Both Harry Bosch &amp; Terry McCaleb return in this novel, and although it is great to have Terry back, it is truly Harry Bosch that withstands the test of Connelly's skill in developing a character. We see Harry at his most poised, in the courtroom, and at his most influential - when he turns the tide for McCaleb and sets the two of them on a path to resolve the newest crimes to dot the much maligned LA landscape. The tie in to Harry's namesake, the frightening artist Bosch, is worthy of Michael Crichton. In concluding the book, the reader realizes that it has not been a great &quot;mystery&quot; just a fully absorbing read of profiling and the constant rollercoaster changes that arise in solving a crime.Personally, I know that I've had a great read when I walk around the house all evening, from task to task, carrying the book with my finger in the place I stopped - so I can gulp a few more paragraphs between tasks. In this, &quot;Darkness&quot; did not disappoint, and Connelly keeps me looking forward to his next plot invention."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly has combined two fascinating heroes from past books in a suspenseful novel that keeps you up until you reach the end. Terry McCaleb who received a heart transplant and is on disability, has been spending his days waiting for fishing charters. His wife, Graciela, from his book Bloodwork, has given him a new baby daughter that he is enamored with. However, when Jaye Winston from the Sheriff's Department shows up to ask his help in solving a murder that is getting colder and colder, Terry can't wait to get into the &quot;book.&quot; At the same time Harry Bosh is the key witness in a sensational trial involving David Storey accused of killing a date after consensual sex and then trying to make it look like sucicide. How the two cases meet and put Harry nearly on the wrong side of the suspect list is the heart of the storey. Just read it!As an interesting aside, there is a minor character in the book that is the central character in a Michael Connelly short storey published on the internet. While I printed it out to read and found the writing just as good as expected from Connelly, I was disappointed in the story. Probably I just prefer the fleshed out longer pages of a full size Connelly novel, and I will look for the next one. At the end of A Darkness More than Night the relationship between Bosh and McCaleb appeared to be terminated, but anything is possible with fiction. I hope they come back to work another case."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A fantastic book. Connelly remains at his riveting best -- an enthralling read, finished in one session. I've been a fan of his for a long time and he is never off the mark. But this is better than Void Moon and Blood Work, getting up to the brilliance of the Black Ice and Concrete Blonde. Thoroughly worthwhile. (And good to see that we have the drop on the US from all the way here in Sydney; the book's been out here for a while :-)"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I have read all of Connelly's work. He has got the &quot;pulp mystery&quot; down as far as style. He is unevem on plot, though. Sometimes this means a complete surprise ending involving characters that were not even relevant until the last 20 pages -- clueless (to the reader) perpetrators, in a sense. &quot;Darkess&quot; is the opposite. The readers knows who did it within the first 30 pages and also knows that the leading suspect throughout the book is not the guilty one. So disappointing to know so quickly where things are going and then read on to discover you were right. A good effort with a majoy weakness."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"When I was a young boy, the comic book business was at its hey day. You could buy a Giant comic on The Lone Ranger, one or two on the Green Lantern, one on Superboy, and get change from a dollar. At some point, the comic powers to be determined it would be more profitable to channel the virtues of the super heroes together. How hard would this be to believe? Not only did we live in a world with a Batman and his androgenous sidekick, his homeboy was Superman! And eventually, the three of them hooked up with Captain America!The end result was, it didn't work. The heroes had certain virtues that when juxtaposed against ultimate evil, shone even more brightly. When they worked together, they seemed kind of silly.That's what I found to be the case with A Darkness More Than Night. Connelly is a first rate author. There is no doubt about that. His Harry Bosch quartet, The Black Echo, The Black Ice, The Concrete Blond and The Last Coyote are first rate literature comparable to anything written by Chandler or Parker or Crais. The Poet, for other reasons, introduces Terry McCaleb and in it's own way, excels. Angels Flight, ditto. Void Moon, ditto. But in all those cases/stories, the hero lives and dies by his own wits.In this case, we put McCaleb and Bosch together, and frankly, both end up the worse for wear. McCaleb makes an enormous mistake that one has the feeling a first year profiler wouldn't make. Bosch, on the other hand, comes off seedy, almost like a second rate gumshoe out of Spillane.Additionally, I am beginning to find it tedious that all profilers are looked upon by their spouses as having to descend into the caverns of Hell in order to pay the rent. John Sandford does this in his Lucas Davenport series. Susan is always trying to talk Spenser out of matching wits with the bad guys, because somehow, I guess, it changes them and maybe, we are led to believe, in a parapsychological sort of way, the men they love will never come back.Come on. This is Starksky and Hutch schtick. This is Chips. Graciela is crying in the dining room because Terry is going back. To where? Earn a living? Keep his job? We don't know, but we hope and pray he will be OK.Finally, the first 130 pages were brutal. A struggle. Trying to get across the street. Swimming against the tide.Skip this one. He's great but I was disappointed."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"\\"A Darkness More Than Night\\" is a book that restores my waning interest in mystery fiction. The plotting, pace, level of legal detail, and characterization are outstanding. Michael Connelly writes with a gritty, no-nonsense style that makes no attempt at wit, pretense, or flourish. The result is a classic hard-boiled detective tale of top quality.The only problem with the book is that the story's premise starts out eerily similar to Thomas Harris' \\"Red Dragon,\\" in which Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter makes his debut (and which the movie \\"Manhunter\\" was based on). An ex-FBI profiler (Terry McCaleb) with a medical condition (and a family that wants him to stay out of the sicko-hunting business) is approached by an ex-partner (Winston) for assistance in the bizarre, unsolved murder of ex-con Edward Gunn. He takes the case, of course, straining his health and family relations. But from there the story veers from Red Dragon and is quite unique and compelling.McCaleb's analysis of the ritual-style murder scene uncovers hidden clues that connect the murder to 500-year-old paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, whose works depict his vision of hell and the sins of Man. When links to the deceased and LA detective Harry Bosch are found, McCaleb narrows his focus. Then he finds a print of one of these paintings in Bosch's apartment--and a possible motive for Gunn's murder. The case, though strange, begins to look routine and all but solved. But, of course, Connelly is only toying with the reader.The plot is complicated by a seemingly separate high-profile murder case that Bosch is currently testifying at for the prosecution. McCaleb must determine whether Bosch is the actual killer, or the target of an elaborate frame. He must do so before Bosch's credibility is destroyed, ruining the prosecution's case. And he'd better do it before he and a few others get killed for their efforts. This is a marvelously twisty tale. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of BIG ICE."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly's latest is a complicated, twisting and turning face-off between two men. Harry Bosch, a good cop in a bad city...and Terry McCaleb, the ex-FBI profiler that he partnered with a long time ago while investigating an equally brutal murder. Both are excellent characters and their work in this piece is sharp--Bosch is in deep this time, but he seems to work best when his back is to the wall. McCaleb doesn't want to believe that his old friend could be guilty of these crimes, and neither do you, the reader. But nothing's for sure until the last page. I read this book in one night--I could not put it down. I'd reccommend it to anyone who likes a good crime novel."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"We first met Terry McCaleb, the former FBI profiler with a bad heart, in &quot;Blood Work.&quot; In that book, he had recently received a transplant and his health was very tenuous. That didn't stop him, though, from finding the man who killed the former owner of his new heart. This time out he's in better shape and it's a good thing, too.Terry is asked by a former colleague in the Sheriff's department to look into a troubling murder that shows no promise of being solved. McCaleb begins to investigate, trying to understand the killer's thoughts and motivations. He is soon shocked to discover that his profile seems to fit one person perfectly: LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. (For those of you unfamiliar with Connelly's work, Bosch is the hero of six of his books.)Connelly has once again demonstrated that he's an enormous talent. His plotting is swift and gripping, the details perfect, and the characters intriguing and believable. It's amazing that such a normal-seeming writer can create such madness on paper.This book is highly recommended, both for fans of Connelly's, and for new readers as well."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Jaye Winston, detective with the L.A. Sheriff's office has hit a brick wall on a particularly gruesome and grisly murder case, involving a strangled, hog tied drunk with a penchant for hurting prostitutes, so she visits an old friend and collegue, Terry McCaleb, now retired from the FBI's profiling unit and running fishing charters off Catalina Island. Her hope is that he will &quot;volunteer&quot; to go through the crime scene video and murder book and pick up on something that she's missed. McCaleb obliges and soon is hooked, running down leads and making a startling discovery. At the same time, LAPD detective Harry Bosch is up to his ears in a murder case of his own. Movie director, David Storey, is on trial for the brutal murder of a would-be actress and then manipulating the scene so that it looked like an accidental suicide. Bosch is not only the lead detective on the case, but also the prosecution's star witness and is determined to put this guy away and see justice done. As these two separate cases move forward, the lines begin to blur and overlap and one name keeps coming to the top of the list, Harry Bosch..... Michael Connelly has brought back favorite characters from several previous novels and written a tense and gripping, fast paced mystery/thriller. A Darkness More Than Night has it all...interesting and complex characters with strong voices, a compelling and suspenseful plot with intriguing, riveting scenes and enough twists, turns and false starts to keep you off balance and turning pages to the end. Don't start reading this novel unless you have the time to finish it in one sitting, because you won't be able to put it down. Michael Connelly is back and better than ever!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Sometimes, when an author's been around for a while and finally gets a book that hits the best-seller lists, it isn't necessarily the author's best book. But hitting the lists is roughly the equivalent of an Academy Award an actor gets for past performances even though the award is being given for a new movie that's less than wonderful. That is definitely the case here, with A Darkness More Than Night.There are two books here, with two heroes--both featured in previous novels by Connelly. One works, the other doesn't. Harry Bosch has, from day one, been a viable character. Terry McCaleb was viable in Blood Work. In this book, he's absurd. What Connelly posits here is that a very experienced former FBI profiler would make a gaff of such epic proportions that he puts Harry Bosch in the soup. Sorry, that doesn't fly.While McCaleb is busy profiling, the real narrative is happening in the Harry Bosch chapters. That's when the book comes alive and gets interesting. Sadly, Connelly is trying to pull off a double whammy and every time he goes back to McCaleb the book falls on its face. This makes for tiresome reading. It's a plot that simply isn't worthy of the work Connelly's done before. I can only hope that he'll go back to focusing on one hero at a time, rather than attempting to push two into the package for the price of one.The McCaleb part of this book is simply implausible, and therefore annoying. And the title is worked to death; it must figure in the text twenty-five or thirty times. Rather than slogging through this one, I would recommend going back and reading the early Connelly books, where the energy is full force, the plotting is tight, and the characters are up and running at full speed. A Darkness More Than Night reads as if the author had a deadline to meet and was working on only two cylinders. It's tired, not believable, and very disappointing."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have read every one of Connelly's books and this strikes me as the best to date although &quot;The Poet&quot; and &quot;Bloodwork&quot; are masterful. Hats off to the pairing up Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb. What makes Connelly such a singular storyteller is his literacy -- an extraordinary ability to write detective fiction with lofty brushstrokes of intellect."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Having followed Michael Connelly from his very first novel, I am in awe at this; his latest, his best! Watching his growth in his literary carrer has become a joy for me. I have always been intrigued by his characters and story lines, but with his intertwining of characters from several books in A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT, he has produced a slick,heart-tugging freight train of a story. It would be easy just to outline the book. But that would be an injustice. It is imaginative, intriguing and absolutely unpredictable!I invite you take a seat on this streamlined, fast-moving vehicle and then just hang on and enjoy the ride! But pack a few sandwiches first, because you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"By now those of us who are regular Connelly readers reckon we know the character of Harry Bosch pretty well, and finding him suspected of a gruesome murder makes for a jarring but not completely implausible premise. We know already that he can be violent, but could he have done this? Finding out whether Connelly agreed with my answer was half the fun of this novel, which also develops the character of Terry McCaleb, previously seen in Blood Work. With both of Connelly's master creations in the same story, one fears that the plot has been designed merely to be as marketable as possible, but in fact it's as entertaining and fast-paced as any in the series. This far in, the Bosch series is starting to recycle plots as well as characters, so I for one hope Michael Connelly continues to experiment as he did in the enormously enjoyable Void Moon. I don't think this is his best book, but even so it's better than almost any of his competitors."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Many of the other reviews here claim that this is not Michael Connelly's best work, and I have to agree. That it not to say it is a bad book, not by any means. Connelly is a terrific writer and his novels are not just crime stories but truly literature, not only intricately plotted, but with strong characterizations and a poetic sensibility toward description, setting, and the like. In a sense the problem is that he raised our expectations so high with his earlier work. I just don't think there is any better detective fiction than the opening Harry Bosch quartet (The Black Ice, The Black Echo, The Concrete Blonde, and The Last Coyote). The strength of those books was twofold: absolutely riveting crimes, and Harry Bosch's complex, troubled, but nevertheless fascinating personality. You've just gotta love a cop named after Renaissance painter Hieronymous Bosch, and you've gotta appreciate a writer who respects his audience enough to do that. But this novel, unfortunately, does not quite meet Connelly's highest standards, and it is exactly because there are problems with both crime and Bosch's portrayal. If you've not read Connelly before, read no more of this review and go get those first Bosch books now.A Darkness More Than Night tries to play on Bosch's complexities; his barely pent-up anger, his deep frustration, and his moral need for justice to be done. A killer who had escaped justice is murdered, and former FBI agent Terry McCaleb (of Blood Work) comes to believe that Bosch is responsible. But herein lies the problem--while, granted, McCaleb hasn't read the previous Bosch books and so doesn't know him as well as we do, the reader who knows Connelly's previous work is never able to believe Bosch capable of that. It's as though John McDonald asked us to suddenly accept Travis McGee as a serial killer--impossible! So the reader is left wondering why, when at one point McCaleb acknowledges the possibility that someone is setting up Bosch, he doesn't investigate that immediately. And furthermore, when the denouement comes round, the real killer is no great surprise, nor is his motivation. There are a few unexpected twists at the end. Overall, however, the focus is more on McCaleb than Bosch, and since McCaleb is supposed to be a genius profiler but makes such an egregious mistake, and the true criminal so obvious, the whole is slightly disappointing. I'm still looking forward to his next novel, City of Bones, which I believe focuses more on Bosch."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This was my next-to-the-last third-person Harry Bosch novel and I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't really a pure Bosch novel. However, it WAS good, just not what I expected. The main character was really Terry McCaleb, an ex-FBI profiler with a heart transplant.Of course Harry is in it and has a big part of the story, but the main character is really Terry. I went along with it and through the usual author's plot twists and turns I had a pretty decent time. It took me a little bit to figure out where it was all heading, maybe a third into the book, but I was anxious to see what happened and stuck it out by doing almost nothing else. The ending left me a bit flat, especially with the morality of it. That's the reason for the four instead of five stars. I know my hero, Harry, has done some things in the past, but this time the author implies something I'm not real happy with if it turns out to be true.Otherwise, it was a solid read, kept in third-person with no head-hopping. The narration didn't drag, at least to me, and I found it all kept a good pace. More of a crossover like the Mickey Haller books but this time Harry is more of a plot point than the main character. Still recommended as a good mystery story."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"First, I have to say that I've read other Harry Bosch novels and have truly enjoyed them. However, I cannot even say that this was a real Harry Bosch novel. A quarter of the way through the book, I was bored stiff. During the first 4 chapters, I kept waiting for Harry to make an appearance. When he did, it was a cameo. He did appear later on. This novel may as well have been about retired FBI agent McCaleb and FBI agent Jaye Winston. The Prolog had Harry Bosch, but I have found that most Prologs are an excuse to provide some action with the author knowing that the start of his novel is more than boring.The premise was weak and never got any better. The evidence for thinking it was Harry and the plot was so thin and unbelievable. The life of McCaleb, his family and his pills, was not as interesting as the loner life of Harry Bosch. It was almost like part of the novel was written by a person other than Connelly.I was expecting more of a novel like The Black Ice, The Black Echo or The Last Coyote, but was disappointed. If you are looking for a Harry Bosch novel, skip this one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I love Harry Bosch. I greatly dislike Terry McCaleb, and I can't help myself feeling defensive and incredulous that he actually took up so much of this book with his absurd theories. I thought I was getting the next Bosch book; instead I had to skim through page after page to get past TM and his over the top morality. Ugh! I want to rip that new heart out of his chest. I was amused at myself for getting angry with Connelly -- I realize he is the owner and creater of Harry B -- but I found myself quite put out with him for allowing the annoying TM to get away with treating my favorite character like that.I do not recommend this book, but I do recommend all of the other Bosch books. I'm so glad I found them! Mr Connelly absolutely rocks."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I am reading all of the Harry Bosch Novels, in order. When one is half read, I already have the next one waiting. Michael Connelly has created a fantastic character in Harry. He can be glum, sarcastic, rude and doesn't mind butting heads with authority, but there's just something about Harry that is downright loveable. Anyway, here is Harry, once again knee-deep in trouble.As with the previous Harry novels, I enjoyed this one immensely. I'm already on the next one...look for the review."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I love Connelly's Hieronymus Bosch series. Bosch is one of the most complex and fascinating protagonists of police procedurals I have ever encountered. Each new novel in the series brings new insights into the personality of this fascinating character. A Darkness More Than Night, however, is so good that even the wonderful preceding books in the series (I'm reading them all in order better to understand the development of the main character) pale in comparison. In this novel, we finally get a glimpse into the true complexity of Bosch's personality.There are two plot lines in the novel that converge to deliver a breathtaking finale to the book. Both plot lines are so fascinating that it was impossible for me to make up my mind as to which one I wanted to know the most about. In one of them, Bosch is testifying as the main witness for the prosecution in the murder trial of a sleazy film director. In the second plot line, Terry McCaleb, a retired FBI profiler, is helping a former colleague investigate a murder that looks like the work of a serial killer. McCaleb is also an interesting character. He, however, is far less complex and engaging than Bosch. I believe that the character of Harry Bosch is truly Connelly's masterpiece. His other characters are very interesting, too, but none of them even comes closely to the complexity and the emotional depth of Harry Bosch.Other reviewers mentioned that the mystery was easy for them to solve. I truly envy them their powers of perception. As for me, the novel kept not just surprising me, but actually shocking me until the very last sentence. The novel offers a police procedural, a courtroom drama and a psychological thriller in one book. If these genre are of interest to you, you are bound to love this novel."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This was another great deal I got on Amazon. I read this book in 2 sittings. It brought 2 great characters together and kept you turning the page for more.

A darkness more than night with its courtroom settings was very entertaining"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"As with all \\"Harry Bosch\\" stories this one doesn't dissapoint - I have tried to analyse why these Connelly novels make it difficult to put the book down and I have come to the conclusion that it is not only \\"harry's\\" strength of character but it is also his frailty. He never comes across as being a \\"james Bond\\". Harry endears himself to the reader because he can be Rude,surley, usually unpopular with colleagues and awkward with female company - in short we see him as human and not so different from ourselves.I wait for good things to happen for Harry but they don't seem to and I guess that is the reason for his popularity - he is generally the underdog (like with his bosses and power players etc)and we are on his side"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I just love the &#34;Harry Bosch&#34; Novels and have read all of them (some twice).

After receiving permission to virtually ignore my family, I curled up with this book and didn't set it down until I was finished!! Riveting is too calm a word for this union of Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb...."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Mr Connelly does it again. I've ready all his books and have yet to be disappointed. I just wish this book had more Bosch in it than McCaleb. Harry Bosch is one of the best characters of Connelly's novels. He solves crimes like no other. I won't give away any of the plot, but I definitely recommend. Can't wait for his next novel."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I am a big Connelly fan , but this one is dissapointing. the pairing of his two strongest characters, far from improving the novel, weakens it, as Mc Caleb's assumptions are not believable for anyone who has read the previous Bosch novels, and this makes the ending obvious quite early in the book. I Agree with the reviews which pointed out mostly the same objections; the only true Connelly touch is the revelation about Bosch's REAL part in Gunn's crime. Mc caleb has no dimension as a character and comes accross weak, linear and his domestic troubles are predictable and boring. Bosch should stand alone in the future, he's a fascinating character who can sustain a book in his own right"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Author Michael Connelly presents an intriguing premise: what if retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb (from &quot;Blood Work&quot;) were coaxed into working one more case - and his analysis led him to suspect LAPD detective Harry Bosch (from &quot;Black Echo&quot; and others) to be a murderer? Having both of these complex characters working interlocking cases in an atmosphere of increasing suspicion could make for a great book, but unfortunately here the whole is less than the sum of its parts.The author relies on the reader's recollection of previous books in the series rather than develop the characters, especially Bosch, in this book. The story is told mostly from McCaleb's perspective, though several chapters are devoted to Bosch as he prepares to testify in a trial happening at the same time as McCaleb's investigation. The relevance of the trial becomes clear in time, but it is too bad that a character as interesting as Bosch is given so little to do in this story.As the plot threads begin to come together, the suspense increases and there are some interesting twists toward the end. All in all this was an enjoyable and quick read, but not up to Connelly's usual high standard."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Another Harry Bosch book that was ruined by a terrible ending. - How could Bosch possibly know that the victim would be contacted by the bail bondsman? Plus I hated the implication that Bosch set the events in motion that led to the murder, even though he is a rogue detective in many ways. I want him to remain a good guy, despite his tendency to disregard orders or bend the rules!I also thought McCaleb was a bit quick to suspect Bosch. It never occurred to him that it may all have been a set-up, which would have been much more likely than Bosch being a murderer."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Detective Harry Bosch, like his namesake medieval painter Hieronymous Bosch, has always been aware of life's cruelties. Bosch throughout his lengthy career has exhibited a profound sense of justice and a need to rectify criminal wrongs. Consequently, he has little tolerance for bureaucratic rules that hinder his pursuit of justice and often sidesteps or ignores them.In this latest Bosch saga, he is playing a leading role in the trial of a Hollywood director accused of murdering an actress and suspected of killing others. In a seemingly unrelated affair, retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb is asked to examine a ritualistic murder scene. It turns out that Bosch has been trying to crack the victim, sleaze-bag Edward Gunn, for the last six years over a questionable death of a prostitute, including the night before his death when he was in the city's drunk tank. The murder scene is constructed with any number of similarities to the paintings of Bosch, the artist. From these details and given Harry's obsessions and willingness to cut corners, McCaleb draws the astounding conclusion that Harry is the prime suspect in Gunn's death.The story thus involves the resolution of that mistake, and the discovery that the two murders are related. It seems that the movie director tried to extend his scene management skills into areas beyond the acceptable. Any yarn with the gritty Bosch is not all bad. But the story line is not particularly good, especially the profiling angle based on little more than coincidence and dubious analysis. In addition, other than mention of Harry's estranged wife, Eleanor, there is, uncharacteristically, no female interest for Harry.The book was not entirely disappointing. It is hard to write consistently great books; this one is just okay."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"It is always a difficult thing to do - to bring 2 of your major characters together in a novel. Connelly pulls it off with a flourish.What makes Connelly tick?He does not write poetic paragraphs but his writing is crisp and clear.His characterisation is brilliant. There are no always do-good, super-American heroes in his booksHis plotting is almost always brilliant with just about enough twists and turns. I go crazy with plots that twist and turn like a hairpin bend road - it just seems so contrived. This plot would have been perfect except for the last bit with Harry and TerryThere is always a problem with great writers running out of steam - Connelly seems to have not lost it so far (Looks like Narrows passed the test)The Owl, Paintings and title add to the psyche of the settingThere is something about novels set in LA that has a great feel (like a Western) - from Chandler, McDonald and Connelly continues that tradition with aplombMichael Connelly is without doubt the best crime fiction writer alive today.What more you have in store for us?"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Having read the book just 3 weeks after visiting Avalon, Catalina, I found myself enjoying the book more than I would have otherwise. The book is overall very entertaining, intelligent, and very easy to read. The ending might be predictable but the way the story comes together is quite good. Except for a few minor character/plot points that were never quite explained (spoiler; i.e., why did the apartment manager take the owl to the other building?) and a somewhat over imaginative &quot;profiling&quot;, this is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"In the long series involving his signature character Harry Bosch, Mr. Connelly writes of the darkness found in good men everywhere. Police officers who deal with the worst that society has to offer while trying not to lose their own decency. This novel is no exception and another pleasurable read. If this is your first exposure to Mr. Connelly&#65533;s prose, you are in for a real treat.Harry Bosch is a LAPD detective and is currently involved in an O. J. style celebrity court case. An actress is dead, and a movie director who was last seen with her is on trial for her murder. Bosch knows the defendant did it, but proving it in a court of law under the watchful eye of the media is becoming increasingly difficult.Separately, Terry McCaleb, three years after his life saving heart transplant in the earlier novel &#65533;Blood Work&#65533; is dragged into reviewing the death of Edward Gunn. McCaleb isn&#65533;t an F. B. I. Profiler anymore, having given it up to start a new family and move on in to a less stressful life by doing fishing charters. But when contacted, he reluctantly agrees to review the case and becomes drawn in realizing that there is nothing that he would rather do than find and stop the psychos that walk among us.As surprising links are formed between the case and the court trial, Mr. Connelly examines the fine line between good and evil. He poses the moral question that if a killer was going to be killed by another killer, and it could be stopped, should it? By knowing it would happen, are you responsible? After looking into the abyss so long, when do you become part of it?Like his other excellent novels, Mr. Connelly once again mixes the elements of a strong plot, tough dialogue, and strong characters in his own very distinctive style. While these characters are the ones that we know and love, they are in no way static, but constantly changing and evolving. Each new novel brings about new shadings of the Harry Bosch character as well as others in the ensemble cast. A Darkness More Than Night is no exception to the rule and it will be interesting to see if what is hinted at in the ending is true.If you are new to Mr. Connelly&#65533;s gritty work, I strongly encourage you to begin at the beginning of his series with the novel &#65533;Black Echo.&#65533; Like all his books, his first is filled with the trademark items that make his work so enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"The only book I'd read in the Harry Bosch series before this was City of Bones, and I have to say this is a fair amount better. At first, I didn't even realize it was a Harry Bosch book. It starts with the bizarro ritualistic murder of a sad case loner, which brings an ex-FBI profiler Terry McCaleb into the picture. Just as I was about to sigh and groan at yet another FBI profiler vs. serial killer story (ever since Red Dragon/Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs, why does anyone bother?), the case starts bumping into LAPD Det. Harry Bosch.Bosch is the key witness in the murder trial of a big-time Hollywood director, who is accused of having strangled a nobody actress while having sex. While the sensationalist aspect of the case and trial are pretty clich&eacute;, the details of the courtroom ebb and flow of the trial are quite interesting and well done. Intermingled with the court case, and its various last minute complications, is Terry McCaleb's off-the-record investigation of the ritual killing. His personal life gets a little cheezy as well, as he's started a new life with a younger wife and tiny daughter on a transplanted heart, but can't resist the lure of an interesting case.Saying any more about how McCaleb's case and Bosch's trial are connected might tip the plot away, but suffice to say there's a good twist or two and some deep dark secrets that come to light. I don't know if some of them relate to previous books in the series, but one might want to read them in order to avoid spoiling anything."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"What a strong novel. It never loses its hold on the reader. It is extremely hard to put down even for sleep. Mr. Connelly is a master at keeping you turning the pages.The melding of Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb is both a treat and a wonderful juxtaposition of characters. Can they become friends or will there be enough doubts raised to make them adversaries?I strongly recommend going to www.michaelconnelly.com to get the short story that give you the back story and how Bosch and McCaleb first meet. It's very good insider knowledge.It is not easy to to give a precis of ADMTN without divulging too much. The book does a spectacular job of developing the characters of Bosch and McCaleb.My only regrets are that I read it so quickly and now I have another year to wait for the next one by Michael Connelly; and that I did not reread &quot;Bloodwork&quot; and &quot;The Poet&quot; (as reporter Jack McEvoy joins the cast of ADMTN) before starting &quot;A Darkness More Than Night.&quot;As a solution I reread &quot;Bloodwork&quot; after ADMTN and will do the same with &quot;The Poet&quot; shortly. Then I plan to reread the entire Harry Bosch series in order (one a month) and that should take me to next MC release.I have been fortunate enough to catch Mr. Connelly on three occasions at book signings. He is just as compelling speaking as he is in print. If he is making an appearance in your area, be certain to attend."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Harry Bosch becomes part of Terry MaCaleb's supporting cast in A Darkness More than Night. Although he has to give up much of the stage, it is very revealing for all of us Bosch fans as we see him in a new perspective. As an added bonus, McCaleb is a fascinating character by himself who I would like to see come alive in action again. Actually, I am convinced that Connelly is simply a great genre writer who can make any character interesting. A Darkness More than Night is basically two plots that converge into one of Connelly's typically imaginative crescendos. In the first McCaleb is asked to take a break from his seemingly idyllic retirement from a career as a FBI profiler to examine a case file and hopefully come up with some ideas. His analysis of the crime scene leads him to images of good and evil in Northern Renaissance art that then focuses on the fifteenth century artist, Hieronyomus Bosch, Harry's namesake. An added bonus of this book is an education in the person and art of Hieronymus Bosch. Since Harry Bosch has a history with the victim, he naturally becomes a suspect. Meanwhile, Bosch is involved on the prosecuting team of a nasty trial of a movie director he arrested. As Harry realizes what is going on, the two plots become intertwined with interesting interaction between him and MaCaleb. This reminds me of movies in which two Superstars team (how about Clint Eastwood and Bruce Willis?) up to fight evil. The ending has plenty of surprises, heroism, and also some self-reflection for both MaCaleb and Bosch."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"After reading Connelly's \\"Blood Work,\\" I wondered if he'd do another book with Terry McCabe. Well, here it is, and it's a winner. Terry is now married and has a young child, and is drawn into a complex murder case by his former cohort, Jaye Winston. Of course, Graciella doesn't want him involved, even though they would never had met if she hadn't drawn him into her sister's murder years earlier. Anyway, Terry jumps in and guess who the main suspect is? Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch!!!The way Connelly uses Harry's name is unique and a focal point in why Terry thinks Harry's guilty. Of course, Harry's involved in trying to put away a sleazy Hollywood director, accused of murdering a rising starlet. The case rests on Harry's testimony, as the smug killer confessed to Harry that he did indeed kill the girl.Terry investigates and finds many unusual clues, such as an owl, which leads him to discover the painter Hieronymus Bosch, who Harry was named after. The pictures reveal murders that fit the graphic crime scene, and McCabe is certain Harry may have finally gone off the deep end.The plot moves along and you keep wondering, what in the world is going on? Is Harry bonkers? Is he being set up? And why did Graciella turn out to be such a whiny woman?This is answered and more, and the dark sides of both Terry and Harry are revealed.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I would recommend ALL of Michael Connelly's novels to readers who love Who Done Its, even though I've only read half of his work so far. He has the gift of great mystery writers where the reader gets &quot;hooked&quot; and doesn't want to put the book down until the last page is read. I try not to open one of his books unless I have a full day to finish it having a NEED to know the killer's identity. Often you don't get the real answer until the last pages of the book, in between you get teased with false perps who you believe did the dirty deed!Unlike another review on this book, I have no problem with Connelly using two leading men since they have different characteristic's (i.e. one has a heart transplant that makes him physically weaker than the other), but both are great detectives with a burning desire to get their man. You also get the real life competition scenario between the FBI (retired in this case), and local police detectives.Buy his stuff, you won't be disappointed. We his audience will then only argue about which one of his books was his greatest of the great. Our only fear might be that his latest book will be his last, a real killer for his many fans."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"&quot;Great!&quot; I thought, when I read the synopsis of this book. &quot;Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, together in the one book! This has got to be good&quot;. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. I wanted to cry out in frustration that a book with seemingly so much promise could fall so short. I hate to see a great idea that hasn't been realised to its full potential, but here is a prime example.The story goes that McCaleb has settled in wedded bliss on Catalina Island and is living the type of life usually only seen in television commercials, when an old colleague, Jaye Winston, knocks on his door and asks for his help investigating a murder, all the clues of which point to LAPD detective Harry Bosch as the killer. Has he finally crossed over to the dark side of the law? McCaleb and Winston certainly think so. However, Bosch himself then turns up on said doorstep, protesting his innocence and claiming he's been framed. He wants McCaleb to clear his name.Connolly seems to be showing an increasing predilection for setting his books against the backdrop of a major trial in which one of the protagonists is participating. This is a major flaw in this book as it distracts us from the main plot, and can also get very boring when he launches into the legal minutae of a criminal or civil trial. I was very tempted to skip forward a few pages several times.I loved McCaleb in &quot;Blood Work&quot;, but in this book he comes across as a stuffed up old prune, the kind of person who irons creases down the front of his jeans. Bosch is as irreverent as ever, thankfully, but the Golden Rasberry for Most Annoying Character is won hands down by McCaleb's wife, Graciela. She constantly fights with him about how he is risking his life and his family by helping out with the investigation, having apparently conveniently forgotten that he did the exact same thing for her when her sister was murdered and she asked for his help.A Darkness... isn't a terrible book, but it's certainly disappointing by Connolly's standards. Not as bad as Void Moon, but close enough."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"The talent of Michael Connelly was apparent as I read the latest in this absorbing and entertaining Hieronymous Bosch series. The most mind boggling aspect of this novel in particular, is the clarity and creativity he used to tie in the past stories and characters so that they added to the current mystery and not detracted from it. It is as if he had a grand scheme when he started writing, planning his entire body of work as if it were one novel. He showcases his skill by reprising his past stories as elements for the current case. Terry McCaleb, retired FBI profiler introduced in Blood Work, is asked to review the murder book of an investigation headed by Jaye Winston, sheriff detective who has worked with Bosch in the past. McCaleb's conclusions intersect with a case Bosch has investigated and in which he is testifying. As usual, the reader is taken along with Bosch as he uncovers clues and ties the pieces together with the added enjoyment of recognizing past cases and characters. If you are a regular reader of Michael Connelly or new and looking for a first class &quot;suspenser&quot; a Darkness More Than Night will not disappoint. Highly Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Years ago, plot was the thing in mystery novels. Over the last several decades, authors have relied less on plot and more on character to carry their work. Two current authors who are especially proficient with character driven mysteries, but who also don't scrimp on the twists and turns, are Michael Connelly and William Kent Krueger (see my review of Krueger's Purgatory Ridge elsewhere).Connelly is the author of the highly successful Harry Bosch series and several stand-alone novels. The Bosch books are definitely police procedurals, yet they show Bosch's obsessive character pushing him to bring down the bad guys, and right the ills of the victims. Being a meticulous detective is the method by which he achieves his ends, which to Bosch means, &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;.In A Darkness More Than Night Bosch is the key witness for the prosecution of a man on trial for the strangulation murder of a young woman. At the same time, Terry McCaleb, the former FBI profiler and heart transplant patient last seen in Blood Work, is asked to unofficially offer his take on the brutal, ritualistic murder of an ex-con. What McCaleb discovers are details that lead him to see Harry Bosch as a possible suspect. Once he gets started on the case, McCaleb can't stop and he realizes how much he's missed the adrenaline surge of the chase.The eventual solution comes as no real surprise, but the profiling of Bosch by McCaleb, is an inspired blending of characters from his earlier novels and really carries the book. Connelly is a master at conveying the &quot;darkness more than night&quot; that lives within Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I so badly wanted to love this book as much as the other ones I've read, but I really disliked it. I am currently reading all of Michael Connelly's books that feature Harry Bosch as the main character. Though this was included on the list, I almost wish I would have skipped it. Of the books I've read so far (Black Echo, Black Ice, The Concrete Blonde, The Last Coyote, Trunk Music, and Angels Flight), A Darkness More Than Night stands out as having the thinnest plot and makes ridiculous leaps and assumptions.The main character is from another Connelly book \\"Blood Work\\" and is wholly unlikable. The conclusions he arrives at (based on flimsy \\"facts\\") are ones that even the rookiest of rookie Agents would never come to. I found myself frustrated and continually hoping that the story would pick up, that there would be some sort of redemptive plot twist, ANYTHING to make this book likeable.*possible spoiler*I gave it two stars ONLY because I liked seeing Harry on trial for the prosecution for once. It was fun to see him on the same side as the \\"good guys\\", rather than being investigated by the IAD or being torn apart in court. Other than that, this book was a total disappointment."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This isn't my favorite Bosch novel, since much of it is devoted to another Connelly character, Terry McCaleb, of whom I'm not especially fond. A Darkness More Than Night is well plotted, as are all of Connelly's novels, but far too much space is devoted to McCaleb and his family. That includes his whiny wife Gracelia and their two kids, none of whom adds anything to the story.There are some good plot elements, though, as well as some interesting ancillary characters. One of those is Buddy, a guy with whom McCaleb runs a sport fishing business out of Catalina. And Connelly adds some nice touches to the story, which involves the work of 15th century painter Hieronymus Bosch, for whom the detective Bosch is named.Connelly first introduced his readers to McCaleb in an earlier novel called Blood Work, which was made into a film. That is, I suspect, the reason that McCaleb reappears here, since the film was a hit and Connelly may have wanted to get more mileage out of McCaleb. At any rate, by the book's end McCaleb has managed to get the wife to stop complaining about his choice of career so if he turns up in a future novel we can hope that she'll be a better developed character.Sorry to be picky, but I really hate it when the female characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, and that is definitely what Gracelia is. She spends the entire book worrying about McCaleb getting hurt and somehow works herself into believing that he must choose between his career and her. It's just so predictable and boring.I know that Connelly is capable of writing good, strong female characters (Eleanor Wish, Rachel Walling, Sylvia Moore) so am hoping that if we are forced to meet Gracelia again Connelly will have given her a extreme makeover."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I wish I could give two ratings on this book. One for the writting (5 stars) and one for the reader (1 star) I really have enjoyed the Harry Bosch series of books. I started with the Narrows and then went back and started at book one, Black Echo. I don't have time to sit and read, so I listen to them (always the unabridged version) in my 40 minute drive to and from work. The person reading the is book, however, did NOT do a good job. He almost makes a really good book bad just by the way he reads it. I have really had to work to stay with it --- and had I not listened to several before this, I might not read/listen to any more of these books. Thank goodness I didn't start with these tapes."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly and I've read almost all of his novels (only one more left to read) but, like many reviewers, I have to say that A Darkness More Than Night is one of the author's weaker efforts.The novel does have a lot of the good qualities that are evident in all of Connelly's Bosch novels, notably the dark nourish tone, the moral ambiguity, the insight into LAPD politics, and the accuracy (not that I'm an expert) of the police and courtroom procedures. Connelly's novels may not always have plausible resolutions (my chief complaint with this novel) but the details always seem technically accurate and I appreciate that.But, there are a few issues that make this one of Connelly's less than stellar efforts:1. Sometimes the plot device of having characters from previous unrelated novels cross paths in a novel works but more often than not, it feels like a gimmick. The introduction of McCaleb into a Bosch novel is plausible enough but the use of McEvoy was superfluous and felt gimmicky to me. McEvoy's role is small and could realistically have been filled by any generic reporter character. There was no need to include him in the novel and because his role is so secondary and generic the use of McEvoy was more of a distraction than a real asset to the novel. Generally speaking, combining characters from other novels (kind of like The Super Friends) can be an intriguing novelty but it doesn't usually make a novel any better.2. There is no mystery in this novel. It's obvious who the killer is early on. I don't mind novels where the identity of the killer is known but these novels have a different dynamic. A Darkness More Than Night, on the other hand, doesn't deviate from the \`police procedural format', and as a result, it's a mystery without any mystery. In the end you feel like you're waiting for the characters to catch up while you wait for the inevitable conclusion.3. The novel may be realistic when it comes to the details of police and courtroom procedure but when it comes to the crime itself and the motivations and behavior of the person(s) responsible for it - its just too preposterous to be believed. The plot to frame Harry is outlandish and unnecessarily complicated and the final twist at the end was like a jigsaw puzzle piece that just doesn't fit.Connelly is one of the best authors of crime fiction but this is a marginal effort and unless you are a completionist determined to read all the novels in the series, I suggest passing on this one and picking up one of the author's better novels. There is no shortage of excellent options but you can't go wrong with any of these: Concrete Blonde, The Last Coyote, Angels Flight, Echo Park, The Lincoln Lawyer, Blood Work or The Poet."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm very glad several months ago I decided to read Michael Connelly's books in chronological order. I immediately became a fan of Harry Bosch, an LAPD homicide detective and the main character in most of Connelly's books. Harry's ultimate goal is justice for everyone...great and small...so he truly is one of the good guys...but his means to the end aren't always by the book. This is absolutely the case in A Darkness More Than Night which brings Jack McEvoy from The Poet and Terry McCaleb from Blood Work together with Bosch in a single exciting and drama filled plot. The main character in A Darkness More Than Night is McCaleb but there certainly is a focus on Bosch who is yet again being investigated...but this time it isn't by IAD. I was rooting for Harry all along the way but at the end I wasn't 100% sure I should have been...he may have gone a little too far this time."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Connelly is one of the best writers working today when it comes to the police procedural variety of murder mystery. His best known series features Det. Harry Bosch, but he has a couple of newer series going, too, plus several independent novels. But since all of them are set in Los Angeles, it's no surprise that some of his characters have begun to appear in each other's novels. Terry McCaleb is a now-retired FBI profiler, one of the best, whom we first met in _Blood Work_ (which also was made into a pretty good film starring Clint Eastwood), and who is now trying to run a charter boat service out of Catalina while making it through his fourth year since the heart transplant that was the pivot-point in the earlier book. He's brought in to consult on a case by a homicide detective with the Sheriff's office who's afraid she might have a serial killer on her hands. On his new wife's insistence, and because of his new baby daughter, Terry has avoided such matters -- but it's what he does, what he is, and he deeply misses being involved. Meanwhile, Harry Bosch is just as deeply involved in the murder trial of a Hollywood producer accused of strangling a young actress during sex. Naturally, the two narratives drift slowly together, a process the author handles very adroitly. The details of Terry's homicide case and of the producer's trial will suck you in and keep you up late reading. Connelly is very skilled both at complex but understandable plotting and at painting four-dimensional characters with lots of history. Bosch, especially, knows the darkness almost too well. And the driven McCaleb isn't always an admirable character. But they're both \\"real\\" people. This is one of Connelly's best."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I've always like Connelly's characters--Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch. This was a great joining of the two into one novel.The plot was complex and twisted and unpredictable. The characters are all well-rounded, screwed up and people you want to have coffee with. Hope to read the two of them crossing paths again."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I really enjoy the adventures of Harry Bosch and the way he always springs back from the depths. Michael Connelly's books are well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have spent the past couple of months reading the Harry Bosch series. They have been a great read and very entertaining. Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb are both interesting characters and the result is roller coaster ride with an appropriate number of twists, turns and blind corners."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"As always, Michael Connelly provides an interesting, accurate, and tight story. After reading so many of his works, I feel that I know Harry Bosch. It is a pleasure watching how the man works."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"After getting to know Terry McCaleb in Blood Work, I'd hoped his second outing would come out better than this. He enters into Darkness having shed several IQ points. That he was dumb enough to conclude that Harry Bosch was a brand new serial killer on the rise is a huge liability to McCaleb's reputation.I like learning about Heironymous Bosch, the artist. These details give the faithful readers of the series (who haven't gone out and research the subject) an even deeper look into Det. Bosch's psyche. Like layers on the proverbial onion, Harry is peeled down to the core, giving readers an exceptional character on multiple levels.The undisputed winner in the throwdown between these two sleuths is Harry, by far and away. The more pages Terry filled, the more it seemed like he needed to just stay home with his wife and family.A Darkness More than Night is a pretty good read, especially for Connelly lovers, as it ties up some loose ends left over from previous novels."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"What's interesting about the Bosch novels is that every one has a slightly different twist. The twist in Darkness is the grudging collaboration between two old pros, Bosch and McCaleb. Neither one is a sweetheart - you don't want to cross these guys, and even when they are forced to cooperate, they can't quite become friends. McCaleb strongly suspects that Bosch has slipped over the edge, morphing from avenging detective to vengeful murderer. Bosch is stunned and insulted, and, when he discovers that he's been diabolically set up, incredulous. The two plots - the nasty murder of a lowlife and the sexual murder of a beautiful actress - work together well to make this an exciting episode in the dark and gritty life of Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I don't recall ever hearing about Michael Connelly until spotting a couple of his books in a pile of giveaways. Most online reviews gave him high marks, so I took the thinner of the two first.Connelly moves the story right along, with a fast pace and not a lot of distractions or parallel threads unrelated to the major plot. The writing is crisp and not especially complex, and the characters are fairly sharply defined, even for a reader who had no familiarity with any of the other books. Both Bosch and McCaleb have enough flaws to be reasonably interesting, and I liked their little meeting at the end.I assume that Connelly doesn't make a habit of hooking the story to the painter of the same name in other books, as presumably he can't use that more than once. I waffled on that as a plot device, in that it would seem to be way too much of a clue or too far-fetched for a real scenario. McCaleb fell for the idea too quickly, in my opinion. At least the paintings were suitably dark, as opposed to having some character named Grant Wood kill people with a pitchfork.The reader will grasp immediately that the murders will be related and not just two independent stories to be solved ala CSI. I had a pretty good idea of the basic outcome well before the end. Even so, there was enough doubt in my mind and suspense to keep my engagement.For this new reader, the inclusion of characters from other books was OK, as it feeds the regular fans or people reading the books in rough order. They neither added a lot nor caused too much distraction. As an example, Jack McEvoy could probably have been replaced just as easily by a new character, but no big deal."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I liked the book except for the idea that Harry Bosch could be a killer.

The plot cuts between endless and rather boring courtroom scenes and the plodding of the can't-stay-retired Bloodwork guy. The whole subplot of whether Harry is guilty of murder fails to entice, as you know he's not (even though I guess he kind of is, in the end). And the semi-twisting ending, which reveals an existential showdown between Bosch and McCaleb over all this, is a let down simply because everything else leading up to it lacked sufficient gravitas. Every artist has their low points, and this is Connelly's. He'd rebound and give us the Lincoln Lawyer a few years later, so I guess he (and Bosch) just needed to slow down and catch his breath. Unless you're a die-hard Connelly fan, skip this one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Has a hint of Michael Connelly, however, seems to be written for the female market. All others I've read (everything he's written save one), were great cop-fiction holding back nothing. This story seems like his female editor took charge on a majority of the story, deep character fleshing out, lots of mental drama, little action."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly's A DARKINESS MORE THAN NIGHT is a Harry Bosch novel that also features ex-FBI agent Terry McCaleb. McCaleb was featured in Bloodwork and also in some of the novels involving the \\"Poet\\" I believe. You don't need to read Bosch novels in order to enjoy them, although it might help.This novel is standard Connelly, which means it is really good. While I really enjoyed it, I also found it incredibly easy to predict the plot. McCaleb is enjoying his new life as a married father while trying remain healthy after heart transplant surgery. Ex-Partner Jaye Winston comes to him with a case that she's getting nowhere with and he agrees to take a look. The back cover copy gives away that McCaleb discovers Harry Bosch might be a suspect. Meanwhile, Harry is busy working with prosecutors in a trial for a famous Hollywood producer accused of murder. The book spends a lot of time on the trial, and then the two stories slowly converge.The story structure and the blurb on the back gave it away from me, along with a few other details in the novel. That doesn't take away from the great writing and characterization done by Connelly. He's been one of the best for close to 20 years now. If you haven't read him, try and start from the beginning. All of his novels are really good."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"All of Michael Connelly's books should be read while listening to classic jazz. Connelly himself will clue you in to the artist that he believes would provide the best soundtrack (in this case it is Art Pepper's sweet, sexy sax). \\"Darkness\\" is an interesting mix of police procedural and courtroom drama. Harry Bosch is testifying in a celebrity case and there are complications. An ex-FBI profiler, Terry McCaleb (Bloodwork) is called into profile a bizarre murder of one of Bosch's prey. All roads lead to Bosch. As always, Connelly's writing is suberb. His plotting is exquisite. And his character development sets the standard for the genre. This is a great read!!!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"When the LAPD run into a brick wall solving a bizarre murder, sheriff's detective, Jay Winston, asks her friend Terry McCaleb, a retired FBI agent recently recovered from a heart transplant, to help them out by polishing up his psychological profiling skills and putting them back to work on their stalled case. Edward Gunn, a small-time LA hood involved with the murder of a prostitute was himself found tied, gagged and strangled. McCaleb is convinced that the key to finding Gunn's murderer rests with two bizarre clues - the statue of an owl found in the room with Gunn and the inscription on the tape binding his mouth, \\"Cave Cave Dus Videt\\" or \\"Beware, Beware, God Sees\\" translated from a version of Latin spoken around the time of the Renaissance.McCaleb started his search for details on Gunn's murder with an interview of detective Harry Bosch. Bosch, who had been assigned the case of the prostitute's murder and was certain that Gunn had been the killer, was apparently one of the last people to see Gunn alive. But Bosch can only find time to give McCaleb the most cursory of interviews. His time and his mind are fully occupied as the star witness in the very high profile prosecution of David Storey. Storey, a fabulously wealthy Hollywood producer, is on trial for the sex slaying of a young actress. He's alleged to have strangled her during a bout of rough sex and then staged the scene to make her death look like a case of accidental auto-erotic asphyxia.It's that bizarre owl that's the centerpiece of McCaleb's investigative efforts. Author Connelly leads McCaleb (and this fascinated reader) on a magnificent journey through \\"A Garden of Earthly Delights\\", as it were - a fabulously informative sidebar on the paintings of sixteenth century Dutch Renaissance painter, Hieronymus Bosch. It isn't long before McCaleb and Winston have Harry Bosch in their sights as their sole suspect in Gunn's murder. They've got it figured as Bosch meting out frontier justice because he couldn't corral Gunn within the framework of the legitimate legal system.\\"A Darkness More Than Night\\" is unquestionably the darkest and most complex story yet in the ever growing Harry Bosch canon. Connelly skillfully weaves the story of Gunn's murder into the tale of David Storey's trial for murder and brings both stories to a superb conclusion. But for all the complexity and brilliance of the plot that Connelly has devised, it is really the growing, ever deepening and ever darkening character of Harry Bosch that takes centre stage in this particular play. From his earliest appearance in \\"The Black Echo\\" as a shell-shocked Vietnam War tunnel rat returning to an ungrateful country to his suspension for pushing his supervisor through the glass window of his office, Connelly continues to make Bosch an ever-deepening mystery. Maverick, loner, cowboy, sinner, saint, psycho ... all of the above? How are we to know?A superb addition to the Harry Bosch series. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Ok, I'm a huge Michael Connelly fan. Unfortuantely, I've read his books out of sequence; starting with the newer ones before making my way through the older ones. I thoroughly enjoy these novels and the characters Connelly weaves into each book. I haven't read Blood Work and therefore have no real background on Terry MaCaleb's character. However, it appears that he was a highly sought after and respected FBI profiler. Given this, it was very hard to understand how he named Harry as a suspect. He even had the advantage of having previous knowledge of Bosche from a previous case. It just wasn't plausible and didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I thoroughly enjoy every Michael Connelly book I read. His plots are always complex and satisfying, his characters always engaging. A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT is no exception. It's like a Connelly reunion book. Terry McCaleb, Harry Bosch, Jack McEvoy (each the star of at least one previous Connelly title) along with lesser lights such as Jaye Winston, are all brought together here in a fascinating case.Things get rolling when Winston asks McCaleb to help her profile the killer in a case she's working on. Though reluctant at first, McCaleb finds himself hooked once he gets involved. Bosch, meanwhile, is the main prosecution witness against a Hollywood sleaze-ball accused of murdering a young actress during a sexual encounter. The two parallel plots begin to mesh when McCaleb uncovers evidence that makes Bosch a suspect. If McCaleb's suspicions become public, Bosch's effectiveness as a witness will be decisively compromised.A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT is another great read from Michael Connelly.

The assumption that underlies the whole McCaleb angle seems strained and overly obvious.Oh, and I get the whole light/dark thing that seems to get pounded over and over in Connelly (and primarily Bosch) books. Ok, he served in tunnels and now works in a 'sewer' - its enough already. Not everything has to involve shadings of light...I did enjoy the book as I have of every Connelly I have read but, as good as it is, its still only a four star read."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A Darkness More than Night draws you in on the first page and doesn't let you go until the last. You are drawn deep into the soul of Harry Bosch to view the good, the bad, and the ugly in this haunting book. Terry McCaleb is the perfect complement to Bosch's extremely complex character. He is drawn from retirement to help solve a baffling murder and the trail seems to lead in Bosch's direction. Not since The Last Coyote has there been such an intense Harry Bosch novel."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but (as a mystery reader) I had the outcome of this book figured out about 100 pages into it. I had read \\"Blood Work\\" and \\"Last Coyote\\", so was happily familiar with both Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch as characters, and with Michael Connelly as an author.Despite thinking ahead to the resolution, I was compelled to finish by Connelly's crisp writing about some good, solid detective work. (Even though I do feel the references to Bosch, the painter, were contrived, I guess suspending one's imaginative boundaries allows for fiction in the first place.)For a quick summer read, people could do lots worse than Connelly. And even if you know where it's headed, there are some nice twists and turns along the way to keep you motivated."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I read a number of works by Michael Connelly and all of them were quite captivating. Michael Connelly was always able to combine a good story with an excellent presentation. A Darkness More Than Night is not the best of his works and it is not the worst of them.

Most of society would agree that the killing of Edward Gunn is no loss, but Terry and cohorts conduct a professional investigation anyway. This homicide and others very similar appear to be the work of a serial killer.Terry concludes that the killer seeks vengeance and knows his paintings as the deliberate clues left at the murder scene come from the works of Dutch master Hieronymous Bosch. The profile Terry draws up fits Los Angeles detective Harry Bosch, an associate on previous joint investigations. Adding to the picture is that Harry unsuccessfully once tried to put Gunn away for first degree murder. Has Harry taken the law into his on hands or is a killer so devious and cunning he can manipulate two old law enforcement pros into becoming enemies?Michael Connelly takes his two best characters, McCaleb (see BLOOD WORK) and Bosch (see THE BLACK ICE) and converges them as foes in a serial killer police procedural tale. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action though several references and other characters from other Connelly novels dot the landscape. That technique should please the author's die hard fans, but to many readers this seems more like an over-Spielberg gimmick that takes away from the prime confrontation. Still, DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT is a clever who-done-it starring two strong opponents whose personalities not only shine, but will send readers seeking their previous starring roles.Harrriet Klausmer"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have read most of the books on Harry,but this one was a great combination of two great crime fighters unlike any I have seen before.

Not much to the book"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"&quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; (the title comes from a line in a novel by Raymond Chandler, who was Connelly's inspiration for becoming a writer) is Michael Connelly's 10th novel. Six of the first nine star LAPD detective Harry Bosch; one of the other three (&quot;Blood Work&quot;) stars Terry McCaleb, a former FBI agent forced into retirement by heart disease necessitating a transplant.Although Bosch and McCaleb had worked together before, offscreen so to speak, &quot;Darkness&quot; brings them together in the same novel. McCaleb is happily retired from the serial killer profiling business, making a living from chartering fishing trips around Catalina Island in Southern California, when an LA Sheriff's Dept. deputy friend of his comes to him for his help on a strange murder. (In case you are wondering, the Sheriff's Department is a county agency; it polices the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. Crimes within L.A. city limits fall within the jurisdiction of the LAPD.) Against his wife's wishes, McCaleb agrees to take a look. He comes across a clue that the sheriff's deputies missed the first time, and that clue leads him into a whole new area of investigation that eventually points at . . . Harry Bosch.Some of Connelly's mysteries contain what for me were stunning twists -- &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; and &quot;Trunk Music&quot; come to mind. &quot;Darkness,&quot; on the other hand, proved to be relatively easy to figure out about 100 pages before the end of the novel. Nevertheless, it's still a gripping read. Most of Connelly's books are dark and edgy, but the darkness and edginess are even more palpable in this book. McCaleb's investigation takes him (and the reader) into a very grim Renaissance age painter, the owl as a symbol of evil, and an unnervingly cocky defendant in a media circus trial.One of the most interesting things about &quot;Darkness&quot; for readers who've read the Bosch novels is the glimpse of what Bosch comes across like to someone else. The encounters between McCaleb and Bosch -- not the first one, but the ones after that -- are fascinating and point to the difference between the two men: especially Bosch's &quot;avenging angel&quot; nature.Another interesting thing about this book (and many of Connelly's others) is the way that he weaves in facts and characters from earlier books. Readers of &quot;Void Moon&quot; who wonder what happened to Cassie Black's parole officer (Thelma) find out here. It's just a throwaway paragraph, but it's a nice touch.In summary, Connelly is a consistently good writer, and &quot;Darkness&quot; doesn't disappoint, even if it telegraphs the solution to the mystery a little too early. It's still satisfying to the end."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly is the BEST mystery-thriller writer working today, so it almost goes without saying that this book stands head and shoulders above most others within this overcrowded genre. In *A Darkness More Than Night*, he demonstrates once again his extraordinary skills in terms of weaving intricate plots filled with twists, turns, and early-innocuous-clues-that-become-pivotal-later-on. He also has developed not just one but two extraordinary protagonists, Harry Bosch and Terrance McCaleb, and their &quot;face-off&quot; in this book adds a fascinating dimension to an already fine work. Connelly also does a wonderful job of creating the *noir*, &quot;there is evil afoot in this world&quot; mood/philosophy that pervades his books. The discussions of Hieronymus Bosch's paintings, the symbolic meanings of owls, etc., are absolutely riveting.Given that I've bestowed such effusive praise upon this novel, why four stars instead of five? First, it's apparent that the novel will be appreciated far more by readers who have already read not just one or two but ALL of Connelly's previous works. Yes, it's common for mystery writers to write their successive books with an element of &quot;ongoing story&quot; to the work, including occasional references to events and cases described previously. But Connelly employs this practice so heavily in this book that it almost seems futile for any reader to pick up *A Darkness More Than Night* without having gone through at least a few previous Connelly mysteries.The second reservation I had is one that other reviewers have mentioned, i.e., that although the McCaleb vs. Bosch angle is certainly exciting for all of us who are Connelly devotees, there is a certain implausibility about some aspects of the plot line, particularly in light of McCaleb's own travails in *Blood Work*. Since one gets a clear inkling of where the story is headed, this removes some of the tension associated with how the Gunn case will ultimately be resolved.Am I being nitpickingly negative here? Perhaps. For a writer as skilled as Michael Connelly, we readers develop extremely high expectations--perhaps excessively high. Overall, this is a wonderful novel that leaves me waiting impatiently for Connelly's next work."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"It's double trouble and a double treat for fans of mystery master Michael Connelly when he pairs two of his compelling protagonists - LAPD Detective Hieronymus Bosch ( &quot;The Black Ice,&quot; &quot;The Concrete Blonde,&quot; etc) and Terry McCaleb (&quot;Bloodwork&quot;). The duo serve up surprises and shocks in this tale of murder and mayhem Hollywood-style.Michael Beck, who has read several of John Grisham's classics, delivers a blockbuster performance in this riveting encounter with a movie director accused of murdering an actress. LA is, of course, agog, clamoring for details.The trial transfixes as Bosch, who was the arresting officer, is also a star witness. He goes mano a mano with McCaleb who has a different take on the crime.As the complexly plotted drama unfolds it seems that what may be the conclusion is too outre, too incredible to consider. What a pair of crime busters! What a seductive read! What a bravura performance!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I've read all but two of Michael Connelly's books. I think he's a good writer, and through most of his work, I thought he was a good storyteller. Which is why I was unpleasantly surprised with A Darkness More Than Night.I think this book is a cheat. Connelly presents a flawed premise, pads the middle of the book with a couple hundred pages of filler, and then creates an ending that is no surprise and doesn't even qualify for the term mystery. Connelly is a good writer, but even he couldn't pull this one off.A recurring theme in Connelly's books is the \\"good\\" versus \\"evil\\" situation. He also likes his good guy characters to struggle with philosophical questions about the evil that men/women do and what it takes to bring these people to justice. Harry Bosch seems to fluctuate between good and evil to the extent that the guy is more schizophrenic in this book than he's been in any of the others. I would buy that if there were a good reason to make him such an undefinable character. But in this case, there wasn't a reason like that. For no reason other than Connelly apparently wanted to give Terry McCaleb something to do, Bosch becomes a suspect in a murder. And while lip service was given to the thought that an investigation of Bosch had better produce hard evidence that he did what McCaleb suspects he may have done, it seems to me that everyone had no problem believing that Bosch just suddenly decided to become a cold blooded murderer. Given everything readers of Connelly's books have been led to believe about Bosch up to this point, that just doesn't make any sense. 400 pages of fill doesn't make it any more credible a premise.I held out until the very last page of this book hoping that Connelly could redeem himself with an ending that would salvage something from all the stuff following the beginning. In my opinion, that didn't happen. What's worse, one of the two main characters comes off as a crybaby.The bottom line is that in an effort to maintain his strong sense of good versus evil, Connelly sacrifices realism. He presents two seasoned veterans of crime fighting, and he tells us that these two men have seen it all. So, if that's the case, how does one of them miss learning that life just isn't planted on that naive high moral ground that shows up at the end of the book? When I finished the last page and closed the book, I just wanted to tell Connelly to Grow Up."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is a celebration of Connelly's work so far. He has managed to tie in characters from all his other books. Terry McCaleb from Blood Work, Harry Bosch, the protagonist of 6 other books and Jack McEvoy from The Poet. He makes mention of the incident from which he was serving a suspension in The Last Coyote. Not only that, the assistant prosecuting attorney in the ongoing court case makes a reappearance after being introduced in Angel's Flight. Just for fun, see if you can spot the passing reference to a character in Connelly's other stand alone book, Void Moon.On top of everything else, Michael Connelly delivers yet another powerful thriller, combining McCaleb's profiling skills with the dark figure of Harry Bosch. Two stories are intertwined as Bosch is involved with a high profile court case, and McCaleb investigates a murder. I feel we're treated to the best of all worlds through the combination of all of Connelly's main protagonists.If you're a dyed-in-the-wool Michael Connelly fan, this book will bring back fond memories of his previous works. If it's the first Michael Connelly book you've read, I think you'll find your curiosity sufficiently aroused to go back and read the earlier stuff."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly's newest book, A Darkness More Than Night, features Terry McCaleb and Jaye Winston (from Blood Work)and Harry Bosch in a thriller that will definitely keep you glued to your seat. Be prepared for the pages to seem that they they are flying through your fingers. If you liked Blood Work, you'll greatly enjoy seeing how McCaleb tries to once again see inside a horrifyingly deranged criminal mind. What he uncovers, however, will not seem possible. In typical Connelly fashion, he develops characters, both good and bad, that are very well-developed and ones you'll feel are very real. Further, his plot will keep you engrossed from first page to last. Don't hesitate to add A Darkness More Than Night to your must-read list."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly outdoes even his magnificant reputation with A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT. A cast of characters from his previous works team up for a near perfect mystery. Terry McAleb (Blood Work) is asked by Jay Winston to investigate a grisly murder that looks to be the first in an eventual series. Through his gritty detective work and outstanding profiling his pegs a sure fired suspect.....the problem is that the suspect is the infamous Harry Bosch (Black Echo, Angel's Flight, etc.....). Each piece of evidence points to Bosch and throughout the book the reader is forced to ask &quot;Did Bosch go over the edge?&quot;. All the while, Bosch himself is in the middle of a tedious trial of a Hollywood murder. Other familiar characters in the Connelly world show up including reporter Jack Mcevoy (The Poet). Therefore it may help to have read previous Connelly novels to gain the full efect of this work.The book is a non stop piece of intrigue. Once picked up it beckons the reader to keep going until the masterful ending. There are no dull moments and the characters of Bosch and McAleb feed off of eachother. There are bad guys worthy of your spite and good guys with the weaknesses that are a Conelly trademark. Is Bosch a fallen heroe? Has McAleb missed the mark on this profile? Will the killer strike again? All of these questions run through the course of the brilliant five star fiction."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I discovered Michael Connelly last summer and tore through his Bosch series in a couple of weeks. It quickly became one of my favorite detective series. I had read The Poet prior to these books and finally made the connection. I was a little worried when I got to Blood Work and Connelly departed from good old Hieronymus and took up with Terry McCaleb as his protaganist...but the storyline with the detective investigating the murder of the donor whom he received his heart from was too delicious to pass up. Now, in A Darkness More Than Night, Connelly makes the brilliant move of pairing these two characters up in more than just the passing manner of prior stories. Even Jack McEvoy from The Poet makes an appearance. The strength of this book is web of characters and events that fans will remember and enjoy. If you haven't read Connelly before, you might enjoy this book even more by starting the series from the beginning (The Black Echo) and watching the pieces fall together...but I suppose you could read this book alone and still be gripped by the storyline. The plot is yours to discover, but I will say that the darkness that seems to seep into my favorite detective makes the possibilities suggested by the twisting discoveries of McCaleb more than a little disconcerting. This is a guaranteed hit."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I read about 40-50 mysteries a year, and Connelly's works have quickly become some of my favorite reads. In his newest novel, &quot;A Darkness More than Night,&quot; I especially like the way he combines his primary series character (Bosch) with Terry McCaleb, his hero from but one novel. I've often wished that more writers had the guts to do this, and Connelly pulls off the melding of his hero (McCaleb) and anti-hero (Bosch) beautifully. If you've yet to read any of Connelly works, I'd recommend going back to the beginning of the Bosch series, reading them all, and reading the one work with McCaleb. Though this is not a necessity, many earlier books and characters are alluded to in this latest work. Not only does Connelly manage to present an intriguing case to be solved, it is his knowledge of police work and the court systems are what really make his novels awesome. His stories have a way of sucking you in, making you care for his characters, and wanting to see justice done. Connelly is as good and better than most all that are out there now, and this latest novel is marvelous."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is a review and a rating which I give very reluctantly.Michael Connelly is one of my favourite authors of popular fiction. He has updated the classic police procedural novel and, in the form of his protagonist - L.A.P.D. detective Harry Bosch - contributed to the genre of hard boiled detective fiction. In recent years, Connelly has branched out - introducing readers to different characters, such as the intriguing Terry McCaleb, former FBI profiler and heart transplant recipient.Hence, when I heard that Connelly was writing a novel involving both Bosch and McCaleb, I looked forward to reading it and anticipated another Connelly classic. &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; has a lot of the elements I enjoy about Connelly's writing - a rough edge to the plot, extensive use of police procedure and a setting which, in my opinion, cannot be matched -the den of iniquity which is modern day Los Angeles (Connelly is wonderfully effective at evoking Los Angeles and all its quirks).Nevertheless, I finished this book somewhat disappointed. It revolves around McCaleb's suspicions that Detective Harry Bosch has turned from rogue cop to bad cop - exacting revenge on individuals who the justice system failed to punish. Nevertheless, I found myself predicting the ending (accurately) within about the first 30 or 40 pages of the book. Readers do get further insight to the character of Harry Bosch but the use of McCaleb seems almost spurious. Connelly's use of Terry McCaleb as a character in his novel &quot;Blood Work&quot; worked because the plot of that novel revolved around McCaleb's heart transplant. Here, that special element of his character falls away and we are left with something quite one dimensional. Sadly, as the book progressed and the ending became more and more apparent, I found myself reading for the sake of finishing rather than for the sake of savouring the story.Michael Connelly remains an excellent author but he probably needs to stick with what he does best. Rather than trying to intertwine his various characters from previous books (there are cameos from characters in other Connelly novels as well), he should focus on developing the character of Harry Bosch - rogue cop - as well as creating new characters just as interesting and intriguing as those from his previous books. Connelly fans will certainly want to read thisbook but those who have never read his books before should try &quot;The Poet&quot; or &quot;The Last Coyote&quot; first rather than be disappointed. My own choice would be to give the book a rating of only 2 1/2 stars but I will give Coonnelly the benefit of the doubt and round that up to 3."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I've read almost all of Michael Connelly's work and I consider A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT to be the weakest of the bunch so far. Don't get me wrong -- Connelly is a terrific writer, and this book is certainly an above-average crime novel. But it falls way short of the greatness of your typical Connelly book.This novel had a lot of problems. The plot of A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT is largely implausable, and worst of all, not very thrilling. The villains in this book are so arrogant and nasty that I found them cartoonish. This is also the only Connelly novel where I found the plot predictable -- I predicted most of the twists before they occurred. In short, I was disappointed. Only Connelly's fine writing and good pacing saved this book in the end for me.Lastly, don't make A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT your first Connelly book! This novel liberally uses characters and situations from prior Connelly books -- THE LAST COYOTE, THE POET, and BLOOD WORK. Reading this novel, in my opinion, will spoil these earlier novels, which in my opinion are far superior to this subpar effort."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"After two weaker efforts, Angels Flight and Void Moon, Connelly is back with a vegenance here (in more ways than one). The story is tight and very noir. This is not happy story for either bosch or terry. It probes motive and explores the pysches of both burdened men. It has the usual brillant touches--a paragraph where Bosch sees Thelma from Void Moon going back to work--and a note about selling the TV and Movie rights to Blood Work. Jack McEvoy is here and still a bit sleazy (although his sleaze factor is no where near that of earlier reporters in this series). A bit outlandish at times, but overall a wonderful book that explores motives and behaviors of the good guys."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This seventh installment in the Harry Bosch series includes a character from one of his out-of-series books. An excellent character from an excellent book (they made a movie out of Blood Work with Clint Eastwood). In this book, the character collides with Harry Bosch, with extremely unpleasant results. Don't get me wrong, this is a terrific read. But I did not enjoy seeing two &quot;good guy&quot; characters duke it out. Each character was great within their own stories, and I would have preferred a collaboration rather than a collision in a cross-over book like this. Oh well.Still, this is a great read; I recommend it to any fan of the genre."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"In A Darkness More than Night Michael Connelly combines two of his greatest characters, Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb. In this book, you're not sure who you like more.In an ironic twist of fate, Bosch is the main suspect in a murder that McCaleb is investigating as a favor for an old friend. And if that weren't enough, Bosch is in the middle of an important trial, where his testimony could make or break the case and puts the responsibility of a killer punished or set free on his shoulders. With two suspenseful stories playing out, with characters we know and love, this book proves yet again Connelly's talent for writing. As of yet, I haven't been able to guess an ending yet- he keeps you on your toes!I enjoyed this book, as I've enjoyed all that came before it from Connelly. The only thing that was a little strange, was that it seemed Connelly had a hard time juggling the two characters and giving them equal time in the book. In a book that is considered part of the &quot;Harry Bosch&quot; series, it really was more about McCaleb and that left a little of a bad taste in my mouth. Even though I enjoy both characters, Bosch is still my favorite and I was looking forward to a book that again, focuses more on him and I didn't quite feel I got that. However, that's the only let down, BUT surprisingly, I did begin enjoy getting to know McCaleb more and more through out this book. I do hope Connelly writes another one featuring him, I just think it might be better though to keep the two characters separate and give them each their own stage."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite detective novelists, right up there with Robert B. Parker, Jeffrey Deaver, and Sue Grafton. I think he's most comparable to Deaver, because they both specialize in interesting plot twists that keep you guessing, but Connelly is also good at compelling characters, interesting locales, and smart dialogue. Unfortunately, the plot here isn't up to some of his other books, but the rest of the ingredients are still present, and Connelly's a good enough writer that when he's a bit off, it's still a good book.The book starts with the hero from Blood Work, Terry McCaleb, being asked by a friend to look at a homicide \\"book\\" for her. This is the combined file that detectives keep on a case, and in this instance she's hoping he sees something she hasn't. She thinks the case is the first in a series of murders, and wants to get a jump on the killer. McCaleb is intrigued, and quickly develops a serious suspect: Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch, the hero of Connelly's series of detective novels (he's been in six previous books) and a dedicated if a bit obsessed LAPD homicide detective with a very dark past. McCaleb works the case with various hindrances (a friend who may be spying on him, his medication for a past illness, his wife's concern for him, meddling reporters and other cops) and wavers between suspecting Bosch and others. This is the weakest part of the book: one reviewer said he guessed the ending about 100 pages beforehand, but I had it about halfway through.Connelly's strength is his characters and atmosphere, and they're both in evidence here. Bosch and McCaleb are fun to watch together, the bad guys are so evil they're fun, there's a typical sleazy lawyer, and so forth. The characters eat at Musso & Franks, In and Out, and so on, and move around recognizable locations in LA, which is fun for someone who lives here. Connelly used to report for the LA Times, and you can tell he knows the city pretty well. All said, while it's not his strongest plot, it's still worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"\\"A Darkness More than Night\\" has several prominent aspects.First, it's a character study. Connelly for the first time describesHarry Bosch from the perspective of another primary character, Terryfrom Blood Work, contrasting it with Harry's view.This allows observations of Harry thatwouldn't be possible from the conventional first-person ofprevious Bosch novels. Additionally, the presence of Terry allows acontrast of two very different characters. The risk with having twoprotagonists is their characteristics will tend to merge, both takingon those of the author. In the case of ADMTN, Connelly does a solidjob of maintaining the distinct identity of each. In addition to themulti-perspective view of Bosch, there is a similar \\"study\\" of Terry,although Connelly fans have more invested in Bosch to date.Second, it's a study in the descent into darkness. From his days inthe tunnels of Vietnam, through his time with LAPD, Harry has beenimmersing himself in both physical and metaphorical darkness. Thenovel considers the effect of that prolonged exposure. Sure, it's anold theme (Luke's struggles with the Dark Side), but worth revisiting.Third, it's a courtroom drama. Many have criticized this aspect of thebook. It's a matter of taste -- I really enjoyed the court scenes,providing insight into the legal process with a Los Angeles spin inthe Court TV age. One of Connelly's great successes as a writer is heis able to capture the flavor of Los Angeles in a way most authors areunable to grasp. Chandler, Parker, Sandford, --- through their eyes,LA is a featureless, generic, list of place-names. Connelly gives itlife.And then there's the Hollywood theme. Connelly describes the powerwielded by producers -- desperate actresses struggling fortheir professional lives, willing to do anything to expose themselves(pun intended) to those in positions of strength. In a worldwhere success isn't necessarily due to merit but insteaddue to prior success, the stories of those trying to make theleap to the inner circle are compelling.All the parts are strong. Is it a classic of the genre, a masterpieceor signature work? Not quite, so it doesn't rate 5 stars. I almostdrop it to three, due to what I consider a rather contrived plot,especially involving the film producer. But then what can one expectfrom a professional contriver, as film producers are?So I'll give it four. Read the book -- if you enjoy courtroomdialogue, at least, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Connelly has done it again. Another very, very good book. This one is as much about Terry McCaleb as Harry Bosch. Terry is asked to come help find the killer of Eddie Gunn. Even though Terry is supposed to be retired he agrees to help. Guess who all the evidence points to? Yes, Harry Bosch, did Harry really kill Gunn? To prove he did not, Harry only has a few days to find the true killer. The book will hold your attention. You will not want to put it down until the end. I could gladly slap the face of Jack McEvoy, the reporter, but Connely can write so you feel that way about a character. If you like a good mystery you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I am a Harry Bosch fan, and Michael Connelly has written some of the best detective stories I've ever read. &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot;, &quot;The Black Echo&quot;, &quot;The Black Ice&quot; - I found were all exceptionally gripping and kept one turning pages. &quot;A Darkness more than Night&quot; is good, but I would have preferred more of the old Harry Bosch and less of Terry McCaleb.

Terry McCaleb, the ex-FBI profiler from &quot;Blood Work,&quot; is an important element here, because he helps the reader explore Bosch's character without forcing Bosch to lose any of his morose uncommunicativeness.

Like we couldn't all see that the killing was a setup by the defendant in that case.But the most unbelievable was the suggestion that Bosch allowed the first guy to get killed, a. because he deserved it, and b. to catch the guy that was on trial. Both scenarios are out of character for Bosch who has always lived by the motto \\"they all matter or none of them matter.\\"I guess I'm giving it two stars instead of one for the reason that he at least kept Bosch and McCaleb active and united in the end to solve things. Not a really good reason I admit.It appears that Connelly got an advance and had to write a book to justify it. So he churned out this sub par performance. Good thing I only paid $2.00 used."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This was the first book by M. Connelly that I picked and I have to say that if the author is indeed as good as they say then I probably should have chosen his other title.I gave two stars because I think the author writes a good prose. The book is readable.As far as plot is concerned, it is simple but weak. It is hard to show what I mean without giving away a story. But frankly, if someone told me in advance what to expect, I would have only said 'thank you' and picked something else to read.Some folks refer to twists and turns in the plot and I have no idea what they are talking about. What twists and turns???Warning... what follows may be a spoiler.........We have this super ex-criminal profiler, who apparently lives and breathes only when he works. He's been doing this for a loooooong time. So he is an expert in profiling a criminal. He studied the crime scene, made couple inquiries and wholaaa.... he's got a suspect. The crime scene construction was suppose to lead to the name of the \\"killer.\\" Which it did. But even I, who understands nothing about the profiling, know that there is not one killer on earth who would committ a crime and provide clues to investigators that spell out their name (THEIR FULL NAME!!!). Oh, but our 'expert' thought that this was ok. And you don't have to be too smart to guess that he was, of course, wrong. I knew it from the moment he named a suspect, but our expert did not realize it until way later into the book.This plotting is what killed the book for me. Very sloppy and I cannot believe M. Connelly sold it to publishers. No first timer would get anywhere with this kind of plot.Something else stood out..... According to M. Connelly cell phones only chirp. In this novel they did every other page (ok, almost every other page). If you decide to read this book you'll know what I am talking about."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I did not know what to expect I had never read a Connelly novel before. The person who had recommended the book to me told me that the author had drawn characters into the story from his past books. I feared something akin to a bad high school class reunion. McCaleb and Bosch. Knowing that the author had written about two these guys in the past I worried about the back-story that I did not have. \\"You like fast paced mysteries,\\" my friend said. \\"I like Nelson DeMille,\\" was my reply. \\"I don't like class reunions. I don't like jumping into the middle of something.\\" So with some reluctance I read A Darkness More Than Night. The book was good.

Without a doubt this is one of the best plots I have read in a long, long time. While this is the first Michael Connelly book I have read it won't be the last. In fact I'm going to buy a couple of more right now."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I enjoyed Terry McCaleb's character far more in this book than in &quot;Blood Work.&quot; Mr. Connolly does a spiffy job of taking us through the profiler's logic and thought processes, and he somehow manages to keep track of minutiae that would send most authors screaming for Prozac. The only flaw that I see in this book is an arguable one: This was really a McCaleb story, far more so than a Harry Bosch story. And the fact is, for me, Harry remains a far more intriguing character than McCaleb. So I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, only because I wanted more Bosch! (For a 5-star Bosch story, &quot;Angels Flight&quot; is the one to read.)"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This book is not the best of Michael Connelly but is a good read, but if you want you can skip the last three chapters and you will miss nothing, the part of McCaleb's investigation is much better than the trial, but this part is also good, if you are a Connelly reader don't expect to much of this book and with that in mind read it."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly brings back Terry McCaleb from \\"Blood Work\\", retired after a heart transplant, to help Detective Jaye Winston profile the murderer of Edward Gunn who killed a prostitue six years before in \\"The Last Coyote\\". Harry Bosch investigated the case, Gunn was never prosecuted, and we know from the prologue that Harry visited him in the drunk tank the night before he was killed.A plastic owl on a bookcase looking down on the murder scene points McCaleb to a Renaissance symbol for punishing evil that was also a prominent part of the artwork of Hieronymous Bosch, Harry's namesake. He and Jaye find a bird repellent business that sells the owls and shipped one to Gunn under the name of van Aiken, Bosch the artist's other name. Harry, in the meantime, is the key witness at the murder trial of David Storey, a b-movie producer accused of strangling his sex partners and making it look like suicide. McEvoy, the reporter from \\"The Poet\\" who is covering the trial with an O.J. like army of reporters, gets a tip that Harry's under investigation for the Gunn murders.There's a lot of great action and, as always, people who suspect Harry, but he stays on the trail, which eventually goes to ex-cop Rudy Tafero, now a P.I. and the bail bondsman who sprung Gunn the night he was killed. The action moves pretty quickly to a Perry Mason-like twist in a packed courtroom. (Storey's lawyer was named just for the line Connelly has Bosch mutter when the bargain is struck, \\"that's all Fowkkes\\"). Of course, even after there is at least one more twist to come.I think this was Connelly's best and particularly liked the way he brought old characters into his plot. Unlike \\"The Last Precinct\\" which Cornwell dragged into boredom trying to tie old characters to a new story, Connelly made it an art form. Whether or not you knew the old story line or character, the reintroduction played smoothly, often giving a Connelly fan the opportunity to anticipate what bullet from Harry's past would appear next."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Very enjoyable book...the kind you can't put down until your done"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I was pretty excited about this book, I mean, Connelly has yet to disappoint me. I picked up Void Moon with much trepidation and loved it, so imagine my excitment when Connelly decided to use McCaleb to investigate another main character of his books, Harry Bosch. Unfortunately, this book did not have much of what I love in Connelly books, including the dark, poetic nature. Much of the reflection done by the characters seemed too forced and I felt that Connelly actually took some bad directions with some of his characters. Added to that was the inclusion of at least one or two characters from every book he has written, which also seemed a little forced. Now, maybe three stars is a harsh rating for this book, but it doesn't stand up to his previous works at all. Still, I will race out to buy his next one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I waited anxiously for two of my favorite fictional characters to be together against crime and I was not disappointed.

Definately a great ride-especially for Michael Connelly fans."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"That Terry McCaleb (of Connelly's earlier novel _Blood Work_) could somehow, even for a moment, suspect Harry Bosch of being a murderer? This is a plot twist that pretty much blows the book apart--if you're even a tiny bit familiar with the Bosch series, this is going to hurt your reading. This twist marks the beginning of a three-book downturn for Connelly, which he's only recently recovered from with _Lost Light_."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"...

The wimpy asides of his detectives make me gnash my teeth, and the awful (even embarrassing) predicaments he shoves them into make you wonder how they ever got to the lofty heights he claims for them.

Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, but this is not up yo his standards."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm a big fan of Connelly (Angels Flight is a classic detective novel) but this is one of his average efforts. I agree with other reviewers that the solution is telegraphed. I also think that the &quot;revelation&quot; about Bosch in the last few pages (McCaleb's last visit to Bosch) doesn't withstand scrutiny. I won't explain why because I don't want to give away the plot but I can't see how it jibes with the rest of the book. Still, I could barely put the book down and it was very entertaining."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"...The book gripped me from the beginning, as being Connelly one of my favorite authors. A very well written novel. 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I was hugely imressed by the first three Connelly books I read...two of them featuring Harry Bosch and the other with Terry McCaleb. VOID MOON seemed a letdown, and I hoped that this one with both major characters would be back to what I expect from Connelly. No such luck.Primarily the &quot;mystery&quot; is very disappointing. You should have it all figured by the time you're a third through. I did miss one element, but the rest was painfully obvious. I was so disappointed that I came close to giving this two stars. However, the characterization was strong all the way through and the climactic scenes made much of the preceding more worthwhile. We're taken deeper within the psyches of each, and the last few chapters sharply define the inner selves of the two main characters.References to earlier novels and brief glimpses of characters we met in previous novels do help keep the interest. I was quite pleased that one character from VOID MOON made an appearance. I think Connelly likes his characters and keeps us informed as to how they're doing. This was fast reading, and not a complete waste of time. In fact, I suspect that foundations were built in this story which will influence future books.I believe that Connelly's fans will want to read this, they should just be warned that they may be disappointed. Those who aren't yet acquainted with Connelly probably would do much better to start back earlier in the Harry Bosch books, and also with BLOOD WORK. By the way, I notice clever plugs for the upcoming movie, BLOOD WORK, in both ANGEL'S FLIGHT and in this one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I like Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels, and I liked this one. It engaged me, I stayed up late reading it, and I enjoyed it.But... oh, are there ever plot problems in this one. The heavy plot machinery clanks and groans. I couldn't really believe any of it for an instant.I couldn't believe Bosch dunnit. I couldn't believe McCaleb could believe Bosch dunnit. And I couldn't believe the REAL criminal would have risked being so subtle setting up a frame. He couldn't possibly have been sure that McCaleb would pick up the clues and draw the right conclusions, I mean the wrong conclusions, I mean the conclusions the criminal wanted him to draw.And, while I have no objection to a writer naming his character after a fifteenth-century Dutch painter (any more than I object to Parker naming his after a fifteenth-century English poet), making the name figure directly into the plot sounds to me as if the writer is running short of ideas.Still, a good read."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Michael Connelly turns in another compelling read in his series. Always fascinating in police procedures and pacing of a novel, the only place this author is lacking is in female character development. In this entry, several women are briefly described as excelling at their jobs, and Graciela is the loving wife and mother, but in none of his books are the female characters adequately developed. Also of minor annoyance in this book is the fact that the author reminds us of every other book he's written that feature the two lead characters - sounds like something a publisher would ask him to do, but for the reader it screams advertisement and was irritating. Nonetheless, this is a great read and this author deserves the fame he's gained."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"When a small time criminal who may or may not have killed a prostitute in the past is found dead, former FBI profiler Terry McCaleb is asked to investigate the case. All leads point to Harry Bosch, the detective that is the fixed main character in Michael Connelly's books. Did he or did he not step over the line that separates doing justice from committing crimes? Harry Bosch is in the meantime busy as a member and star witness of the prosecution team that tries to nail a Hollywood movie maker for the killing of at least one girl.We follow both Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch in their quest for justice. The book is very smoothly written with a lot of action even though it is not always of the &quot;shoot to kill&quot; variety. The solution of the case was obvious after the first half of the book. The way in which it is described is, however, very entertaining making this book maybe not the best of Connelly's work but definitely worth the reading."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"The trial scenes are too much and too long with Bosch sitting through. I have to jump over almost all the tiresome court scenes to get to the next development. This one is with very loose structure with no passion, no tension, no nothing in it. If Harry Bosch keeps losing his edge and becoming a very vague figure like this one and his last several ones, Connelly would lose lot of his loyal fans who have been so craving for his creations. No cigar this time neither for the writer nor the readers. A total disapointment. It might be still readable, but for how long?"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This book was ok but he has done better. I like Terry McCabe but he was better in Blood Work.

However, I am tired of seeing so much of Harry's dark side - I hope the next novel brings hope and even some humor back to Harry."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Harry Bosch is usually chasing killers, but this time he might be the killer. In this installment of the Harry Bosch series, Connelly turns the tables on Bosch for a little bit. But don't worry, Bosch is determined to find out who set him up to take the fall in a brutal murder. Fans of Bosch and Connelly won't be disappointed. And Connelly's pairing of Bosch and Terry McCaleb(Blood Work) is a winning combination!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I love Michael Connelly's many books. I love the concept of learning more about Bosch by viewing him from McCaleb's perspective. I love how the plot races along in this one, where some of his books take a while to gain momentum. But ultimately, A Darkness More Than Night stumbles. ***SPOILER ALERT*** My major gripe is that the basic premise doesn't work. Evil murderer David Storey wants to destroy the prosecution's case by framing Bosch - the key witness - for a different murder? OK, I'll buy that. But he sets up such a convoluted frame that the police can't crack it and nearly drop the investigation, which would have failed to accomplish Storey's objective. Surely there would have been more straightforward - and far less risky - ways to undermine Bosch. Minor gripes - the McElvoy subplot goes nowhere, wasting a great character. Similarly, the Getty art department promises intriguing possibilities that don't get exploited. And we never find out how involved Storey's lawyer was in the frame. Nor do we fully believe that the former-cop-now-bondsman-and-Storey-minion would have agreed so cavalierly to kill to set up the frame; nor do we have reason to suspect the deep bond between bondsman and his brother.Don't get me wrong - this would be a major achievement for a lesser author. But I expect more from Connelly."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I am on the way to reading all of Michael Connelly's novels, and I've rated almost all of them at least a \\"4\\". This one was first rate. Solid plot, lots of suspense, good pacing, credible dialogue and court scenes, and some heart pounding action near the end. The next-to-last scene was a bit of a surprise but just clicked and was consistent with what went before in the story (and in prior Bosch novels). I was uncomfortable with Harry Bosch being once more identified as a potential murder suspect -- poor Harry is always beleaguered by something, but in this case, Connelly handled it well and believably, and didn't go too far down any miscued path without things falling into place the way they should. Harry Bosch is a great character and consistently played, and I always enjoy how he deals with the slings and arrows of being a hard-boiled detective in the City of Angels. Michael grabs you and keeps you near the center of the action pretty much from Page 1. And that's why I keep coming back."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This episode of the Harry Bosch series introduces a new side of a story where Harry is suspected of being a killer in a prior case and the facts seem to support it. The problem is that Harry has too much contact and history with the victim. When an LAPD detective askes a former FBI agent to give her a profile on the case, the profiler begins to zero in on Bosch and never seems to look at others.The story line is one where the reader feels sorry for Bosch as he is being put through the wringer by the detective and the profiler and his past personal history is used to make the case for the murder the detective is investigating. However in an unusal turn the FBI profiler is dismissed from the case by the detective because he is not an official law officer any more since he retired. The detective feels she has to turn the matter over to her boss because it may involve an active police officer. He then calls in the real FBI and Bosch really gets grilled and tailed.In a turn of events Bosch finds the profiler, a former friend and source, hires him to find out what was missed in making the profile that named him as a suspect. The profiler starts anew and then uncovers some information he did not have before which points away from Bosch to someone else. In the final minutes the real killer is revealed and the reasons are explained as Bosch literally saves the life of the profiler and he in turn saves Bosch's life all in the same book ending.I found the ending a bit trite in the way the author revealed the true killer and what happened. It was as all of a sudden the killer appears and is about to do away with the profiler while making it look like Bosch did it thus sealing Bosch's fate with the FBI. But then Bosch appears and saves the day and the profiler in turn saves Bosch when a second killer appears. Not a real good ending for a mystery and I know the author has done better in this series. Still though it is a good book to read and follow along, but as I said not this author's best work."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"After reading my last Bosch in the series, \\"Angels Flight,\\" everybody out there was impressed by it. Well, ok! I wasn't. It wasn't something I enjoyed, and I allowed myself to express my displeasure. After that, I decided to go in the direction that seemed obvious, and that was \\"Blood Work,\\" Terry McCaleb's story. I did enjoy that one. And then it was time to see if the rubber really meets the road for Michael Connelly, to see if \\"A Darkness More than Night\\" was going to be something I enjoyed. I think I can chalk this one up as a favorite!This begins with a confrontation in the drunk tank, and Bosch is doing the confronting. It gets heated. And then we resume the life that Terry McCaleb now leads. He's married Graciela, has a little baby, and he's enjoying family life. But when he gets a visit from Jaye Winston, he knows what his life is still about. That's catching the scum of the Earth, and putting them away. Knowing that something horrific might happen once again, McCaleb gets involved, and gets personal.It gets really personal when works of art becomes involved, and the name Bosch surfaces. Could it really be that this investigator is actually a suspect for the unthinkable? Is Harry Bosch seriously a corrupt cop? The questions fly, and while Bosch is looking to clear himself of any wrongdoing, McCaleb continues to dig. And through it all, Terry McCaleb becomes a target himself.One reviewer said that mystery here is rather obvious, and I can't argue that point. But I thought the story was pretty awesome! I thought Connelly finally has finally outdone himself, and chalked up a read for people who love to read. Even Jack McAvoy has some moments in this. And through it all, Connelly doesn't look stupid while putting it all together. He looks for the right angles, and in the end, Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb both give a hoot! And that's the truth."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"STORY BRIEF:Two stories are being told interspersed. Gunn was found murdered in his home in an elaborate method patterned after a scene from a painting. Detective Jaye Winston is in charge of the investigation which has stalled. She asks retired FBI profiler McCaleb to help her.The second story is a murder trial. A wealthy movie director Storey is charged with murdering an actress and making it appear as a suicide. Bosch is the arresting officer and star witness in the trial. Storey bragged to Bosch that he killed her and that he would get away with it. The confession was not on tape so it's Storey's word against Bosch's.REVIEWER'S OPINION:As I've said before, I'm enjoying this series. This is book 7 in the Harry Bosch series. As I finish one, I go right on to the next one. I'm doing them all as audiobooks, which might mean something. This one is not typical Bosch because the main detective work is being done by McCaleb, not Bosch. We are in McCaleb's mind through most of the story. It was good, but I prefer Bosch as the main investigator, not McCaleb. This book is also listed as book 2 in the Terry McCaleb series. This could be read as a stand-alone, but I recommend reading it after McCaleb's first book \\"Blood Work.\\"Things I did not like:The murder trial story was mostly being done through trial testimony. This resulted in a \\"telling\\" feel rather than \\"showing.\\" So it wasn't the best way to hear a story, but it was ok. I viewed this as a supporting story to the McCabe investigation.I wish the author had spelled out things more clearly at the end. McCaleb accuses Bosch of knowing something and doing things without telling McCaleb. Bosch subtly acknowledged this, but as the reader I wanted more specifics. I wanted to know exactly what Bosch knew, how he knew it, and what he did. The overall story and resolution were good, but I didn't like having to make assumptions.To avoid a spoiler I'm going to be vague here. I didn't see the logic of why McCaleb thought Gunn's murderer was X. The murder scene was made to look like a painting that many people owned copies of or had seen. So why did he suspect one of these people as a murderer? My immediate reaction was this could be a set up or a frame, but McCaleb didn't consider that. The reason I like this series is because McCaleb and Bosch are smarter than I am, but that wasn't happening here. McCaleb's conclusion as to X being a suspect should have been better justified.NARRATORS:I did not like the narrator Richard M. Davidson. His interpretation of some characters came out too arrogant and negative somehow. McCaleb and Bosch weren't as enjoyable because of this interpretation. It made me realize how wonderful Dick Hill was who did the first six books. My biggest problem with Dick Hill was his effeminate gay guy voice for some of the female characters. He did that in the early books, but not in the later books. So he improved. In this book, Richard Davidson used a deep super-gravely bass voice for Bosch which didn't feel right to me. In another scene Buddy was saying something in a \\"pleading whining voice\\" (author's words), but the narrator used an almost arrogant tone for that phrase.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 12 hrs and 33 mins.

Fortunately, A Darkness More Than Night is mostly successful as it features yet another gripping mystery. Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch make an interesting duo in this half thriller/half legal drama. Connelly's careful sense of realism is typical, and that's what makes this one (and his previous works) both intriguing and entertaining. There are, however, a couple of cliches that can be a bit distracting to those who have read numerous mystery/thriller novels. Also, there's a bit of implausibility when the killer is revealed. But still, the entire story is both powerful and hard-hitting.As a Southern California native, the negative imagery of Los Angeles in A Darkenss More Than Night (and the previous novels from the author) doesn't bother me, because I already know that all cities are never perfect (whether it be L.A., New York, Chicago, etc.). But I still love Los Angeles despite its flaws (and the entire state of California in general). But anyway, A Darkness More Than Night is yet another great achievement from Connelly. Interesting characters, fast-paced drama, and a dark and edgy environment make for a fun and fascinating read.Grade: 8.8 out of 10Also from Michael ConnellyThe Black Echo: 7.1 out of 10The Black Echo (Harry Bosch)The Black Ice: 7.7 out of 10The Black Ice (Harry Bosch)The Concrete Blonde: 9.7 out of 10The Concrete Blonde (Harry Bosch)The Last Coyote: 9.3 out of 10The Last Coyote (Harry Bosch)The Poet: 8 out of 10The PoetTrunk Music: 9.2 out of 10Trunk Music (Harry Bosch, No. 5)Blood Work: 8.2 out of 10Blood WorkAngels Flight: 8.9 out of 10Angels FlightVoid Moon: 7.6 out of 10Void Moon"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience?

My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Even though I'm partial to the early Harry Bosch books, I'd still say this is one of the best in the series. Connelly delivers here with a great mystery and a compelling setting. This is not to be missed by fans of his work."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"What can I say, I just found Michael Connolly this year and have already read the first 7 Harry Bosch novels. I know I will finish them all this year."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A well structured and well written thriller. Connelly does an excellent job of drawing the reader in. The clues to the identity of the murderer are well thought out and the story will keep you guessing right up until the very end. A very enjoyable reading experience. The characters in the story come to life and you can't help but get involved in their lives and problems. I look forward to the next Michael Connelly novel."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Harry Bosch is the lead detective in the murder trial of a Hollywood bigwig. Former FBI profiler Terry McCaleb's Catalina Island retirement bliss is disturbed by a Sheriff's detective eager to get a jump start on a murder that looks for all the world like the work of a serial killer. Thus these two Connelly tough guys are united in an incredibly satisfying and literate mystery. Slowly McCaleb's insight draws bead on Bosch, and the dark world spins furiously as both men struggle for resolution.Few writers can deliver a compelling who-done-it sandwiched between commentaries on Dutch painting. Michael Connelly once again delivers a disturbing look into the darkest recesses of human existence. The essential humanity of both Terry and Harry gets in the way of a neat and blameless resolution, and consequently each man will bear deep scars forever. Although these men are not there yet, Connelly makes us contemplate whether the evil that they confront will finally consume them as well."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"While this book was more entertaining than a lot of books out there, it does not live up to the normal high standards set by Mr. Connelly himself. To me the mark of an outstanding book is one in which I feel frustrated if I have to put it aside to do other normal daily activities. This book did not meet that criterion. If the book had disappeared for some reason before I'd finished it I would not have cared much. I too did not find it reasonable for McCaleb a seasoned, experienced former agent to fall so easily into believing the worst of Bosch. I would recommend Connelly's earlier works if you want to read truly excellent writing."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Recently several popular authors have created new characters and moved away from focusing on their original creations.(eg. Robert Parker, Robert Crais) Connelly takes three characters from earlier books and has them interact in this page-turner. We get a very different look at Harry Bosch in this mystery. Connelly's stories are getting smoother, with less heavy handed plotting, with each outing. His books are among the best of the genre being created today. Come into the dark."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have followed Connelly's work since he was an LA reporter, and he just keeps getting better. From the microcosm of several murders that matter little to the grand scheme of the cosmos he has woven a story that engrosses the reader and brings him or her into the grander story of why people are the way they are, how they get that way, and how they can change. The story is gripping, the personal enlightenment invaluable. I thought Blood work and Angels Flight were his best. Now there are three best -- and the rest are still far ahead of almost anyone else."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"On Michael Connelly's tenth outing, he brings his wildly popular Harry Bosch character face to face with Terry McCaleb, the hero of his seventh book, &quot;Blood Work&quot;. Fans deeply invested in Bosch may find themselves a tad disappointed here. He's barely in the first one hundred pages or so, and when the book does begin to focus on him, it's as the perpetrator of the crime, not the crime solver. The story is set up on two parallel courses: McCaleb is asked by a detective friend to add his insight into a case she believes could be the work of a serial killer. The evidence that turns up seems to point to Bosch as the potential suspect. Meanwhile Bosch is the key witness in a huge Hollywood court case ala O.J. that involves a famous film director on trial for murder. Connelly is a great story teller. His books are like watching an edge of your seat thriller. And that's what was missing for me here; the thrills. As a reader and someone who loves the character of Harry, I found it hard to ever believe he could be capable of what McCaleb believes he could do. I also, for the first time in one of his books knew where it was going and figured it out. I then just wanted to get to the end to see how it would play itself out. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a bad book. It's certainly not boring. I just think he's managed in all his other books to achieve a level of tension and psycholgical sparring that was all but a veneer in this one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have enjoyed other Connelly books (I would give Brass Verdict 5 stars) but this book makes leaps of judgment from scant evidence. Try other Connelly books, but pass on this one."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Having read all of Michael Connelly's books, some of them more than once, I was looking forward to this one because he was teaming his characters McCaleb and Bosch for the first time. What I didn't know was that he'd come up with the ludicrous idea of having McCaleb think Bosch was guilty of murder, perhaps even being a serial killer! Those of us who've read this series know Harry Bosch has got a lot of flaws, but deep-seated psychosis isn't one of them. So, the book just didn't ring true for me and completely lacked any suspense. Bosch and McCaleb would've been better served if Connelly'd had them tracking a serial killer together, instead of Bosch trying to prove his innocence. Plus the references to Connelly's other books (Poet and Void Moon) were disconcerting. Reread The Black Echo or The Concrete Blonde and hope Connelly returns to form with the next book."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm a great fan of Michael Connelly's and would recommend the Harry Bosch books to anyone who likes a good detective novel. It's obvious that Connelly has read Chandler and read him closely, and while he can't reach the heights that Chandler did, Connelly gives Hollywood a dark and tawdry glamor. Bosch is an interesting character, sometimes traced back to \\"Dirty Harry\\" Callahan, but Bosch has been enriched and rounded out over the novels that precede \\"A Darkness More Than Night.\\" Bosch is willing to break all the silly procedural rules and he's dogged in pursuit of the truth, but from the beginning a reader knows there's no real cruelty in Bosch. Anger, yes; impatience, yes; short-sightedness, yes. But no real cruelty.So anyone familiar with the earlier Bosch books would have trouble accepting the premise that Harry has crossed over to the dark side and taken to executing criminals. Anyone familiar with the reputation of Terry McCaleb, master profiler, would have trouble accepting the premise that McCaleb would easily embrace the idea of Bosch's transformation. Yet that's precisely the situation that we're faced with in \\"A Darkness More than Night.\\"Speaking for myself, I didn't find McCaleb that interesting in the earlier \\"Blood Works,\\" and I was less impressed with him here. McCaleb is almost as whiny as his wife, Graciela. Glad to see the new heart's working out, but it's hard to believe this man was ever a crack FBI agent. Perhaps the immuno-suppressive drugs have eroded McCaleb's intuitive capabilities.So--this book has too much meandering McCaleb and not nearly enough Harry. The ending, too, with a moment of weak-kneed insight for each major character, is no way to end a hard-boiled police procedural. Connelly's weaker offering is still better than the average writer's best. But I hope in the future he leaves McCaleb parked out on Catalina and gets Harry back on the streets of Hollywood."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Like the last 5 of Connelly's I've just read, this one is wonderfully brilliant as well. This guy Connelly is a flipping genius. Not only is his writing smooth and fast-paced, but very unique and interesting things happen new in each book. I don't get bored with his stuff. I can barely even find any lag at all in the last few I've read. This one in particular was very engrossing. Great courtroom action. Great ending. Great dialogue. I sound like a broken record here, but gosh, this is good stuff folks. Luckily I have another 10 to go before I have read his whole back catalog."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"The first half of this novel is very slow, but once you slug through it, you will enjoy the action packed second half. Terry McCaleb is the main character, brought out of retirement by Jaye Winston to profile a sick killer, who hogtied his/her victim and left an owl behind as a clue. We have little sympathy for the victim, who may have been a killer himself, but McCaleb must solve the case before somebody else ends up hogtied. The action gets intertwined with a courtroom drama involving old buddy, Harry Bosch. Meanwhile, McCaleb's new wife isn't enjoying involvement in this mess. McCaleb keeps sniffing and he keeps finding clues pointing toward Harry. Say it ain't so, Harry."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This falls far short of the very high standard Michael Connelly set with his fabulous early books Black Echo and Black Ice. Later efforts have varied in quality, and this unfortunately isn't one of his better ones.The pivotal piece of the plot is not even vaguely credible. Without spoiling it for you,the main character (a retired FBI agent) would have to be a complete idiot to respond as he does to the key &quot;clues.&quot; A second key turning point is equally unconvincing.He is still writes well and can move the story, but one hates to report the decline in one of the best mystery writers."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I really enjoy police/crime novels so when a friend suggested I read Michael Connelly, I looked forward to it hoping to find a new author I liked. Unfortunately, that did not happen. I first read The Concrete Blond which was just OK. The beginning was interesting but after a while I found myself getting bored with it and just began skimming it to find out the ending. Since Connelly generally gets good reviews, I decided to try another one thinking maybe I had hit a bad example of his work so I picked up A Darkness More Than Night. Not only did I think this one was worse than the first, I was annoyed at the totally preposterous main storyline. A supposedly highly regarded and intelligent ex-FBI profiler leaps to the conclusion that a highly regarded detective - Hieronymous Bosch - is a murderer based on the fact that a plaster owl is found at the scene leading the profiler to somehow connect that owl to a 15th century artist and then to Bosch because their names are the same. Lacking any physical evidence, the profiler is nonetheless convinced of his theory and never bothers to look for any alternative ones. The ending is equally annoying pulling together 2 seemingly separate storylines into one.So my advice - if these two novel are representative of Michael Connelly's work - skip him and read Lee Childs' Jack Reacher novels - they are truly addictive."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Connelly is a good writer but, as in THE POET, the plot is a little too contrived/clever for its own good. The opening scenes of McCaleb grudgingly accepting the case were a little too reminiscent of Will Graham in the beginning of Harris' RED DRAGON. Also, McCaleb was too quick to accept Bosch as the killer of Gunn (If Bosch was the killer, why would he leave such elaborate clues pointing to himself? And why didn't Bosch, or someone else, point this out to him?). The ending wraps everything up a little too neatly and conveniently for my taste and, at 470 pages, this novel could probably have benefited from a little trimming here and there. Finally, would the real killer(s) have had the intelligence and ability to concoct such an elaborate murder scene? Not a bad novel, but not worthy of the high praise it has garnered."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"See story summary above.This, in my opinion, was a very average mystery. I've read one previous Connelly novel and thought the same of it. I guess if I would have read all his previous novels with both Bosch and McCaleb, my opinion would be different, but just by itself, it's average. It was interesting learning about the actual painter by the name of Heironymus Bosch-who's theme has a major role in this novel-and his rather gruesome paintings. The book did have a steady pace with a better than average ending that I enjoyed.Recommended for mystery/procedural buffs."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"A former serial killer profiler for the FBI recovers on an island with his new wife and new baby...until a former colleague brings him a file to look at...the file intrigues him...he gets the scent again...the murders are inspired by famous renaissance paintings...This is my first, and now only, Michael Connelly book I've read...prodded by all the good reviews here...The above description fits DARKNESS, but it could also fit Thomas Harris's first Hannibal book, RED DRAGON, which is a classic of the genre, whereas DARKNESS is just business - selling tired plots without a clearly drawn central evil-doer (unlike, obviously, Hannibal)...the film producer of DARKNESS is only shown at the defense table reacting to the trial...the actual perps are only tossed in at the end...an in between you get an average level of police-procedural dialogue...An extremely disappointing read."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I have not listened to the book yet.

I read this book years ago and it was in fact my introduction to Bosch. I thought it was an interesting read and didn't hesitate years later when I was doing quite a bit of driving from Georgia to Tennessee to take care of an ill relative and decided to re-listen to some favorite audiobooks. After my second listen, I decided to start from the begining with this series-now back at the seventh installment of the series, I listened to A Darkness more than for a third time. Things that didn't bother me when I listened to this as an independent book, now bothers me when I take the book as a part of a series. Number one is-how many books do the readers have to endure of EVERYONE believing Bosch is a dirty cop? As part of a series, there is no suspense in this book from the series prospective because we know from jumpstreet of Bosch guilt or innocence. It just waiting for, this time, the FBI to play catch up. Independently, when I knew nothing of Bosch and his history-then fine, I was like is he or isn't he?Plus, there were times that I felt Connelly was OVER explaining things. He will explain something and then rap it up with: 'it other words'-and I'm like-'Yeah, I got it'.Plus, I never did understand the deal Bosch offered Storey and Folks. Where was the deal-if it didn't apply to the Gunn case? It looked like he had a fair chance of winning the current case-so that would have left him to just face murder for hire in the second case. The prosecution couldn't introduced any more evidence to the current trial and I believe they were about to rest their case. Cop to murder 1 for both women in this trial and we'll what for the Gunn case?As for the narrator--don't quit your day job. Where is Dick Hill? The man was a master in the first six Bosch installments!Anyway, you really can't go wrong on a Connelly novel. The ride can be just as much fun as the destination."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This book is absolutely fabulous. Great story, great characters, hard to put down, lots of suspense, you name it, it's got it. My favorite book of Connelly's so far (I've read about half of his to date). I would HIGHLY recommend this book to any mystery fan, any cop series fan, any Connelly fan! I loved it that he put Caleb (from Blood Work) together with Bosch, what a team!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Standard in this case is good, as there are a lot of good writers of detective/murder mysteries. You've got at least one veteran that's seen it all, and that person probably has an authority figure problem. There are strains on personal life. And the mystery somehow draws the protagonist personally into the story.That's usually what you find in these books, and you find all of it here. So when this happens I'll look to see if the mystery teaches me something about a world I've not been exposed to. In the case of this book, there's not much to offer. The protagonist is a retired profiler, and we've seen that. The mystery also takes place in the Hollywood area, with people big in the movie business involved. We've also seen all that before, and only have to look in the newspapers to see stories just as good. We do get a bit of an art lesson, in that a killer is basing the crimes on the work of a medieval painter, and this is what gives it the third star. But that's not enough to bring it into higher ground, especially with so much competition in this field."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is the 5th HB novel I've read. Generally speaking, it is a very solid, suspensful novel. However, in my opinion, MC has written much better books. You realise too early in which dirction the plot is heading. Moreover, it seems that MC, in a darkness more than night, wasn't very creative and imaginative. He was apparently running out of ideas so he maybe thought, why not bring two characters of previously successful books together? But it doesn't work that simple. In comparison with Harry Bosch, (one of my absolute favorite characters regardless what book) McCaleb falls very short. He just can't compete with Bosch, that's for sure!!!In addition, I was also dissapointed to see so many similarities with an excellent book that had been previously written: the concrete blond. It is also a mixture of police thriller and courtroom story. But the concrete blond is, by far, the better book. Anyway, fans of HB will like it. For everyone else I higly recommend to read the HB novels (starting with the black echo and so forth) right from the beginning.cheers"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Isn't this what all readers dream of? Their favorite author combines several of their well-known characters in one book? That's what A Darkness More Than Night by Michael Connelly proposes to do. I have to say that the title is just great and every book I've read by Connelly is both well-written and also one of those books you want to read as quickly as possible to find out what's going to happen. Often his books aren't about solving the mystery so much as delving into the motivations and inner demons of the detective solving the mystery. This book, more than any of his others, is more about what the two detectives, Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, are thinking and feeling. But since the book shifts back and forth between the two of them, the tone is uneven and a bit disorienting. Still, it was a great read, but I found that there were a few dangling characters and ideas in this book, things that are introduced and then discarded. The book does raise interesting ethical questions about legal procedure versus punishing the guilty. I would highly recommend that you read the other Harry Bosch works and the Terry McCaleb book (Blood Work) before you read this one, since it reveals a lot of the plot details from previous novels."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"... I lose interest in the book. It is not badly written and has some fairly engaging moments, but once it became obvious what was going on (about halfway through) I just skipped ahead to the ending. With some mystery/thrillers, you can figure out the killer and his plot and still enjoy the book, but I didn't find this to be one of them."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"This is the first Connelly novel I have read and it did not meet the hypeI liked the way he began the novel and it had a strong ending as well.The attempted frameup of Bosch was alsoclever. However the middle 200 or so pages of the book seemed padded at times and connelly's unfelicitous prose did not help. I recommend the book but only marginally"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly and think that his book \\"Blood Work\\" is one of the best mystery novels I've ever read. I've also enjoyed his other novels, most of which feature Hollywood Homicide Detective Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch. \\"A Darkness More than Night\\" is a sort of culmination of his novels to date as it features \\"Blood Work\\"'s main character, Terry McCaleb, and the above mentioned Detective Bosch. This is both its strength and a symptom of its weakness.Terry McCaleb is enjoying his retirement from the FBI on Catalina Island when he is contacted by L. A. County Homicide Detective Jaye Winston. She had worked with Terry in \\"Blood Work\\" and is seeking help with a murder investigation that has stalled by asking him to take a fresh look at the evidence and facts of the murder. While this is occurring, Bosch is the primary witness in a sensational murder trial which will likely turn on Harry's testimony and credibility.McCaleb's review of Winston's case ties the victim to Harry and the evidence left at the crime scene to a relatively obscure, 500 year old painter, also named Hieronymus Bosch. Terry discovers that the victim had, at least in Harry's opinion, gotten away with murder, and the scene of his murder somewhat resembled a Bosch painting that Harry has hanging in his house. For McCaleb, the conclusion is obvious. Harry has set himself up as an avenging angel. Other information, much of which is taken from earlier Connelly/Bosch novels, only serves to strengthen the case against Harry. Soon the FBI has joined in the hunt.However, Harry, now aware that he is a suspect, confronts McCaleb forcing him to consider the possibility that he is the subject of an elaborate frame up. McCaleb must then decide whether Harry is indeed the killer or whether he should be looking elsewhere. Since Harry is the lead character in most of Connelly's books, the author must also decide Harry's fate. (Hint: Connelly has a new Bosch novel out.)Connelly is a terrific writer, and, for the most part, this is an interesting novel. McCaleb and Bosch are wonderful, well-drawn characters, each of whom approach a mystery from their own point of view. There is also an important moral to this story dealing with accountability for one's actions with McCaleb and Bosch both forced to eventually look at some of the steps they have taken in the pursuit of justice.As good as it may be at times, the book is greatly flawed. Sixteenth Century Dutch Painter Hieronymus Bosch is not exactly a household name, and yet a good deal of the investigation depends on people either having or gaining an awareness of his work. McCaleb himself was the subject of a frame attempt of sorts in \\"Blood Work\\", and yet he never considers that possibility in Harry's case. The relationship between a murder charge against Harry and its impact on his credibility as a witness seems all too obvious and should also have immediately occurred to McCaleb. Other evidence seems to be overlooked until it is suddenly needed at the end. Also, there are indications here that Connelly may be running out of ideas and is recycling events and characters, minor or otherwise, from prior novels.This is an extremely commercial work by Connelly. I do not mean it was written to make money, presumably all authors have that intent. Rather, it is one long commercial for his other books. Connelly is almost shameless in mentioning his other novels through the use of characters and events taken from other novels, even referring to case names that are the same as the names of the books from which they were taken. In addition to the prior McCaleb and Bosch novels, he works in references to \\"The Poet\\" and \\"Void Moon\\", stopping just short of providing names and addresses of bookstores in your neighborhood.I would, however, recommend \\"A Darkness More Than Night\\" to anyone who has read and enjoyed other Connelly books. For anyone who hasn't, do yourself a favor by reading \\"Blood Work\\" and almost any of the other Harry Bosch novels first."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"I could not put this book down.

I'm a big fan. Keep writing Mr. Connelly."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"\\"A Darkness More Than Night\\" is Michael Connelly's tenth book, his second to feature Terry McCaleb and was first published in 1999. McCaleb, who made his first appearance in \\"Blood Work\\", is a former FBI Agent who retired after a heart attack. He lives on Catalina Island, runs a fishing charter and has now married Graciela Rivers. The couple met when Graciela asked him to look into her sister's murder, some three years previously. Since then, McCaleb hasn't been involved in any investigation - until Jaye Winston comes to visit. Winston, a Sheriff's detective, requests his help with a murder she's investigating - something she terms Terry's \\"sort of thing\\". Edward Gunn, the victim, was killed in his apartment in what appears to have been a very carefully constructed murder. Studying the case file, McCaleb notes some of the more significant features, including the message written on the victim's gag. However, he spots something on the crime scene video that Winston seems to have overlooked. A hand-painted plastic owl - roughly two feet in height - had been placed on the shelves in such a way that it 'watched' as Gunn died.A background check on Gunn shows that he was 'known' to the police : he had a record for 'small-time' crimes, including soliciting for prostitution and drink-driving. He had also been questioned by the LAPD about the murder of a prostitute six years previously. However, the department reluctantly dropped the case and wrote it off as self-defence. McCaleb notices that the lead detective on the case was a man he'd once worked with : Harry Bosch. McCaleb decides to contact him, initially to see if he has any thoughts about Gunn's murder. The investigation, however, puts a very different slant on things and ensures the two men will be talking again.Bosch, who makes his seventh appearance in this book, is already a well-established character. Orphaned at the age of twelve, he is the son of a prostitute who named him after the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. After serving in Viet-Nam, he returned home and joined the LAPD. He was once a member of the elite Robbery-Homicide Department, but following an IAD investigation was demoted to the Hollywood Division. While McCaleb is investigating the Gunn killing, Bosch is in court helping to prosecute a high-profile case. The defendant, David Storey, is a very famous (and notorious) film director, charged with the murder of a young actress. Jody Krementz's body had been found in her own bed, though it was believed the pose was staged so that it would look like accidental death. Storey is joined at the defence table by John Reason Fowkkes, his lawyer, and Rudy Tafero, his PI. Tafero was once a LAPD cop who, like Bosch, worked out of Hollywood. He retired after twenty years, went private and took out a bail bonds licence.There's some history between the two lead characters. Although this is the first time they've shared the spotlight in print, this isn't the first time they've met. McCaleb was setting up the Bureau's BSS and VICAP outpost in LA when Bosch - then still at RHD - asked for his help with a profile for a killer. The victim had been a Mexican girl, in her early teens. Never identified, Bosch christened her 'Cielo Azul' and McCaleb named his daughter 'Cielo' in her honour. Connelly subsequently wrote a short story about the case, which has now been included in the collection \\"Dangerous Women\\".I'm not entirely sure dividing the action between Bosch and McCaleb really helped the story - I would certainly have liked Bosch to feature more, given that I think he's a stronger character than McCaleb. Connelly has nearly overdone it with the number of cameos - Jack McEvoy and Brass Doran, from \\"The Poet\\", make brief appearances, while there's a nod to Thelma Kibble from \\"Void Moon\\". Meanwhile, both Bosch and McCaleb bring a number of their own 'support characters' it was nice to see Teresa Coraz&oacute;n again. Harry's investigation into Gunn was never covered in any book, though it did form the backdrop to \\"The Last Coyote\\". (Harry's Lieutenant at the time, Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds, had interfered with Gunn's questioning - as a result, Harry lost his temper and pushed his bureaucratic boss head first through an office window. \\"The Last Coyote\\" deals with his subsequent suspension). As a result, this is far from the best place to start if you haven't read anything by him before - I'd recommend reading at least \\"Blood Work\\" and \\"The Last Coyote\\" first. If you are a fan of Connelly's, though, you should enjoy this - the more you've read by him, the more you'll get out of it."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Another great Connelly novel, this one bringing together two of his most dynamic creations, Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb. How refreshing to see these to characters interact, and how amazing of Connelly to actually make the reader believe one of these men is not what seems. But, if you're new to the world of Bosch and McCaleb, don't start here. Be sure to read the earlier works first, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Harry Bosch is one of the characters that I never get tired of reading about. His personality and demeanor have been well developed by Mr. Connelly. McCaleb on the other hand is a little too wishy washy for me. If I never read about him again, OK. Bosch is what makes this amost enjoyable book. It must be hard using the same character again and again, however Mr. Connelly does a superb job. As a frequent mystery reader, I find that I look foward to Mr. Connelly brand of detective fiction. He is my favorite writer, and I look foward to his next novel."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Connelly is one of the few novelists who could actually have two of his protagonists go head-to-head and have you wondering if maybe one of them has gone over to the dark side. Bosch has been becoming progressively more disillusioned and erratic throughout the series, making the idea of him as bad-guy frighteningly convincing. As if all this wasn't enough, C. manages even to squeeze in a cameo from POET star Jack McEnvoy (and by the way, where the hell's the sequel to the POET? Last I looked, the bad guy wasn't dead at the end - not for sure, anyway...)"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"&quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; features Harry Bosch (Trunk Music, Angels Flight, Black Ice) and Terrance McCaleb (Blood Work) as the main &quot;detectives&quot;. These two are great characters to read about. Terrance McCaleb is enjoying his retirement on Catalina Island, California. He loves spending time with his wife, Graciela, and his new born baby. The good times end when he gets a surprise visit from an old police colleague asking for his help in a murder case. A man named Edward Gunn, has been brutally murdered. The police cannot find the killer. They are stumped! Terrance goes to the scene and starts investigating. As he looks at the pictures that the police took, he discovers that there is an owl decoy planted on a dresser looking down at the victim. When Terrance gets to the scene, he discovers that the owl is stolen. He thinks that the owl could be the killer's trademark, and he goes on the look for it. Terrance then links the owl to gothic and evil painting done by people who perceive owls as evil. As Terrance travels to museums to see what artist uses owls, he finds that the main artist that uses owls is Hiernonymous Bosch, aka Harry Bosch! The detective Harry Bosch was named after the painter! Terrance starts to believe that Harry Bosch has been setup for the murder of Edward Gunn. Unfortunately, some other people believe that Harry is the killer. Harry Bosch is in the courtroom testifying against a man named David Storey. Harry knows that David has killed a young woman, and he must use his police tactics to prove to the jury that David is a guilty man. As Terrance and Bosch hook up to try and prove Bosch's innocense, they find a disturbing link between David Storey and Edward Gunn. This is probably Michael Connelly's best novel yet. It is a must read for Connelly fans and for all suspense fans. Don't be left in the dark, read &quot;A Darkness More Than Night.&quot;Brad Stonecipher"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"[...]. I'm a huge Connelly fan and it's my appreciation of his masterful writing that kept me from noting the missed opportunities while reading \\"A Darkness More Than Night\\". It's a great read when compared to the works of most other modern authors, but compared to the high standards that Connelly's other works have set for him, it sticks out as a (forgivable) misstep in the Harry Bosch timeline.The initial idea of putting LAPD detective Bosch and FBI agent Terry McCaleb (introduced in the magnificent page-turner \\"Blood Work\\" - don't judge it by the lackluster movie) together on the same investigation is a great one. They exist as opposite sides of the law-and-order coin: Bosch's past has left him cynical to the point that he will pursue justice through any means, while McCaleb has found a new optimism through his second chance at a life and family. They maintain professional respect for each other while investigating related cases, but eventually their philosophies must collide. Along the way, each man also questions his own current belief set. These conflicts are the strongpoint of the book, but their examination comes too late and isn't handled with sufficient depth.Instead, too much energy is devoted to weaving numerous other Connelly characters into the plot, and not always to great effect. For example, why force Jack McEvoy (the journalist from \\"The Poet\\") into the mix when established L.A. reporter Keisha Russell would have done just fine? Eventually, all of the crossovers [...] detract from the strengths that should have been the focus of the book. The introduction of characters from different book arcs is often used by authors as their series progress, and in lesser hands, they usually come off as ham-handed gimmicks. Connelly manages to salvage a good story out of this, but you're left disappointed that the crossovers kept it from being as good as it should have been.The plotting of Bosch and McCaleb's parallel cases is very well done - Bosch is the star witness for the prosecution in a high-profile Hollywood murder case, while McCaleb has been asked by Jaye Winston (more crossovers, although justified here) to profile a current homicide that looks like a possible serial case. This duality is reminiscent of \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" except that it's McCaleb doing the current investigation this time. As a result, you won't find any of Bosch's usual supporting cast around (Jerry Edgar, Grace Billets, Irvin Irving) in this one; only Kizmin Rider makes a brief cameo.Several other areas that didn't receive proper attention include an examination of the painter who is Bosch's namesake and the interesting parallels between the two, the arrogant Hollywood playboy defendant in Harry's trial, and the eventual resolution of that case. Each of these areas were given very promising leads that never fully matured as they should have.I wish that Amazon allowed fractional ratings, because \\"A Darkness More Than Night\\" is a solid 3.5. It's both a good mystery read and a necessary chapter in the timelines of both Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb. The story held great promise when focused on their distinct psychologies, the necessary conflict between the two, and the casework that draws them into each other's path. Unfortunately, this potential is never fully realized as too much time and effort is devoted to squeezing in crossovers from all of Connelly's different character arcs."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"As an avid fan of Mr. Connelly, I was a little disappointed in this book. It was great to see McCaleb and Bosch together in the same book. And as always, Connelly weaves in characters from other novels, which makes for an interesting read.What I found hard to believe is the shadow of suspicion cast upon Bosch, and that McCaleb and the others fell for it so easily. A seasoned investigator, Bosch is involved in his own high profile murder investigation and prosecution, and now the reader is to believe that McCaleb seriously considers that Bosch is on the streets dishing out his own brand of vigilantism? Give me a break - Bosch is one of the good guys.This wasn't the page turner Connelly has churned out in the past, but the characters were well developed, and the plot lines interesting. If you're new to Michael Connelly, try one of his earlier novels first...."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"&quot;A darkness more than night&quot; is Michael Connelly's second novel featuring retired LAPD detective Terry McCaleb. After &quot;Blood Work&quot;, which came to a very well-rounded and satisfying conclusion, a second McCaleb novel was definitely a surprise, a positive one at that. &quot;A darkness more than night&quot; is a superb book. Connelly's writing is right up there with the great classics of the genre. Although his stories take place in modern day Los Angeles, they have a noir touch to them that reminds us of the Philip Marlowe stories.In this book Terry McCaleb crosses paths with Harry Bosch, star of several Connelly novels, most recently &quot;Angel's flight&quot;. Without giving away too many clues it is safe to say that a very captivating story develops as personalities collide and two seemingly unrelated investigations enter a web of darkness. As in &quot;Bloodwork&quot; the reader follows breathlessly and until the very end is unable to figure out where this tale is heading. Believable, well-drawn characters, great storyline, athmosperically dense writing, great book!"},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"Retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb is asked to help find the killer of a man himself suspected of killing a woman some years earlier. McCaleb comes to suspect LAPD detective Hieronymus Bosch because the crime scene evidence suggests that the killer included references to the artist Hieronymus Bosch. The reader gets to learn a lot about Bosch the artist and about owls as an icon of evil in medieval and renaissance art. The confluence of art from the past and events today is more interesting and accurate than similar maneuvers in the DaVinci Code.While Detective Bosch looks like he might be a killer, he is the main witness in the trial of a powerful and wealthy Hollywood mogul accused of murdering a woman. The use of Architectural Digest as evidence in the trial is a clever twist.Detective Bosch is in this book as in all of the Bosch novels the man on a mission, convinced that he can bring a sliver of justice into this sordid world. McCaleb is similarly committed, willing to complicate a good life with his wife and two children to chase down the bad guy while he has to live with a heart transplant and the 54 pills per day that it takes to keep him healthy. This story like Connelly's other books is full of interesting detail and scenes from LA, well-drawn characters, and enough twists to keep the reader busy following the web of interrelated events.Don't be surprised if this book reminds you of the film, Blood Work starring Clint Eastwood. Connelly wrote the book on which the film is based. Terry McCaleb is the main character; the cause of his heart transplant is the major plot element."},{"Title":"A Darkness More Than Night","review":"(review is of the 2001 Warner Books edition)We re-visit a lot of old friends in this interesting mystery, full of twists and turns. Terry McCaleb (last seen inBlood Work), who is a retired FBI profiler, is contacted by Jay Winston for help on a case. She wants him to do a profile for her. At first he refuses, but he finally relents and agrees to do the profile. However, he ends up being pulled into the case and discovers that there appears to be a link between the murder Winston is investigating (the murder is of Edward Gunn, previously investigated by Bosch in an earlier book - unfortunately I can't remember which book at this time) and a Netherlandish artist ... named Hieronymus Bosch.At the same time, Bosch is helping prosecute a trial against a rich Hollywood bloodsucker named David Storey, who is under arrest for strangling at least one woman to death. When it is anonymously leaked to investigative reporter Jack McEvoy (last seen inThe Poet) that Bosch is possibly under investigation in the murder of Gunn, Bosch is furious - first that he would be suspected at all, and secondly because if it were to get out it would destroy his credence in court and allow Storey to go free.The two intertwining yet apparently separate plot-lines turn and twist around each other until finally they reach a conclusion that is, to put it mildly, quite explosive.Great book, great story!

It is necessary to read all the books to appreciate the later ones."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The most negative thing I can say is that this book isn't for everyone. It's different. A reader expecting a Tolkien photocopy will be disappointed - but a reader looking for serious fantasy won't.Pluses: Dynamic, structured magic. This is one of those rare books where magic actually rules, instead of brute might as is especially common in FANTASY. The plotting is what I'd call lean, but hardly rushed. The world of Earthsea is stunning and believable at the same time, mainly because of the speed(and care) with which Le Guin establishes individual islands and people. This book has characters, not clones. Another particularly good thing is that the main conflict never stretches too high, trying too hard to be epic and dramatic; rather, the story is down-to-earth. Ged is especially meaningful and the scale of the story supports him well.Overall, everything fits together.

A Wizard for Earthsea is a wonderful coming of age story that presents a lot of very wonderful lessons in personal growth and maturation without losing the core of being a story.LeGuin's Ged is a well thought out main character who's existence and eventual life story are extremely well developed. His early beginnings are well founded in actual conditions that set a tone of realism in the book. This is especially important because LeGuin writes more than just this book.I enjoyed the philosophical points that she makes in pointing out some of the flaws(pride, vanity, overconfidence) that are so common among adolescents and can lead to some very real problems. The development and personal growth of the main character is not so sudden that it becomes unrealistic.

Ged is a character who really resonates with me for some reason I haven't quite completely pinned down yet (nor do I particularly want to). The narrative is taught and inviting, giving just enough world building and dialog to bring the story to life, but never feeling tedious. I am amazed with every reading at how rich of a story this is for barely being over 200 pages. Le Guin is a truly gifted writer. I have read a lot of fantasy from authors who can't inject nearly as much story, character and heart into a bloated book 3 times this length."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"When I was a child, the three big fantasy series in my world were Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, and the Earthsea Trilogy. I loved them all, but the one that really moved me, that gave me wonderful dreams and nightmares, was Earthsea. I loved it deeply.Today I live in Japan, and the movie Gedo Senki, loosely based on the 3rd and 4th Earthsea books, was released last month. So I reread the original trilogy and I've started on the newer ones. They are still powerful, wonderful stories, and they only get better: the latter books are more mature and even more powerful, and LeGuin's skills in description and characterization have improved as well.There is an omnibus edition that includes the first four books under one cover, and I would recommend it over this edition, both for savings in cost, and because the omnibus has fewer typos."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Here is a book where I can recognize the literary excellence, the sparse but aesthetic prose, and the overall quality of the story but totally reject the worldview presented. LeGuin's world is one where magic operates in the occultic sense. Her fantasy writings are often grouped with the works of Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, and while it is true that they are all \\"fantasy\\" writings, whereas Tolkien and Lewis were writing from a Christian worldview, LeGuin is writing from a decidedly pagan one. What she means by \\"wizard\\" and what Tolkien means by \\"wizard,\\" for example, are as different as night from day. The story itself, however, is top-notch. The \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" of the title is an extremely flawed and self-conflicted character. In the end you find that the major plotline essentially boils down to a great struggle the protagonist has between the different parts of his nature. I always thought that the endless glut of fantasy novels that have been churned out over the past half-century owe their existence to the popularity and influence of Tolkien. I see now that this is partly true, but much of their existence is owed to LeGuin as well. This is unfortunate. If modern Christianity had a writer of speculative fiction who could produce works as potent and popular as those of Lewis and Tolkien, it would help to counteract the pagan influence of modern fantasy novels, most of which follow LeGuin instead of Tolkien in this regard."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Le Guin has written one of my favorite short stories, \\"The Ones who Walked Away from Omelas\\", and I picked up this book hoping her experimental narratives and beautiful world creation would translate well into novel form.Long story short, they did - but other more novelistic elements came somewhat more sketchy. The book's main character, Ged, sometimes seems as faceless as the horrors he confronts - he simply doesn't have much personality, even though the third-person narrator seems to be lodged near the back of his mind. His emotions are real, his development as a human being is real, but he never seems to conjure up any sort of lasting, memorable personality. None of the characters excel very much, from Ged's master to his kind-of sort-of love interest, except for maybe his best friend. Don't be expecting the likes of Frodo, Aragorn, or Gandalf from Earthsea.However, the world is brilliant, and as a high fantasy adventure it certainly captivates. The system of magic Le Guin creates for her universe is intuitive and frightening - everything has a very, very real price, and the best mages are those who scarcely use magic. The beasts, from island-sized dragons to lovable (if violent) dog-rat familiars, are exemplary and the world they inhabit lives and breathes with them.This book is worth reading, definitely - but it could be better. The ending alone makes it a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Reading the Earthsea Trilogy was one of the highlights of my childhood. Discovering that it had become the Earthsea Quartet and now Quintet is one of the highlights of life today. Why it's still being featured as a trilogy when there are two further books to be read, I don't understand!Le Guin is the daughter of anthropologists and through all her fiction there is a deep, ingrained understanding of societies work and how they are built and evolve (or disintegrate). It's very interesting to see how her own interests have matured and deepened over the decades of writing this series - the latest Earthsea Title - The Other Wind is a fabulous rendition of concerns about gender/sexism/prejudice and the very nature of things. BUT that's for the grown ups, what really matters is that underneath all her incisive intelligence Ursula Le Guin tells a gripping, exciting and devastating series of stories that come at one in a rush of tight telling and delicately realised plots. She is simply one of the greatest writers for older children - or anyone!

Reading the editors' reviews of the book on Amazon, they compare it glowingly to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but I just don't see it. Granted this is only the first book, and I will likely read the second, but it certainly was not the caliber of Tolkien. The book is rather choppy and written in a sort of third person narrative that gets annoying after time. I also felt the plot and writing were rather immature. This was one of Le Guin's early works, but it still needed a good editor. I can see, however, why The SciFi Channel has opted to make it into a mini-series, the story is simple high fantasy -- nothing too difficult, nothing too mind boggling. It will probably do well."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Granted, this is only my personal opinion, but here it is: this book is amazing. IF you read it with an open mind, that is. I read it not knowing what to expect, and I would recommend you do the same. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is not a thrilling, by-the-seat-of-your-pants, entertaining novel in a Harry Potter sense, so don't expect it to be. This doesn't mean it won't be a thoroughly enjoyable read, however. It's archetypal, it's philosophical, it's profound, it's timeless; it will make you think about good and evil, failure and success, and the powers we have as individuals in a vast, [mostly] empty universe.I think the best way to describe the novel in general is \\"mythological,\\" for if you observe take into account the plot, characters, setting and history found in the book, you'll notice that the story as a whole resembles many tales of heroic figures from various mythologies. Also, if you've ever studied Zen, I think you'll enjoy it :)So, in summary, don't expect a lot of description about the characters' histories, physical appearances or the setting, for they're not central to the story. LeGuin knows we, the readers, don't need explicit details about the hero's history or appearance to understand the novel - we've met \\"the hero\\" hundreds of times, in every novel we've ever read, and I think she'd rather leave it up to our imaginations.No, the center of the story is the philosophy, the explanation of which I'll leave to the author."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the first in a series of books.

It wasn't the best book iv ever read but it was very enjoyable. in conclusion i recommend this book to anyone who isn't looking for a classic thats written perfect but to anyone who just wants a good read pick it up and treat yourself"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin has written one of the greatest stories in fantasy literature. As the first book of the Earthsea cycle, A Wizard of Earthsea has such imagery that pulled me into the the imaginary world of dragons, wizards, and the balance between good and evil. I thought that this book would be the same as the Harry Potter books, but with a twist of the Middle Ages, I was excited to find out where the story would lead.The main characters had so much tension that you can understand what they were feeling. For example, when Ged was being criticized by Jasper that he was better than Ged, He wanted so much to embarrass Jasper in front of everyone by beating him in a duel. As the tension between them got darker, Ged would not resist any longer and do the unthinkable thing to strengthen his reputation and put the world in chaos.Ursula K. Le Guin tells a story of a young man who finds himself by learning from his mistakes and how he mastered the powerful words of sorcery, tamed an ancient dragon, and restores the balance of good and evil by putting his life on the line.A young man named Sparrowhawk would be known as Ged, the greatest sorcerer in all of Earthsea, but until the then he is a troubled young man who was anxious for power and knowledge. He meddled with forbidden secrets and set loose a terrible shadow upon the world of Earthsea. Now he must face the consequences and learn the most valuable thing in being a great wizard.I would recommend anyone who likes a magnificent sci-fi fantasy, to read this first book of the Earthsea Cycle and the next three books of the Earthsea Cycle."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin occupies an unusual place in the world of science fiction and fantasy largely because she refuses to do what is expected in the genre. Where fantasy is defined largely by the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, which involves grand battles, mighty wizards, and vast armies contesting matters of simplistic good vs. evil, Le Guin constructs her fantasy world around shades of gray, around the complexity in single individuals. The result is work that reaches outside the genre even as it alienates some within.\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is such a book. Ged defies the stereotypical Gandalf-type wizard in that he is young and foolish, his wisdom not appearing at the beginning of the story but growing through it, much as wisdom in real people does. He can fight great monsters, and he does, but this story is about the monster within, about the dark side found in each of us. Le Guin brings this to life through magic and faces her protagonist with a choice that we each, at some point in our lives, must face: will darkness consume me?The result is a work quite unlike anything else in fantasy. Like all great writers, Le Guin does more than tell a story. She makes you think as you read, challenging your easy assumptions, using the unreal world of myth to illuminate the real world of now. If the ethical simplicity of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" leaves you unsatisfied, come to Earthsea and discover yourself, shadow and all."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have read this book and consider it a fine fantasy tale. I came here to review the book, which I give four stars. Very original, very creative.I was however disturbed at the comments made by \\"R. M. Fisher \\"Ravenna\\" \\" praising the books inhabitants for being non white. While this is certainly not a problem, I find it disturbing, that this person is disturbed that the majority of fantasy features Caucasians in main roles. Fantasy, at least the Kind portrayed in Tolkien's work and in Earth seas work, as well as a majority of the fantasy genre are based upon the archetypes of the European folk soul. Much fantasy is a celebration of Caucasian indigenous roots. Our way before Christianity. Our spiritual path before our conversion. Much fantasy allows us to celebrate this lost, but somewhat returning past. Le Guinn has written a good book in which her characters are not Celtic types (even though the universe is based upon the Celtic peoples) and this should not be a major issue. However it should also not be an issue, that most fantasy celebrates European culture, and therefore casts Europeans in its main roles. Would the author also be upset after reading an entire corpus of Arabian Jinn tales, and go on to mention that it is disturbing that all the main characters were Brown ? I doubt it. Europeans are quite allowed to write books about their past and heritage, and they should not be chastised for that, just as any other race would not be chastised for celebrating its roots with fiction. Celebrate your roots, whether you be black, brown, yellow, red or even *Gasp* white.All and all a great book. Good for kids as its easy to read. I read it for the first time almost 10 years ago. Avoid the film if you are looking for an exact conversion, but its still fun (as long as the look of white people don't offend you)"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read the first chapter of this book and I thought, \\"Wow! This is really going to be a great book\\". I was wrong. The first chapter of the book was exciting, well described and emotional. However, the rest of the book was a steady decline from there.In the middle of the book there is an encounter with a dragon. However, it's glossed over and much of the detail is left out. A lot of detail is given in sailing from this island to that island. Personally, I would like to gloss over all the sailing and spend more time on the conflict with the dragon and the final conflict at the end."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"One of the basic tenets of writing good fiction is \\"show me, don't tell me.\\" An example: Tell - \\"Ged didn't like Jasper.\\" Show - \\"Ged felt a strong urge to punch Jasper right in his sniveling little face every time he looked at him. Every snide remark, every condescending look, increased the power of that urge.\\"Both of those examples convey that Ged didn't like Jasper, but which one brings you into the story and adds character development? That's the problem with the author's writing--pages and pages of narration. Too much telling and not enough showing. It makes the pace of the book very fast, which is nice, but it feels like watching a movie with the fast forward button pressed--you get the basic idea of what's going on, but none of the finer details. That's how reading this book feels."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The story is slow and plodding. Granted, it was written for teens, but it felt as if someone where reciting a parable instead of telling a story. The ending was not engaging (like much of the book) nor was it much of a surprise. There is supposed to be some sort of environmental message. If so, it's a weak one.I give it two stars as I am a big fan of this genre, so I don't write it off as a complete waste of time. This is certainly not Le Guin's best work. The Lathe of Heaven was much better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I know some have raved about how great this book is. Unfortunately I didn't feel that way. Not bad, but I've read better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I can't say a whole lot about this one - it was mildly entertaining, slow, and just not my cup of tea. I know many consider this to be a great book, but honestly it just wasn't my cup of tea. The pace was slow, the characters shallow (leading me to not really care about them, or what was happening). I think given the time when this was written, this would've been a great book, but I've been spoiled by some of the great fantasy novels of the last decade or two."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book arrived really fast and in the expected condition. I had a very pleasant experience with this seller and i would recommend them to anyone."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It took me several renewals at the library to finish this book. It takes forever to get started, and I really didn't like the main character (and he had too many names to keep track of). But Le Guin's writing is beautiful to read, so I kept at it, and the story improved steadily. You can see where JK Rowling got the idea for Harry Potter--straight from this book. The magic is very well defined and limited (a must for fantasy/magic). The tension in the was tight--when it happened finally--and there was a sound message with subtle symbolism (the yew tree and yew staff) below the surface in a Tolkien way--often missing in contemporary fantasy.This is a must-have for any library, it only misses the fifth star because it failed to hook me into reading it straight through."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The book tries hard to be something of a Lord of the Rings story, but it rarely succeeds. We are quickly told about Ged and in the first few chapters he has lived about 4 years of his life, we rarely get a second to breathe or really know anyone, but Ged. And we hardly understand him either. It is quite a tedious read and uninteresting from this perspective. There are a few attempts (well, quite a lot actually) to capture the reader's attention, but unfortunately that is just what they are, attempts. This book isn't awful, but it is just like any other Fantasy book or Trilogy and doesn't stand out like Tolkein or Rowling's books. Read it if you like, but I would reccomend something with a deeper storyline, more colorful and dynamic characters, and events that keep the reader's attention and entertains them. This book doesn't do that."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea books are hailed by many as an outstanding example of the fantasy genre. I am personally going to withhold judgment on that until I have had the opportunity to read the other two books in the original trilogy because while I enjoyed A Wizard of Earthsea I felt that there were some things missing that could have made it a much better book. My hope is that those missing pieces will be filled in by The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore and that together the three books will make one outstanding tale.My first thought upon finishing A Wizard of Earthsea was, \\"That's it?\\" I really felt that it was far too short. I enjoyed the story a lot, but it seemed as though I was just getting into it and things were really just beginning to happen when all of a sudden things were being wrapped up and before I knew it, the book was done.One thing I would like to have read about is more of the magic theory of the world. There was lots of talk about classes in magic, but nothing that gave me a glimpse into how the magic really worked. There were enough different branches and classes to imply that there is a magic theory, but it was never elaborated upon. I would also have liked to know what differentiated the wizards from the sorcerers. I know that they touched on it in the book, but I never truly understood the difference. That is definitely one thing that I hope will be expounded upon in the later books.Actually, I hope just about everything, including characterization, will be expounded upon in the later books. Like just about everything else in A Wizard of Earthsea, I felt that there was a good start on characterization, but that it could and should have gone a little farther for it to be truly complete. The only character I felt that I knew at all well was Ged, but there were a few, like Vetch and Ogion, who I felt as though I should have known better than I did, because they were important to Ged. In addition, I felt that the squabbles Ged had with some people would perhaps have had more meaning if I had known more about the people involved.The only thing that I didn't really like about A Wizard of Earthsea was was Ged's reaction to what I thought should have been a traumatic event. I felt as though the whole incident was rather pointless because it didn't really affect Ged at all. He didn't really mourn as far as I can tell, and though it was mentioned that he was upset, I didn't see any signs of Ged being more than somewhat disappointed. Perhaps that was due to the fact that I didn't know him as well as I would have liked, but it did seem odd that I was more upset than Ged was.Other than that, however, I found A Wizard of Earthsea to be a very enjoyable book. I wished that it was longer and that there was more to it, but that was because I was enjoying the book. I was sorry to see it end, and I'm looking forward to reading the other books in this series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read fantasy to escape the mundanity of life and to escape the human body (with it's limited capabilities).

As soon as I started the Earthsea Cycle I had a third.The world of Earthsea is very brilliantly created. Rather than learn about the world up front you discover each land through different characters. As Ursula mentions in the book, she doesn't have a complete picture either and discovers though the eyes of the characters. The books should definitely be read in order to get the full experience. The other wind provides a fantastic ending, but much is left to be imagined. I almost don't want to pick up another series just so I can live in earthsea for a bit longer.I definitely recommend this series for anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" the year it was published, just after returning home from my own odyssey as a peace corps volunteer in India. The lyrical language, the adventure upon the open water travelling to the unknown, the voyage to the personal unknown--and perhaps unknowable--all resonated with me.Upon a second reading, it is still a strong and vibrant story, though I became a bit bored with the repeated hopping from one port town to the next and the multiple close calls. I could certainly relate to her descriptions of walking to exhaustion, and pushing oneself to the limits of one's endurance!There was a plot hole which I felt was not sufficiently explained and upon re-reading still feel that it is a bit wobbly, but a minor kvetch for a marvellous book. I thought it very clever of her to introduce the \\"stubs\\", the unresolved questions from which other books will take their start, woven into the narrative and not just plugged in at the end.I know it's a YA book, but don't let that description deter you. It's beautiful and enduring, a work of art."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is a decent book, and part of a great series. There's something really timeless and innocent, but philosophical, about Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea novels.Unfortunately, when I first read A Wizard of Earthsea, I found it to be slow and a bit boring. I didn't get what all the fuss was about. It's short, and definitely a classic heroic journey. However, it didn't excite me. I didn't fall in love with the characters. Actually, that's probably an understatement, I was more or less turned off to the whole idea of Earthsea. I shoved the book somewhere in my garage (where my books go to die) and thought I'd never pick it up again. In my mind, I wrote it off as \\"The Hobbit, Lite.\\"My second reading was different. I had gotten and read a used copy of The Farthest Shore (Book 3 of the Earthsea series) at a hostel book exchange, and was somehow blown away. I devoured the other Earthsea books, and loved them. Finally, I dusted off this book and read it again. This time, I found it much more charming. I loved the characters by then, and found the story much more exciting as a result.So, though I know this book is chronologically first in the Earthsea series, I (personally) do not like it as an intro to the Earthsea world. I would read the other books first. Because, on its own merits, A Wizard of Earthsea is only ok. But, as a prequel featuring characters I already love, the book is an absolute treat."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read this book in 1984 when I was 12 years old and I have returned to it many times over the years, re-reading either parts of it or the entire novel. A Wizard of Earthsea has few peers in the fantasy genre. As relevant for mature readers as young ones, this book works its spell on you by capturing your imagination. Its themes are timeless: the individual's search for meaning in the face of uncertainty, friendship, maturity, and most importantly redemption and acceptance. Although there is a good bit of action in this story, the real action of the story plays on a deeper level: self-discovery."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"No wonder this is a classic. This book is truly a work of genius--creating not only a new realm, but philosophic underpinnings for it in a natural-seeming way. It almost feels like an authentic myth that developed over time, not like a work of contemporary fiction. I could hardly put it down. Moreover, while many fantasy writers tell good stories, their style is often lacking. LeGuin balances plot, character, and style perfectly.I won't go into more detail, as there are so many other reviews, but I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was recommended to me and I really liked it. I plan on getting the rest of the series as well so I can continue to follow the story of Sparrowhawk. It is not a complex as Tolkien, which is good for a light read and an escape from stress. The part of the plot I really liked was that the writer lets us see Sparrowhawk in his youth, with all his pride and anger and let's us be part of his growth into a man."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"After reading all of the reviews and the back cover of the book my expectations were hi. The story is good, but there isn't a lot of dialogue or character interaction. It's a good story, but while reading it I felt like there was something missing. Maybe because I prefer more dialogue between characters, mood, and showing vs. telling in the stories I read.Still, I am glad to have read this book. It was a quick read and I plan on reading book 2.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book is by far the most clear cut example of excellent and pure storytelling I have ever read.I admit, the story is for a younger reader than I am, but for God's sake, not everything has to be Jane Austin. One very interesting trick that , for me, seemed brilliant but so simple you'd miss it if you weren't paying attention was the uncomplicated way magic was used in the book.Many fantasy novels go to great lengths to create whole languages and spend tremendous effort on the explaination of how magic works and why. In this book the author jsut says, \\"Ged laid a charm upon it and the brackish water ran pure.\\" Another example would be, \\"He had to hold his boat together mostly with magic.\\" It's very simple and in itself uses the magic of giving enough information to paint a detail, but leaving enough out so that the reader's own imagination can fill in the gaps instead of being beaten over the head with details until it submits to the author's pre-envisioned ideal of how the story should appear.Kudos to the author for she has given us a delightful book that is fun to read and not so hung up on itself that it becomes a fantasy physics piece. Kudos for keeping it simple but rich."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The world of Earthsea is so rich, textured, and well developed that it is hard to force yourself to leave it once the book is over. I know this is suppose to be a book for young adults but it doesn't read like a young adult book at all. The themes and topics addressed in the book really explore the universal state of humanity in a way that makes you think about your worldview. Even when surrounded by magic and dragons, Earthsea's epic story feels real."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ged, aka \\"Sparrowhawk,\\" goes to wizard school on the Isle of Roke. In rivalry with another student, he abuses his new powers, unintentionally unleashing a dark force. He pays dearly for his foolish dabbling and is scarred for life. He feels great remorse and wants to make things right, vowing to use his powers only for good, but he can't seem to outrun the shadow spirit he awakened. Finally, Ged comes to understand that he'll have to pursue the shadow and conquer it, or it will plague him and Earthsea forever.With his steadfast friend Vetch, Ged makes a long journey \\"to the coasts of death's kingdom.\\" He faces down his demon and becomes \\"a man: who, knowing his whole true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived for life's sake and never in the service of ruin or pain, or hatred, or the dark.\\" (Best description of manhood I've ever found---ever.)This book has all the elements of the traditional fantasy questing tale: developing magical powers, fighting the dragon, lonely travels, loyal friends, sinister enemies, and venturing into the great unknown for a final showdown. A Wizard of Earthsea is set apart from others in the genre by two things:1) its strong literary quality (Harry Potter it ain't).2) its understated wisdom, often shared by the older mages and wizards who train Ged. Ged's first teacher, Ogion, is especially wise, and he also happens to be my favorite character.If you like critters, you'll want to acquire some new pets after reading this story. I'll start my Earthsea menagerie with a harrekki, a miniature dragon that lives in oak trees and dines on wasps and worms and sparrows' eggs. I'll let it hang from my sleeve and feed it table scraps.This was a satisfying story and I look forward to reading the next book in the cycle. Meanwhile, I'll keep my ears alert for the flapping of scaly wings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Amazon review compared this story to Tolkien's Middleearth and C.S. Lewis' Narnia, but the only thing this story has in common with those books is that it stole the basic concept for the Earthsea series from those classic fantasy series. There is nothing original about the story or the main character. It is obvious the author was trying to write it like it was an epic fantasy soon-to-be classic but to me it was so contrived and cliche. The story was so boring and lifeless that I forgot most it as soon as I finished it. Don't bother reading it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I expected more from this book, given the reputation it's received over the years. It's difficult to read..the reader has to really concentrate to read the countless paragraphs without action. The whole evil shadow thing is very confusing."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who hated this book. I can see how it would make a half-way entertaining children's book, the kind that third graders are forced to read for school, but I can't understand what all the adult reviewers see in A Wizard of Earthsea. There are a hundred things that annoyed me about this book- I'll list a few.1) The names. It seems like a minor thing, but GED?!? I felt sick having to read that name a million times, over and over and over. Earthsea? Wow, imaginative! Not really. All the names of the islands on the little map provided seemed to be random combinations of letters, barely pronouncable and utterly meaningless. I'm not even sure why the islands were named, since only a very few of them are mentioned.2) The language. There actually are places with good description- but very, very few of them... Most of the language that Le Guin uses is dull and boring. Even though the shadow is a main part of the book, she couldn't be bothered to find a single synonym. The result is that the word \\"Shadow\\" is used, on average, about once per page. And these are tiny pages with big writing. Sometimes even if a plot is horrible, I can read and enjoy the book anyway because the descriptions used are interesting and I like the wording used. Not so in this book.3) The characters. Ged is the only character who has any depth whatsoever, and what personality he has is trite and cliched. The other people in the book seem to be there just to move the plot along, without any real effort to make them worthwhile or original.4) The storyline. As a few other people mentioned, the story just hops around. One second Ged is four, then in the next paragraph he's thirteen. You can't skip reading a single word if you want to have any clue as to what is going on, because in just a single sentence, the plot will shift hugely and the reader will be left confused. I was, anyway. Even a seven year old should be able to predict the end right from the beginning- there are no surprises to this book, besides the conspicous lack of attention to details and the poor writing. Another thought for you to consider- since the ending is so completely obvious to just about everyone, is it really necessary to use foreshadowing to \\"tempt\\" us toward the conclusion?5)Problem-solving. How does Ged solve every problem that he faces? With magic, of course. Magic that we never see him learn. It always does seem convenient to have a main character who is a wizard, because it's no longer necessary to actually figure out how things get solved- just write \\"Ged waved his hand a bit and all the bad things went away.\\"6) Useless information packed into the corners. It's often good to have information about the character aside from what is absolutely required to keep the story going. In this case, the author WAY overdoes this. Example: He finds an otak somewhere, who then follows him around. Nevermind that it was specifically mentioned that otaks DON'T like people. But it did anyway, because Le Guin wanted Ged to have some worthless, helpless little creature randomly decide to follow him around so it could lick his face later on in the book and wake him up, even though there was no reason for a lick to have done that.Overall, I say read this book if you want to, since a ton of people seemed to like it, but my personal opinion is that it is one of the most pointless books I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A lot of people (usually the sort of techies that read sci-fi to jerk-off over descriptions of gadgets-mankind-has-never-seen-before) totally mis-understand this book. A lot of very young children who are asked to read under the misconception that it is for them, get confused. You'll find reviews from both sorts on this web-page.The reason is that this is an allegory of emotional life. Ged is a fallible hero who has done something wrong and goes out to try and redeem himself. It's about adolescence and discovering your power and how to apply it to society. It's full of little gems of wisdom like the Arch-mage who dies quietly,going slowly down the road to the land of the Dead, as one who is familiar with that road. Wise men have faced death and have come to understand it.People who have not lived do not understand this book. It is not really fantasy at all, but about a human being's emotional life. Not surprisingly it does not appeal to those who do not know how to live.Unlike the simplicistic (racist, class conscious) plot of Tolkien, this book actually gives you something lasting to apply to life. And don't be put off-it does have odd moments of supreme drama. It develops at the pace that life develops for most of us fast and exciting at puberty / adolescence, quieter echoes later on. And it manages all this in a tiny slim paperback. Tell that to Tolkien.The film-maker Powell/ Pressburger of A Matter of Life &amp; Death fame (another superbly crafted allegory) wanted to make the film. Maybe this detail will afford an inroad to understanding to all those techies who couldn't find a logical, step by step plot that poked two fingers up their nostrils and dragged them thru the book?This review is of the first book only."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Maybe I'm biased against this book because I was required to read it for school, but most of the other books we have read I have loved. This one just annoyed me. It seemed like when you read it there were always certain parts in the book that just didn't need to be there. Filler. If I had taken out all the filler in this book, it would have been at least half as thick. Maybe I'm just not into these kinds of books (although I like most books no matter what they're about), but I found it hard to focus on because of all the unnecessary information, and kind of boring. I personally do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I (12 year old...just above average person) found this book quite challenging and difficult...I didn't understand it but there was some bits that I did understand! the bits I understood where pretty good (they were battle scenes)...only read this book if you are really desperate!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"For those who don't know already: This book is the literary description of some important part of C.G.Jung's psychology: get to know (your own) shadow, the dark side. Fight it, struggle with it, find out that you can't run away from it and ultimately accept it as part of your-self and thus grow and develop with it. I wonder how much the author knew about Jung.Nevertheless, if it comes to fantasy, i prefer Tolkien. He is more skilfull in describing all the details necessary for developing a whole world of its own. Some 200 pages are just not enough for that. Still there are a few sparks of wisdom to be found.a few quotes: Chapter 5 - \\"...From that time forth he believed that the wise man is one who never sets himself apart from other living things, whether they have speech or not, and in later years he strove long to learn what can be learned, in silence, from the eyes of animals, the flight of birds, the great slow gestures of trees.\\" / \\"...Master Herbal had taught him much of the healer's lore, and the first lesson and the last of all that lore as this: Heal the wound and cure the illness, but let the dying spirit go.\\"Chapter 4 - \\"...And the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do...\\""},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is no Lord of the Rings!!!!

He has the potential to become the greatest wizard of Earthsea, but his youthful arrogance keeps getting him in trouble---and may get him killed. A Wizard of Earthsea is the first in this series by Ursula K. LeGuin.I enjoyed this book even though Le Guin uses less narrative than exposition (more \\"tell\\" than \\"show). It's almost like reading something in the style of the Old Testament. After I thought about it, I decided it was not a bad way to present this story. It would have been too drawn out otherwise."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Way back in the dark ages before the Harry Potter books were published, Ursula K Leguin's Earthsea trilogy was widely agreed to be one of the best fantasy series ever written. Like many others from my generation, I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" at least ten times. After recently picking up my old copy, I was pleased to find that the book stands up remarkably well from an adult perspective. LeGuin's writing is, as always, top notch. She uses a simple vocabulary and short, straightforward descriptions, and doesn't include very many big slabs of dialogue. Consequently, the book remains short (183 pages) and moves quickly from one event to the next. The ending is quite suspenseful. Actually, the entire book is quite suspenseful, and the brief conflict scenes draw you in and make you feel like you're in the middle of the action.The characters are another of the novel's biggest strengths. The protagonist, Ged, is a young wizard in training. During an attempt to show off his skills, he accidentally unleashes a shadow from the world of the dead and realizes that he must fix his mistake by tracking the shadow down and destroying it. LeGuin doesn't take the sledgehammer approach to characterization; instead, she lets us see Ged's personality and changes through his behavior. Unlike many other fantasy authors, LeGuin doesn't neglect her minor characters, and she develops the relationships between people with great care.The plot of \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is very tight and well organized, with every major confrontation contributing to the overall meaning. A less talented author could easily have taken twice as many pages and not said nearly as much. The system of magic in LeGuin's world is more imaginative than in many other series, and she includes many episodes where Ged employs his magic powers in clever ways. Overall, LeGuin has the one thing that many fantasy authors lack: the ability to have fun. She makes \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" enjoyably for both children and adults."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea was an interesting book. It's about a precocious boy who is born on the island of Gont. He starts out by learning a bit of magic from his aunt, the village witch, but then the mage of his homeland takes him in as a prentice, and names him Ged. Then the mage sends him off to a wizard school on the island of Roke. There, trying to show off, Ged accidentally unleashes a mysterious, shadow beast that follows him (after he leaves the school) wherever he travels. Finally, the assiduous shadow corners him, and he is almost pulled into the unexplainable darkness, but with the help of his friend Vetch, he makes it through and learns the importance of friendship.Ged also masters throughout the story, the art of wizardry, whether it dark or light, and about courage and believing yourself. I liked this book, but because it was written in the sixties it wasn't very humorous, and also I don't think the story was planned out that well. It did have this quality about it, however, that made it seem ancient and mystical when I was reading it, and I liked that. Harry Potter is very different from A Wizard of Earthsea; the styles of writing are completely different and probably the only similarity between the two is that there is magic involved. I have just started the second book of the Earthsea cycle, The Tombs of Atuan, and I'm liking it more than A Wizard of Earthsea so far. Over all it was a pretty good book, and I recommend it to people who are looking for a probably more out of the ordinary book than others they've read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle has found its place among the great fantasy series of the time. With a vast, colorful, and incredibley original world, readers can't help but feel drawn in. In this first book, we meet Ged, and follow his early adventures. The plot is intriguing, if feeling a bit rushed at times, though a pleasure to read all the same. This quick read leaves you wanting more, which you get if you continue reading the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea is an incrediable story which details the adventures of the young magic-user named Ged. Through many dangers, toils, and snares, Ged discovers he has a powerful gift for magic, and leaves to study at the ancient school of magic on Roke island. But when he accepts a challenge from a fellow student, he releases a deadly shadow from the netherworld, and must journey the earth to battle its dark power and seal it away forever. This story gives you a sence of the medieval past, when the world was filled with mystery and adventure. The story of Ged is one that both children and adults can enjoy for years to come."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Let me first say that if you're looking for a fun, easy read filled with the high fantasy of dragons, spirits, evil lords, and wizards living side-by-side, then this is your book! It is written primarily in a historic point of view about a great wizard in his impetuous youth and the trials and tribulations that he has to undergo to find himself. Le Guin switches from time to time to an insider's voice to show the humanity of the main character, but always returns to her place of historian for the land of Earthsea.Ged, his master Ogion, and his friend's sister, Yarrow are drawn well, but most other character lack any depth. Even the book's villain's personality is not filled out enough to make the reader understand Ged's fear of it. The author could have easily painted this character based Ged's imagination more clearly to pull the reader in more.The characters colorlessness is contrasted with the full breadth of detail afforded to the workings of magic and history of the land. If nothing else draws the reader in it is how Le Guin explains the workings of the ancient art and how it affects the world around it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea is one of fantasy fiction's most unique and endearing series. The world she has created is vivid with culture, magic and mythos, the first installment of which is A Wizard of Earthsea. The novel tells the coming-of-age story of Ged who must solve a riddle to find the hero in himself. Throughout his transformation, Le Guin avoids most clich&eacute; fantasy tropes and renders a very refreshing, human story written in simple, flowing prose. Set in a southeast Asian style archipelago of islands, magic, ancient wisdom and dragons decorate the pages as Ged chases a shadow he's foolishly unleashed upon the world. But it is his wits that he must depend on the most to absorb the lessons he learns along the way and develop into a man in the process. Filled with profound dialogue and touching characters, the story is geared towards young people, but undoubtedly adults can find something novel and worthy of note as well. Eschewing Tolkien-esque fantasy, the fundamental ideology of the novel is Daoist in nature, with a dose of Jungian psychoanalysis thrown in for good measure. This book is highly recommended for those who are interested in knowing what a fantasy world influenced by the teachings of Daoism may be like, or, in a much simpler fashion, as a great way of introducing one's children to the world of fantasy literature with a warm message at its heart."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If you haven't read any Ursula Le Guin, you need to put her at the top of your list! She's way up there with Tolkien, and perhaps the only reason she's not as famous is because she came a bit later and, therefore, like everyone else, is in his shadow.Her writing is beautiful -- lyrical and powerful. I love how she makes all of her words count. They are all necessary, there's no fluff or redundancy -- it's simple, natural, alive, and vivid. Her understanding of different people and cultures (her father was an anthropologist and her mother was a psychologist) enhances her ability to create imaginative, creative, and believable characters and worlds. When you step into Earthsea, you feel like you're in a real world with real people. It's deep and engrossing right from the start. And did I mention that the writing is beautiful? This is what fantasy should be like. I wish there was more fantasy like this.This is the original boy-finds-out-he's-a-wizard-and-goes-to-wizard-school story and it's highly enjoyable for both adults and kids.

If you call this a work of classic fantasy meaning it's a great piece of work that set the foundation - like Lord of the Rings - for a lot of other series, you would be right.A Wizard of Earthsea is the first book in the Earthsea series and as all fantasy series should, it begins with a young wizard, Ged, who knows nothing of magic and the ways of being a wizard, other than his innate ability promising him a career as a great wizard. First he lives with a wise mage, and learns much about the simple things in life and magic and that everything has a cost. He soon discovers this when he performs a dark spell from a book he shouldn't have touched. A deadly shadow is summoned and then banished by his teacher, but Ged knows he will be facing it again.Ged then travels to the isle of Roke where he spends years becoming a master wizard. Upon his graduation, he faces the dark shadow once more but is unable to hold against it and flees in terror. As a renowned wizard now, he travels around the islands helping those less fortunate, battling dragons and other monsters. Then again he faces the shadow and barely survives, fleeing once more. He returns to his old master, unsure what to do. The wizened wizard tells him he must face the shadow and in turn face his greatest fear. And so Ged heads out into the deep sea where none have gone before and there faces the shadow and wages a great battle, finally defeating him. The book ends with Ged returning to land with his friend, now a true and accomplished wizard with the thousands of islands of Earthsea before him.What makes LeGuin's fantasy series more meaningful than most is that all the magic performed here comes at a cost, which the main character has to deal with throughout the book. It requires time and energy, afterwards one is tired; to create illusions is much easier than to actually change or create matter. Unlike the world of Harry Potter, here there are rules; not everyone can be a wizard. Along with this is the magical world of Earthsea with the many many islands of different peoples, a lot of which know little of each other. And for a wizard to travel from one island to another is a great adventure. The next book in the series is The Tombs of Atuan.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to www.alexctelander.com"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Review of Earthsea Trilogy [Written nov 2004]In it's original incarnation (in the 1960's & 70's), this was a trilogy (each book of which is probably short enough to qualify as a 'novella'). The authoress later added 2 more sequels, of which I have only read the first. For me, however, the core of this series is Books 1 & 3. Book 2 was a bit of a dreary and uneventful letdown for me.In any case, the original trilogy is a classic tale of epic fantasy, about how the teenage son of a bronze smith, in an island community of goat herders, discovers his latent talent for magic, has his first brush with dark powers, and then journeys to the fabled school of wizards on the Isle of Roke - where he eventually faces a terrible crisis, and has to rise to the challenge by taking up a great quest.Written in a terse, and fast-to-read style, LeGuin's classic tale also doubles as a parable (morality play) about the great responsibilities that come with power, and the heavy toll that deeds wrought by pride can exact ... and as such, it's a great yarn for both teens and adults alike.I really like this series, and I regularly re-read it every 4 or 5 years.As a final note - this series predates Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series by at least 20 years, and it is only just now that CGI graphics have advanced to the point where classic epic fantasy books like JRRT's Lord of the Rings, and LeGuin's Earthsea novels can at last come to the big screen, to entertain and inspire a new generation of fans. A special made-for-TV mini-series will be coming out on the SciFi channel sometime this coming December."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This has always been one of my favorties. Le Guin creates an independant world where magic is truly real. The characters are well written and believeable and the plot depth is excellent. There is enough action and adventure to satisfy everyone, yet Le Guin weaves an environment complex enough for hard-line fantasy fans. Don't forget the follow up books, The Tombs of Atuin and The Farthest Shore. If you love Tolkein, you will enjoy these too."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A rousing story that chronicles the coming of age of a young man, much like any you would see on the street today.This book hits the heart like few others can, as it is easy to relate to the world of magic and dragons. Just yesterday, as I was driving down the street, someone cut me off, and I instantly was reminded of this book, of the struggles and challenges this young wizard faces as he is brought into the mysterious world of magic. I certainly wished, at that precise moment, that I could blow that other driver away with a bit of magic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book proved to be very unique in its individualistic way. The plot is about a person who was born with wizardian qualities and subsequently had to learn how to use this preternatural gift that was inherited through childbirth. The author, Ursula K. Le Guin, manifested the foundation of Ged's character as having the ability to become a great wizard and eventually led him to acquire knowledge of the Hardic tongue (language). Le Guin took a very clever idea and a synergistic journey by presenting both the combination and separation of the notion of psychological awareness of thought process through illusion, mystery, and language. This conveniently enabled the readership to view the personality of Ged precisely as Le Guin portrayed and presented him.This book also signifies the importance of one mastering the skill and knowledge associated with his specific, identified, and chosen profession. This book further conveys that if one desires to gain power and become skillful in his craft, he must be committed and dedicated to his teachings, coupled with the willfulness to achieve a certain goal. Ged accomplished this when he went to the Isolated Tower and was released early due to his quick learning ability.Notwithstanding, I view this book as sending a profound message, that, \\"in order to be a profectionist, regardless of what gift you may have acquired, there must be a great deal of devotion and sacrifice.\\" Furthermore, the characterization of Ged and Jasper amplifies how a certain personality may not be compatible to another, allowing controversy and conflict to surface. Finally, I found this book to be quite interesting because of the author's ability to vividly express the correlation between reality and illusion, compiled with power and the desire to achieve knowledge through the art of language."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Well, in a way. Just as Captain Ahab hunted the White Whale, so does Ged hunt the black shadow that he has loosed upon the world of Earthsea. Of course, this is all after we read about Ged's childhood on the island of Gont and how he went to Roke and became a wizard.One thing that really surprised me with this book was how poetic it was. There are literally dozens of sentences that have alliteration in them, making this work much more beautiful. And yet, I felt a little let down by the storyline. I guess I was expecting a little more action, such as expecting Ged to became the wizard in command of some army that must turn away the foes from some other island--but it's not so. That's not to say that the book is boring, though. It really is interesting, but just not excellent enough for a harsh critic like me to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea ranks among the Chronicles of Narnia and the Wizard of Oz as the the best fantasy series I have read.

LeGuin is a master at alliteration (if you don't know what that is, look it up), which gives every sentence a dreamlike, poetic quality.

Otherwise, an excellent book. Sparrowhawk is a masterfully created hero and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard Of Earthsea (1968) is one of the finest coming of age novels written during the 20th Century. Grim and unsparing in its depiction of the harshness of existence, the book is nonetheless incredibly wise and beautiful, and should be read by audiences of all ages and backgrounds. With the exception of Tolkien's magnum opus, critics have called Le Guin's initial three Earthsea books the greatest fantasy novels ever written; but the simple truth is that Le Guin's trilogy surpasses Tolkien's achievement, since, without damaging the integrity of her fantasy world, Le Guin infuses her work with ample deep truths that are applicable to all individuals, all times, and all cultures.A Wizard Of Earthsea is the story of Ged, called Sparrowhawk, a young Healthcliffian loner who unwittingly discovers that he has an innate potential for extraordinary magical power. Leaving Gont, the gray, windswept island of his birth to seek training on Roke, the island of wizards, the rough - hewn, sensitive boy foolishly accepts a dare from an envious senior comrade, and thus brings an irrevocable disaster down upon his head.The balance of A Wizard Of Earthsea concerns Ged's comfortless flight from the horror he has raised, as his careless action is one so terrible that its resolution is beyond the power of the even the greatest of Roke's wizards. Earthsea's far - dwelling dragons, of unsurpassable age, erudition, and power, can likewise do nothing to buttress or assist him. Physically and psychically scarred and exiled from mankind by the singularity of his predicament, Ged courageously and responsibly accepts his fate. Accompanied only by a small shrew - like animal that nests in his hood, Ged takes to Earthsea's endless oceans and becomes both the hunted and the hunter of the black, faceless, and unknowable parasite he has unleashed.The fantasy also astutely reflects the psychological truth that archetypal \\"monsters\\" are often, if not always, disenfranchised, wounded, and needy remnants of the very individuals and societies they ostensibly assault and violate.Ged is clearly a Christ figure (Ged / God) and an everyman, and it is to Le Guin's great credit that she conveys both the existential nature of his character and his inexorable destiny in a manner in which the reader can readily identify. Few novels of any genre communicate what it is to be young, ignorant of self - knowledge, misunderstood, emotionally isolated, guilty, and bearing up resourcefully under a terrible burden as powerfully as A Wizard Of Earthsea.As presented, Le Guin's fantasy world is a starkly romantic, autumnal, pre - industrial land of innumerable small islands set in an endless gray sea. The author's sparse, plain - spoken, and nuanced prose combines the stern, unyielding strength of Hilda Doolittle's early Imagist poetry with the psychological profundity of Jung's Memories, Dreams, And Reflections (1961) or Collected Letters (1973). Never less than insightful, A Wizard Of Earthsea is a sad, dynamic novel imbued with the genuine power to educate and inspire its audience about the fundamental difficulties inherent in living."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This wonderful fantasy book stars Ged on his quest to undo his wrong that he unleashed upon the world. A powerful story with moral, sorcery, dragons, friendship, and everything you want from a good book. A fantasy story like no other, I highly recommend it. It is one of those books that makes you think apon your own actions and the effect of them. I may not know alot about books. For I am only 12 years old, but I know when a book makes me feel good. Young or old this story gives a person a chance to go into the unknown."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" about twenty or twenty-five years ago and had completely forgot the tale. However, last week I was in search for something to read, and pulled this paperback off my bookshelf. So here is my fresh perspective having just completed this story moments ago:Note: there are some plot spoilers in my review.First, I could not believe the amount of narrative LeGuin used in this book. She writes about lot of things rather than shows the reader how it has happened (or is happening) as the story unfolds. Now, to be fair, LeGuin does this with very beautiful and poetic language, of which I was able to appreciate and admire, but it is narrative just the same. If you cannot stand this style, I expect you will have a hard time with this book.The first chapter goes contains (mostly) fifteen pages of exposition, and breaks into short dialogue less than 20 times. The narrative usually stays out of the thoughts of the characters and remains rather distant. Many of the remaining chapters follow this model.I can understand that LeGuin was attempting to generate a feeling of ancient lore, since use of her wonderful narrative voice adds to that overall effect, but it make this book read less like a novel and much more like a short section of Tolkien's Silmarillion; a book that was never intended to be read as a novel but more as a history of ancient lore in a style that resembles parts of the Bible.The narrator's voice also avoids deep characterization - seldom do we fully appreciate the thoughts and the full motivations of most of the people that inhabit Earthsea. Due to this style, the only chapters that were very interesting and entertaining to me were Chapters Two through Four - the part of the story in which Ged becomes apprentice to the Mage Ogion and later leaves him to train on the island of Roke in a school for Wizards. In these chapters there is quite a bit of dialogue and interesting interplay between characters. Particularly, there is an intense and interesting wizardly rivalry between Ged (a poor boy raised in poverty) and an older student named Jasper (raised in privilege and wealth) [1]. It is from this contest of wills that brings forth the evil shadow that occupies Ged for the remaining chapters of the novel. It is too bad that LeGuin completely drops this Ged-Jasper conflict utterly once the shadow is let loose on the world, as this was one of the best parts of the story.There is what should have been an interesting \\"side trip\\" in chapter six and seven. LeGuin has Ged venture to a land called Osskil in search of a way to defeat his enemy. Again, here are two more chapters of the story that had great potential, conflict, and mystery that ends abruptly for Ged, who flees without fully understanding what has happened or what powers have contrived to entrap him. The reader may also be likewise disappointed as LeGuin writes the set up very well, and the mystery of the stone is well presented, but the sudden flight ruins the suspense. Ged and the reader do not learn enough through this encounter. Did Ged's shadow drive him to Osskil or did the spirit in the stone pull him there? Did the shadow serve the stone or are they the same; are they part of the same darkness? How and why did this happen? Unfortunately, Ged makes a couple of assumptions ex-post-facto, but it is not satisfying or critical to the plot.The remaining chapters describe conflict, between Ged and the evil shadow released (or created?) by Ged's foolish one-upmanship of Jasper at the wizard school. Long before the end of the book it is quite clear as to how, exactly, Ged would manage to defeat this thing. The reader also will likely understand exactly what the shadow represents as well -again this realization will likely happen before the final chapter.Overall, I think this book is entertaining enough for those that are not put-off by such a narrative style, but it certainly pales in comparison to Tolkien, of which it is constantly compared. There is no valid comparison in A Wizard of Earthsea the rich characterization and sheer storytelling ability contained within The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. As I said earlier, if this work is fairly compared to a style of Tolkien, then it must be compared only to a chapter or section the massive Silmarillion: a collection of unfinished writings and narrative history."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula Le Guin knows how to write about wizards and dragons in such a way that your imagination lives in her words.

I can't wait to read the following books in the Earthsea Cycle."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I picked up this book for my love of fantasy and the reputation of Le Guin. I found the story to be very simple and standard fare for fantasy. The young hero sets out on a quest to save himself/the world. During the quest, he increases his skills and matures emotionally. There are many similarities between this book and The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (one of my favorites). La Guin does break the mold a bit by subtly including non-white lead characters and strong female characters which were tough to find in the genre at the time this book was written."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" may come off as following the traditional archetype of a wizard coming of age in wizarding school and fighting evil, but there are quite a few things that make it unique.For one, when Le Guin wrote the book, that wasn't an archetype. Young adult fantasy didn't really exist then.Also, the book doesn't feature war. Le Guin thinks that stories of wars between good versus evil are over-told and that there are more important stories to tell. The story is about Ged, the protagonist, coming of age, realizing his shortcomings, and overcoming and accepting his personal demons. The conflicts are no less epic and the victories no less sweet for the lack of war.One of the reviews that I read before reading \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" included the line, \\"A 1968 book with a non-white hero! LOVE.\\" Being a white person, I might not have even noticed that fact if I hadn't read the review, but it was both true and heartening.The writing style was different than I'm used to. It had an old-fashioned fantastical lyrical storybook feel. It was interesting seeing a different style, but I think that, while I appreciated the lyricalness, I prefer less whimsical styles.Overall, a very good exploration of humans and meaning."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I came back to this book after a long bout of urban fantasy and dystopian novels in my read pile, and I must admit it was a bit jarring. I read this book for the first time as a young girl, so to be fair to the book, I feel like my review is a combination of my feelings from both times I read the book.A Wizard of Earthsea is a true fantasy book distilled to its purest form. LeGuin does not use many words, and does not waste time with fluff. The me now found this a jarring transition because I find that most of the modern books I read are very descriptive, and focus more on the showing of events and worlds than the telling of the story. At some times, the lack of pronounced downtime and character development felt a tad tedious. Younger me, I felt, had more of an imagination to feel in the gaps. I really do enjoy the story itself. I like that in the Earthsea novels, magic doesn't come from the elements, or pseudo-Latin words, but from holding the power of a things true name. I think that is one of the things I find appealing about faerie mythology, so I enjoy seeing the theme here in a different light. One of the things I like most about this novel, both now and in the past, is it a parable that warns of the consequences of having power and of abusing that power.I'd recommend it if you have a good imagination (or don't mind terser books) and like true fantasy books (wizards, magic, dragons)."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings when I was a kid. I had heard about A Wizard of Earthsea but for some unknown reason never bothered to pick it up. Now, 20 years later, I finally decided to because of the reputation the book has acquired as a fantasy classic.A Wizard of Earthsea certainly deserves its reputation. Although geared towards a young adolescent readership, who will probably be drawn into and affected by the book the most, I found that it pulled me in as well and kept me immersed right to the end. Although the book is relatively short by fantasy standards, the world of Earthsea is beautifully constructed and Ursula LeGuin's writing is spare yet evocative. The story is also compelling and philosophical, drawing on Buddhist/Taoist concepts of the underlying unity of existence and Jungian psychology for an original and thought-provoking fairy tale.I challenge contemporary fantasy authors to whittle down their massive tomes and endless sequels into a tale as simply told yet as powerful and meaningful as A Wizard of Earthsea."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"O.K. you are a middle grade to younger ya reader. You've done Harry Potter, and while you had to trudge a little to get through it, you're now done. What next?Everyone says \\"Narnia\\". People who love it love it like crazy. Some, like me, don't think that much of it. Read the first volume and see if it strikes a chord.There's the Eragon cycle. First volume is very, very clever and well done. I can't get through the rest. They seem sketchy, rushed, shallow and obvious.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is the gold standard, but you know what? You may have to try that two or three times before it grabs you and draws you in.Then there are dozens of other current fantasy sets. from obvious successes like the Riordan Percy Jackson books to less well known ones like the Bemis \\"Clockwork Dark\\".What to do? Well, I was in that place and realized that even though I knew of the Le Guin series, knew the story, and knew of its huge fan base, I had never actually read it. (Sort of like \\"Treasure Island\\", \\"Kidnapped\\", and so on.) The great news is that while the word \\"classic\\" is used pretty carelessly on these pages, it is appropriate here.The biggest problem is that \\"Wizard\\" is such a touchstone that many of its original elements have been copied so many times that it will feel familiar. Don't let that bother you.

And given that, I was let down by the story. The characters leave much to the imagination and are uninspiring. With a story so short and so full of adventure I would have though that I would grow to care about these people. But, that wasn't the case. The story is about a young wizard and his life to maturity, through all the trials of being a child and through manhood. I would say interesting. But, nowhere near the best sci-fi book of all time."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K Leguin has certain exceptional talents as an author. Her best, and most lovely, talent is an unsurpassed style and prose. She is a poet in disguise, quite frankly. Her beauty in expressing herslef is the greatest joy to be found in reading these books. Her style distills meanings without being didactic- the hardest task an author has when trying to convey some message to the reader. The book is a multi-layered story about a boy reaching manhood. The process is standard- a sort of twist on the sorceror's apprentice- a trial the main character (Ged) undergoes to achieve an inner peace. If you read a little deeper, not too simple, you could also catch glimpses of a man struggling with power, and how to deal with great power and not upset delicate balances. A sort of 'playing with fire' tale, if you wish. Leguin creates a charming world, if a bit sleepy (thats part of the charm i suppose). Its not terrifically detailed- it is a novel about a character, to be sure- and its best quality is its mysterious nature. Its a strange place with strange powers and few comforting laws. As i said, Leguins best talent is her beautiful prose. She is, however, not without flaws. Her world is her chief liability. Its not only sleepy- at times its rather dreary. In fact, after reading the book, I came away with the feeling that the world was very chilly and grey, with constant fogs, dreary skies and no sun. It certainly casts a bit of a pall on the events in the book. And the interminable sea rides- riding over a grey sea under a grey sky- can really depress you. I certainly wouldnt want to live in the world she describes here (it gets a bit better in the second book- a desert- barren, but at least not chilly). Finally, Leguin fails in writing a good conclusion. Ged defeats his gnawing shadow in a sort of 'trick' ending that gives the impression of Leguin wiggling out of a problem she created for herself. But, the books are a nice read in the long run. it certainly gets better in the second book (with a character much more interesting than Ged). Fantasy fans who can live without adrenaline will love this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was a great book. It was slow in the beginning, but once I got through the first three chapters it was really good. I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"after reading a lot of dragonlance and tolkien, earthsea was a whole new look on fantasy. one of my favorite subjects in fantasy is magic, and in the earthsea series i found a new, much more realistic side to it. the bookis written in children-style but for those who look deeper into it, it reveals deep and sofesticated messages. the power of words is shown here as a magical power which controls the things in the world of earthsea, when in our reality it is quite close to that as words can be a very powerfull thing in comunication with other beings. there are more of these thoughts buried deep or shallow in the series and in this book there maybe are more than in the others. therefore i dare put Orsula K. Le-Guin on one plain with J.R.R Tolkien which, untill now, i thought the best fantasy writer. tolkien's greatness was in his language and sofesticated details, le-Guin's is in the messages behind the story itself which is nevertheless an interesting, mystical adventure which anyone will doubtless enjoy.it's a great loss that the series wasn't as detailed as tolkiens novels, i sure would like to know much more of the ancient language(especialy the runes), and the customs of earthsea... our loss."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"My favorite book, the second being the last in this trilogy. Ged the wizard.. his adventures mirror my own in so many ways, unleashing a shadow of my own vanity or anger or aloneness, for whatever it was, it was made of himself. I related to this story in so many ways, and the peace of the final pages somehow was my own. The long voyage over the sea, and the description of the land of death, running down the hill to save the dieing child... It is all so vivid, original, and living. I read this book often. I loved the first time I met the wizard school, and all the long studying to learn the crafts of bringing from the invisible to this world ones intention. Ged is the moral compass, who does only what he must do, and so follows a pathvoid of desire, and filled with the will of the shadow he follows. His simply cottage and the pleasures of being warm in old weather, of having a friend to talk to in long lonely seasons is here described with perfect simplicity. The fact that he is a magic wielder .. well lets say its far more elequent than the cartoon animation of the book.I was sad that Harry Potter took so much from this work and yet it did not enjoy any of the big attention. Perhaps because it is a deeper, greater work. Or maybe because it was one of the first of its kind, before things we marketed. I think of it, of the writer, like Rickie Lee Jones, having created so many things in her work that were taken by others and yet she seems to have received little credit for the paths she forged. Ursula Le Guin might be associated with leftist politics but they really have nothing to do with the story. The fact that the protagonist and most of the characters are black and brown never made me think twice. They were as easily heros to me as any Tolkien .. and maybe more so, for his only flaw was to include the terrible British social hierarchy that is at times embarrassing, but understandable, for we cannot suddenly become what we have never been. We must walk a path out of the dark. So his remarks of ' tell your master' and so forth can be forgiven, if only a little bit, for he had no imagined a world in which these things we not necessary to his characters... Ursula carefully wove her characters from classless, or from what at the time of the writing were the lower classes. But it does not come off that way. In future times, as now, no one will know that the idea of black protagonists was rather revolutionary. In factI still have not seen many in fiction, but of course I do not read much fantasy anymore."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Before I started reading this book I was unsure weather this would be a good investment of my time. While I usually like books like this, for some reason I was not expecting much from it. I was happily proven wrong however and it turned out to be a highly addicting book,and I ended up plowing through it in two nights reading. Sadly it is very short coming in at just over 180 pages, but it was good enough I am going to give the other books in the cycle a try, and if you are into fantasy books I would not hesitate to recommend this to anybody that can appreciate a good fantasy book.Oh, and I forgot to mention, this book covers a VAST landscape, you will NOT get bored of the scenery lol."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I liked this book because it's orgianal and it has charm to it. the book is hard to put down it's so good.

I read this book when I was a child, but I found it much more interesting as an adult. Le Guin creates a world with it's own definition of magic, where the highest power is commanding something by wielding its true name. one of Ged's classes is simply learning the names of everything, and I found this simple but powerful. Some people will compare this Harry Potter. Potter is more detailed and comprehensive while Earthsea is more thematic and brief. I recommend reading them both."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I thought A Wizard of Earthsea was a great book. It was THE fantasy book to read. It was full of magic, action,and friendship. The theme of the story was that you shoudn't be arrogant. I'd recommend this book to anyone, ecspecially people who like fantasy.(If you think you're intrested in reading it, check out my overview)A Wizard of Earthsea was about a boy named Ged. At birth, he was gifted with extraordinary powers. At the age of 13, he crossed into manhood and was taken as the prentice of the Wizard Ogion. Ged decided that he would rather go to a school of wizardry, so he went to school on the island of Roke. After about a year on Roke, Ged challenged an older boy to a duel. Thinking that he could surpass what the others said he couldn't do, Ged attempted to raise a spirit from the dead. In doing so, he failed and loosened a \\"shadow\\" of neither the realm of the living nor realm of the dead. It is now Ged's duty to rid the world of it--before it rids the world of him."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This was magical book with lots of cool meaning. In this book there is a very delicate balance and as a wizard Ged had to understand the boundary of being in this balance. Obcourse Ged is a very haughty and challanging kid that does not respect this balance. Because of his obnoctious character, Ged lets off a ghost (his evil shadow) and through the story he runs from it in the dark but cant get rid of it. He then learns the way to defeat it is to say its name. However he cant figure out what its name was. Ged finally gets older and wiser and figures out the ghost is himself and he must face it... It has lots of action with dragons and fights and spooks! WOW what a book!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea began slowly but ended with a bang. In the first five chapters, I only found one adventure that truly kept my interest. It was not until the sixth or seventh chapter that I became interested in Ged, the protagonist, and his adventures. The storyline reminds me of the typical teenage boy who wants to be free and not live by the rules that are set for him until he gets himself in too deep and eventually must find his way home again. Le Guin throws some magic in the mix and comes out on top with A Wizard of Earthsea. In this story, Ged is the young man that does not want to live by the rules. He allows his jealousy and need to impress people with his skill as a mage to get the best of him, until he unleashes an evil that wants to crush his soul. Ironically, Ged realizes that home, which for him is with Ogion his Wizard Master, will set him free. I did find some passages too tedious to even read that I would skim through those dry parts, but I held out and finished the novel. I am glad I did because by the last chapter, I could not wait to find out how Ged conquers his demon. Not only does Le Guin take the reader through an exciting come-of-age journey, but she also teaches the reader a moral lesson. Unfortunately, I have no desire to read the rest of the series"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read the book A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K.

WhileI don't remember the details of the earlier books, I do remember thefeeling I had entering her world. And the blend of moral insight, magical powers and occult dangers seems like a familiar and slightly disquieting scent.Le Grin undoubtedly is a skilled myth-maker. Her protagonist is a young man who is learning to use his magical powers. Her world is sparsely but I think rather well realized. (Her maps are more real-looking than Tolkien's.) The outline of the book is rather similar to the great Chinese classic Journey to the West: a hero of great power overreaches himself and is forced to set out on a journey to learn (among other things) humility and self-control. Along the way Le Grin drops the reader thoughts to chew on for a while. &quot;Magic consists in this: the true naming of a thing.&quot; (How does that apply to modern genetics?) &quot;The price of the game is the peril of losing one's self.&quot; (True whether the game is business, the occult, or modern science.)The ease with which Le Grin's hero, Ged, works magic, I think, threatens the plot and the imaginable quality of her world sometimes. Ged flits from island to island so easily that the world becomes rather too dream-like. He is in danger of becoming too strong to have adventures. The story is about his taming to good, like the Monkey King. Yet one gets the feeling that in Le Grin's world, evil is ultimately stronger. Perhaps this is why her world feels less real, and less enjoyable, to me than those of Tolkien or Lewis, based on a Christian psychology, or that of Journey to the West, based on a rather cheerful Buddhism. Nor do I think her insight or imagination can really be compared with Tolkien in Lord of the Rings or Lewis in Till We Have Faces. And her world seems to have less humor than the other three. While I enjoyed the creative realization of her story, and felt as if she were bringing me near to some depths of psychological insight, I felt a little dizzy from the journey, and was glad to be back on terra firma. But I'll probably take another short visit before long.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man..."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have read the whole trilogy and think it was a terrific set of books.

It involved reading 3 books by an author on a specific list. He recommended Ursula LeGuin. So I gave her a try. First I read The Word For World is Forest, a book about an alien people trying to release themselves from the oppression the humans from Earth are inflicting on them. Then I read The Eye of the Heron, an amazing book. It starts out telling you about a group of convicts sent to Victoria, the new planet. Then the peace loving people are sent there because there is no room for them on Earth. The peace loving people are oppressed by the descendants of the convicts and are forced to release themselves by civil disobedience (yes I know you've heard of it). Well anyway, back to A Wizard of Earthsea. This book was imaginative and overall a pretty good book. I'm sorry, I haven't read The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, so I can't compare. Well here I am finishing up the I search at 3:00 in the morning on the day it's due. Wish me luck (for an A)."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It has been years since I finished reading the science fiction book \\"The Legends of Earthsea\\" by Ursula K. Le Guin. There is nothing at all to complain about when describing this book. If I can remember it from 3 years ago and be able to discuss it today, then that proves it's a good book in my opinion. It is my most favorite book of all time up to date.\\"The legends of Earthsea\\" is about a young boy named Ged who lives in a small village on the isle of Gont. Ged does not like his lifestyle on the island at all, because all he does is help his father smith. Ged knows that his abilities far exceed that of a mere smither, because he continuously has visions. These visions show a girl in a dark labyrinth, and she is running away. Ged has no idea what this means, but he knows that he has special abilities.Ogion, a wizard that resides on Gont, advises Ged that maybe he should go to the isle of Roke. Roke has a school for people with wizard-like abilities, and only accepts those who have specially written recommendations from Arch Maguses. When Ged gets there, he becomes quick friends with Veg, a student who has enrolled there. However, he is also challenged, challenged to a duel in wizardry, by Jasper. In this challenge, Jasper says that Ged could never summon a spirit if his life depended on it. However, his life would have been much better off he did not summon one. Ged summons a dark spirit and releases it into the world.Throughout the book, Veg and Ged seek the demon, flee from the demon, and seek it again. Ged knows that the only way to defeat Debith is to confront it and speak its true name.The story line of this story is good because it always leads you along on the hunt. It's a story that takes you with Ged on his journey to defeat the Debith, and as he does this, he learns many lessons and skills along the way. From sailing across many oceans, to evading the wrath of dragons, Ged travels all over earthsea for the answer he needs to defeat this evil he has released.I would recommend this book to everybody because this is not a boring book at all! Also, read the entire trilogy, because it gets better after the first book, much better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Simple and poetic.

A Wizard of Earthsea doesn't quite fit the bill.Not that it's bad.Le Guin is a great writer. Her use of language is terrific, very reminscient of Tolkien. However, like Tolkien, the narrative favors the story rather than the characters. The story is episodic in nature, and the characters (there's really only one main character) are not developed the way we're used to in today's fiction. Don't expect Charlie from Lost.Still, a fascinating story."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The story is decent, though it suffers from the third person omniscient pov. Most of it is exposition, with very little feeling from the characters.But my primary review, and the rating of one star, is because of the narrator. His voicings are terrible. Even worse is how he speaks, screaming, stuttering, breaking up words and pronunciations in ways that no one would ever speak.

The story follows a young man named Ged, from the moment he said his first spell, not knowing what the words meant, to the days when he is a powerful wizard. Ged is probably one of my all time favorite charactors, because all though he is very powerful he has his flaws, and it was his reckless pride that changed the world forever.

This book is thoughtful and full of a quiet beauty, reflecting not only the author's knowledge of anthropology but quite a lot of wisdom about humanity as well. If you like flashy sword-and-sorcery fantasies in the pulp tradition, this won't be for you; on the other hand, if you are in the mood for something that reaches beyond the normal smothering cliches, give it a whirl. No, it isn't Tolkien, but for heaven's sake, it's not even the same sort of story--can't compare Dickens to Dinesen, can you? And check out Ms. LeGuin's other works.

This book was the start. I have been wanting to read this book for years. I bought it quite some time ago and finally found some time this weekend to give it a read.This book was published in 1968. I was interested to read the book to see how many elements of fantasy have been taken from her work. The book is short being under 200 pages. In the fantasy world it is not uncommon to read a 500+ page book in a long series.I will admit that I struggled at first stay interested in this book. It is all about personal taste. It was not so much about the writing or story line as it had everything I typically like. However, it just did not grab me. I almost felt bad for thinking this way as hundreds of people just rant and rave about how great this series is. I posted at about page 109 on Goodreads.com that I was thinking of putting the book down.I am glad I did not. I decided to finish the book to give it the proper time it deserved. One Ged finally turned himself around and went after his main voyage I became quite interested. I think it was because the journey paralleled the many thoughts and ideas of my personal goals I create for myself. I was able to relate to his mindset. I am actually in the process of applying this novel to some principle of my GETTING IT DONE blog series and book I am writing.I am glad I read this book. Not a favorite of mine, but one that I think deserves to be read by and fantasy fan. I can see why so many would like this book and series. I think many middle grade students would love this story. It is a great stepping stone to the much larger volumes. Despite myself not liking this story as much as I had hoped for, please don't let that deter you from reading. I think many people will really like this story. I guess I need to jump back into the A Song of Fire and Ice series and begin book two to satisfy my cravings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I started reading A Wizard of Earthsea briefly after finishing the first Twilight book.

The author mercifully refrained from adding kitsch and characters ad infinitum without thought of future theme park possibilities or products to be placed or plastic replicas to be sold from here to eternity. A truly original tale as well, with nothing borrowed, overused, hackneyed or hijacked from countless cliches found in contemporary fantasy series that leave so little to the imagination. A true treasure."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I had seen the miniseries on SyFy a few years ago when it used to be the SciFi Channel. I enjoyed the miniseries, so I thought I'd like the book. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book was drastically better than the miniseries.Le Guin's writing style is distinctive. In most of the other books I read, dialogue is the main driver of the action. Usually, the formula is: set the stage, provide a lengthy exposition of something that occurs within a brief amount of time, then provide a transition to get to the next lengthy exposition.For example, consider the six Star Wars movies. They each fit into a chronology where a lot of time passes in between each movie, but each one movie concentrates on events that transpire over a few days.Le Guin does the exact opposite. There is amazingly little dialogue in the book, and we rarely get a full conversation. Rather, we get to see important snippets of what's said. Le Guin instead concentrates on the overall story arc of Ged/Sparrowhawk's life. She tells the story as one relating a legend while sitting around a campfire. The words are flowery with plenty of metaphors. With the lack of dialogue and other fillers, the writing is dense, and the pace can be very quick at times. At the blink of an eye, a year or two can pass. Even with only twenty or so pages left to read in the book, I wondered how she could finish the book with so little paper left, but I should not have feared - she ended it well.Le Guin has the talent of describing concepts that otherwise wouldn't make much sense - but somehow she makes sense of it. For example, here's an excerpt of her explaining the strange coldness of the Court of the Terrenon.\\"From these windows Ged looked out, as he kept by himself in his high tower-room, day after day, dull and heartsick and cold. It was always cold in the tower, for all the carpets and the tapestried hangings and the rich furred clothing and the broad marble fireplaces they had. It was a cold that got into the bone, into the marrow, and would not be dislodged. And in Ged's heart a cold shame settled also and would not be dislodged, as he thought always how he had faced his enemy and been defeated and had run. ... And he would watch the snow falling, thin and ceaseless, on the empty lands below the window, and feel the dull cold grow within him, till it seemed no feeling was left to him except a kind of weariness.\\"Doesn't that just give you the shivers? Oh, and did you notice how much time had elapsed in that short passage? It's impossible to know exactly how much time passed, but it certainly feels like a long time. (Okay, now I'm feeling a little depressed.)I recommend this book for anyone seeking a fantastic epic with vignettes that will stick with you for years."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Duny is no ordinary boy. He has a true name, a nickname, and the one given to him at birth. He's a boy shaped around words. In this world words have become very important, especially when it comes to naming. When he leaves for Roke, the magical island renown for its school of magery, it's with youthful fantasies of turning himself into any creature he desires, of changing mundane objects into marvelous ones, and unrealistic ideas of power--with none of responsibility. In the land of Earthsea, names are very powerful; language is the very thing used to harness the world's greatest strengths and manipulate reality the way it was never meant to be.A Wizard of Earthsea (first published in 1968) has the lyrical and romantic command of a legend. It's one of those books I wish I had read as child. I'm sure I would have fallen in love immediately. How could I not? I've already fallen in love. It's adventurous with magic and wonderfully sentient creatures, and a map I found myself placing my finger on to trace the path of Ged's boat. Oh, the map. Earthsea unfurled beneath my fingertips. I could almost feel the mountainous terrain of Gont, the saturated grasses of Roke Knoll, the wintry court of Terrenon. Surprisingly, the map gave a vast scale to a journey that was now measurable by sight as well as description. But description alone would have done the job quite well.Le Guin doesn't seem to waste a phrase. She's mastered her diction and molded a narrative that invites a measured reading. There is no rushing here. The language is poetic; Le Guin's prose lingers long after the book is closed and lifts my mind to the beyond--to worlds we can inhabit only in our dreams and imagination. And what an imagination she has herself--what beautiful writing. Le Guin is at heart a story-teller. She has the type of narrative voice easily read aloud (in fact, I couldn't stop thinking that someone should be reading this to me). There's something organic about her writing, something wonderfully intoxicating that reaches up from the very depths of a tradition that goes further than the printed word.As I read about Ged and his magical quest, finding friends and making enemies along the way, I suddenly found myself feeling as enchanted with the story as I have by only a handful of stories since I was a child. The Hobbit, The Once and Future King, these are books that speak to the soul with some mysterious and intuitive soul language; A Wizard of Earthsea deserves a place of honor next to both. It's as much a coming of age story as it is a tale of a young boy who learns how to test his limits. He develops lasting friendships and comes to understand the darkness deep within himself is tempered only by the light, which he must also recognize.This is a difficult book for me to write about. I don't just want to talk about it, I want to share it with you. The characters sometimes fall into these difficulty childish roles influenced by misunderstandings and jealousies. Ged clearly and quickly identifies Jasper as an enemy, if at first only as a rival in his seniority, due in part to his curiously cultivated, subtly sarcastic attitude. These are characters we must see through Ged's eyes to best understand his motivations and weaknesses. And he is nothing if not prideful and impatient, eager to impress others and become recognized for the glory he imagines in the talent and accomplishments of magery, rather than temperament or restraint.His actions are not only influenced by who he is (or who he thinks he is), but by his intentions. This is a book that contains such subtle and non-subtle messages of responsibility and kindness, honoring the sacrifices of friends, and the intrinsic relationship people share not just with each other, but with all creatures and objects of nature. Ged has to find his place in the world, but to do so, he has to discover his limits. And so he reaches out by islands and boats, on foot and through air, at times running away from or toward his fears, back into the arms of friends and out into palaces of those that wish him no good. He travels everywhere and back again, even to the ends of the world, determined to find equilibrium without ever realizing that is what he yearns for the most. To be at peace is to find balance within one's soul and to accept that which is good and that which is bad. Knowing when and how to act is Ged's most difficult journey and harshest lesson.A Wizard of Earthsea may be a short novel, but it leaves a lasting impression. It's a type of bildungsroman with an awareness of itself as the stuff of fairy tale and legend. The text even refers to itself through the narrator as a story we all must have heard before, concerned with characters we might know in bits and pieces. Whether or not Ged's tale is true, or if different versions conflict with each other, we have this one here which even references other legends and tales outside of itself, but altogether within the realm of Le Guin's fantasy. Surely there's darkness and adventures with perilous and light-hearted outcomes, but Le Guin has created something cognitive and tightly woven. Anyone, no matter the age, will find something to enjoy about it. You never know. Perhaps it will be the dragons."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula LeGuin is that rarity in fiction writing: a writer who takes a genre and treats it as serious literature. More, she has done this not merely in science fiction, with novels like \\"The Left Hand of Darkness,\\" but here, with the first of her Earthsea series, fantasy as well. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a novel that puts ideas first, characterization second, and world building and plot third (plot and world building are usually the first and main focus of fantasy-- see \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"). Most remarkably, though, is the fact that LeGuin succeeds spectacularly at all levels in this novel.Written like a myth rather than a straightforward narrative, the story of Ged is one of acquired wisdom, learning that power-- in this case through magic-- is itself dangerous to the one who wields it. LeGuin visits this again in later books of the series, but never as well as she does here, and it is a point usually missing in the heroic fantasy that focuses on battles and quests. If I had to guess, I'd say this is why LeGuin is taken seriously as literature and most other fantasy authors are not. Again, this is a novel of ideas, and it tells us clearly that the greatest enemy we will ever face is ourselves and our own failings. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" may be a fantasy, but its ideas could not be more real."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have nothing to add to the glowing reviews that already make up the body of this catalogue. This book made the same sort of impression on me as a child that the Bible, Torah or Koran might make on a religious person. It is, in my opinion, a superior example of flawless storytelling and I cannot praise it highly enough.Buy two- one for yourself and one to give to someone you love deeply."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I can see why many people love the book and many people don't.Story:The story follows the early years of Ged, and how he became the greatest sorcerer of Earthsea. Throughout the adventure, there are a lot of timeless themes: Good vs. Evil, Light vs. Dark, self discovery, friendship, growing up, compassion... Because Earthsea deals with self discovery, your age and life experiences will shape the way that you view the story. Younger readers can grow up with Ged and older readers can reflect back on their childhood memories. These themes transcend generations so everyone should be able to enjoy the story to some degree.World:Earthsea is a medieval fantasy world mostly covered by water. Think of the Earth that you know, if the seas rose about 100 feet. There is a magic system based on willpower and knowing the 'true names' of things, but there are also dire consequences for those who don't respect its power. Dragons also exist in the world of Earthsea, so if you've got a place in your heart for dragons, that's a plus.Writing Style:The story is linear and chronicles the major events of Ged's life. Each 10-20 page chapter represents a challenge that Ged faced: Saving his village from raiders, going to magic school, confronting a dragon... Nearly all of the major events are wrapped up neatly in each chapter. Because the book is so fast paced, the details are used sparingly (but effectively) and at times the story just whizzes by. The pacing is good for readers that just want to know what happened to Ged. But, if you're the type of reader that wants to visualize the whole adventure and craves depth, then you're not going to like this book at all.Characters:There are a few interesting characters in the book and most of them are likeable, but they really don't get much screen time.Action:There is a bit of action in the book and it's suitable for all ages.Overall:This is a good story that mostly breaks the, \\"Show, Don't Tell\\" Rule. On the plus side, it's incredibly easy read and the events in the story are good. The fast pace of the book and universal themes are good for younger readers. (This book could easily have been 500 pages instead of 197.) But if you're a fan of rich details, great dialogue, exciting action, and a story that pulls you in, you'll be disappointed with the book. It's more like hearing someone describe the life of Frodo Baggins or Harry Potter in 15 minutes, than reading Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter and experiencing the journey for yourself."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"As strange as this may seem, I sought out a book by Ursula K. LeGuin because of one of those crazy online quizzes--this one in particular was supposed to determine which fantasy author's works I most \\"identified with.\\" My result was Ursula K. LeGuin and I'm embarrassed to admit that I had never even heard of her until that moment. I stumbled across this audiobook on iTunes and figured it was the perfect opportunity to give LeGuin a try.In the end I'm glad I did, and now I intend to try to get my hands on more of her books. LeGuin's start to the Earthsea series definitely has the feel of classic fantasy. This was the first time I had ever listened to a fantasy novel instead of reading it, and while I found it was a little more difficult to keep up with things at times, it was definitely enjoyable to listen to. This particular audio rendition must be fairly old--it sounded as if it was copied from an old recording and the reader sounded like a storyteller, as opposed to the perfect readings that you find on audiobooks today. It's hard to explain the difference, but it really did not sound as if the reader was reading straight from the book, and I found that to be a plus when listening.As for the story, it is a bit of a different take on wizards and their quests. Ged's quest is not so much to save a world, as it seems is the case with so many fantasy books, but rather to clean up a \\"mess\\" that he made as a boy in training to become a wizard. Of course, along the way there are other side adventures and we watch Ged grow and mature through the years. The story is a bit dry, but the writing seemed fairly colorful and flowed nicely. All-in-all I thought it was a great example of fantasy literature and certainly a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Rented this movie and it was lame, read a review and it spoke of the trilogy in book form...I am in the middle of book 2 and it's so much better then the movie, what a shock...I'm not sure why movie directors can't stick to the main story line, it's a pity."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book arrived well before the expected date and was a great buy.

I liked it, thinking it good but not great and certainly not anywhere near as good as 'The Hobbit' or any of the Narnian Chronicles.

It tells the story of simple country-folk type Ged encountering both the wide world around him as well as the darkness that dwells within himself.Earthsea is populated with straightforward individuals and a smattering of magical, otherworldly beings (including dragons). It is a standard fantasy world, and the coming-of-age tale of Ged is a standard fantasy plot. LeGuin's famous focus on the importance of names and their relation to being able to do magic is an interesting twist.Perhaps given its age (first published in the 1960s, I believe) the book was groundbreaking at the time. Read now, it is simply a solid novel that beckons one to read the next."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea is an interesting story of a young boy, named Ged, in search of his own identity. Ursula Le Guin uses very vivid descriptions to expand the depth of the readers understanding of the scenery and of the characters of her story. Ged starts off as a young, curious boy, interested in all that is unknown to him, and wanting to acquire the knowledge of wizardry. His quest leads him through many trials and tribulations. His learning starts with the local witch, his Aunt, to his beloved master, Ogion, who warns him of his wanting to learn too quickly, and then to the known school of wizardry. The most obvious of these trials is the birth of the shadow, which is released through his pride, arogance and ignorance of the unknown. His first fear and then quest for the \\"shadow\\" is the true test of gained knowledge of his own identity. His misuse of pride in his skill brings him a humility that is needed for him to fullfill his destiny and to become the greatness that all but him are aware he will be.While this book is full of adventure and insight, it is, in some places, difficult to get through. The scenes are long, and in great detail, which looses the readers interest. It is the ending that is the most interesting for those interested in double imaging and the human psyche. Though the book is not very long, it makes for a long read. If you look at this story as a preface to the adventures of Ged as the \\"Archemage\\" of Earthsea, then it makes it much more interesting. I am interested in seeing how the other two stories to the trilogy are written, and wether or not this preface is worth it's attention to detail."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book is so good! I just love how it talks about all the magic and people in this world where demons, dragons, and wizards are almost common place.

This book contains excellent descriptions that give you the true feeling of what the stroy wants to get across. The stunning descriptions make the whole world of Earthsea seem real and very enchanting. The book also gives you a sense that it could be real because of all of the little restrictions that people and wizards have. You might think that a wizard could not be stopped, but this book gives lots of things that wizards must obey to keep the balance. This book also shows distinct character development of the main character. The book shows how he gradually faces his fears and overcomes it. Also, there is a late climax that keeps you interested until the very end of the book. The world of Earthsea seems real for the fact of the people in the book. The people are not all nice and willing to help the wizard. Most of them give him the cold shoulder, and yell a spiteful curse at him. At points in the book I feel sorry for the wizard because it seemed like he had no friends. As the stroy comes to a close, it makes you think about how power c an be abused. It also makes you think of the consequences of your actions. You never know when you might release an evil."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was truly excellent. I enjoyed this wonderful series very,very,much.

Had I not read Tolkein's &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; trilogy, this novel would have received 5 stars. I found the two worlds to be comparable in some ways, yet very different in others.

Others, like myself, had known Ms. LeGuin's name from literary sources (Ms. LeGuin has had her stories selected for inclusion in the prestigious, annual Best American Short Stories series).

And they were disappointed since except some LeGuin's, Tolkien\`s and maybe few other authors' books fantasy is not a good literature. In the short commentary to the Polish edition of the novel S. Lem has stressed its main valor: it is self-contained and complete. You cannot find in it any unnecessary &quot;gadget&quot; just for amazement of the reader, everything has its meaning and role in the Earthsea world. On the other hand - you cannot remove magic from the novel; words-spells are its building material as well as they are building material of the world created. &quot;Words are acts.&quot; The Earthsea books are often compared to Tolkien's works but they are rather complementary than concurrent. Tolkien derived his creation from the linguistic research which is mostly hidden, while LeGuin exposed the central role of language in the creation. Certainly, if you dare build the whole world of words you should know how to use them. But this is just a writer's job - and LeGuin proves she is a very good writer. There is one more good reason why &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is worth reading - it is a novel about human beings and human problems, showing true meaning of choice and responsibility. It is wise and well-written, rarity in sf and fantasy literature.

I couldn't make myself read through anymore of this mind-numbing ode to boredom.To be fair, the author starts out with a good premise in this book. A young man discovering unknown powers, craving even more power, learning caution through a harsh lesson that costs a life and then he sets out on a quest to right the wrong he's done. It's a great formula and the glimpses we see of the characters show that they were good enough to pull it off. But that's the problem; glimpses were all we ever got.The author suffered greatly from \\"telling\\" instead of \\"showing,\\" that is, telling us what happened instead of letting it unfold through circumstances and dialogue. As a consequence, all of the characters remained two dimensional and severely underdeveloped. I wanted to care about them but there wasn't anything there to care about.One of the big climactic scenes in the book, Ged raising the dead, was pretty close to anti-climactic simply because the author didn't have either the patience or the desire to develop the scene more.Many scenes in the book suffered from that failing, especially the ending, which was a huge letdown. All that build-up and we're left with what? An overly confusing layer of images (badly described scene) where Ged's facing off against himself? Sure, it's supposed to be deep and meaningful, but it comes off as trite and dull. Much like the rest of the series, actually. And no, it being geared towards young adults doesn't excuse any of its faults; there are many sci-fi/fantasy YA books out there and so many of them are better than this series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Published in 1968, 1971 and 1972, Ursula Le Guin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\" is widely regarded as a fantasy classic on a level not far from epics like Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and C.S. Lewis' \\"Narnia Chronicles\\". The story begins with a young man named Ged, commonly called Sparrowhawk, who receives training to become a wizard. His training in wizardry at the wizard school on the island of Roke begins with the power of illusion. Most magic merely involves the apparent change from one thing to another. But Ged is a brilliant student, and soon progresses to the true magic of changing. \\"Magic consists in this, the true naming of a thing\\" - when one knows the true name of an object, one can begin changing things. \\"Illusion fools the beholder's senses; it makes him see and hear and feel that the thing is changed. But it does not change the thing. To change this rock into a jewel, you must change its true name. And to do that, my son, even to so small a scrap of the world is to change the world.\\" This also applies in the world of men: \\"Who knows a man's name, holds that man's life in his keeping.\\" But true magic is perilous: it affects the broader world, and can upset the balance of the world \\"Rain on Roke may be drouth in Osskil.\\" Tempted by pride, hate and revenge over against Jasper, another student wizard, Ged tries calling forth a spirit of the dead and succeeds only in bringing a shadow of evil into the world. LeGuin does not justify Ged's actions, but clearly portays his actions as the result of pride and hate, and resulting in ruin. Like ourselves, Ged is a hero with flaws and must now live with their consequences. In a manner not unlike a dark horror novel, this evil shadow now hunts Ged, and his quest is to hunt it in order to remove it from his world.It's a gripping story, almost too dark at times, at least for young children. But unlike some other popular fantasy novels, the magic here bears a close connection to the occult. In Le Guin's world, a wizard is a respected adviser who plays a role similar to a religious leader in our world today. His spiritual role includes aspects that are being popularized under the name of Wicca and similar pagan religions. It's obvious that Le Guin's magic is pure fantasy, but the way it is worked out seems to closely resemble contemporary paganism, and this made me somewhat uncomfortable and question the suitability of this series for young children. Unlike the Harry Potter series, this fantasy is much more serious (like Robert Jordan's World of Time there are also influences of Taoism) and never trite. Like the Taoist yin-yang, Ged is driven by both evil and good desires; even the concept of the shadow has overtones of Jungian philosophy - modern readers have seen the book as model of Jungian psychology. But this aside, there's no question about how gripping Le Guin's plot is, and how vivid her world. It's no wonder this book won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in 1969, and Le Guin has proven herself by winning several Hugo and Nebula awards with other titles. I look forward to reading the rest of the series! -GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I really wanted to love this book. It was given to me by a friend with the recommendation that it was an excellent book and that I would love it since I read a lot of other fantasy novels and this was right up my ally. I wouldn't necessarily say that I was disappointed, but perhaps that the book did not live up to my expectations. The story itself was interesting, though a bit cliched, at least in this day and age: (Possible Spoilers)A young boy exhibits unusually strong magical powers and it's contently obvious that he is going to grow up to become the greatest wizard in Earthsea, in part because the author tells you flat out that he does so. It really ruins any suspense because you know he's not going to die, or even lose a battle because he is obviously the greatest wizard ever. The ending is also anti-climactic, with the final battle taking fewer than three pages despite the fact that the wizard has been chasing and fighting this creature for the past hundred pages and that this being is supposedly this great evil that has no true name among other characteristics that make it so deadly and dangerous.The writing is a bit sparse. Ged, the wizard, is not always characterized well. He seems a bit flat at times and while the story has very interesting moments, battles with dragons and an excellent chase across the sea, it is also written in a fairly flat tone and occasionally seems hollow, without substance or anything to really grab onto in order to attach the reader to the story. I actually enjoyed the character of Vetch a lot more than I did that of Ged, and Vetch is simply a minor character.Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I've read quite a bit of fantasy and heard a lot of good things about this book and I hoped it would be a wonderful read. That being said, I think Le Guin is an adept writer, and will certainly be trying some of her other writing to see if this can be improved upon and if it was in fact my own bias that got in the way."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If you have seen the SciFi channel miniseries and were even moderatly intriged this book is a must read. A comming of age story that can be enjoyed equally by adults and younger readers alike."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was so incredibly awsome I cannot even describe! To see Sparrowhawk grow from a young boy who entranced goats, to a man who mastered his own inner deamons was a great journey. This book is full of magic and mystery more than you could imagine. The thought of a gibbeth coming after me terrified me to my very soul!!

I am glad I did. The characters were great, and it was nice to be able to read a book and the references made to herbs, and plants, and certain rules of magick to ring true. Too often a writer is afraid of being persecuted due to the realistic tone of the book. I praise this author for not being one of them. The book has good plots and great characters.

Le Guin, is about a boy, Ged, gifted in magic and the greatest wizard in all Earthsea, with an even greater destiny. But when still young and in training, he utters a spell that even he cannot control and releases a terrible shadow-creature into the world. He flees in fear until he realizes that he must face the terrible creature in order to be rid of it. Ursula Le Guin did an excellent job in writing this book. &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is the first book of her Earthsea Cycle,consisting of four other books. I think the only way it could have been improved is if this book had a more interesting beginning, but if you stick to it you will be rewarded! I would recommend this book to people who like J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, or fantasy in general."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This was an amazing book. It was about an young boy who is just beginning to discover his powers as a wizard. He is sent to a school where he finds many adventures and lots of excitement. Sparrohawk's adventure through his life as a young wizard in this school in a far away land, was both exciting and amusing. I was kept on the edge of my seat, wanting to read more and more. The author is very talented, and quite creative. I only hope that following books in this series are as well written and fun to read as this one was. I will deffinately recomend this book to others."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Earthsea series, of which this book is the first part, is a majestic work of fantasy fiction. The flowing beauty of the world, the clear simplicity of the storytelling, and the mystery and depth and wisdom of some of the passages makes these books a pleasure to read and reread. Along with J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth and C.S. Lewis' Narnia, Ursela Le Guin's world of Earthsea is one of the most wonderful places to visit in the genre of fantasy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard Of Earthsea, the first book in her long standing Earthsea Trilogy, is the spiritual grandparent of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This story, about a boy training at a school for wizards who will one day go on to become the greatest wizard of his age, seems like a more adult version of Rowling's story. Certainly the implications of magic and the responsibility of having such powers are given greater weight in Le Guin's story. Sparrowhawk becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. Later, Sparrowhawk having been sent to a school for wizards, unleashes a terrible apparition of evil during a prideful contest with another student. His quest to destroy the apparition makes for a compelling right of passage story.Preston McClear..."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Storytelling never loses its place at the forefront of this, the first book of the Earthsea Trilogy. This series has always been one of my favorites ever since I read it. Ms. Le Guin creates a believable world with characters that ring true on every page and the way she discusses and develops the importance of language and words in these novels is not only unique but powerful. Please read this series. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I picked up this book when I had nothing else to read. My mom had read it ages ago,when she was really into fantasy and reccomended it to me. I could not put it down.It was complex,magical,and at many points exciting.Le Guin developed and amazing culture ,yet she did not go too far ,like other authors (David Eddings). I adored how Le Guin put an anti-racist thing in,very slyly.The Kargs ,had pale skin,and a good deal of Earthsea didn't(the Kargs are \\"evil\\").This book made simple classes of wizardry ,which in most books would be amazingly boring,was extremely interesting.Most of the boring parts were when the character was bored,not when you for some reason were supposed to be interested. I have to say ,besides Ged,my favorite character was the otak.So cute ,yet so loyal.Le Guin can make little things wonderful. Alright,I suppose I'll need to go to the plot now.Ged ,a young sheephearder on the island called Gont,discovers that he is a wizard.He is sent to the Isle of Roke to train.Soon he becomes powerful,but while trying to summon a dead spirit ,he unleashes a shadow upon Earthsea.That Shadow is after him."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I tried and failed to read this book a couple of times in my teens, but over a decade later I recently picked it up again and it charmed me. Your typical swords and sorcery this is not, so skip this book and its sequels if you're looking for another Tolkien clone. Le Guin is as original a sci-fi/fantasy author as you can find, and A Wizard of Earthsea is pioneering fantasy. Le Guin has a background in anthropology, and it shows here: A Wizard of Earthsea succeeds best in subtle characterization and gently sculpting the fantasy setting: an island archipelago whose mythology and mysteries are sparsely described but nonetheless captivating. The book will give you many original and refreshing delights: the practice of magic is more about learning the true names of things than memorizing incantations, death is a traversible landscape, and dragons are the true masters of the ancient language of magic, which binds ordinary mortals to truth. Read the series with an open mind and you will find ample rewards."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"In a genre dominated by 800+ page tomes, the Earthsea books are a refreshing and delightful change. Ursula Le Guin is a master of flowing, lyrical prose. Each book is relatively brief, but chock full of all the elements that are required for a great fantasy story. She accomplishes this feat by keeping things simple and uncluttered. She doesn't need an appendix to list all the characters and their relation to one another. Her world is well-realized, her characters well-fleshed out, and the story captures you from the first pages. Take a break from the massive tales of Jordan and Martin et al. (not that there's anything wrong with them) and read an author whose writing is as magical as her story."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If I could give this series 10 or 20 stars I would. These books are dense, rich and beg to be read and re-read. I first read these books in my 20's; many years later, I still become engrossed in the wonderful imagery. Ms. LeGuin is the BEST writer I have ever encountered who can write with a 'sense of place' that makes you know that the book's world indeed does exist, and boy do you wish you could visit.I had trouble reading the Harry Potter books. They are boring and juvenile compared to this award-winning series. I can't understand the hoopla surrounding the Potter books when this series is a magnitude better. I'll bet people in their 40's will not be re-reading the Potter books. They will re-read again and again this superb series.My only complaint is that there aren't another dozen of books in this series.A stunning accomplishment from a truly gifted author."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"In the book, A Wizard of Earthsea, you encounter a wild young man named Ged. His mother died when he was born, his father has no use for a baby that can do no work, and his aunt merely looked after him until he could fend for himself. Ged has no family support and no friends. He is looking for acceptance and he finally finds a way to gain some form of respect when his aunt, the local witch, recognizes his natural talent for magic. From that point on, Ged has found the path that he must take in life. That path finally brings Ged to the doors of the School of Roke and into the company of real friendship.Magic was Ged's deliverance from his small little town, it was his means of saving his townspeople, but it also has a darker side. Ged glimpsed this dark magic once while under the tutelage of the great mage of Ogion, and while at the School for Wizards, he gets a horrifying view of it that nearly takes his life. Due to his proud, boastful nature, Ged accidentally looses a dark demon into his world and the balance is not offset and a great man dies in order to save him. Everyone can see that there is a great powerfully potential in Ged, but he, so starved for acceptance, is careless. Now that he has disrupted the balance of the world, he has to live up to his potential, temper it with wisdom, and right what he has set wrong. The demon Ged let loose will eventually seek him out to destroy him and Ged must be equal for the fight.This book depicts Ged as an imperfect hero. He is greatness within him, but he does not know how to manage it. The events in his life have molded him into an impetuous child that answers to no one. Ged had no guidance as a child. No one paid him any attention until he saved the town with his spells. He led a life not necessarily in the shadows, but one of invisibility until someone saw him. Ged, like any other child, wanted to be noticed. He wanted to be a part of something. The only chance that he had was to become a wizard for with that title comes the respect and acceptance that he yearns for. In order to handle this responsibility, Ged also had to learn humility. He had to understand that greatness does not come solely from sheer skill. It is a delicate balance between skill and an ongoing search for and acquiring of wisdom."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Earthsea series is one of the greatest works of high fantasy, and A Wizard of Esrthsea is a good start to the series. But it's also my least favorite book of the series. Not that there's anything wrong with it - it just doesn't pull me in like the next three books do."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"You get a mug of tea, dim the lights, sit down in your recliner, and hit the PLAY button.Is there anything better than being told a good story? Remember when mom read stories from books to you? I loved that... and still do!The Earthsea trilogy is one of the great fantasy novels. In my humble opinion it is second only to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.So what's this book about then? It's about a boy that starts out with two empty hands and ends up a man with a wizard's staff in them. Any further desciption I could give wouldn't do the book justice, but there are other reviews that cover more of its content if you're not already sold.If you're into fantasy, buy Tolkien's works (on cd/tape) first, but then definitely get this one!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read this book in the late seventies, and have re-read it several times through the years. It is also one of the few books that my children also enjoyed while they were still teenagers. The story is well written with a unique world, a unique view of magic, and of life in general. Her interaction between the characters is interesting and at times inspiring. I particularly enjoyed the conversation between Ged and the Master Summoner, where the Master tells him, &#34;You thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought once. So did we all. And the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do...&#34; Ged grows from an impatient young boy, eager for power, through darkness, pain, and a very difficult lesson to a wizard both wise and powerful, and we are allowed to accompany him.While I do agree that it is a very good book, I have to disagree with the Sunday Times (London) reviewer who stated that Earthsea has replaced Tolkien's Middle-earth as the chosen land for high otherworldly adventure."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book moves with a subtle grace, taking the typical coming-of-age tale and flipping it on it's head. I was drawn in, coaxed to care deeply about the hero, and led through a story that felt, even while being fantastical, like it could be my own.And in the end, it was perfect. If you are to read only one such novel, please let it be this one."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Started reading this series last summer just as something to do.

I would recommend anyone to read them and enjoy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If it hadn't been for the first chapter, I would have given the book 4 stars.In the first chapter, indeed on the first page, the author choses to reveal the entire future history of the main character. I hate that. When I read it, I nearly threw the book across the room; why read it if I know what's going to happen (I know, lots of people don't care, but I'm not one of them)?After the first chapter, though, things get going, and really pick up as the chapters roll by.I give this book good marks for including a map (fairly common for the original publishing period, but something sadly lacking in most modern fantasies; removing a major component of believability).It also has a fabulous magic system. The primary drawback is that the author doesn't go into it broadly enough, despite the main character spending considerable time at a school for wizards.I've read it twice, and consider it to be fairly good."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It's sad that every work like this has to be held up to Tolkien for comparison; the Earthsea trilogy (excepting, of course, the fourth and much later book) is a great work in its own right. It seems works like this are less popular now, whereas writers like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan, who've ripped off a good portion of their ideas from older works, are more popular."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book is one of the best in the fantasy genre. Although no match for Tolkien, this series comes close. Anyone who says it is too complex is just to simple."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book may not be a lord of the rings clone, but it delivers.

Fans of the Dragonlance and TSR books will miss the cartoon-like action, and fans of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind will miss the endless meandering that dominates so much modern fantasy. Instead, you simply get a tale crafted of magic and wonder. Truly remarkable."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I like fantasies and this was one of the books that I truly liked. The only strange thing that I noticed was that it is in the Earthsea trilogy, which so far I like the rest of the set, but there are four books instead of three. Could anyone explain this to me?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Yes, there was a time when a fantasy book could end before 200 pages and still tell the whole story. There was a time when a series could be read one volume at a time and the plot was never left hanging on. The Earthsea saga is one of the finest products of that mythic, golden era. This, the first of the four books, is as fine an adventure as you'll ever find, but it's also a deeply philosophical book about life. Le Guin tells us that evil is inside, it can't be slain with ordinary weapons. A gem of a novel, I say."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was about the best and most interesting book that I ever read. Once I picked it up it was hard to put down."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the first in a series of books. There are 4 novels in the series and two collections of short stories. It follows the life and career of Ged a young man from the Island of Gont. Le Guin has created a very unique world, a world that is mostly water and each nation is a collection of islands. This book is also one of a few that has children's teens and adult editions in print.Ged apprentices to the local Wizard on God, and is eventually sent to the school for wizards on Havnor. There in anger during a fight with other youths he releases a dark shadow, an evil. The Masters of the school appear and banish it from the island. However this shadow and Ged are now tied together in a very unique way.After leaving the school Ged becomes haunted by the shadow he has released. He tries to return to the protection of Havnor but cannot return to the island the magic protecting the island will not let him approach. So he decides to head south.The shadow is getting closer and closer to him, and he must discern it's true name or else he will not be able to defeat it. Can he solve the puzzle, will he wrestle with his shadow and win or will he succumb to the evil he has let loose.This is a book I first read back in highschool. Then a few years back had to read it for an English literature course at the University of Waterloo I was about a third of the way through it when I realized I had read it before and that is when I found our that the story continued. Since then the two collections of short stories have been published in this world.Le Guin deals with some big questions of life in this book. Such questions as:Who am I?Do I have a role or purpose in life?Can I defeat the darkness within me?Can good conquer over evil?Why am I here?Can I make a difference?This book will be a good read for anyone who has ever struggled with some of these questions. Or who wants to use a novel to help them grow to have a deeper understanding of themselves."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read the original Earthsea trilogy over 20 years ago, and it has stood the test of time. If you like your fantasy with action, this will not be your cup of tea&#8230;but LeGuin is a master and a unique voice. The best part is that the books keep getting better and more moving. Read this so that you can get to Tehanu, which I think is one of the best books ever written about the nature and meaning of love."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"No fan of fantasy should go without reading this. It's that simple.Without question, Earthsea stands alongside Middle Earth, Narnia, and the other \\"classic\\" fantasy worlds with amazing strength, holding its own throughout.And like those worlds, the tales of Earthsea are accessible to young readers, and yet offer layers of depth and meaning for older readers.Le Guin weaves a tale in a language seemingly pulled our dreams, gorgeous prose throughout. She tells her tale of good against evil and of the triumph of man over his fears in such a way as to make one think that this is not a story that was written in the 20th century, but rather a story that always was. Perfect craft. A Wizard of Earthsea is a timeless work telling the tale of one man's struggle with magic, and himself.Modern fantasy lovers beware, this is not a typical swords and sorcery romp. Fans of the Dragonlance and TSR books will miss the cartoon-like action, and fans of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind will miss the endless meandering that dominates so much modern fantasy. Instead, you simply get a tale crafted of magic and wonder that gets right to the point, never pausing, never dragging, always engaging. Truly remarkable, even decades later."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"In \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" Ursula K. Le Guin has a very distinctive tone that shines out and makes the book different from other works of fantasy. From the opening page you see how Le Guin is like a storyteller that is reading or telling something to you, as the story that is being told is very descriptive and easy to follow. This makes this novel a classic of the fantasy genre, among other things which will be discussed later on.Our main character, Ged (Sparrowhawk) is a resident of Earthsea, a huge world of islands. He is blessed with a gift in magical arts, and he is sent to work as a prentice of Ogion, the master wizard of Gont. Ged feels that he is leading a humdrum life with Ogion and doesn't think that he is learning anything that could advance his gift in magic. Ged decides to go to a wizardry school on the island of Roke to study with other young men of his age. But before he leaves Ogion, Ged attempts a spell and unleashes a shadow that will follow him and try to take over his soul. When Ged gets to the school he makes a very good friend, Vetch. After graduating from the wizardry school Ged goes and fights dragons and does a few other things, but mainly is trying to defeat the shadow that is trying to take over him. Up until the climactic finish that will leave you ready for the following \\"Earthsea\\" books, this novel will entertain.In a way this book is a lesson on life. The novel shows how our main character, Ged, goes through the first stages of his life and must cope with things that come up. At the wizardry school he must deal with the vile Jasper and come over this boy's tauntings. When he travels on a boat throughout the sea he has to survive and cope with stresses from the shadow. This book shows how people could overcome the odds when everything seems like it is going against them.Most of the novel is descriptive and there is not a whole lot of dialogue, which I happen to love. Although Le Guin's writing style may get a bit tedious at times this book was written by a master of not only fantasy, but also the English language, so the book is still great.That said the description of the novel makes the book feel very realistic. Le Guin's world is very believable and is fun to read. In addition, the characterisation for the main character Ged is wonderful and I'm sure that as the series progresses I (and you, if you pick up this book) will feel more for him.\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a short novel but don't think that this book isn't good because it is not as long as other epic fantasies. In fact, it is better than most of today's fantasy. I am wholeheartedly looking forward to reading the next two novels in this trilogy, and possibly the others of the series.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read A Wizard of Earthsea when I was in seventh grade. I could not put it down at the age of twelve. The way Ursula K. Le Guin writes reminds me of a fairy tale told by my grandmother on a rainy Saturday morning. The style is dreamy and reminiscent of old fashioned storytelling at its best. I was able to lose myself in the story, in the people, and in the land. I read A Wizard of Earthsea the second time at the age of 24. The book again captivated and mesmerized me. I am now 32 and I still love this story.A Wizard of Earthsea is the story of Sparrowhawk, a goat herder from the island of Gont. Sparrowhawk develops an unusual power, which gives him the ability to call animals. When Sparrowhawk learns that he has more power than he can safely control, he leaves his old life behind and travels to the School on Roke.What we might call magic is referred to and separated from wizardry in this book. Wizards are specially trained (and male) on the island of Roke. Magic is the realm of witches and not held in high esteem. A wizard's life is spent learning the true name of things in the old tongue. Power to a mage must be kept in balance. Every action has a reaction.To me, this sense of balance is the real beauty of the novel. Sparrowhawk, or any wizard for that matter, cannot unthinkingly use a spell without facing consequences. I think this is wonderful way to look at our own society. We have all but eliminated our social sense of consequences. Sparrowhawk finally understands the balance at great cost to his soul and power. What will it take for us to face the consequences of our actions?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Well, it sems that this is one of those books you either love or hate.Personnally (and you may be able to tell from the rating!) I think that Ged, and the world Ursula Le Guin created is one of the best I have ever read.Tehanu was not the greatest, but the Wizard of Earthsea was a fantatastic story, showing the samll details, and the story was not an end-of-the-world type, just the posible end if Ged's world.Tolkien, Feist, Jordan etc follow the dramtic (ie. global) picture when writing, guin wrote a story from a more intimate perspective, and for that we can only applaud her vision.everyone who likes fantasy must read this!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This series of books is phenomenal. Much like the popular Harry Potter books, they're written at a young-adult level. The difference, though, is that the plot, characters, and magic is much more dark and mature. I recommend the Earthsea books to everyone I can; you won't regret reading them. I think one or more also won the Nebula Award. Go get it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I would give this story 10 stars if I could. I read this when I was in grade 7 and it became my favorite book, now after university I still think this is one of the greatest fantasy books I've ever read. Le Guin takes you into her little wonderful world of islands with strange exotic names and builds a tapestry of characters and places with histories and cultures intertwined in a tale about a young wizard who meddles with the forces of darkness and has to deal with the consequences for the rest of his life. It is truly original in the same way that the Lord of the Rings was, and the Wizard of Oz was, and Alice in Wonderland was; a story that children can enjoy but that grows with you as you grow in life and learn to appreciate what good story telling is, and Le Guin is one of the best in the world."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It's been months since I've read a book.I'm a college student who has been juggling school, full-time work, a frequently updated web site, and attempts at having a life--and with sleep, that doesn't allow great amounts of time for pleasure reading.This book, however, has taught me that this time, somehow, must be set aside.This Earthsea that Ursula Le Guin has created easily kept me glued to the book for hours on end and prompted me, within fifteen minutes after finishing, to order the second in the Earthsea series.Fans of Tolkien, tales of the middle ages, or the magic of the power of everything, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read the series for the first time when I was about 12, and have gravitated towards it every couple of years since then to re-read. I just can't help myself. This isn't typical kids' stuff, it's brilliant writing. I recently started to re-read a Stephen Donaldson book that I remember liking as a teenager 15 years ago and was amazed at how poor the writing was--bad grammar, convoluted sentences and inept metaphors. I immediately reached for A Wizard of Earthsea, fearing I'd similarly misremembered its greatness--I had not. It was as great as ever. I lost sleep three nights running and now I have to wait another couple of years!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula Le Guin is the daughter of Alfred Kroeber, an anthropologist, and Theodora Kroeber, a psychologist and writer. It's easy and accurate to say that her parents' interests inform her brilliant writing, and that cultural anthrpology and Jungian psychology are at the core of Wizard of Earthsea and its three sequels.But the book isn't a treatise. It's a wonderful, well-told story of a young man, Ged, coming of age in a world where words can have the power of magic and dragons are as real as earthquakes. There is nothing didactic about this story; Le Guin's writing is compelling and her characters are vivid: Ogion, the Mage of Silence, whose word had stilled an earthquake; Vetch, who helps Ged on a deadly quest for no reason but friendship; Murre, Vetch's sister; Yevaud, the dragon of Pendor; and Skiorh, possessed by a gebbeth.Earthsea doesn't exist in a vacuum. Le Guin constructs a deep and textured history, and her characters act in ways that are consistent with that world. She manages the trick of writing a mythic tale without falling into the traps and foibles of sounding like you are trying.The climax is straight from Carl Jung, but you don't need to know Carl Jung from Steve Young to appreciate it.From time to time, religious groups call for this book to be banned from school libraries, claiming it promotes witchcraft. Nonsense. This is a book every teenager should read. It speaks to self-understanding, nothing more.And some feminists criticize Le Guin because Ged is a male character. Again, nonsense, Ged is an archetype, and his gender matters not at all.This is an important book. It's also terrific fun. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Not only is the &quot;Earthsea&quot; trilogy a wonderful series for adolescents but it also contains profound wisdom for adults seeking their own path to individuation. Rich in timeless myth, the series has the young mage Ged surmount many trials on his way to understanding himself and therein lies the key to his ultimately becomming the Archmage of Roke. Each book in the series has the main story turn on the issue of trust between two people and upon Ged's courage in facing dark issues either within himself or in the enviroment. Ged is a powerful role for young people developing a sense of their inner integrity and for middle-agers every where beginning to deal with their shadow issues. Of course there are plenty of dragons, battles, transformations and journeys which can be enjoyed simply as a good storey, but don't pass up the chance to re-read to catch the deeper meaning. This series is too good to be eclipsed in popularity by LOTR and the Chornicles of Narnia, &quot;Earthsea&quot; stands on its own! If I haven't convinced you, please read the essay by Noel Perrin in his book, &quot;A Child's Delight.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" comes from a different place then the other two fantasists with whom her Earthsea trilogy is so often compared. Tolkein's so-called fantasy was a real attempt to capture what Tolkein believed the languagues lost before the beginnings of early English, while his Oxford colleague wrote his Narnia fantasies from a Christian viewpoint. LeGuin's fantasy novels derive from her background in anthropology and show it in every way.The story concerns the Wizard Sparrowhawk and his education. Sparrowhawk comes from a desperately poor village in the mountains, from among illiterate peasants (compare to the world of the hobbits, where, though illiterate, there is no squalor) who live with their goats. His home island, Gont, is the birthplace of Goatherds, Pirates, and Wizards, and from an early age Sparrowhawk shows his powers. After saving his village from an invading army, Sparrowhawk is apprenticed to Ogion, the great Mage. There Sparrowhawk begins to learn what Wizards know: the names of all things. He also is drawn to showing off, including calling up the dead.Too powerful and curious for Ogion, Sparrowhawk goes to the isle of Roke to attend the school there ( Rowling only stole from the best) and finds he's not only the best pupil, but he can make enemies. In a boast, he calls up a spirit and brings out a sort of un-him. The un-him scars Sparrowhawk and kills the school's Archmage who uses his power to try and undo what Sparrowhawk has done.Ged, Sparrowhawk's true name, must now pursue this unhim while fighting dragons, evil stones, and gibbeths, people the unhim have entered and destroyed.Finally, Ged turns on his pursuer to fight an epic battle on the unsea and reunite himself.LeGuin's spare prose is based on folktales, and myths, and Earthsea's theology of balance, true names, and magic is clear: Ged has disturbed the balance, so he must restore it. Like Tolkein's and Lewis' books, there is a sexual innocence here: Ged is a mage first and foremost: he feel attractions, but no lust. Of course, Heros of Myth are too good to be lustful; chastity preserves their power.Unlike the other fantasies, the Earthsea Trilogy is not England, but an actual mythical place, albeit medieval in a European sense. Ged is no Englishman either, being copper-colored.The deep understanding of what makes a culture a culture underlies everything LeGuin has written, from \\"The Dispossed\\" to \\"Terhanu.\\" The intelligence behind these books is impressive, neither sentimental nor baroque, almost clinical in its portrayal of an premodern world where magic does work, and where every action has personal consequences and real pain."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I'm writing this review because JK Rowling's books about the Hogwarts School of Magic reminded me of this, one of the few perfect novels I've ever read.It's not a light-hearted fairy tale, though it is &quot;high fantasy.&quot; It's the story of Ged, from his childhood discovery of his wonderful yet terrible magical powers; to his education at the School of Wizardry on Roke Knoll. There he makes a misstep; overstepping his powers, he accidentally lets loose an evil creature from a shadow world. His self-imposed exile, journeys, and eventual maturation and triumph are written with a deft flair for the beauty and wonder of magic; yet Ms. LeGuin is even more masterful in depicting Ged's character: the young high achiever who must finally make his peace with his inner demons.As a child, I loved it for the idea of a school of magic. I grew older, reread it during a dark teenage time, and cried when Ged finally confronted his inner shadow creature. Later, studying anatomy in medical school, I recalled Ged's long days in the Namer's high tower, learning the true names of things; and bent cheerfully to my task.It still bears re-reading to this day. Readers who enjoy Tolkien, JK Rowling, or Alice Miller's &quot;Drama of the Gifted Child&quot; ought particularly to read it; and readers who didn't like &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; should give Ms. LeGuin another try, in this, her finest work. . It is one of my favorite novels and I recommend it to you wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read this book two years ago when i was 22 and away on holiday with my fiance. It is one of his favourite books, and he has read the whole series time and again. I enjoy reading all types of literature, although science-fiction and fantasy books are my favourite. I have always favoured sci-fi, especially Asimov and Clarke, and my fiance fantasy, particularly Tolkien and Le Guin. This book, along with The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, have made me as passionate about fantasy as sci-fi.The book works on many levels, as a good story, as escapism, as a gateway to an incredible fantasy land, and as something far deeper. The story is thought-provoking and compelling, rich and meaningful. The book examines how we consider ourselves and the world around us. What is our real self ? What are we capable of ? How do our actions influence the world around us ? How do the names that we apply to objects affect how we view and understand them ?A brilliant book that i would recommend to anyone of any age. I think its ridiculous that great literature such as this, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland, C.S. Lewis, and so on get classified as &quot;childrens books&quot;. They are books for everyone with imagination, who enjoys good story-telling, and interesting and unusual characters. They are tales which leave strong images for years after reading, which make you want to go back to read again and again, which offer something new each time they are read, which make you want to tell other people about them, which enthrall and inspire you, which leave you with plenty to think and talk about, and which push back the boundaries of your thoughts and imagination."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula Le Guin made fantasy history with \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" a spare but strangely entrancing story about a young wizard coming of age. Despite a rather distant writing style, Le Guin's story is still a classic that is generally put on the same shelf as Lewis and Tolkien.Ged was born in a village in Earthsea -- a grouping of many, many small islands -- in Gont. The boy soon shows signs of great power, the ability to call animals and to laugh even when his tongue has been bound by a spell. A mage named Ogion apprentices Ged--who is known as Sparrowhawk, as knowledge of his true name would give anyone power over him. But Ogion's discipline and lessons are full of silence and self-examination, something which soon sends Ged to the school for mages in Roke.A rival finally mocks Ged into a magical duel, and a monstrous creature made of shadow attacks Ged, nearly killing him. But upon the completion of his studies, the now-wiser wizard sets off to an island to seek the Dragon of Pendor. As the shadow closes in on Ged and his life becomes increasingly imperiled, he must discern what -- and who -- it is, to make himself truly whole.Le Guin's book has a lot of things in it that tend to annoy readers -- several years are skipped in a few pages, and little of Ged's thoughts and emotions aside from \\"Ged felt this\\" and \\"Ged thought that\\" are revealed. But the spare mythic style and quiet philosophical bent add an extra dimension to a straightforward fantasy story.Le Guin's story spans several years in Ged's life, taking him from a little boy in a dirty village to a powerful and respected mage. But she also spins in Eastern philosophy, in the form of the \\"shadow\\" that stalks Ged for many years -- in some ways, the final explanation for what the shadow is seems fitting.Ged has the makings of a classic hero: he is talented and initially hot-headed, but through his misfortunes is tempered into a more selfless, albeit scarred person (both physically and emotionally). Most of the supporting characters don't appear long enough to get much development, although Ged's buddy Vetch comes across as a sweetheart.Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a memorable story about a boy becoming a man, and a man coming to terms with himself. A unique story, and one worthy of being called a classic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"When I was about 7, my uncle gave the Earthsea Trilogy to my mother (a reading teacher) for her students to read. I remember reading a couple of chapters of one of them (Tombs of Atuan, I think) and finding it very exciting and mysterious, but also a little hard to understand (probably because I was starting in the middle of the series and because I was 7). Since then, I have often wanted to read the trilogy, but I had difficulty finding the books, which were out of print for most of the 1980s. I also was a little turned off because many people classify the trilogy as &quot;young adult fiction,&quot; probably because they are relatively short.I just finished a Wizard of Earthsea and I was surprised to find that it was one of the best fantasy book that I have ever read. Le Guin's narrative style in this book (which differs greatly from &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and its progeny--a style that I found to be a little plodding and self-indulgent) is very lean, almost minimalist. In this respect it reminds me of Michael Moorcock's Elric series. Unlike Moorcock, however, Le Guin conveys a rich emotional life for her characters. (This is not a criticism of Morcock, I think that he intentionally meant for the characters to remain somewhat distant and enigmatic--making them more like characters of myth and legend).The back of the edition that I read claims that Le Guin has dethroned Tolkien as the ruler of epic fantasy. I wouldn't go that far. But she certainly deserves share the upper eschelon of fantasy writers with Tolkien and a very few other authors."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It is an insult to the genius of this book to try to describe it in layman's terms. Words just don't do justice. Le Guin always proves that she has a unique outlook on the world, and the Earthsea books are no exception.The Wizard of Earthsea is the first part of a series of (now) four books. This part details the origins and youth of Ged - a boy from a backwater village in the great archipelago world of Earthsea. With a magical feat that saves his entire community from barbaric invaders, he shows himself to be greatly proficient in the Art. He is apprenticed to a sorceror (who nevertheless hides under the guise of a simple healer), and makes his way to the Academy on the Island of Roke. There, out of his great pride, he unleashes a shadow-thing in a contest of forbidden magics. Injured, scarred both physically and mentally, he now must flee the thing he brought into this world - or confront it.One of the most surprising and masterful twists is the terse, epic writing: Le Guin does not spend time to write whole descriptive paragraphs; she sets the scenes with broad strokes of a few sentences, focusing on the most important events. This book is very quick reading.Ged is an inspiring character. He can be crudely compared to Ender from Orson Scott Card's writings, or perhaps Taran from Lloyd Alexander's, in that he wields great power, by which he is burdened. The reader quickly becomes attached to his grim, brooding persona, as his quest takes him through the world. Ged is also a powerful role-model: he must acknowledge his undeniable talent and shed his fears of losing control of his powers.The Wizard of Earthsea is undoubtedly a classic, a powerful work of high fantasy and spiritual development."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Le Guin enjoys no press, no fanfare, no fan clubs. She has no movies (until now the mini-series), no trading card games, no computer games. Her writing is not flamboyant: it is thoughtful, considered, and quiet. Her books are generally short and are closer to novelettes. Yet she remains as one of the principle authors of the fantasy genre and her work survives. It will outlive, we suspect, a great deal of those novels that enjoy such extraordinary popularity today. JK Rowlings is the Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz) of our generation. Le Guin is the CS Lewis (The Chronicles of Narnia) of our generation. The distinction is in decibels and the scope. Earthsea, we believe, is one of those rare series of books that will quietly fill every library of every parent who has a child who loves to read. Incidentally, we feel that the later books Tehanu and The Other Wind detract from the series rather than add to it (as is the case with many sequels). Those later books are better avoided.WHO SHOULD READ THIS:As we mentioned, the series is aimed at grade levels somewhere around 5th to 9th. These are a series of books that are invaluable for this age group. It is mythology--both relevant and exciting--that teaches us not didactically how to live but shows us what it means to be alive. Many critics have said many different things about her books but the (overused) phrase \\"deeply human\\" seems just about right. These are books that--if the reader can meet the level that Le Guin sets in--will be revered for many, many years. People who have enjoyed Ender's Game, Tales of the Otori, and The Chronicles of Prydain will find these books very special.WHO SHOULD PASS:As we often say about books that are especially good, this is a novel of introspection. There is a bit of death but you won't see blood sprayed across the page. There are no great battles, sieges, or other events of great war. There is no overt sex. The magic is not \\"Terry Magic\\" (that is, Terry Goodkind or Terry Brooks type that shoots forth as fire, lightning, and death in the air) but rather a magic of language, of truth, of world harmony.

It's a classic tale of wizardry and magic, but with twists along the way.A Wizard of Earthsea is the story of the Archmage and Dragonlord Ged. Long before Ged had become Archamge and Dragonlord, he was known as Sparrowhawk, an intelligent, but reckless youth, power-hungry and lacking in wisdom.Ged begins learning simple magic from a local witch before being apprenticed to Ogion, a quiet mage from the other side of the island on which he lives. After spending several years with Ogion, he travels to Roke, to attend the school for wizards.However, he soon becomes rivals with a fellow student. One night, intent on putting his rival to shame and establishing himself as the superior magic-user, Ged accidently lets loose a shadow on all Earthsea. For the rest of his life, it will follow him, hunting him down trying to kill him and posses his flesh so it can gain form and substance with which to wreck havoc upon all of Earthsea. In order to prevent this, Ged must confront and defeat this evil, but the quest cannot be accomplished easily, but Ged must try, at risk of his life so that he can save his soul."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book may have had a good moral but I think it couldv'e turned out a lot better if it wasn't so borring.

I mean, it was better than anything Terry Goodkind and Terry Brooks could ever hope to write, but that's not sayig much. Then I re-read it to catch this big deep underlying theme. There wasn't any.

I was bored to tears. I presume Rowling was familiar with the basic idea of a young man going to wizard school and finding out who he really was, but Rowling did it brilliantly while Le Guin was just plain awful. I presume it was so popular when written because there just wasn't a lot of fantasy for fans of the genre.

How could naming something give you power over it? I don't know, it was not explained. Also, why did everyone have 2 names? As a coming of age novel, this novel was a pretty good book. But I wish there was more action in this novel. Sometimes Sparrowhawk or Gad or whatever name the main character in this novel was going by just seemed to sail and sail and sail. Boring. Thats ok there are plenty of other fish in the ocean (no pun intended), like the Gor novels which have plenty of action and more of an interesting storyline.PS. I didn't really understand that last part where sparrowhawk/gad goes head to head with the shadowy creature who has hunted him all threw the novel.

How can you relate to some wizard with powers you know nothing about. Can you explain what it feels like, can you explain how you get it. Well, this book follows the ways of fantasy, you can't relate to this character, b/c you have no idea what he is going through, Le Guin doesn't tell us, she assume we are magicians.

Nor will I comment on anything further than the first chapter, which I could not complete. I found it filled with actual witchery and sorcerel realism. It became a threat to my soul and poisoned my imagination. The rest of the work, I imagine, is filled with the demonic. Christian, if you own a copy, do not sell it, (spreading the evil) rather destroy it like I did, and boldly tearing it to peices lest it weave its spell over you.(I did however enjoy the tv mini-series, in which, interestingly, her wizards seemed more like our priests)."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give A Wizard of Earthsea--on the one hand, it is certainly well-written, and Earthsea is among the most realistic of all the fantasy worlds I've encountered. On the other, I just didn't find this book engaging, particularly in the second half. When I take an entire week to get through a 200-page book, it tends to be bad news.My conclusion: This book just isn't for everyone. A lot of reviewers seem to have been referred to it because of their enjoyment of Tolkein or Rowling, and were understandably disappointed. Stylistically, reading A Wizard of Earthsea is akin to reading a myth or fable, rather than a popular novel. Anthropology, worldbuilding and thematics are its strong points; heart-pounding action nowhere to be found; and bits of dialogue few and far between. Characterization is solid, although we see little of anyone other than Ged.No, I didn't really enjoy reading this book, but then I tire of reading Greek myths, biographies, and history texts as well. A Wizard of Earthsea is a well-written book, and if any of the above appeal to you, you'll probably like it better than I did. If you're looking for the next Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, though... best keep looking."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I'm not a big fan of fantasy literature, but this book was really good.

I found it to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to people that may be skeptical about fantasy novels."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book really takes you to that wonderful place of Legend that so many attempt but few (e.g. Stewart's Crystal Cave, Wolfe'sThe Knight, Gemmell'sThe Legend of Deathwalker, and, of course, Tolkien) sometimes manage. Doubtless this comparison has been made so many times that it must be hackneyed by now, but while Harry Potter can be fun, it really is playing with the trappings of magic while these guys give you the real thing. An absurd thing for me to say when talking about fiction, but I suspect many readers know just what I'm talking about.Part of way Le Guin gets us there is in the simple dignity of her narration (cf.The Left Hand of Darkness). But there's also the skill in spoiling us with a powerful wizard (something everybody does) but tempering this with an awareness of the cost. Ged is set up for a fall, sure, but this makes it no less tragic and potent, and informs the rest of the story. It doesn't just have him as an enigmatic brooding figure - we know why he now deals with people the way he does.Oh, by the way, Le Guin capably creates a world, throwing in original ideas among some of the familiar ones. Not a bad trick that - she's deservedly a professional writer - but this isn't what sets her apart."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"While the Eartsea series was written for adolescents, it is a wonderful search-for-self journey that adults of all ages can enjoy. LeGuin's love of the philosophy of Taoism is prevalent in all of her works, but this book really focuses on the concepts of Yin and Yang, how to recognize them in our daily lives, and how that recognition (and acceptance) helps make us \\"whole.\\" Her use of images of light and dark wonderfully underscore Ged's journeys into the threatening unknown and then back to places of \\"safety.\\" As Ged's emotional crisis intensifies, so do the images of darkness, of things considered \\"evil\\" because they are separate, alien, unknown.While you don't need any knowledge of Taoism to enjoy this series, with a little research, the text takes on a whole new life. Every image is significant; like peeling an onion, there is layer after layer of meaning.Although this is the first book of a trilogy, the story doesn't come full-circle until the fourth book, Tehanu. LeGuin's writing comes full-circle as well; in the many years between the books, both she and the characters have gone through many life changes. The maturity and reflection that has resulted is obvious in the voice she writes with. If you enjoyed the triology, keep reading! She just keeps getting better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I picked up A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula Le Guin, in a moment of weakness in a beautiful bookstore in Montrose, called Once Upon a Time. I had promised myself that I would not buy anymore books, and instead borrow them from the library. But this particular bookstore had a whole section of \\"We recommend\\" books, with bookmarks inserted, each with a compelling description of the books' best assets. I just couldn't resist picking up a couple books to read (I mean, to add to my pile of books to read.)A Wizard of Earthsea was described on the paper insert as a Harry Potter-esque story that takes place in another world of Arthurian magic. After reading it, the only resemblance between the two stories seems to be that the main character is a young wizard coming of age and discovering his power and importance in the world he lives in. The cadence, the adventures, even the kind of magic used in this novel is not at all similar to that of Harry Potter. I wouldn't even put them in the same category of literature. I would say that it's much closer to The Lord of the Rings type of storytelling, with much less detail and much less bloodshed.Earthsea is a Homer-esque adventure of a wizard who has opened the door of the dead and must find a way to restore balance. All the while, he learns who he is, and teaches the reader about the lands in which the story takes places. The story does not unravel like the tightly woven story of Harry Potter, rather, in rolls out as a timeline-an adventure story where the main character has a goal, but is met with one thing after another that keeps him from reaching it.The writing style is sprinkled generously with Old English turns of phrase and the cadence of the story is uneven, interweaving meticulous description with quick-paced action in an unexpected manner, making it a little difficult to initially find a reading rhythm. But this inconsistency contributes to the story's charm; seldom is the story boring despite the fact that many of the trials and tribulations of the main character do not strongly contribute to the overall storyline, being merely descriptions of interesting things that happen along the way.In this way, I think it would a wonderful book for a child (perhaps 8-10 or older, depending on their reading ability) to be introduced into the genre of fantasy novels; the story can be easily read a page or two at a time without losing the storytelling rhythm, and the events in the book are interesting and even a little frightful, although not indiscriminately gory.But perhaps the most important aspect of A Wizard of Earthsea concerns the maturation of the main character, Sparrowhawk. His path to wisdom is a universal message that many young readers (or even adult readers) would find inspirational. It conveys a message that how we respond to pain and mistakes is an important way to wisdom-a message which resonates from the beginning to the end of this account of Sparrowhawk's adventures.Even though the story was well written and compelling, I don't think that I'll be reading the next books in the series (there are four). However, I'll keep it on the shelves for the kids when they are old enough to start to read this kind of fiction. My husband will probably also enjoy it; this is the kind of story he likes to read-lots of adventure, running around and exploring, in a world of magic and dragons."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Among other things, I am a great fan of fantasy, and among my favorite books are those in the Dragonlance series, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and various other Middle Earth tales, and other such books. This book, A Wizard of Earthsea, however, stands apart from the rest, and by far outshines all those save, perhaps, Tolkien's, compared to which it is on an at least equal footing.Perhaps most importantly, this by no means should be considered merely a \\"young adult\\" book, or even a simple \\"adventure/fantasy\\" book. This a tale which explores some rather deep aspects of the human psyche, and when read closely is not a work to be taken lightly, much as Tolkien's works explore deep aspects of spirituality.Set in a fantasy world that seems to resemble more the ancient world of the Hebrews, Hittites, and other such peoples than the more common medievalesque setting, Le Guin uses a style reminiscent in tone and atmosphere of the Viking Sagas to tell the tale of Sparrowhawk, or Ged as his \\"true\\" name is (in this book words have substantial power, as people of many ancient civilizations believed - in this case in particular, your true name is the word that allows others to have power over you). Specifically, this tale covers the parts of his life from early childhood to early adulthood (it is continued in the next three books of the Earthsea cycle).It begins with Sparrowhawk's childhood on the Island of Gont, and like the stars of many tales from the ancient world, he has a rather special, bordering on \\"miraculous,\\" childhood. Even as an untrained youth he has noticeable power, and it is substantial enough to aid in the rescue of his village from foreign invaders.Sparrowhawk then goes on, through various twists and turns of plot, to become apprentice to a mage named Ogion, who, to use the words of history/politics in the world of magic, walks softly and carries a big stick. Impatient, however, to learn slowly but surely, he goes on to learn at an island called Roke, on which there is a school for Wizards (where he meets, among others, my favorite character, the Otak).It is at this school where the plot really takes off, for it is here that, through a series of unfortunate but necessary events, Ged, who's power surpasses his judgement and is made dangerous by his youthful pride, releases a shadow upon the world. From here, much time is spent on his part running from the shadow, and thus he begins a series of adventures, including a showdown with a family of dragons. Eventually, though, Ged realizes he must confront the shadow, and it is his quest for the shadow that forms the climax of this tale, which I will not say anything more about.Underpinning all of this is a wonderful synthesis of concepts from antiquity, mythology, psychology, and philosophy, and teaches several valuable lessons. One is the notion of not disturbing an abstract entity called the Equilibrium, which can be applied to our current lives in many ways, including (though certainly not limited to) care for, if not conservation of, the environment. Another is self-acceptance and the sense of self-efficacy, and more so spiritual/psychological fulfillment, which comes from that.In short, this is by far and away my favorite book, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for either a simply good read or a philosophical treatise."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Modern fantasy writers should take a day and reread Mrs. Le Guin's novel with the hopes of gaining perspective on what makes a good fantasy novel. In about 30% of the length of most new novels, the author builds a world rich in detail and history, and still manages to keep the story driven by the characters, and not by the world itself.The central character goes through a six-year span of his life in this book, from the age of his naming to when he's nineteen and a full-fledged wizard. During that time he studies and grows and faces his most inner demons. The author fleshes out that inner turmoil that every teenager goes through and turns it into a great adventure of self-discovery. This would have made an even more fantastic read when I was in high school.The book is definitely a fantasy, but in the classic sense. Magic and such is not he backbone of this book. It is more of a backdrop.I recommend this book to all adults and young adults who have 5-6 hours to immerse themselves in a world of fantasy adventure and friendship."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"With the recent Sci- Fi Channel miniseries, there is bound to be renewed interest in LeGuin's classic first book in her Earthsea series, as there should be. This remains a classic fantasy for good reason. The world within which the characters move is fully developed, having a sense of past, present and future as well as a sense of a larger \\"there there\\", as opposed to some fantasies that feel like a Hollywood stage set, as if nothing exists beyond the narrow social/geographical worlds the characters move through. Such is not the case with Earthsea. One feels it is real from the start and the ensuing books in the series only deepen that feeling with regard to its social and political structures, its people, its mythic past.The characters are equally strong, especially Ged, the young boy who grows to adulthood in true coming-of-age fashion--through pain, loss, self-destruction, and eventual slow growth of wisdom. The depiction of his younger years as he first learns of his wizardly power and potential, apprentices to a single wizard then rejects that slow, dull path in order to attend the more exciting wizardry school (do not think Harry Potter here, style, tone, and environment are quite different) is right on. He is impatient, cocky, self-sure, quick to anger, impulsive, moody. In short, he is an adolescent. As such he has no time for the slow pace of his masters, for their constant warnings about the \\"balance\\" (the universe is in constant equilibrium and one change someplace effects another change, for good or ill, somewhere else) and its restrictions on use of power. The idea of the balance is the more you know, the less likely you are to act. Ged, in impetuous and realistic fashion sees it as the more you know, the more you can act.As one might expect, his blithe self-confidence sets him up for a major fall, as he accidentally opens a portal, allowing an unknown \\"shadow\\" to enter the world. Roughly the first half of the book leads up to this event, the second half follows what happens afterward, as Ged is hunted by the evil he has let into the world, an evil that can cause great harm unless he does something about it. Along the way, he slowly grows in wisdom (the steps toward adulthood are gradual but nicely marked), helped along by his former tutor whom he rejected for his dull passivity and his closest friend from the wizard's school at Roke, Vetch.The end, without giving details away, is simply perfect in its resolution, in its tone, and in its complexity. Don't expect simplistic happy ending or heroic battles against overwhelming odds; this is a personal journey, a personal victory, though it has larger repercussions.The book succeeds in pretty much all it does. Its world creation is rich and full and three-dimensional. Its characters are sharply detailed, realistic, complex beings. Its plot exciting, its language vivid (sometimes classified as young adult--I'm not sure why--it does not talk down to a perceived younger audience, in terms of complexity of language or philosophy). And in the best test of a good book, it leaves the reader wanting much more; luckily LeGuin provides with several more books in the series. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read this book in about 3 days, on and off, and I was so inspired by it. It wasn't my first fantasy book, but it made me want to read more and more of the genre (despite my decision to read all fantasy series years ago). It is so exciting to read this book. I read it at age 13, and am saddened to think I hadn't read it earlier. It has all of the elements of a fantasy book, but is written better than most. It doesn't overkill with words like Terry Brooks (whose writing I do love, especially Shannara) or say too little. You love the technique (Le Guin is the best female fantasy/science fiction writer in the world, in my opinion). I can't describe the feeling you have towards Duny/Sparrowhawk/Ged, and are saddened when it ends after, what, 160 pages? That is the only downside: This book is so short. At least there are 5 others in the series, though. This is a piece of literature that every elementary school student should read. I am happy to say I will introduce this to my nephews/nieces when they grow up. It will be worth it for them.Darn it, this review made me want to read it again. I knew that would happen...."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Simple yet elegant. Le Guin's writing is economical - sparse on the descriptions but it's more than adequate. Refreshing change from the typical Anglican sword-and-sorcery settings, with dark-skinned islanders as the main focus and the Caucasians as the far-off enemies.Ged is an endearing and interesting character. We recognize his mistake when he leaves Ogion, and sympathize with his realization of his foolish pride and it's terrible price.The magic system LeGuin has created is interesting and consistent. The lore is intriguing and helpful. The first in a wonderful series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is a fun story for the younger crowd to enjoy (8 years and up). There is good character development in this story of a young boy growing up that sweeps you into the high adventure of wizards and magic and dragons that is sure to keep one riveted to this page turner."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This being my first Ursula LeGuin book, I wanted to finally understand the mystique surrounding this Portland based (according to her 1968 bio) author. Any friend of Portland, Oregon is a friend of mine. At first, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a little slow going. Beginning the book I was overeager, unfortunately, to lump LeGuin into that much scoffed at group of Tolkein wannabees. Here we had all the makings of a different world with the usual cadre of Anglo-European mythological people and creatures. LeGuin's talent isn't a sparkling wit or a magnificent explosion of plot. But it has a slow burn that ever so gradually makes it so that the reader cannot help but want to know more. Reading further, I found that my Tolkein based assumption was farther off the mark than I'd anticipated. Here we have a world where magic is almost a science. Unlike Harry Potter or Gandolph, when Ged (the hero of this tale) weaves a spell it requires making calculations, assumptions, and particulars about the objects he enchants. He must know the names of the objects he is influencing. In many ways, the spells in this book are like long written thesis. They require research and patience. The people also have some significant differences from those found in other tales as well. For one thing, they're not all white. Remember all the black people in the Lord of the Rings saga? No? How about Dean Thomas from Harry Potter (a character that in the original British editions was never declared black)? With few exceptions (Nancy Farmer being the greatest exception of them all) the world of fantasy is white white white. Unless of course you count the horridly stereotyped cannibals in Edward Eagar and E. Nesbit's fantasies, of course. But what was never made fully clear to me until now is that the protagonist of \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is not white. Nor is his companion, Vetch. Nor, to be honest, most of the characters in the book. No big show is made of this fact. LeGuin is too much the lady to ever say loudly, \\"Hey look! I wrote a book in 1968 about a wizard that isn't white and I never made a big deal about it!\\" But it's true.Now, admittedly there is a significant lack of one particular group in this book. Women. If women in \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" have the ability to work their own brand of magic they're either labeled witches or evil sorceresses. And this from a female author? So I cannot wholeheartedly give it five stars. Just the same, on the whole this book deserves its praise (a fact that fills me with amazement). For someone who was fully ready to mock and downplay the book's achievements, I say here and now that it is worth reading by anyone who thinks they have some sort of a grasp on the kiddie lit fantasy scene. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the first one of the books I've read by this aurther. And It's not a dissapointment.

A fantasy must-read with a cute little Jungian ending."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I give credit to Ursula for imanginative and creative scenerios of writing in this book, but must say I didn't enjoy reading it. I read this book in English last year and found the plot very hard to follow. This was not only my opinion, but the opinion of 30 other students. This book is definately not a page turner. I would only recommend this book to those of you who have very open imaginations, LOVE fantasy, and have the time to sit down and carefully read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"While not as detailed or as ornate as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle is considered among the finest of the Sword and Sorcery classics. A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA is the first book in the Cycle.Ged, a young adolescent, is taken as apprentice by Ogion the Mage shortly after Ged's magical abilities manifest themselves. A difficult, awkward, vain but brilliant student, Ged is soon sent to the School For Wizards on Roke Island, where he summons up a spirit from the Dead on a bet. Due to his foolish and destructive motives, an evil shadow enters the world through the doorway Ged has created. Dedicated to undoing his evil act, Ged's quest becomes one to somehow find the shadow and master it.Despite a very weak plotline that wanders from its path as far as does Ged, LeGuin's characters are memorable, and many of the scenes in A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA are enthralling, even though LeGuin spends too little time developing the historical and mythological backstories of Earthsea, and is sloppy with her invented language, Hardic. These flaws weaken the Cycle and keep it from the true greatness evident in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Katharine Kerr."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Before I start, I have to admit that my review of this book is sort of biased because I usually would not read literature that deals with fantasy and as you probably guessed, I did not like the book. I will, nonetheless, attempt at giving a fair review.The book is about a young man named Ged, who is known as Sparrowhawk to the rest of the world, and his journey to become a grand wizard as well as a learned man who knows how to conquer his fear. The journey is a worthwhile read for the message that it gives but, at the same time, the plot is long and drawn-out. My last thoughts were, \\"I'm sure the author could have found another way of getting the message of conquering fear across to her readers.\\" Once again, though, I must say that my statement may be biased. Looking back at the events that took place in the book, I don't believe that any one was insignificant. Every event in some way brought the protagonist closer to the story's final message. The plot may have seemed long and drawn-out to me because I am not accustomed to reading this genre of literature and, of course, every event in a fantastic story is going to seem far-fetched which is a quality that I do not look for in the novels that I choose.So, I will conclude by saying that I would only recommend this book to lovers of fantasy literature. Otherwise, readers are in for a long, tiresome ride."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea was hardly the book of excitement I expected it to be. Ursula K. Le Guin follows the life of a young wizard Ged, as he learns to cope with the responsibilities of being a wizard. The story manages to simultaneously fly through the first nineteen years of his life and drag on. Many of the characters and adventures Ged encounters last no more than a few pages and hold little, if any, bearing in the story as a whole.The beginning of the story seems to lag as we wait tofind out what exactly Ged's great adventure will be. When he finally finds it, there is still some confusion as to what \\"it\\" is. It does pick up a bit from here, and the reader can get more involved in the story. However, then Ged is off on another adventure and the one the reader was interested in is pretty much lost.The end was unfortunately predictable, though I was not disappointed by it personally. It seemed that is was the only real way to end it. The final showdown does prove to be a satisfying read and I finally found some of the excitement and magic I had anticipated. Whether it makes up for the rest of the book, I am unsure, but it does open the possibility of a more successful second and third book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the first volume in the Earthsea quartet (followed by The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore and Tehanu).After his mother's death, young Ged gets to live with his father, a smith, and his aunt the village witch, who teaches him some minor spells, such as commanding to animals, until one day he uses this magic to save the village from barbaric invaders.Impressed by the boy's potential powers, the mage Ogion takes him as apprentice. But as the days go by, Ged becomes bored and when the choice is offered him, he decides to go to the wizards school of Roke. There he meets with two other scholars: Vetch who'll soon become his friend, and the arrogant Jasper who always looks down on him, and who'll become his rival.And after several months spent in the school, with hatred steadily growing between them, Ged one day challenges Jasper in a magic duel. And as Ged, in a surge of immoderate pride, is trying to wake the dead, he accidentally unleashes an evil shadow, also almost managing to get himself killed in the process. The story goes on to describe Ged perpetual flight from his shadow.Ursula LeGuin's style is elaborate and poetic, but maybe a little bit too much, too old-fashioned, for my liking. As a result, the novel somehow failed to fascinate me, and in the end I realized I didn't care much about what happened to the characters. I'll read the rest of the quartet anyway, in hope it gets more gripping."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have been hearing about this book for years and years and never got around to reading it. I finally did, and totally hated it. The prose was very lyrical, but there was hardly any characterization to speak of, and the plot can be summed up as \\"wizard chases his shadow\\". It was a very boring, albeit poetically written, story. It reads like an epic poem, flowing writing, but hard to connect with.Whoever recommended this as an \\"if you liked Harry Potter, then...\\" is totally off the mark. J.K. Rowling may have been inspired by the wizard school and coming of age story in this book, but the resemblence stops there. This book is completely devoid of the warmth, humor, and delightful reading experience found in Rowling's books. It is 100% exposition. It is more like a modern-day Beowulf than an old-school Harry Potter."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I've meant to read this for years. (Love Tolkien, Asimov's Foundation, and Harry Potter.)It is a painfully slow, grim story of two-dimensional characters and nature descriptions that reads more like the account of a self-flagellant religious than a story of discovery and adventure.Tolkein was right to distrust allegory in all of its forms.Rob Inglis got me through a book I would never have finished in print, but he also may have been the wrong reader for this story. Perhaps it would have been more persuasive read by a woman or a more juvenile voice."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea was a confusing read. This particular book was filled with many examples of courage and bravery. Ursula Le Guin used a creative mind when writing this book. Her amin charcter Ged was based on one with courage. Ursula Le Guin used this character to show a brillant example of bravery. This book showed how one faced their fear head on no matter what the consequences. Ged faced fear and uncertainty in its face.Although I did enjoy this book and it was relatively short in read, I did find fault in Le Guin's use of names for her mystical places. I found it hard to focus or keep the names straight. The names were a little diffcult to comprehend and to remember which place was associated with the charcters. I do understand that the names of her places bring a sense of fantasy and mystery to the book, whereas the reader is pondering whether these places actually existed but again the titles of these places I found hard to remember.I do give credit to Le Guin when it comes to her writing. She expressed herself and her ideal of bravery/courage by getting straight to the point. She did not let the story linger or draw it out which is good in some instances due to the fact taht some storyines you like for it to linger and take it's time to get to the point and you want it to take its time (e.g. romance novels.)She got straight to the point and showed her example of what it means to have courage and be brave whatever the cost. I would recommend this book to other readers especially high school students who could always use an example of what is means to be courageous and brave."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"After reading a lot of second rate books I hope Earthsea would be a whole new look on fantasy. It still came out a disappointment, the book is written a little to childish for me. Therefore I am disgusted now when people compare Orsula K. Le-Guin to J.R.R Tolkien, Robert Jordan or George R.R. Martin. Tolkien's, Jordan's and Martin's greatness strength's are detailed stories and worlds. Le-Guin's skills are stuck at a childish level in this book and not fully developed. (Her only excuse is that she was a women stuck in the 60's, and forced to waste her Sci-Fi talents this way).My opinion might be skewed by the high praise this series got, ( given it was probably earth-shattering when it came out) It got a three because everyone will say &quot;You haven't the series yet?&quot;"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"After being forced to read this book not once, but twice, once for seventh grade English and once for high school English II Honors, my verdict is the same. It is an uncompelling, poorly written waste of ink, paper, and most of all my precious time. Comparisons to Tolkien are entirely undeserved - like comparing Jewel to Bob Dylan. The characters are all unsympathetic, poorly drawn, and distant, the kind of interchangeable, assembly-line sorcerers and kings who inhabit the trashiest of dimestore fantasy novels. The writing and action are muddled and lack fluency - but there is no great contemplation or presentation of ideas to fill in the gaps between what passes here for action. The concepts at hand - the balance of magic, the evil within oneself - could be and have been better expressed. If these are themes you wish to explore, do not attempt to do so by reading this sophomoric, boring folderol.

I plan to teach in the high school in a couple of years and it really took me a while to get into this book. However, I noticed that Ursula LeGuinn is very descriptive and my goal was to figure out what my students would get out of this book. There are many morals to the story. Ged, the main character, has to find something that makes him who he is. He finds himself through magic and the meaning of his name. This is good, but it can take the reader a while to realize what the story is about. When reading the book in the beginning I thought it to be very boring and didn't see a reason to encourage anyone to read it because I was focused on what was where and how it might have looked. Then an idea suddenly came to me! The idea that I came up with was an art class. Because of the descriptiveness, it would be very interesting to see how students would draw the land of earthsea and the people that live there. I would advise students who are into art and imagination to read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who hated this book. I can see how it would make a half-way entertaining children's book, the kind that third graders are forced to read for school, but I can't understand what all the adult reviewers see in A Wizard of Earthsea. There are a hundred things that annoyed me about this book- I'll list a few.1) The names. It seems like a minor thing, but GED?!? I felt sick having to read that name a million times, over and over and over. Earthsea? Wow, imaginative! Not really. All the names of the islands on the little map provided seemed to be random combinations of letters, barely pronouncable and utterly meaningless. I'm not even sure why the islands were named, since only a very few of them are mentioned.2) The language. There actually are places with good description- but very, very few of them... Most of the language that Le Guin uses is dull and boring. Even though the shadow is a main part of the book, she couldn't be bothered to find a single synonym. The result is that the word \\"Shadow\\" is used, on average, about once per page. And these are tiny pages with big writing. Sometimes even if a plot is horrible, I can read and enjoy the book anyway because the descriptions used are interesting and I like the wording used. Not so in this book.3) The characters. Ged is the only character who has any depth whatsoever, and what personality he has is trite and cliched. The other people in the book seem to be there just to move the plot along, without any real effort to make them worthwhile or original.4) The storyline. As a few other people mentioned, the story just hops around. One second Ged is four, then in the next paragraph he's thirteen. You can't skip reading a single word if you want to have any clue as to what is going on, because in just a single sentence, the plot will shift hugely and the reader will be left confused. I was, anyway. Even a seven year old should be able to predict the end right from the beginning- there are no surprises to this book, besides the conspicous lack of attention to details and the poor writing. Another thought for you to consider- since the ending is so completely obvious to just about everyone, is it really necessary to use foreshadowing to \\"tempt\\" us toward the conclusion?5)Problem-solving. How does Ged solve every problem that he faces? With magic, of course. Magic that we never see him learn. It always does seem convenient to have a main character who is a wizard, because it's no longer necessary to actually figure out how things get solved- just write \\"Ged waved his hand a bit and all the bad things went away.\\"6) Useless information packed into the corners. It's often good to have information about the character aside from what is absolutely required to keep the story going. In this case, the author WAY overdoes this. Example: He finds an otak somewhere, who then follows him around. Nevermind that it was specifically mentioned that otaks DON'T like people. But it did anyway, because Le Guin wanted Ged to have some worthless, helpless little creature randomly decide to follow him around so it could lick his face later on in the book and wake him up, even though there was no reason for a lick to have done that.Overall, I say read this book if you want to, since a ton of people seemed to like it, but my personal opinion is that it is one of the most pointless books I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The book is about a kid who becomes a wizard. Anti climatic from beginning to end. He is bullied and mocked, ends anticlimactically. He is tasked with dispatching a massive old dragon and its spawn, ends anticlimactically. He unleashes an evil on the world, spends half the book trying to bottle it up, ends anticlimactically. The character is not self absorbed, the story about him is.

It has become one of my favorite books of all time - despite a regular diet of faster-paced science fiction, etc when I was younger.One of the things that has impressed me more as I re-read it as an adult is that, while this is a story of Ged growing up (somewhat parallel to the Harry Potter series), Ged is not struggling so much with an external evil but with the different parts of himself that he must master. Altogether a valuable lesson for young readers.I also agree with another reviewer about the treatment of women in the early Earthsea books, but that is something the author has rectified in her more recent Earthsea additons (and has done so with the perceptiveness that must stem from her own life changes in the intervening 30 years).My only regret is that recent paperback editions either omit the maps and woodcut illustrations entirely, or reproduce them in a smudged form. My first copy (an Atheneum hardcover from 1968) was a beautiful book.Altogether, I cannot recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is basically when Ged meets the mage and is taken to his castle and becomes his prentice. After the Kargs tried to hurt the village people that where Ged lived at and everyone tried to flee. His aunt taught him different kinds of powers here also. He used some of those powers to make some fog go away and almost died but the mage saved him and he became his. Ogion also gave Ged his name which was first Sparrow hawk.This brings me to chapter two. This is when of course Ged is now with the mage and is living with him as his prentice but wonders about it because the mage hasn't taught him any powers. He meets a new girl and she asks him to turn himself into another form and he runs home to look through hidden book to do the spell and the mage catches him and tells him that the girl was probably a witch. Ged confesses about what is troubling him and the mage asks him if he wants to leave or go to Roke and he chooses Roke! The mage is also known as Ogion.Chapter three and four are when Ged has arrived in Roke now and he goes to live with the Archmage Nemmerle. He is now there and he meets his friends Vetch and Jasper. They try to get him to do spells but he gets upset because he can only do illusions. This is a kind of turning point. It was spring time and Ged was studying with the Master patterner in the secrecy of the immanent grove. He didn't see his friends much. This is a time when he starts to become mad with jasper. He was sent home by the master and at the little party. Jasper was getting a lot of shine which made Ged very upset and Jealous.Chapter five and six are very interesting because Vetch and Jasper tried to get Ged to do some crazy and dangerous magic. Bring a dead person back to life. Ged did it and he brought back an evil force. A woman, she tried to kill him and everyone. Ged created a magewind to help move the ship. After that Ged traveled to Oskhill to go to court of the Terrenon to get a sword to fight shadows with. The Gebbeth escaped by going through a door of some kind.This part of the book gets very good because Ged awakes in a big bed and Hoeg was gone. Ged met a woman names Serret which was the wife of Benderesk. Ged refused to touch the stone and speak to it because it can work great evil. Serret wanted Ged to talk to the stone. Ged escaped successfully from the creatures of the Stone. Ogion gave Ged some advice, he said go back to the place where he was harmed. Read the rest! You will enjoy it!So this brings me to the end of the book, there is more I can say but I want to make this short. My group liked this book very much. We recommend it if you like the Harry Potter series. It's an easy book to read and it keeps you wanting more. We recommend this book to ages 13-16. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If you like fantasy, A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula K Le Guin, is an enjoyable read. Le Guin creates a wonderful world of wizards, dragons, heroes and villains, where a young boy, Duny, grows into a man and a wizard. After saving his village from maurauders, Duny is given his true name, Ged, and leaves with the Mage Ogion to gain the knowledge to fulfill his destiny. When Ged's pride leads him to unleash the evil shadow, he must face himself and his fears to restore the balance he has upset.A Wizard of Earthsea is fun for those who enjoy entering a world where anything is possible, however, the story is predictable and at times tedious. Le Guin inundates the reader with the names of the various islands, mountains and seas in which the story takes place. It becomes rather like a Geography lesson as one follows Ged on his journeys. Le Guin is exhaustive in her descriptions and histories of the people and places that comprise Earthsea.Because A Wizard of Earthsea is at times a tedious read, I would not recommend it to readers who do not enjoy fantasy. For those who do, A Wizard of Earthsea, and the remaining books in the series, will be a pleasurable excursion into a world of wizards and magic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Rarely that one finds a book so simply written, yet so beautiful. The characters are not larger than life. A wonderful few hours of escaping reality. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It may sound crazy, but I first read the Earthsea trilogy when I was in sixth grade. I have read all four of the Earthsea books at least once a year since then and, when people ask me what got me interested in literature, so interested that I'm now studying for my PhD, I tell them it was this book. Enough said."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have all four of the earthsea books, and have to say that the first one is the best. We are introduced to the major character in the series, Ged, and his beginnings to becoming an archmage. I remember reading this many years ago in high school and just being in rapture while reading it. The chasing of the shadow...very metaphorical. Although the next 3 in the series only get 3 stars from me, this one is definately a 4."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This series is fairly interesting. I would not recommend it for adults. I would recommend it for kids under the age of 14. The books are far too short, there is little plot or character development. Frankly I was disappointed at how the books related to each other, there were too many major gaps in the series. In reading a review that said: &quot;If you liked the Hobbit you will love these.&quot; This is a poor characterization. These books are not even in the same league as Tolkien. They would be good books for kids just getting into fantasy, but for the veteran fantasy buff recommend Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series or Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn or something of the like. The premise behind the plots of these books is good but is not developed well."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea was an incredibly difficult novel. Ged's coming of age story lacked the necessary pieces to form a great work of art. The lack of excitement and character development made for a tedious reading. Earthsea's stop and go, choppy presentation created even more difficulties. The climactic scenes were few and far between and without those couple of events, the book would have been a complete failure. The two main confrontation scenes held the most excitement and this enthrallment simply festered out of the need for action and longing for an interesting facet to this book.Another fault within the confines of this book was the poor depiction of time. With all of the sea travel and moving around, the time frame seemed to extend to decades. It appeared to be much like an epic, extending over an incredible amount of time. However, in actuality the lapse was only a couple of years. There was only one instance where the time passed was given an amount. The time between the first encounter with the shadow and the running into Vetch towards the end of the novel was two years. In those two years, Ged had traveled far and encountered much, so much it seemed impossible that it had only been two years. For this reason, it was extremely difficult to give age, appearance or understanding to the character, Ged. The similarities between Earthsea and Harry Potter were amazing, however, Harry Potter was written well with character development and exciting, adrenaline-rushing scenes. Despite the similar aspects Earthsea fails to live up to Harry Potter or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If you are reading this book for your Harry Potter fix, you will find next to no similarities. Yes, the main character is a young wizard and he does spend time in a wizard school, but that is where the similarities end. This story is more serious and told more like a fable and has none of the fun, sometimes whimsical nature of a Potter story.I enjoyed the story and it was over before it even got started coming in at a thin 196 pages in paperback. Alot of Ged's life is breezed over, sometimes covering years in a paragraph or 2. About halfway through the story, you know pretty much how it will end and it seems to drag out the inevitable with a very short final conflict.The world Le Guin creates is a huge island based realm with boats and water in abundance. Magic is ubiquitous and wizards are highly respected members of society. I was drawn into the story by the legends and lore as well as fantasy elements like dragons, but didn't care much at all for any of the characters who are never given much depth.Maybe in the 60's this book was a breath of fresh air in the fantasy world, but it just doesn't hold up over time to current books with much better drawn characters, more fantasic worlds and more engrossing plots."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is a classic book and with good reason. It takes the standard concepts good vs evil, becoming a better person or become the person you are meant to be; and Le Guin makes is it feel fresh and inviting you want to know more. The reason for only 3 stars is due to my personal bias of finding the writing style a bit cumberson. This will however not stop me from reading the rest of the series because I want to know Ged's journey."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin is about a powerful wizard in the archipelago of Earthsea who, in his quest for mastery of all words of power, unintentionally unleashes a terrible shadow upon the peaceful lands. The all-powerful wizard, who is named Ged, is also called Sparrowhawk in his bumbling as well as awe-inspiring youth. When the Kargs, the people from the island to the north of his attack, Ged conjures up a fog spell he learned from his aunt to hide the townspeople from the Kargs. When Ogion hears about this, he exclaims that he believes Ged will become one of the greatest wizards ever. Ogion then takes Ged to the Isle of the Mages to learn all he can about wizardry.At the Isle of the Mages, Ged, who is now named Sparrowhawk by Ogion, learns much at a high rate. Being a young and naive wizard, Sparrowhawk challenges his arch-rival, Jasper to a dangerous if not forbidden duel to the death. During this pride instigated battle, Sparrowhawk attempts to use a spell too difficult for him to control and greatly injures himself. The enchantment he attempts summons a spirit from the dead which was, after attacking Sparrowhawk, loosed upon the lands of Earthsea. Soon, much evil happens across the lands. Sparrowhawk was sent to the island of Low Torning to battle newly hatched dragons and, upon his arrival, found the head dragon. Because the mage guessed the dragon's name correctly, he then controlled the dragon. The wizard forced the dragon to tell the others to not attack the people of Earthsea, which turns Sparrowhawk into a dragonlord. Then the wizard feels obligated to finally destroy the black shadow. He tracks the shadow down and calls it by its real name, Ged. He reasons with it and it returns to the wizard's body because Sparrowhawk realizes that the shadow is only a part of him that he was scared of. He realizes that there is always going to be an evil side to him to balance everything out. This book was very good and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.I liked the different turning points in the book. They were very original and there were a lot. For example there were points like when Ogion comes to Gont and tells him that he will be one of the greatest wizards ever. Two other big turning points were when Sparrowhawk unleashes the shadow and becomes slightly disabled and when he finds his yew staff which brings him back to his normal self.Another thing I really liked about this book was watching the changes and big decisions Sparrowhawk made in his life. A big decision he makes is when he goes to the Isle of the Mages instead of staying in Gont with his family. Another big decision he makes, which was also a risk, is to stay on the island of Low Torning to battle the dragons. Even though he was urged to leave, he knew what he had to do. At the island, while he is battling the dragon, the dragon offers to tell him the name of the shadow with the price of releasing all of the dragons and letting them destroy the East side of Earthsea. Sparrowhawk refuses the offer and decides to learn the name of the shadow himself.The other thing I really liked about this book are the lessons it teaches to the readers. It teaches to the readers as well as the main character that there will always be a good side and a bad side of any given human being. The thing that defines a person is the way they balance it out. As long as you realize this and attempt to control it, you will always be considered \\"good\\".I liked this book a lot and thought it is one of the best fantasy books I have read. I did not expect it to be so good because all I did was go to Barnes and Nobles and picked out the first book I could find. It turned out that I made a good choice. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is the first of a trilogy set in the World of Earthsea long ago, during a time when dragons, wizards and magic were not uncommon, nor yet extinct. The island of Gont, located in the stormy Northeast Sea, is a land famous for its wizards. Gont's most famous native son was Ged, called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage. His life is told in the \\"Deed of Ged,\\" in many other stories and songs, and in this book.Duny, a boy from the village of Ten Alders, was fascinated by his aunt's small \\"women's\\" magic. She was the local witch, no dark sorceress, but someone of use to the townspeople with her herbs and simple spells. The boy seemed to have a natural inclination for magic, and his aunt taught him a variety of tricks. His innate skills were put to a test when hordes of vicious Kargs invaded his homeland. His quick thinking allowed him to tap into his limited repertoire and come up with a spell to enshroud the village and its inhabitants in fog. Thus they were invisible to the enemy and almost everyone was saved. Word of the deed spread until Ogion the Silent, the great mage of Re Albi who tamed an earthquake, finally heard of Duny. Ogion comes for the boy on his thirteenth birthday and gives him his \\"true name,\\" which is Ged. And Ged takes the use-name (nickname) of Sparrowhawk. Very few in this world know a person's true name, \\"because who knows a man's true name, holds that man's life in his keeping.\\"Ged travels with Ogion to Re Albi as his apprentice, learning to read and write the Six Hundred Runes of Hardic and proves to be an adept student. He finds he has developed a power which allows him to call animals. However, Ged is tempted by magic clearly forbidden to one so inexperienced, and makes a terrible mistake. From this incident, Ged and Ogion learn that he has become too powerful at too young an age and is not able to control the magic within. The boy decides to leave his beloved mentor and travel to Roke Island and the School (for sorcery). Here he studies under the Archmage Nemmerle, Warder of Roke and the nine Masters of Roke. He finds that a wizard's life is spent learning the true name of things in the old tongue. Power to a mage must be kept in balance. Every action has a reaction. Again, training goes extremely well for Ged until pride and willfulness cause him to step over the line again, and foolishly use power which he not yet mastered. This time the consequences are truly horrific and will have a lasting effect on his life.Ged must move on, past this trauma to body and spirit, and continue to seek wisdom while he prepares to confront his monsters. He must also serve as sorcerer to the people he made a contract with. His adventures along the way are thrilling, as is the novel's extraordinary climax. This is a phenomenal book!Although this novel, and the entire trilogy, have been classified as children's books, I don't know whether I totally agree with the label or classification. The plots may well be appreciated by children and adults alike, but the prose, the very language used to form the riveting storylines, is as rich and flavorful as dark Belgian chocolate. I had to stop several times to read descriptive passages aloud, to listen to the music of the narrative. The author paints a universe of landscapes with words, and they're as vivid in the mind's eye as seeing the real thing. The narrative voice is bard-like, as if relating a legend of long ago. Ms. LeGuin's exposure to Native American legends as well as Norse mythology is evident in her writing. She is the daughter of anthropologists and throughout her fiction there seems to be a deep understanding of how societies work, how they are built and evolve. Ursula Le Guin is an artist, pure and simple, as well as a magical writer.JANA"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The Earthsea Trilogy (now five books total, but originally A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore) is part of the fantasy canon and the first book is by far the best.From headstrong and impatient youth, to upstart schoolboy to true wizard (wizard derives from the words \\"wise\\" and \\"one\\"), A Wizard of Earthsea follows the rites of passage of Ged who learns to control his power, his emotions, and his knowledge as he journeys through his adolescence -- he becomes a greater wizard and better person with age and adversity, a lesson LeGuin imparts to her primary readership in this book (teens and young adults).There's a lot here in this small book: a fully developed world, a system of magic (the true name concept that one can obtain power over something or someone by knowing its true name) that has spawned similar magic systems in other fantasy worlds (Black Company's true name of sorcerers, Belgariad's Will and the Word), a school of magic, a plethora of dangers and adventures, and one of the great mage-mentors, Ogion the Silent. All of which is evoked simply, swiftly and without authorial self-indulgence.Plus, this is a rare fantasy series because its heroes are not European-esque Caucasians. The Earthsea islands seem like North Sea chains, but Ged (reddish-brown skinned), Ogion (same) and Vetch (black-skinned) are the main heroes and none is a typical Caucasoid male.This is one of the great books of fantasy fiction. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin's novel \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a fantasy that takes place on an ocean world that is speckled with a large number of islands. Earthsea is a pre-industrial society of farmers and fisherman, where the weapons of choice are swords and lances. It is also a world of wizards and dragons.\\"Wizard\\" is a coming-of-age story that follows its hero, Ged, from boyhood to young manhood. Along the way he learns the craft of wizardry. This is a story of friendship and rivalry, of arrogance and self-knowledge. A key concept is the equilibrium that true wizards strive for. Although the story is fantasy, I found Ged's journey to remind me somewhat of the journey of the hero of \\"The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,\\" another great coming-of-age story (although a real-life one). This indicates to me that Ged's story, despite its fantasy setting, is firmly grounded in real emotions and ethical concerns.LeGuin has created a complete and compelling world. Masterfully woven into her narrative are geology, meteorology, linguistics, racial diversity, oral and written literature, dragon biology, and other aspects of this world. Her prose style is simple but elegant, often poetic and mystical; the book has a timeless, classic quality. If you only know LeGuin as the author of classic science fiction, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" will reveal her to you as a master of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Hallo fantasy lovers,I am a girl from a Eastern Europe, Latvia, and in love with le Guin's books. I have read the Earthsea trilogy, that's the only of her books that has been translated in my language, but English books are unfortunately hardly available here. Yet I would like so much to read them in original... I think English is much more appropriate language for tales and fantasy... and of course, to possess them... But they are long since out of print in Latvia. Now they are publishing mostly trash that I do not read.I could, of course, have the books through Internet but there's a problem that my student's scholarship does not quite coincide with the normal Western prices. ( If somebody's interested, the scholarship for excellent marks is around 15 dollars a month - is it not ridiculous?). That's why I am writing this review hoping to find a friendly readerly heart. Is there anybody out there who has has got a spare copy of le Guin' s works that he/she could share? It can be old and suffered, of course. I only want to read them desperately.

It is rich, deep and well worth the time of a serious reader, as well as being a great read for someone looking for entertainment. The previous comments about the descent into the subconscious and the search for the Anima (etc.) are welcome insights to carry during my frequent re-readings. As true and important in its own way as Dione Fortune's The Sea Priestess and Moon Magic for its sensible treatment of real magic.

Sparrowhawk begins as a young goat herder on the island of Gont. He is being trained by a witch there, but when he uses his powers to defend his island from attack, he attracts the notice of a powerful wizard named Ogion. Ogion tells Sparrowhawk that his true name is Ged. (a true name holds great power in Earthsea for it permits the speaker power over the named) and takes him on as an apprentice. Ged learns quickly and is reckless in both his learning of magic as well as his application of magic, and this eventually gets him in trouble. Ged desires more knowledge and goes to the school at Roke. It is here that Ged truly excels, but it is also at Roke that he casts a spell that calls a shade (best description of it without spoiling it) that is much stronger than Ged.This begins the quest portion of the book as Ged both flees from the shade and later confronts it (that's not a spoiler, you had to know it's coming). There is magic use, a really nice fight against dragons, and some adventure. Overall, I wasn't too excited about this book. I know it is a classic in the fantasy field, but it was a little slower and less interesting than I had hoped. It was well written, certainly, but it also lacked a little something to make me want to keep turning the pages. Honestly, I didn't care what happened to Sparrowhawk.

Because of those reasons, I wanted stop reading it at page34, but unfortunetly it was required for school. Why can't a book be both preachy and entertaining? The only time I sit down and ponder the theme of a book is when the story didn't need the theme and was just intresting itself.This book failed at that. The plot of this book is also lame. Its about a young powerfull wizard who unleashes something terrible unto the world and goes hunting after it. Nothing else happens except this part involving dragons."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I had heard high praise on this book from many people, so I thought I would give it a try. I am always up for reading a new book, whatever genre it may be. I started reading it. The plot was a little vague to begin with, but I can name a few good books that have a slow beginning, so I gave it the optimistic approach and continued reading. But it never picked up my attention. I always felt disconnected from the characters and plot, and I never felt that I knew anybody's personality. Important people died and people cried and villages were saved and burned, etc. I just didn't care. I felt that this was the story of some random person that I didn't need to be reading.

It follows the life and career of Ged a young man from the Island of Gont. Le Guin has created a very unique world, a world that is mostly water and each nation is a collection of islands. This book is also one of a few that has children's teens and adult editions in print.Ged apprentices to the local Wizard on God, and is eventually sent to the school for wizards on Havnor. There in anger during a fight with other youths he releases a dark shadow, an evil. The Masters of the school appear and banish it from the island.

He tries to return to the protection of Havnor but cannot return to the island the magic protecting the island will not let him approach. So he decides to head south.The shadow is getting closer and closer to him, and he must discern it's true name or else he will not be able to defeat it.

Then a few years back had to read it for an English literature course at the University of Waterloo I was about a third of the way through it when I realized I had read it before and that is when I found our that the story continued. Since then the two collections of short stories have been published in this world.Le Guin deals with some big questions of life in this book. Such questions as:Who am I?Do I have a role or purpose in life?Can I defeat the darkness within me?Can good conquer over evil?Why am I here?Can I make a difference?This book will be a good read for anyone who has ever struggled with some of these questions.

Because it isn't modern, it wasn't very humorous, but sometimes books don't have to be funny to be enjoyable. Ged (Sparrowhawk) travels through some pretty interesting adventures, and he learns about courage, wisdom, friendship, and masters the art of wizardry along the way. The mysterious and evil magic he encounters almost takes him in, but with the help of his friend Erastarriol (Vetch), he overcomes it and learns that their is nothing better in life than friendship. This book wasn't your typical Harry Potter or other type of magical book, it felt much more ancient as I was reading it, and to me that made it more mythical and enchanting.

I'm usually a huge fan of LeGuin's young adult work (Very Far Away from Anywhere Else was on my twenty-five-best list when I read it in 1997), but her tone here is a bit on the didactic side, a far cry from the natural prose she normally uses. Not that it'll keep me away from the other three in the series, as the characters are well-drawn and LeGuin laid her hooks for the next books quite neatly in a row in this one, but if you're new to the wonderful world of LeGuin, I'd suggest starting with one of the adult books before trying these out. ***"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Nor does each volume have to be 1000 pages long!

The writer has a wonderful ability to describe the surroundings and situations, but I felt wanting to know more about the character and the situation.

I found myself enjoying it a lot. It is a very complicated tale about limitation and about fighting one's own personal demons.The cast of characters is deliciously real and every character has many aspects:Ged is torn in two, his bravery and courage is being tested, his honesty and goodness even more so, as he releases a great evil and must fight it with both sides of himself. His teacher is wise and tries to remain as objective as possible, yet he loves his pupil dearly and his icy manners are not as solid as Ged initially thinks.

Good work Ursula!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"i was introduced to ursula k. leguin just this year, and she has certainly become one of my favorite authors. her books aren't like typical fantasy, with some magic object of power and a big old quest, with plenty of fighting and killing on the way. i loved this book because of how well the author developed characters and how she portrays ged's transformation from a child to an adult. i also like the fact that the evil is conquered not in some huge and bloody battle, but by ged coming to terms with the good and bad sides of himself. i loved the description of nature and the sea, and i found all the different histories of the islands to be really interesting. this book hasn't gotten the credit it deserves, so i hope more people will read it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The earthsea quartet was wonderful. I've read it many times. It takes you on ups, and downs. You see suspence, fear, humor, love, anything you could ask fore. Ged is my hero! These were such great books, and I think everyone should read them!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"While I have not read any of Le Guin's other works, this book sorely tempts me to try. As others have said, the fast and furious action of sword fights and magic battles is somewhat lacking. It should be stated, however, that the book never pretends to offer that. It is more a story of growth and personal development and this is what Le Guin clearly accomplishes. She writes in such a manner as to engage readers of all ages over 13 with solid writing, incredible plot and character development, and extremely good dialogue. The action, when it is present, is appropriate for the scene and is never the focal point of the chapter. Call it the psychological drama/thriller of fantasy, I just call it a really good book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Has alot of strange things in the begining, but there are enough explainations and descriptions in the later chapters. Great for any person just begining fantasy, this would be the book to start reading. McCaffrey and Tolkien and Le Guin are my favorite, they all seem to be of a parallel, if not the exact same types of fantasy. Gives great insight on nature of person, world, and our feelings, actions and thoughts. If a teacher &quot;forces&quot; you to read this, go thank him/her."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I loved this book. I read it quite a while ago but It made a big impact on me. I like how the main character developed throughout the book. It also showed that we all go through trials even the most powerful of us, Sparrowhawk had to respect the power of words and keep the balance. This, in my opinion, was the best book in the whole series. The rest were very good too. It delved deep into the mind of the main character and kept me captivated the whole time. Her writing style is very good, and so is her ability to describe. I loved this book. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read the whole series, if not they can still enjoy the one book but I would find it impossible to not continue with the series. Buy it and savor every page!!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"LeGuin creates a completely believable world reminiscient of the days when Viking pirates plundered European settlements. Earthsea is an archipelago of small and large islands, ruled by island kings threatened by seagoing marauders and the occasional dragon. It is a region still subject to the creative power which formed the islands out of the sea and still endows a few of its inhabitants with some degree of magical power. From amongst these some are drawn to train as fully fledged wizards on the island of Roke so as to serve the island kings or attend to woes of the island people.Into this world the young rustic boy Ged is born with exceptional powers which after their initial wonder and excitement prove more of a burden to him and serve instead to separate him from his family and people. LeGuin writes an intriguing tale of the loneliness of power and the terrible consequences of our actions, even if it is unintentional or well-meaning.LeGuin demonstrates clearly that she is one of the few writers who appreciates that power even of the magical kind has its own rules and limitations which may set us on a path which taxes us to our limits and may deprive of us of life's simpler pleasures and the gift of peace of mind. And so Ged discovers that simple pranks when dabbling in magic have fateful consequences which pursue him to the ends of his world and that a wizard is not the master of his world but very much its servant with his hands not only full but tied.Why and how is explained carefully and ingeniously through the course of the three novels, teaching us why magicians deserve our respect and our pity.But LeGuin can be merciful and Ged's lonely life finds unexpected peace and comfort in the concluding novel Tehanu."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This Wonderful book 'must' be read by all.If anyone thinks they are getting dull and/or boring, then they should read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"As a devout Tolkien fan, I've looked long and hard for a book that can grip my imagination like any of the famous Lord of the Rings trilogy. I thought I'd found the cure to my fever when I purchased this book that was glorified as &quot;a classic of high fantasy...compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis's Narnia stories.&quot; I was well disappointed.As I trudged through the story of Ged the boring one dimentional wizard who is always glum, I began to realize that I may never find a story that satisfies my need to replace Bilbo, Frodo or Gandalf. There is no development of other characters in Wizard of Earthsea. Only an agonizing depiction of a wizard who chases his shadow day after day. However, there is one bright light for this story (the reason I was able to give it 2 stars), it's well written. That in itself is a rarity these days.If you are looking for an engaging story, I recommend skipping the Earthsea trilogy and trying something fresh with George R.R. Martin's trilogy starting with A Game of Thrones. Although the tiny Earthsea books are easier to carry around with you than the mammoth Game of Thrones or Clash of Kings, you'll be much more satisfied in the end!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I don't often read books that combine a fantasy setting, spare, evocative prose with ideas of such great depth and - dare I say it? - universality. There is no real need to intellectualize about this book: there is a real case to READ it.The young Sparrowhawk, wizard aspirant falls afoul of the shadow of his own hubris and spends the rest of the tale trying to master the consequences of his arrogance and ignorance. Earthsea is a beautifully realized setting - with a minimum of verbiage, which so often in fantasy can overwhelm with its detail. The ideas - psychoanalytical, existential and drenched in an Eastern-style holism - speak gently through the simple language. I love this book and the first two sequels. Read 'em all."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"There are a lot of positive things that can be said about this book, and this series. One thing many reviewers seem to be overlooking is the simple beauty of LeGuin's writing. She employs a simple, almost monosyllabic vocabulary, to give her tale the feel of a song, or a poem. Compare her use of language to, for example, the frenzied addiction to long-winded, Latin-derived vocabulary used by Poe, and you will see why her writing conveys an almost mythic calm. I also like the way she has such beautiful sentence structure -- many sentences are like terraced waterfalls, with the reader's mind tumbling lazily down a series off steplike prepositional phrases. If you want to study writing, and the use of language, you could do a heck of a lot worse than start with this book.The story is of a young man's growth to wisdom. There is Taoism as well as Jungian ideas all through this story -- if you can get a copy, (which would have been very difficult if you live in a small town, until Amazon.com and its competitors came along), I recommend picking up the &quot;Tao te Ching&quot;, by Lao-Tzu. You will recognize many quotations from this story.You can have a lot of fun with this story, and hopefully get a lot out of it. Check it out!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It is a strange thing, reading a fantasy novel written decades ago. It is one of the most forceful reminders of how tastes -- and styles -- have changed. This is not a slambang, sword wielding fantasy, the kind many of us have become accustomed to in the past few years. Nor is it the cute, elfin, or funny sort of fantasy, either. There are no cute creatures and only a few scary ones. In other words, this is not a book for the reader looking for instant gratification.The world of Earthsea is composed of groups of islands, each with its own history, and often with different languages. The sea is the highway between them, with boats of various sizes and shapes moving over it from place to place. But the sea is more: it is a character that influences eventsLeguin tells the story of Ged and his search for a dark entity in a lyrical and languid way. Here the beauty is as much in the words as in the setting. Certainly, the characters are less than sympathetic, at least in the beginning. Ged, a young, soon-to-be wizard, somewhat brash, not caring about the consequences of his actions. Ogion the Silent, who knows all and tells nothing. The Dragon of Pendor, hugely ominous and dangerous. And Vetch, Ged's friend and confidant. None of these are well-drawn at first. But, when the book ends, the reader feels that he or she knows each.This, the first in the Earthsea trilogy, published in the 1960s, reflects the inward looking of that time. People trying to find themselves and their place in the world. Before Ged is named, his own search begins as he grows and changes, becoming a person to be reckoned with in his own world.Readers of this book may also like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have nothing much to say, it's just very good book!

I don't know about others, but I like this trilogy very much."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Le Guin wrote this book before the 400+ page standard for a 'good' fantasy book came about. This book takes you there -- you could be Ged and isn't that really what fantasy books are all about? This one's on par with The Hobbit, Dune, Ender's Game etc., in my top shelf category. The rest of the 'series' isn't a trilogy in today's meaning, rather looking at Ged later in life. I'm not a huge fan of Le Guin, but this one will read as well 100 years from now as today."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea not only has a great characters but a great plot as well. Le Guin really spents time on telling about the characters and the scenery and i think it really gives a sense of understanding to the whole thing. The story of a young man growing to be more than he had expected more or less by accident is told throughout the entire earthsea series and this book starts the seires off greatly.

This is one of the most beautifully written books I have read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It's interesting that Le Guin is now returning to Earthsea, first with her new collection of stories, apparently to be followed with another novel. It is telling that she has created a marvelous invention -- despite all promises, even she can't help returning to the scene.It starts off well. A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA is an intense starting point. It describes a harsh realm, where, even with the aid of everpresent magic, life is tough, and survival is eked out. From here, Le Guin launches her fable of Ged, the Sparrowhawk, an intensely talented but brash young man. The consequences of his pride are unleashed in dramatic fashion, and ultimately he must confront the dark forces of life.There is nothing glib, and dark surprises abound. Le Guin moves the story along at a reasonable pace, with a disappointingly (but probably necessarily) compact conclusion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read this book as a teenager, and recently re-read it as an adult. The book has held up wonderfully! The prose is crisp and clear, the story compelling, and the characters interesting. Sparrowhawk/Ged is a wonderful apprentice-hero...he has to learn not only how to be a wizard (hmmm, a school for wizards...sound familiar?), but more importantly, he has to learn how to become a hero. That quest, which is much more important than any of the steps he takes to achieve it, is the true focus of the book. A coming of age stories with magic, dragons and fearsome monsters...what more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"The series of Earthsea is great! I enjoyed the first book one of my teacher lent me, and now I'm working on the third, having completely enjoyed the second. I love Ursula K.

I recommend you buy this book, but I must warn you, you're going to get hooked on it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Not too many fantasy series really impress me. Of this date,there have only been two: Pullman's His Dark Materials and TolkiensLOTR. This book, and series, come close, but i found them wanting.AWizard of EarthSea has its own appeal, in the style that marks theseries. The story has the air of a saga, and one gets the feeling thatimportant things might happen with Ged. People have called it HighFantasy, which is fine. This book is thoughtful and insightful, butthere a few problems.First of all, although great things seem to bein store for Ged, they are not apparent in this book. The sense ofdestiny that was created in the beginning got lost somewhere along theway, and now Ged drifts along with his sole purpose of exterminating ashadow.The book also has little to hold it together; again we getthe feeling of being adrift. He wanders from town to town, from evilcastle to dragon-infested island to fishing villages. Another problemis the interminable length of the boat rides, which creates nosuspense at all for his confrontation with the shadow; nor does itimpress with its imagery, or its rich complexity. The book franklygets a little dull towards the end. In good fantasy we usually get atleast a glimpse of some overarching conflict. That is absent here,almost completely. I'm not asking for a thriller but a book should nottake too much energy just to stay focused. Finally, the way he defeatsthe shadow has the air of a cheap movie ...The book isn't bad. Theauthor's language is simple yet evocative, and I found myselfcontemplating the book. If the second half of the book had been asgood as the first i would have to give it at least 4 stars. LeGuin'sseries has an air of timelessness about it. I only wish this promisehadn't been largely ignored in the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"3 stars for story, 1 star for audio quality. The Audible publishers took the old cassette recording (!!) from the dark ages of voice recording technology and poured it into a digital file. The cassette breaks are still included in the audio, e.g. \\"This is the end of cassette one. Please eject the cassette and turn it over...\\" Even worse, the narrator, Rob Inglis, stops and draws breath after every group of sentences. He should have moved away from the microphone when he needed to draw breath. It sounds gasping at times. Fairly loud every time. I started to cringe every time I heard him gasping for breath between sentences.As for the story itself, it started off with a bang, as a young boy named Duny, aka Sparrowhawk (but mostly referred to as Ged) learns that he is magical. After he saves the village from invaders by creating dense fog, he becomes apprentice to a wise wizard named Ogion. Ged likes Ogion, but when that benevolent wizard doesn't teach him enough flashy spells to suit his ambitions, he decides to attend a school of wizardry. Once at the special school, he must deal with his constant feelings of inferiority. He was born the poor son of a forger, and many of these boys are upper class and have been studying magic for years. He assumes several of the teachers and the boys (Jasper especially) are mocking him, but I am not so sure they were in every case.Ged's pride cannot swallow the supposed mockery so he decides to prove to them all -- especially Jasper -- that he is the best wizard ever. Not realizing what he is calling up, he casts a dark forbidden spell, calling up a shadowy monster. Because of his actions, some people die, including the school's head wizard, who supposedly banishes the shadow. Several years alter, Ged realizes that his shadow monster is still at large, working evil. He runs from it, until Ogion tells him that he must become the hunter, and chase after it. So he does, and in the process he must grow up fast.The ending was all it should be. An outstanding finale to the first book in the series.An okay story, but I was unsatisfied. It felt like a series of events without any glue to hold them together -- an unemotional telling of events. I felt distanced from Ged, because the author failed to adequately reveal his emotions and thoughts, even though he should have been feeling and thinking a great deal, given the danger and death that surrounded him in some sections. Also, I wanted to get to know some secondary characters. I wanted Ged's relationships with Vetch and Ogion to be more developed. This story was very Ged-centric. In that, it was really the story of a young boy with an inferiority complex and a lot of pride who fights his inner shadows and emerges the victor. Nice.Back to the quality of the Audible file, the narrator was not very skilled, technology faults notwithstanding. He was no Jim Dale."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Before he became a legend, the sorcerer Ged, called Sparrowhawk, was a proud and standoffish young man who conjured a nameless and dangerous shadow--a feat of impressive magic that would haunt him throughout his youth. A Wizard of Earthsea is the truth behind a fable, told in a dry but arcane tone that mimics both parts; unfortunately I had no love for the language, which fulfilled its purpose but also reads as stilted and, for me, mostly served to slow the text. Fortunately it's a slim volume, so even when slowed it never stagnates, and the austerity of language combined with the density of action does have a certain fable-esque quality. It seems strange to say this of Le Guin, but one wishes for more (or any) worthwhile female characters, but Ged is fantastic, flawed but rich with potential, and I can understand why this is a young adult/coming of age classic. Best of all, the ending--while not unpredictable--carries weight: it's strong and satisfying, and rewarded my otherwise ambivalent interest in the book. I expect I wasn't the ideal audience for this, and don't think I'll pick up the rest of the series, but I still recommend it on the basis of the strengths I saw although I wasn't the one to appreciate them, and on the assumptions that others will."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Tight, well-written piece of classic fantasy literature, but the ending was just completely deflating, wasting an entire book's worth of intense build-up."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ged's amazing potential as a wizard is recognized and he is plucked from a remote village by a master wizard, destined to become one of the greatest wizards of all.And then that terrible human frailty, pride, gets the upper hand, and Ged makes a mistake that seemingly ruins his life.And Ged is off on a quest to restore the world.Le Guin writes with the rhythm of a poet and with the wisdom of a philosopher in this beautiful classic fantasy novel."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This trilogy, of which this book is the first, is every bit as brilliant as the Lord of the Rings, trilogy. LeGuin has been around a long time - she is undeniably brilliant.

Lovely writing."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Having spent a lot of my time reading non-fiction recently, I wanted to step out of this world and into another. The Wizard of Earthsea was definitely a good choice. The plot travels at a brisk pace and the characters and world are easy to visualize and understand. However, these are not cardboard cut-outs. The characters were some of the most well developed I've read in a fantasy book in a while (coincidentally characters developed a lot like some of the memoir books I've been reading). The world was also superbly realized. It was dynamic; cultures were diverse; the world was interesting. The magic was more intelligently implemented than most. (Personally I felt some of it was too much \\"just go believe me here\\" but that's just me) I unfortunately have a stack of books I want to dive into first, but when I get back to this series I will feel most refreshed."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I think you have to read the first three books of Earthsea as one entity. Each is only about 200 pages long, so if you read all three you'll still be under the average length of one volume of the usual wordy fantasy series.Le Guin's prose is a marvel of compact elegance; she can tell you what you need to know in a few vivid paragraphs where other fantasy writers need pages and pages. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is perhaps my least favorite of the three books, although it's essential to the development of the story. It's Ged's bildungsroman, in which Le Guin establishes the parameters of her magic universe and Ged learns what he needs to know to become a true wizard.My favorite remains \\"The Tombs of Atuan,\\" the middle novel -- an involving story with an attractive young heroine."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I cannot rave about this book enough. The Earthsea cycle is in the number one spot of my best all time favorite YA fantasy novels.I see there are some 400 people who agree with me."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I never thought that a 144 page story would take me SO LONG TO READ. Yikes. I planned to read the first three books of the Earthsea series for Jawas Read, Too!'s Summer of Series, but once again I fear I will fail at a challenge. Maybe if I'm lucky the Tombs of Atuan review will be up tomorrow. Fingers crossed. There are a few good, sensible excuses for my painfully long reading of A Wizard of Earthsea: I recently got a summer job and my hours have gone up lately, especially weekend hours which is prime reading time for me, and I have taken a few vacations in which reading was impossible. But then there is the fact of this book simply did not want me to read it quickly. It refused to be read for more than 20 minutes at a time. I blame Ged.I have been wanting to read a Le Guin book for many moons now. I have heard from a couple people that she is a classic, and everyone must read her before they die. I did some scouting around, like I normally do when I hear such a thing, to see what she has written and if they sound like my thing. The Earthsea trilogy definately sounded like my thing, along with a few of her other books I might pick up later. I put the series of my To Be Read list, but since there were no copies available at my local libraries, I forgot about them. Then I heard about Jawas' Summer of Series. And I found an omnibus edition of the series on Paperback Swap. The stars were aligned. In my defense, I did only receive the omnibus in the middle of June and this challenge is only for the month of June. So there.Ged was born on the island of Gont, an island known for housing powerful and prominent wizards. Not many from Ged's poor village suspected the great things that he would someday come to do. They couldn't foresee that one day songs would be song of the little ruffian running among the goats. One day, a great wizard living on Gont comes and takes Ged away to live with him. There he tries to show Ged what it means to be a wizard, but he is a slow teacher. Ged soon goes bored, and when he is asked to go to a school for wizards on Roke island, he goes. At the school, he learns tought lessons that shape the rest of his life. He learns one lesson too late and unleashes a dark burden on Earthsea that he must vanquish at once or die trying.A Wizard of Earthsea is told as a folk tale or legend. The reader is told a certain amount at the beginning of the story about how things will end. I really dislike this way of storytelling because I like a certain amount of mystery in my stories. I know that things will more than likely end up happy. And I know that the protagonist will be superfantasticamazing because if there weren't going to end up being a somebody, why write a story about them? No one wants to read a story about a wizard who sits on his couch all day, using magic to change the channels. But I still want to pretend to be surprised when things work out this way. I like the warm and fuzzy feeling I get when the characters defeat the evil and head back home to their family and friends. This didn't happen to me in a Wizard of Earthsea because I had known all along what would happen.Despite the feeling of being spoiled, I thought the story was original and entertaining to read. Ged begins his real studies as a wizard with a patient and mysterious wizard called Ogion. I loved Ogion, obviously. How could you not? He was the typical kindly old wizard who knows more than he cares to tell, but only for the good of those around him. He is conscious of the great power he could yield, but he also knows the consequences of everything he does. The greatest part of the story for me was the trials Ged had to go through to learn that exact lesson of consequences and being at peace with oneself as Ogion was. I appreciated how it wasn't an easy thing for him to learn, but how in learning it would make it him an great and powerful user of magic. Some parts of the story, especially towards the end, were very profound and philosophical when discussing the lessons Ged had learned. I think these parts showed what a fantastic author Ms. Le Guin is.I found Ged to be a complex character, but I did not have much attachment to him. My problem with this was the distance that telling the story as a legend put between the reader and the protagonist. Legends are not too concerned with thoughts and feelings. The story is explained as, \\"Something happens, Ged reacts, reason he reacts is explained.\\" The reasons were more told than shown in my opinion. Not only that, but important building years of Ged's life are simply skipped over. I couldn't feel a connection with Ged even though I did feel he was a great character; it was an odd feeling. I loved how he wasn't an innocent viction when it came to his school boy enemy, Jasper. He was as much to blame, if not more so, in creating an enemy in Jasper. He imagined things that weren't there, or things that could have easily been overlooked, he brought to the forefront of his mind and obsessed over. These obsessions came to a head when the two boys took their growing power too far because they didn't understand the consequences of what they were doing yet.The worldbuilding of Earthsea is elaborately over-the-top, and I ate it up. When I first heard if the name Earthsea, I scoffed at its absurdity. I found myself thinking, \\"Could this author be any more unoriginal? Earth and sea, I wonder where she got those two words from?\\" I now swallow those words. I love that name now. It makes perfect sense when you create a world filled with only with hundreds and thousands of tiny islands. I found myself thinking that an in-depth look at the politics of these islands would be fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the little snippets Le Guin gave us of each island's world. I was also overjoyed with the close up maps that were interspersed within the book; I needed them desperately. The little islands were sometimes hard to find in the big map, and I like to know exactly where I am in the world. Another important part of the Earthsea world are names. Every single thing, from a wave to an insect, has a true name which you must know to control it. Names are sometimes important parts in fantasy novels involving magic; books like Eragon come to mind. A Wizard if Earthsea took this theme to the extreme. A person, if they wanted to control a person, had to work to find out a person's name, because surely a person would guard that secret with everything they had. It was an interesting concept and added another layer to Le Guin's theme that no power comes without working.Rating: 7 out of 10. I agree that A Wizard of Earthsea is a classic in the fantasy genre. I have heard some say it paved the way for Harry Potter, which I can, loosely, see. I had a few problems with the story, the main one being how slow going it was for me. I could read the whole Harry Potter series in less days than it took me to read this one book. I will definately pick up more Le Guin books, and I can already tell you that I enjoy the Tombs of Atuan much more."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is a classic fantasy, complete with dragons, magic, and of course the proud and gifted wizard-in-training, Ged. Le Guin's style, which appeals to me more the older I become, is simple, spare, yet colorfully descriptive. It's amazing how much she can cram into a mere 182 pages. I lost a copy of this book when I was a teenager, and was very pleased to discover I could purchase a similar copy, with the original cover artwork, on Amazon."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Although often described as a childrens book, A wizard of Earthsea should be read by people of any age, and any who read it will be changed by the experience. Its one of those books that inspires and changes your entire perspective on life. Ged, whose humble beginnings as a goatherder fail to deter his destiny as a Wizard, unleases a terrible evil while training to be a Wizard on the island of Roke. What follows is a journey that changes Ged's life forever. Chased and persued within an inch of his life, Ged soon becomes a hunter, learning about wisdom, power and ultimately himself along the way. There is magic in the pages of this book, and it definitely does not deserve to be dissmissed as a childrens book, although the kids will enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Though obviously written for adolescents, this is a beautifully crafted story that should appeal to all thoughtful readers. In prose that is spare yet visually evocative and resonant with meaning, LeGuin creates an exterior journey of adventure that is also a deep personal journey toward maturity, with all the pain and loss, the failures and successes, and ultimate balance that such a journey involves. Her note-perfect narrative voice enhances the archetypal nature of Ged's quest for purpose and values. His journey takes place in a world as diverse as our own, for the richly envisioned archipelago of Earthsea contains different languages, remote islands and trade centers, rural folk and city sophisticates, cold lands and hot lands, wealth and poverty. Along with several powerful main characters, the novel has many nicely observed minor players and some charming animals, such as a little dragon the length of a girl's hand that lives in oak trees and eats wasps, worms, and birds' eggs. And of course there is the Shadow that Ged accidentally releases in a dangerous ritual, spurred by his own ambition, that goes terribly wrong. Magic appears only when needed, and the descriptions of it are very effective, such as when Ged creates fog to confuse invading warriors or transforms himself into the sparrowhawk that is his namesake in order to make a long journey fast. Beyond its exciting adventure and the theme of self-discovery, the novel is also about how language creates reality, for magic is controlled by language, and language dictates how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them. This is the best -- the purest -- of the four books in the tetralogy, which is saying a lot because all of them are good. Like each of the four, it is a complete story that doesn't depend on the others. My personal favorite among the other three is The Farthest Shore, in which an older Ged takes on a younger version of himself as a kind of apprentice."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I chose this book a long time ago for a school report. And suprisingly, liked it. I still remember the story, though it's a vague image by now.The story of a young boy getting deeper into forbidden secrets and magics, until finally he unleashes an evil shadow. More philosophical than action packed, more thought provoking and concentration required than most fantasy novels. This is the first in the Wizard of Earthsea quartet.Leguin writes with an abstract quality that makes the reader know the story as a WHOLE never in part. A style that fascinated me at the time - and still does. Like a giant jigsaw puzzle, the more you read the greater the picture. But you can never *see* what and where that single piece fits in. Though I kept searching, I never did find the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This was, I think, my first fantasy book. Aside from knights and dragons type of thing. And ever since the first time I read it, come to think it was for a school report oh so many years ago, the book has stuck with me. This is my all-time favorite fantasy book and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This was a lovely book. It is quite thoughtful,creative, dramatic, and even kind of bonechilling in some parts (such as when the boy first discovers the spell for calling up the dead). Le Guin also did well at creating a mood for this darkish story, which takes place in a fascinating land known as the Archipelago. My only complaint is the lack of strong female charachters, and the confusing balance of magic. However, this only slighty takes away from the story. My favorite part in the book was probably when the boy was being taught at Roke.Followed by three sequals"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"In the realm of fantasy there are several names that stand out: Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, Susan Cooper, Diana Wynne Jones (and more recently, Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling and Garth Nix). Ursula le Guin also belongs into this category, contributing to the world of fantasy-literature her beloved \\"Earthsea\\" novels, chronicling the life and times of the wizard Ged.The strength of the storytelling comes in the unashamed use of archetypes and symbolism. The story as a whole could be easily aligned with Carl Jung's theories or Joseph Campbell's \\"Hero's Journey\\" complete with Departure, Initiation and Return, and archetypes such as the wise mentor, the female temptress and the shadow. It's practically a textbook case, but rather than being predictable and dull; le Guin's skill as a writer means that the series is densely packed with meaning and intrigue.But the use of archetype has its downside too, particularly in the portrayals of men and women; Ged attends a wizarding school that is populated entirely by males, in a later book \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\", he is pitted against a cult of malevolent priestesses. Le Guin has recently expressed regret for these borderline-stereotypes and in later books makes the conscious effort to balance out the gender inequality that permeates the earlier books. For me however, (and probably to most readers) it is no big deal - we are, after all dealing with traditional archetypes and in one very important way (that I probably shouldn't even be mentioning) le Guin completely breaks the mould on typical fantasy stories. Ged and nearly all of the other characters have copper complexions. Can you think of any other major fantasy novel in which the protagonist is not Caucasian? I can't.Le Guin's finest creation is her world of Earthsea, a world made up of ocean currents and a myriad of different islands, each one with their own cultures and customs, rich and detailed. It is second only to Middle-Earth, and only becomes richer and deeper with each passing novel. Likewise is le Guin's system of magic, based on the power of names and speech; the reason why Ged goes through so many name-changes (he is born as Duny, given the name Sparrowhawk at puberty and has Ged as his \`true name', his name of power). It is a powerful and consistent system and based on real ancient beliefs (read some Egyptian mythology if you don't believe me).Ged is born to a poor farming island, though with immense potential for wizardry which he is all to eager to engage. After he assists in saving his community through the instigation of magic beyond his years, he is approached by the great wizard Ogion who offers to mentor him. Enraptured with dreams of power and glory, he follows Ogion only to be frustrated by his slow teaching methods, opting instead to travel to Roke and enrol in the great wizarding school there.It is there he enters a friendship with fellow student Vetch and a rivalry with another student named Jasper. Letting his pride and resentment get the better of him, Ged attempts to summon up a spirit from the dead, but only manages to unleash a terrible shadow upon the world. Now hunted by his own creation, Ged takes to the seas, hopping from island to island, in the attempt to escape - and then destroy - the evil he has unleashed.Despite my praise, the story isn't perfect; I always felt that the prose was a little stiff and un-involving, almost as if we were reading a detailed overview of the story rather than one told from a person's intimate point of view. Likewise, the story takes forever to really get started - since the chapters are quite long, it takes a while before the shadow is unleashed. However, the patient will be rewarded, in this and subsequent books."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I think that this a good book for kids in fourth grade who like magic and fantasy.

The characters remain undeveloped as the very modest storyline unfolds itself. For readers of younger ages (10-12) this book would be very interesting because it poses no intellectual difficulties. It passes over months of the characters life with barely a word. It left me with a feeling of com,plete and utter lack of connection with the main character. The fact that someone would even compare this book to Tolkien let alone praising it over him is rediculous. I would actually reread sewctions of the book figuring i must have left out an entire chapter since seemingly important sections of a characters life were just passed by. I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13 unless you have an afternoon to waste."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read. I'm 15 so that might change. I had to read this book a year ago for my English class and I loved it. I went out and got my own copy and I plan to read all the other books in the Earthsea saga."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"With a limitation of five stars maximum, I cannot possibly give this story all the credit it diserves.I am a dedicated fanatic of Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; which I devoured nearly four years ago in third grade. So far, I've seen nothing but the Harry Potter series come even close to those three marvelous books and &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; I was very pleasantly surprised upon readin this book.LeGuin starts by introducing the child Duny, called Sparrowhawk, who has some very remarkable abilities. When Duny is given his true name, Ged, by Ogion the mage, he becomes his prentice, and is eager to learn the ways of magic.Eventually, he comes to Roke, and becomes a student in a school for magic. He befriends a kindly boy called Vetch, but also makes a great enemy -- Jasper. Ged, proud and thirsting for power, attempts to outdo his rival by attempting a very dangerous piece of magic...raising a spirit from the dead. In doing so, he accidentally unleashes a deadly and mysterious shadow into the world. Although he is nearly killed during his first encounter with it, Ged knows it is up to him alone to destroy the unnamed evil he has leashed upon the world.This first book of Earthsea is about Ged's passage from boyhood into adulthood, his mastery of magic, and the journey he undertook to restore Equilibrium to Earthsea."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book is amazing. Actually the whole series is. When I was in the fith grade, I read this book. I adored it. I wouldn't read anything else but the Earthsea Cycle for maybe a year of more. It haunted me. I didn't realize, though, what the book was really about until much, much later. I recently replaced my old copy of this book and reread the series. Now, as I am older, I realize what about this story really struck me. Not only does this book have strong elements of balance and harmony in it, but I think it is poignant and meaningful when it comes to Ged and the darkness he must face. It is very hard for us to recognize the darkness that is within all of us, and even harder for us to name and then make it a part of ourselves, but the only place evil can truly be vanquished is by recognizing it and understanding it, even the evil things within ourselves. The scene where Ged faces down that formless, horrible monster is quite scary. I read several reviews, from mostly children, about how this book wasn't any good, which while they are entitled to their opinions, I do hope they try reading this book again. I see this book shoved in among books by modern fantasy authors like Robert Jordan or R.A. Salvatore of Tanya Huff (all of whom I like), but it really belongs in the literature section, which I think, is why so many are so confused. It is not the type of story they are looking for. I remember when I was little, my uncle saw me reading the Dark Elf Trilogy by R.A. Salvatore. So he gave me The Fellowship of the Ring. Right then, when I wanted more Drizzt, I hated the Lord of the Rings. He had told me it would be like the Drizzt novels, and he wasn't right. They are different kinds of stories. When you want something like the Lord of the Rings, you don't pick up Harry Potter, but Beowulf. The Wizard of Earthsea is also like that. I remember a co-worker of mine directing a young library patron to the Wizard of Earthsea after hearing she like Harry Potter. I stopped the little girl and told her that while she might like it, it isn't at all like Harry Potter and maybe she should try So You Want To Be A Wizard, the Bartimaeus Trilogy, or the Chrestomanci Chronicles. I was right, she hated Earthsea and loved the others. So, in summation, if you read this book and disliked it, give it another try, and if not go see Goro Miyazaki's adaptation of The Farthest Shore and Tehanu in July, and then try again! Remember, there are more types of wizards than the fireball flinging kind and Gandalf!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea is (and deserves to be) a classic of modern fantasy literature. It is a serious-minded allegorical HIGH fantasy. Gone are the comical cavorts of house-elves, or the liberal spell-slinging of Dungeons and Dragons. This book delves into man's identity as the dust of the earth, and how he comes to terms with that.The story follows the early life and coming-of-age of Ged Sparrowhawk, who will become (according to the book) one of the greatest wizards of all time. Ged is proud and lustful for power, and eventually sets an undead shadow loose on the world---one which only he can stop.Two of Le Guin's achievements in the book stand out above the rest. The first is the ability of her style to spark the reader's imagination. Her description of the physical world is extremely sparse, often focusing on characters' immediate feelings. This allows the reader to fill in the gaps of description in his or her own mind, making the world belong more firmly to the reader. This aspect of her writing is mirrored in her choice to focus on \\"slices\\" of Ged's life by quickly passing over periods of a few years. Finally, she actually gives relatively little description of the world, but hints at it enough to give the reader the feeling that there is more going on \\"out there\\" than the book details. This might be frustrating to a reader who felt they were missing out on action, but the book's themes of cosmic balance and tranquility smooth that over somewhat.Which is a nice segue into her next achievement: well-done literary expression of the idea that power requires caution. This idea has been repeated so oft lately as to seem clich&eacute;d---Spiderman, Star Wars, the World of Darkness, Jurassic Park, even Harry Potter---but earlier works only dealt with the caution that must be taken against those with power. While there are examples of the theme before Le Guin (the stories of Icarus, Prometheus, and Epimetheus come to mind), hers was one of the first in the modern era.I ought to stop writing, though. In the words of Ged's master and teacher---\\"To hear, one must be silent.\\""},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula Le Guin made fantasy history with \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" a spare but strangely entrancing story about a young wizard coming of age. Despite a rather distant writing style, Le Guin's story is still a classic that is generally put on the same shelf as Lewis and Tolkien.Ged was born in a village in Earthsea -- a grouping of many, many small islands -- in Gont. The boy soon shows signs of great power, the ability to call animals and to laugh even when his tongue has been bound by a spell. A mage named Ogion apprentices Ged--who is known as Sparrowhawk, as knowledge of his true name would give anyone power over him. But Ogion's discipline and lessons are full of silence and self-examination, something which soon sends Ged to the school for mages in Roke.A rival finally mocks Ged into a magical duel, and a monstrous creature made of shadow attacks Ged, nearly killing him. But upon the completion of his studies, the now-wiser wizard sets off to an island to seek the Dragon of Pendor. As the shadow closes in on Ged and his life becomes increasingly imperiled, he must discern what -- and who -- it is, to make himself truly whole.Le Guin's book has a lot of things in it that tend to annoy readers -- several years are skipped in a few pages, and little of Ged's thoughts and emotions aside from \\"Ged felt this\\" and \\"Ged thought that\\" are revealed. But the spare mythic style and quiet philosophical bent add an extra dimension to a straightforward fantasy story.Le Guin's story spans several years in Ged's life, taking him from a little boy in a dirty village to a powerful and respected mage. But she also spins in Eastern philosophy, in the form of the \\"shadow\\" that stalks Ged for many years -- in some ways, the final explanation for what the shadow is seems fitting.Ged has the makings of a classic hero: he is talented and initially hot-headed, but through his misfortunes is tempered into a more selfless, albeit scarred person (both physically and emotionally). Most of the supporting characters don't appear long enough to get much development, although Ged's buddy Vetch comes across as a sweetheart.Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a memorable story about a boy becoming a man, and a man coming to terms with himself. A unique story, and one worthy of being called a classic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book, being probably Le Guin's most famous fantasy novel, is also one of the strangest. It is different from Lewis' Narnia series and Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in that it sees to lack a coherent, unified theme throughout the course of the story. Le Guin takes us down side plots and round-about courses to reach the final destination. I found that it was similiar to V.S. Naipaul's halting, slow, and somewhat dull way of revealing his insights to the reader in many of his non-fiction books. However, like Naipaul, Le Guin is able to finally bring everything together. Very few details and side paths are frivolous; in fact, they reveal deep insights into the protaganist's inner character. The use of foreshadowing (Ged summoning the shade on Gont) and the use of raw, stripped-down writing is something to be admired in this day, when many books lack a true natural, organic feel.Le Guin's use of minor details (the bauble given to Ged by the strange Kargish woman on the abandoned island) set the stage for various other adventures of Ged. Also, Le Guin creates an elaborate world, the likes of which is only rivaled by Tolkien's Middle Earth.Le Guin truly created a masterpiece in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; and, as such, should receive the praise for her works. However, a newer generation of readers and fantasy novels seems to have swept her writings away. Nevertheless, she ranks only second behind Tolkien in my personal fantasy favorites."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I don't think that many people truly understand what the term &quot;high fantasy&quot; means. For example, I have heard people refer to Anne McCaffrey as high fantasy, when that is not the case. High fantasy is when the author creates an entirely new world, with new languages, new societies, and new realities, which, strangely enough, allows the author to get closer to the truth about human nature and the ways of the world. I know of few authors that really live up to that definition, and one of them is Ursula LeGuin. Although she draws from ancient folklore, as well as basing some of societies in Earthsea on our ancient societies and cultures, a great portion of her work is straight out of her imagination. The book is not for those who like their fantasy light-hearted and with witty or sarcastic comments made by the characters every few minutes. Although there are moments of comic relief, most of the book (and the series) is rather austere and dark. This is because the world that she tells of is harsh and unforgiving, much like Europe in the middle ages. Back then there wasn't a lot to smile about, so you had to find you light in strange places. The good guys aren't always good-looking, and a happy ending sometimes requires that you don't end up with what you want. There is another book that was written ten years after this series, called Tehanu, and it continues where the saga left off, tying up some loose ends, and giving closure. I would definately reccommend Earthsea for those who prefer their fantasy raw and un-sugar coated. It is gritty, and not for the faint of heart, to the point where I wouldn't even really call it fantasy, because it gets about as close to the truth as I have seen any book get."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"THE STORY: is about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Readers will witness Sparrowhawk's moving rite of passage--when he discovers his true name and becomes a young man. Great challenges await Sparrowhawk, including an almost deadly battle with a sinister creature, a monster that may be his own shadow.MY FEEDBACK:1) This book isn't for everyone. The majority of the book is complete narration and very, very little dialogue. Some might find this borning and be tempted to skip to the next piece of dialogue. If you do, you'll miss 90% of the story.2) I had no expectations going into this book except that it is highlye praised by the majority. Even with the long narrations it somehow captured my attention and held it there. Seeing the transformation of the teenager Ged through the story was the core of the book. Teenagers may relate and thus enjoy the story further.3) Ged against a bunch of dragons. Way cool! Need I say anymore.4) I agree with other reviews that Ged is really the only character we get to love and care about (Vetch is also likeable). Ged is the only character the author spends time on getting into the persona and motivations of. The postivie note is Ged as a single character does carry the story well.5) I like how the world is made up of hundreds of little island townships vs. a large continent here or there. This added some nice man vs. nature conflict, as the battle with the wind and sea are a constant thing in this world.OVERALL: Very quick and enjoyable read. You will not waste your time getting your hands on this because you'll know real quick if the narration style of writing is boring for you or not. I enjoyed it so well, that I'm excited to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I loved \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" when I was younger and always remembered the book in the back of my mind as a creative influence but hadn't realized until I recently heard about the Sci-Fi channel mini-series that apparently a lot of other people feel the same way. It seems to be universally compared (in scope and accomplishment) to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Narnia series, the fantasy genre big boys. I've read LotR (but not Narnia) and think that, at least for the first Earthsea novel, the accolade is justified.Instead of comparing Earthsea to LotR, however, I'm going to compare it to a more contemporary wizard series, Harry Potter. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is also about a young boy wizard who (for part of the novel, at least) goes to wizard school and who faces great evil, but aside from that Harry and Ged (Le Guin's protagonist) are complete oppisites. In fact, when considered against some of the negative attention Harry Potter has gotten for either promoting anti-Christian occult or for teaching kids to disrespect their parents, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is even more starkly contrasted. The novel is almost a morality tale about how pride is wrong and can lead you down the wrong path towards great evil, how one should always listen to elders, how study, humility and respect for life are the ways of a good person. I'm sure there are some religious people out there who would object to Earthsea simply because of the presence of magic, but, in reality, the magic in the novel is all found through the understanding of the balance of the world (which is very religious) and through the \\"true names\\" of things, which, in my opinion, is very much like the word of God. Le Guin is not heavy handed and she is not preaching religion (unlike, as I have heard, the Narnia books do) but there is no lesson in Earthsea that can be said not to align with a Judeo-Christian morality.Harry Potter and religion aside, it is a wonderful story and a wonderful book. I started reading it at dinner and stayed up late to finish it because I couldn't stop, and it's always nice to feel a little bit guilty and excited about staying up past your bedtime to read, probably the way I did the first time I read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I was surprised by this little excellent book! A young boy named Sparrowhawk is born with tremendous power but has no training or discipline to handle it. He is taken by the Wizard Ogion to be trained but, Sparrowhawk, impatient to use his skills asks to be sent to the Island of Roke to the famous Wizard School.There he encounters other boys with skills like his own. He comes to face his own weaknesses and greed for power when a classmate whom he hates dares him to cast a spell he is forbidden to do. This results in a tragedy and Sparrowhawk's near fatal injury. Upon recovery, he vows to change his ways and right what he has done.Although this book was recommended for ages eleven and up, it is by no means a book for young adults only. It has some very profound life lessons that adults will identify with. I loved the fantasy world that Le Guin creates. Her writing is taut, suspenseful and imaginative. The premise that the power of a word can change a relationship or destiny is brilliant. The story stresses balance and equilibrium in life in that each action effects all as we are all from one source.Wizard of Earthsea is a totally engrossing and vivid fantasy tale."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"When I first read this book I was blown away by the power that Ursula K.

It was straight to the point of the matter. It is a high fantasy classic that deserves to be shared with all. Ms. LeGuin rates up there with such authors as Tolkein and Anne McCaffrey. This was brilliant book that i would recommend to anyone of any age. I think its ridiculous that great literature such as this, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland, C.S. Lewis, C.M. whitlock's The Price of Immortality and so on get classified as \\"children's books\\". They are books for everyone with imagination, who enjoys good story-telling, and interesting and unusual characters.

Readers who need/enjoy a lot of description may have trouble with his book.Characterization is minimal. Little time is spent explaining the feelings and motivations of the characters.Action is minimal. Readers who desire a lot of classic swords and sorcery action with lengthy blow-by-blow descriptions of battles and wizards who wield fire and ice may be disappointed with this book.The cast is minimal, and some will find the characters bland compared to those in the books mentioned above. Character interaction is minimal. There are no romances, no intrigues, no wars, no subplots.So BE WARNED! While this book is one of my favorites, I do not consider myself a typical reader of the genre.

She wrote around the same time that J.R.R. Tolkien and Roger Zelazney, founders of the fantasty genre, wrote. This book is written on a lower level of reading as like those found in the young adult/teen section of a library or Barnes and Noble bookstore. Even still, I respect it because it was one of the first fantasy novels, and the modern so-called fantasy novels are really just copies and imitations of what has already been written. This is a series of, I believe, five books. It has some good ideas that could be used in a comprehensive background of magic and its properties. One such idea is that everything has a true name in the Old Speech. This idea is the basis of illusion. If a rock seemingly turns into a diamond, its essence, so to speak, or true name is still a rock. The 'diamond' is an illusion. Overall, this book is entertaining and has a lot of good ideas about magic and heroes, but it is written on a lower level of reading and I wasn't thrilled with the plot. It does have well-done maps and an interesting world in which Sparrowhawk, or his true name/Old Speech name: Ged, travels.

This is the first time I had no interest in finding out what happened in the subsequent books.The stories and characters were horribly underdeveloped. Neither were built up enough for me to even care about what happened to them.

It's tedious, slow to start, sexist, incredibly archaic, impersonal, and featuring a stiff (as in, Al Gore stiff) unempathetic lead character. Also, like &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, it has some awesome scenes, an original concept, depth, well-written character development, and an awesome ending. Pick it up on a rainy day... it's not a must-read, but read it anyway because some day some English teacher will probably force you to..It's a pretty good book of Tolkien caliber, but very slow to start.

The book may have been special when it was released many decades ago, but it pales when compared to modern works from authors like Patrick Rothfuss and George R.R. Martin. The world around the main character is lifeless, and the ending is a disappointment. Also, the arc of the book is relatively simple and can be summed up as follows: Young wizard makes a bad mistake, young wizard runs from mistake and fails, young wizard defeats mistake by facing it head on. Good lesson, though: Don't run from your fears.The most interesting thing about this book is that it is a foundation upon which many other authors have built improved stories.

LeGuin because I have not had the time; Tolkien because I did not want to be bored out of my wits yet again. But from memory alone, I know that LeGuin's writing is in a word: Fantastic. Her command of English prose is absolute genius. I can still remember the haunting beauty of those words in A Wizard of Earthsea that gave each thing its true name, as if all of us, on this earth, had such a name as well. And I still remember the scene in The Farthest Shore on which the reader casts his eyes: dragons floating in the distant air, reflecting the gold of the sun from their wings, onto the water. That image haunts one's memory, because LeGuin gives us something rare not only in fantasy, but in all of literature -- the shared imagination : so vivid that we cannot help but retain those images in indelible memory. Though I read her novels as a teenager, I also read Shakespeare and Tolstoy, and Joyce and Homer. It strikes me as rather insipid to plug her novels into the genre of juvenile literature while somehow vaunting Tolkien's as for the sophisticated and mature. I really beg to differ. LeGuin's Earthsea is far richer, far more imaginative, far more convincing, and dare I say, just darn more interesting, than the world of Tolkien's pen (I won't say imagination). And that Joyce's Ulysses should be about a young Stephen Dedalus becoming his nation's poet has never caused that novel to be called a book of Bildungsroman. Please! Her novels, if we must be plain, are about the search for self, which is not a meager task accomplished between the ages of 11 and 20 -- but a lifelong endeavor. Earthsea is about discovery, of a new and fantastic, beautiful world, and of oneself, as deep, as turbulent, as entangled and mesmerizing as the realm of her imagination. Is this not what we hope for from any piece of art? Understanding of the world, and understanding of the worlds within.And simply because LeGuin's novels are terse and stylistically written in the meter of lore and legend, does not render it in any way inferior to the prose of Tolkien. In fact, many an intelligent reader would gladly do without the droning repetition and pedantic, overwrought elaborations of Lord of the Rings. Quantity does not equal genius. In fact, the true poet is one who says the most with least words. One only has to read a single Shakespeare play to realize that.So once and for all, let us give Ms. LeGuin her due honor, and stop comparing her to a writer such as Tolkien, who truly is much less than her equal. Ms. LeGuin is by my estimation one of the greatest fantasy novelists, and possibly THE Greatest, ever to have taken up the pen. She writes fantasy not to create a world for its own sake (as might be said of some others), but to bring that world of the imagination into the realm of the possible, the credible, the believable -- so much that we would believe in spite of ourselves, and we only wish we could will this imagined world into being a part of our own."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Perhaps back in the 60s Tolkien fans were ready to devour any new fantasy novel. To my dismay, \\"a high fantasy classic\\" this is not. It certainly is a good template for it: moral lessons, good vs. evil, wizened wizards, and a young wizard on a grand quest. But there's not much more than that. There's too much prose and not enough character insight to uphold the already threadbare plot. The most comprehensive description of Earthsea is in the maps which are nice and all, but this is a book - not an atlas.Too short to be a real novel, it'd do better as a children's book. However, in this case size really doesn't matter. The Last Unicorn by Peter Beagle has the same template but unlike A Wizard of Earthsea, the unicorn's voyage is filled with peril through vivid lands accompanied by a colorful cast of characters in only 200 pages. Even today's current poptart, Harry Potter, has the bumbling Ron, quirky Dumbledore, and slimy Snape. LeGuin's wizards are all Arch-Changer this or Arch-Namer that - who seem ready to die at any moment. Rocks have more personality. The protaganist is Ged. Yep, Ged. Oh and he gets spiteful and thus must redeem himself. Thats all I know. Ogion tries but fails to be a Gandalf. The only moments of life shine through the dialogue and as soon as a glimpse of emotion appears... it vanishes.In spite of these faults, it's not so terrible; There is a sense of history and timelessness to the tale. The moral lessons ring loud and true. \\"That which gives us power to work magic, sets the the limits of that power... it if were not so, the wickedness of the powerful or the folly of the wise would long ago have sought to change what cannot be changed, and Equilibrium would fail.\\"Lines like that make reading this book worth hacking through the bone dry parts. After reading LeGuin's speculative work - The Left Hand of Darkness and the Dispossessed, I found her intelligent & thought provoking but uninspired. So I was prepared for a more personal work through her fantasy in A Wizard of Earthsea. Sad to say, I was yet again let down."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Le Quin takes the reader through the magical powers of a youngboy name Ged.

I had to read this in school, and not one of my classmates liked it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I did not Care for this book. I am an avid Sci-fi/Fantasy reader, having digested everything from Harry Potter to King's Dark Tower series to Clarke's Rama series. I purchased A Wizard of Earthsea with high anticipation, having never read a LeGuin novel.I enjoyed the first 20 pages. Then, somewhere thereafter, I had a hard time reading this book. I kept putting it down. Somewhere around page seventy I found myself unable to continue. Every page became like torture, and I threw in the towel. Here are a few things I disliked about the book:1) Ged. Ged was a cookie cutter character. LeGuin provided us with no description of Ged (physical or otherwise), no motivations at all behind Ged's actions, and no details about his character. LeGuin is positively the worst author I have ever read when it comes to creating enthralling, interesting characters. There was nothing - nothing - given to describe or flesh out Ged at all. He simply was a boy in a town who learned spells and who went to a wizard's school. That is it. That is THE fleshing out of Ged. Don't believe me? Read it yourself.2) The story. The story is non-existent. Through the first 70 pages there is a lot of telling about this place or that, and this mountain or that, but there is very little story at all. The first 20 pages where Ged saved his town were the only interesting parts. The problem with the telling is that it is dull and uninteresting. There is nothing exciting about Earthsea.3) Runes. It seems that LeGuin spent all her time developing an elaborate map and spell system, but couldn't wrap a story around them. The \\"real names/runes\\" thing was interesting for a half a page.Folks, this was the dullest book I've read in a long while. It was like eating cardboard. Really. It was like reading a parts inventory for an automobile.This book was 100% devoid of life. No interesting characters. No interesting story. Devoid of plot. No action. Stale lands. Boring travel. Yada. Yada. Yada. I will not purchase another LeGuin book. How this story got into print is beyond me. I would rather read Tolkien or Rowling writing about their bathroom than read the most acclaimed LeGuin book.Nothing remotely intriguing. LeGuin is unable to tell anything that even remotely resembles a story. This is a world-building book. As a story is is fire-starter."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I saw the TV show made, so I wanted to check out the full story.It was a disappointment, but my wife loved it.

Ranking amongst the best fantasy novels I have read.When I discovered Leguin continued the saga, I couldn't wait to get hold of the other three.What a disappointment it was. It looks like a completely different author. The first was a writer, a storyteller and a good one at that. The second one was a disgruntled feminist with the delusion she has writing abilities.The second three books differ from the first three as a cheap cowboy novel differs from Tolkien.By all means, do read the first three books. They are well worth it. But forget the last three. A phone directory makes more compelling and less biased reading."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"'A Wizard of Earthsea' is a book I did not enjoy. It starts out with a young boy named Sparrowhawk who is later named Ged. This is the first part I did not like about it. He is renamed and not even his family knows his name because if somebody knows your name they have complete power over you, Ged was able to defeat the shadow because he knew its name. This made absolutely no sense whatsoever to me. He is then taken away to learn magic from a teacher who is a stranger, who is the one who named him even though, nobody knew the man.Ged was taken away by the man because he had learned magic from his aunt who was sort of strange. He was taught by her to call birds down from the skies. The next part that I didn't like was magic was more of a secret language than special powers. Rather than having to possess any kind of power you just had to say a secret word. I enjoy books with real magic. In this anyone who knew the word could do magic, I think the person should have to have a power.Ged then goes to school for magic where he becomes arrogant and flaunts his power. He is one day trying to raise the dead to prove himself, and ends up raising a shadow. That part I didn't like either, the shadow simply came out of a hole in the air, scratched Ged, and was chased away. I think the action scene could have been a little better, they could have had a huge fight and described the moves rather than a line or two or nothing. Another action scene was with the dragon, which was horrible because he killed them all in the same way, and then persuaded the mother dragon not to kill lots of people. Another part that was not well thought out was, in dragon speak you could not lie. It is impossible to have a language in which you could not say words because they were not true.The only good part was a big action scene of him running from a shadow through the woods. This part was full of suspense and you wanted to find out what happened. Then he finally got away to a castle (that he ran to) and was tricked and had to run from there. Then Le Guinn, the author, made a surprise ending, that the shadow was really the dark side of him. But being as this was a fantasy/ magic/ action book, there should not have been a surprise. Those are the kind of books that have a good side and a bad side (another bad part, Le Guinn didn't make sides she made a one vs. one battle). Usually the book ends in one final win it all or lose it all battle. This ended with him chasing the shadow (which was good) and saying its name. A book like this always ends in a real battle. All in all it was a slow read and I will never read another book in the series I do not recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I found Earthsea to be quite a difficult read. There is no real background about Duny who ends up going from age 4 to a thirteen year old in less than two chapters. He also ends up getting his name changed to Ged by the end of the first chapter. It is not clear to me as to why he was not given the proper name at birth. I also found it difficult to take the story seriously as far as Gont being known for wizards and other forms of sorcery, maybe if I had an interest in fantasy, I may be more impressed by the storyline. The story just seems overdone to me. Even though it was written over thirty years ago, it still seems redundant due to all of the books and movies that have similar storylines. The names of the people and places are difficult to pronounce which made me focus more on what I was trying to pronounce and not the story itself. The theme was unclear to me (if there really was one) and the story seemed to just ramble on aimlessly. While reading this book I could not help but compare it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, which I recently finished. Earthsea sounds so much like both stories, only far less of interest. This could have been a far better story had Duny/Ged not appeared to be going around in circles. And the maps that were included in the story did not help me one bit, it just made me glad that there was one less page to read. Le Guin tries to elaborate on details that do not seem to connect at all to Ged's journey throughout the story. It is a wonder that the book is still in print."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"In A Wizard of Earthsea you will witness and accompany Sparrowhawk through what is to be his rite of passage. He discovers his true name while facing great challenges, such as an almost deadly battle with a terrifying and powerful creature, only to realize that the monster may only be his own shadow.This is a truly original story that quickly captures your attention, imagination and heart. It won't be any easy one to put down, and you won't be able to get you hands on the next book in the series fast enough. It is full of action and symbolism, and represents the authors exceptional ability to create things that the rest of us never dreamed of. This novel will not dissapoint."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I don't usually read sci/fantasy. However, suffering from a cold and lacking any other easy reading material in the house, my husband handed his copy of The Wizard of Earthsea. I didn't really think that I would like, but ended up pleasantly surprised. The Wizard of Earthsea is basically the story of a young man with exceptional talent and an equal measure of stupid pride. As you might expect, this stupid pride ends up getting the young man into trouble when he releases a 'something' from the underworld. Of course, the young man is then forced to 'go on quest' to force the dark shadow back into the underworld. In the end, the shadow ends up being himself and a valuable lesson is learned.While I wouldn't call this original material or fabulous writing, it is still well worth your time. The story is enjoyable and the characters likable. Being ill when I read it, I was able to finish it in the course of a day. This book would also make worthwhile reading for those who are young adults and not quite up to the challenge of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I think this book is a great trilogy because it is filled with adventure and excitement.

He was a reckless child that was hungry for power and knowledge.

The first volume in Leguin's Earthsea Trilogy, A Wizard of Earthsea recounts the journey of Ged from village goat-herd on the island of Gont through apprenticeship to the wise Ogion and on to the school for Wizards on Roke Island (long before Rowling's Harry Potter and Hogwart's School).Much of the charm of the story is the beautiful and elemental world which Leguin's evocative prose creates, a world of heights and depths, darkness and light, beauty and terror, dragons and magic -- a world that has its own spiritual integrity which Ged must learn to respect. This is &quot;high fantasy&quot; at its peak, graceful and spare and profound in its ability to move the reader.The second and third volumes, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore, though they may be read independently, continue to reveal this unique world and further develop Ged's character.

A classic in its own right, this book gets credit for much of the heavy lifting necessary to propel fantasy up to its respectable and meaningful niche in modern literature. Geared towards the younger reader, being an easy read, this book nonetheless tells a powerful story with serious and important lessons. Any reader will enjoy this story, and many will be truly inspired. As Ged matures and faces a myriad of challenges in a dangerous (and wonderfully imagined) world, he learns life lessons that we all do at some point on our journey, eventually coming to face hard truths about his own self and about his role in life.A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA begs to be read out loud. Simple enough vocabulary spun in a lyrical way gives this story a magical feel. Its on the short list of fantasy books that I picture myself reading to my future kids. Very little violence and no sex means this is a book appropriate for any age. The vivid images and powerful emotion will make a lasting impression on young minds, and the story will teach them positive lessons as well.

It was like nothing I'd ever read before. Ged's search for mastery of not only magic but also himself is poignant. My only complaint is that, unlike some epic fantasy novels that are so ridiculously long they overstay their welcome, A Wizard of Earthsea is too short. However, for those readers who like their fantasy smut-free and are tired of five-hundred volume long series that really go nowhere, I highly recommend this book, not only because it's one of the great-grandparents of the surge of fantasy seen these days, but also because of its timeless story and the beauty of its language.Mrinta Quest: A Tale of Zeheryfel (Tales of Zeheryfel)"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It has been over a decade since I read this book in High School, but it's fantastic storytelling and powerful themes always draw my mind back to it's pages. LeGuin here created a world where power HAS to come with responsibility or suffer the consequences. Nowhere in these pages will you find wizards who are practically demi-gods. The magick of Earthsea must always be used with a sense of balance or the consequences can be dire. Every word spoken in the language of dragons must be said carefully, lest you regret the unintended consequences. This great theme of personal responsibility and awareness of the consequences of ones actions had a profound influence on me. Another theme you will found within these pages is the Conquest of the self. To accept, but also balance, all the different facets/passions/aspects of yourself to remain an integral and whole person.

It simply doesn't measure up to Middle-Earth in terms of depth of detail, grandeur and beauty. No doubt it is an excellent product of artistic imagination on its own right, but one can't help but feel a sense of dreariness and bleakness in it.

It passes over months of the characters life with barely a word. It left me with a feeling of com,plete and utter lack of connection with the main character. The fact that someone would even compare this book to Tolkien let alone praising it over him is rediculous.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This book was full of sullen, unsympathetic characters and the silliest dragons in the history of fantasy literature- dragons that you can defeat merely by calling their name. Moreover the book is obsessively concerned with the balance of magic- an interesting concept, but one which the author handles badly. The magic of Tolkien's Middle-earth is inherent in the characters- it's not what they do, but what they are.

Le Guin's short novel about a young man learning to confront his own flaws in judgment and inner turmoil could have been a powerful, moving journey of discovery. A strong tale of adventure whose focus is on the development of the protagonist, rather than the excitement of confronting evil monsters and wizards, surely has the potential to be a well developed and rewarding work of fantasy.Unfortunately, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" does not achieve these aspirations, primarily due to the lack of substantive connections between the events helping to move the plot along. The most important developments that occur to young Sparrowhawk seem to rise out of nowhere, without warning or explanation. Rather than sharing the reader's surprise at the incredible events developing so suddenly and swiftly in his life, the young mage takes everything with an eerily cold acceptance, distancing him from the reader and masking his motivations.The plotline of the story is full of adventurous twists and turns, which, when viewed before their resolutions, seem acceptably fresh and creative, if not earth-shattering. However, the methods Le Guin uses to solve the problems presented in the story horribly mar the established sub-plots, as the problems are solved too easily and without warning. This lack of \\"realism\\" does not encompass solely the ordinary unrealistic elements one expects in a work of fantasy, such as the use magic or fantastic creatures. This surreality comes from Sparrowhawk suddenly gaining knowledge he never learned, or magical ability he never revealed or practiced, and these mysteriously-appearing powers are the keys to solving all of his greatest problems. If this were used once or twice, it would be acceptable, but this is the method by which nearly all of the protagonist's troubles are assuaged.This lack of logical plot development extends beyond damaging the credibility and power of the tale. By not allowing us to see Sparrowhawk's struggles as he learns to master the great magics he wields so freely near the book's end, nor allowing us to see how he decides what tactics to use when battling great foes or navigating uncharted seas, Le Guin flattens Sparrowhawk's character into an unknowable, archetypal hero. Reading about such a character is similar to reading a history text book, but far more illogical, as in history, problems arise due to defined causes and are solved in a realistic manner.Unfortunately, the lack of deep characterization is not limited to the characters themselves. On the surface, Le Guin's world seems a unique realm with much potential. The archipelago-like setting provides a wealth of different islands, each ready to support its own unique culture and teach Sparrowhawk about different facets of the world and himself. Thus, it almost comes as a shock when the young man journeys from island to island, meeting only people and cultures identical to his own. This dearth of fantastic lands to explore is unusual for a fantasy novel concerning a man's great journey. While the argument may be made that this tactic focuses the reader's attention on Sparrowhawk's internal developments, it actually lessens the scope and impact of these same developments. Truly, how much can one learn, even about oneself, if one never goes anywhere containing people unlike those who live in one's own home?While individual characters may have defining traits that help them stand out from their background to a degree, these characters are few, far between, and frequently abandoned by the wandering mage, forcing Le Guin to continually begin building up new characters from scratch. Through the beginning of the book, this is a natural and effective part of the exposition, but abandoning well-established characters (such as the teachers and most students the mage meets on the isle of the wizards) cuts Sparrowhawk off from the few people that caused him to reveal his inner feelings, leaving the remainder of the tale emotionally dry and empty.A Wizard of Earthsea attempts to fill many of the niches presently occupied by the great fantasy epics of J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, and Terry Goodkind within the space of under 200 pages. Unfortunately, the effort is a failure: the characters are flat, the many lands Sparrowhawk visits are similar to one another, and the plot elements are unrealistically and unfulfillingly resolved. In the realm of high fantasy, Le Guin has been outdone by Tolkien and her successors."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read this book for a scifi/fantasy lit class I was taking at the time. The teacher started off with this book because it was one of the first real popular fantasy books that was non-tolkien. I have varying tastes, but all I really desire in a fantasy book is enough detail to make the world feel real, characters that I can care about, and a unique story. This book seemed to be lacking all of those things. I guess it was just to simple for me, and too short to really get invested in the story. I believe it was written in the late 60s and you can really tell, it shows it's age compared to more modern fantasy. I haven't read any of LeGuin's other stuff, but one thing I do know, is that I just did not like this book at all. Also, stay away from the movie version, after watching that I suddenly didn't think the book was so bad."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I don't know about anyone else who read this book but I was having trouble staying awake reading it.

Which is really unusual, because I like a lot of books. But I didn't read all of it, I only got about 3/4 of the way through, and it bored me so much that I quit reading it. I don't usually do that. I was 13, but maybe that's too young. I don't think so, I've read books like Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice and some other harder books, and really liked them.

What in the name of heaven is Earthsea? Where is the plot? Has postmodernism become prehistoricism? This is not a book. It's words on a pages between two covers fashioned from the most typical of sci-fi novel cover-stock paper.

If you want somthing new try The One Kingdome (Sean Russel)."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Before I start, I should explain what I mean by high fantasy. High fantasy is (to me) a writing style that does not concern itself with the mundane details. Good is good and evil is evil. People don't worry about where the next meal comes from, and death and disease are not immediate, except as the story needs them.That being said, in some ways, A Wizard of Earthsea is a very simple book. It's straight high fantasy, and it's a coming of age story about confronting your inner demons, and the price paid for the sin of pride.And in an age where staggering complexity seems to be the norm, with plot twists and complex hurried action, sometimes it is good to sit and read a simple story, well told.Perhaps it's a personal thing of mine. So many people feel that it is necessary to do something new and exciting, the novel seems to exist to be novel and nothing else. I find great pleasure in seeing people do the simple things well. It's a lot harder than you think. Witness how few do it well.The fact that Earthsea is a seemingly simple novel, but complete in its simplicity makes it a classic in the field. Other novels build on the base, or change it, but this is a book you must read to understand the root of how high fantasy is written."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Until now, I haven't read a fantasy or SF book by LeGuin that I didn't like. And this one, I love too. I've got the sequels next to my bed, ready to be devoured at night.I love the epical language (some people seem to have problems with that and the 'hard' words, but what are dictionaries for, and I am even Dutch, so English is my second language), the character development, the heroic view on how life should be.I love the idea of the powers of magic as depicted in this book. So much more realistic and modest than Tolkien. It makes it much more powerful to me.What strikes me in this book, as well in the books of Exile and Illusion of LeGuin, is her love for travel stories. The main character always goes on a big quest to find something, to accomplish a goal. And each time it is different, it is written so well that you feel that this next long journey is necessary for character and story development. It deepens the plot, it pictures a strange world that is still quite similar to ours. LeGuin's books are not for the 'heavy action lovers', where long battles occur.Special as well is the development of the shadow that is unleashed by Geb. It develops into a real human being, it is it's own shadow, and it is finally united with Geb. It makes me think of Yin and Yang."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I'm a fan of many fantasy series, from adult ones like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, to YA series like Harry Potter, Narnia, and Eragon, but somehow I had missed Ursula Le Guin until now. I'm so glad I finally picked up this series, and I will certainly continue reading. A Wizard of Earthsea most definitely falls in the 'adult' fantasy category, and is perhaps the most sophisticated view of magic and the psychological making of a wizard/mage than any other series has attempted. As many have already noted, it is very Jungian in its view of 'shadows' and in particular the shadow of Ged, the wizard of the title. This book concerns his youth and training, and a shadow he unleashes on the world through his pride, and how he comes to defeat it (although 'defeat' is not quite the right word.)If you are looking for epic battles between external forces of good and evil, ala many of the series I listed above, this series won't be for you. The making of this wizard is an inner process, and told in quite a detached way. There is not a lot of dialogue or depth of human connection, although certainly some does develop. But the prose is simply beautiful in places. Dare I say that the entire approach is a bit more feminine? In the sense that the prose is so lyrical, and the story so inner.So I may be late to come to Le Guin, but I am certainly a new fan, and am looking forward to more."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"With a Wizard of Earthsea, Le Guin has created a masterpiece that has every element one could possibly want in a fantasy story. (Ok, so there's no romance-- but romances are usually trite in fantasy novels, so that's something to be thankful for.) Ged's quest is the ultimate un-stereotype; throughout his journey he struggles to reconcile with an otherwordly shadow that turns out to be the dark side of his own being. The world of Earthsea is meticulously crafted; Le Guin's sparse but haunting prose brings everything into a vivid, well-imagined life. This book should be read by everyone who appreciates a good story, if they're a fantasy lover or not."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I read the Earthsea Trilogy as an adolescent. I remember loving it, although the experience was, even then, very different for me. I was a fan of C.S. Lewis, Tolkein, Lloyd Alexander. But Leguin felt really differrent. Part of this was that the novel was more intellectual in focus, more about what lies at the heart of her characters and less about overt action, heroics. I remembering being surprised that the plot moved so quickly away from the obvious. In this novel the hero, Ged, very early on makes terrible mistakes. Instead of being brave and untarnished, he's afraid and for some time runs away from the evil he's unleashed. This is not obvious fantasy fare. It doesn't fit the formula, and for that I loved it. Adolescence was, for me, a time of much uncertainty and doubt and sometimes outright fear. I really connected with Ged and appreciated being able to read about a troubled, damaged hero who wasn't always perfect. Also, I did note that LeGuin is careful to describe her character's racial diversity. This is a world of brown and black people, with a few paler ones living at the margins of society. I think people often miss this, but I didn't then.And I didn't when I reread it recently. All the things I admired in the first place are still there on the page. That cultural diversity is still a part of it, although LeGuin may have been a little too subtle - as many people don't seem to notice this at all - including the filmakers adapting her work. Another thing I noticed now, though, that I didn't when I was younger, is how solid the craft of LeGuin's writing is. Sentence by sentence, description by description, dialogue by dialogue: she's a very good writer. She lean and economical and moves her story forward like a fine craftsperson.This is a wonderful novel of a wonderful series. I've got quite a bit to do these days in my adult life, but it's quite a pleasure to know that at some point in the next few months I'll be able to pick up the next in the series and carry on a little ways. I look forward to it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was amazing. I enjoyed it a lot. It is not a hard read and it has a great story. But what I liked most about it was how it made you ask questions about yourself. This book struggles with inner fear that everyone faces and how to overcome it. When I read it, I had to think a lot. The book helped me to understand that everyone has a battle between good and evil within themselves. Everyone has to fight this battle at least once in his or hers life. For Ged it took him many years, thousands of miles, and dozens of fights to understand what he was fighting. But from reading this book I also learned what I was fighting.This book not only lets you ask yourself a lot of hard questions, but also let you understand fantasy better. After reading this I could remember multiple books that had major similarities taken from this book. This book influenced many authors when they wrote their books, or just has a very popular concept of magic. But either way, it was a classic fantasy that I will never forget."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I've read this book four times--once every decade or so since I was a young teen. Every time I've read it I've been blown away in a different way. When I was thirteen, I was blown away by the thrilling adventure yarn that LeGuin weaves. When I was in my twenties, I was fascinated by the spare, beautiful language and imagery she engages. At thirty, I had just watched Joseph Campbell's Power of Myth, and became fascinated by the way in which LeGuin spins out a tale that follow the structures of the Hero's Journey so perfectly. Now I am amazed by the way in which, with characteristic vision, LeGuin uses a deceptively simple story to delve into some extremely deep philosophical issues. I must be getting old!This book, the first in the Earthsea series that amazon.com has justly called one of the two most important fanstasy series of the twentieth century (the other being Tolkien's Lord of the Rings), follows the early life of a young sorcerer named Ged. Going by the common name of Sparrowhawk (for in Earthsea, true names have great power), he discovers his own magical ability when he is only a boy. He is trained, first by a local wizard named Ogion the Silent, and then at the great wizard school on the island of Roke. While truly coming into his power there, like another young wizard schoolboy in literature, he gets carried away with his own ability and unleashes something evil into the world. The rest of the novel is spent following Ged's attempts to escape and then to confront this evil--learning its name.The story is thrilling, the language is beautiful, the structure is mythic and--as with most of LeGuin's writing--the author is grappling with issues far deeper than the typical sword and sorcery novel. What more could one ask for?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Let's put Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter aside and look at the Earthsea series; it is a superb read without a second doubt of the intense story plotline. Every chapter of the story captures my eye, it makes my reading time all too much shorter.The story tells of a legendary wizard called Sparrowhawk (real named Ged) in the world of Earthsea. At young age, Sparrowhawk discovers his talent in magic and wizardry, after one victory of protecting his village from the enemy. He was taken away by a wizard to learn the art of magic. However, due to his pride and ambition, a curse was brought to him by his pride. He goes on an adventure of travelling throughout the Earthsea; to search for the cure or answer to his curse.The writing style is descriptive, and Le Guin really catches the character's personality. After this first book you'll want to read the rest of the series. I strongly recommand it to anyone at any age, even though you are never a fantasy fan. This book may open your eyes to a whole new different view!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea is a mythical tale by Ursula K. LeGuin about the adventures of a young wizard to be, the curiously named Ged. The book chronicles his induction into magic and wizardry, guiding the reader through Ged's gradual growth and maturation as a wizard. However, the protagonist foolishly and pridefully delves further into magic than he is prepared for, and must correct his mistake in this magical coming of age story.The presentation of the story, fantastic as it is, is wonderfully executed. The author adheres to the rules of fantasy writing by presenting the reader with clear, believable boundaries and rules to her mythical world, which allows the reader a measure of confidence and relation to otherwise unfamiliar territory. Her diction is comparable to that of familiar fairy tales, which is appropriate, even welcome considering the subject matter. LeGuin's matter-of-fact, sententious word style demands belief, her narration adopting the clipped but descriptively informative tones of a newscaster relaying a factual occurrence. It becomes easy for the audience to lose themselves in such a story; indeed, absorption is almost impossible to resist. The reader quickly transforms from readers into observers as her characters transcend their literary limitations.The magic in this story has believable jargon, clear laws, and often visible repercussions that makes rampant use unethical for any moral practitioner. Were magic to exist, these elements of restraint would probably color and police its use, and its effect on the story is an increase in the tale's ability to suspend disbelief.A Wizard of Earthsea is a delightful read for anyone, especially lovers of fiction and fantasy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Le Guin, the famed sci-fi writter, really did a wonder here. This book, this amazing piece of literature, has the depth, color, and artistic flare that all readers should be looking for. Its plot, its characters, its very idea foundation is a wonderful and well written one.You find yourself locked in the world, the world of Eathsea. A world of magic, but one like no other ever described. This is not the fanciful tale of an evil mage and a gallant knight, or a fair maiden and an old king. This book is about a young man, struggling to reach his goals and sail to his own farthest shores. It is the tale of his hardships and struggles and of his realizations and pains. For this is no prince charming, but Ged, the wizard from Gont. And through this book, you will feel and learn and live along side him.This truely is a must for all fantasy readers. Very few books even come close to the beauty of this writting. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I'm a big fan of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, which I consider LeGuin's best writing, certainly as far as style is concerned. Simplicity in writing style is something she shares with some of the genre's great writers like Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham.I read her more popular &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; simply because they'd won awards, but found them a little dissapointing, probably because they are both Nebula AND Hugo winners for their year and I was expecting more.This book, however, delivers exactly what I was expecting, intelligent fantasy done just right. I appreciate the author's ability to zoom in and out of the story without losing focus. She at some times brings us down to a day by day, person to person level, but can quickly zoom out and weeks or even years pass in a page or two. I found that she picked just the right days in the life of the wizard to hold the reader's interest and still gave the grand scheme of his life.The next two books were very good as well, but didn't capture the wonder of the first. I love the way that LeGuin introduces the reader to the magic of Earthsea, how the magic works and doesn't work etc...This book is well worth any Fantasy lovers time and energy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book, along with &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, and &quot;Dragondrums&quot; was one of my favorites as a child. As an adult, I still deeply enjoy sitting down with it for a re-read. Fundamentally a simple story, we look into the life of a young orphan &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;, who discovers that he is a wizard with the true-name of Ged. Through his arrogance and pride, he accidentally releases a supremely dangerous and powerful force, that even the greatest of wizards cannot destroy. He must find a way to make right what he has done.I've always loved this story because of its characters, and its world. I have found with fantasy books that most authors tend towards the stereotypical &quot;man wearing a black cape releases ball of fire&quot; motif. This world has a clear philosophy on the use of its magic, and a whimsical, &quot;fairy-tale&quot; feel throughout. The characters are strong, and empathatic. Overall, one of the best books of its kind. I give it a four only because I reserve my five's for books of such depth and complexity as Dune. Out of 100, I would give it an 85."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It is surprising to note that Harry Potter 1 gets 5 stars from more than 4900 people on Amazon, while this book gets only 4 stars from only a little over 290 reviewers. However, comparison is not my intent (as I believe there's really no way to actually compare the two).This is by far the best book of coming of age in a fantasy/wizardry context. It's deep, thought provoking, amazingly imaginative and written exceptionally well. It resonates with me today as much as it did when I first read it in the late eighties.The plot is superb and what works so well is the humanity of the characters, especially the protagonist, Ged, and fellow students in the school of wizardry on the island of Roke. Ged's motivations are easy to relate to, while the context is magical and yet so real at the same time. Ursula Le Guin has a way with words that's admirable. On the one hand, it's really a short book, she does not tend to overkill the reader with lengthy scenic and character descriptions (unlike what's so common in the genre). In fact, I'd even say that part of the power of this book is how much you crave for more words and yet end up filling in using your imagination. But that's not a drawback, it's a huge advantage. Because what Ursula does tell us, she does with a resonant voice, clear, beautiful prose that fits together very well and at the end you feel you really know a lot about the geography of earthsea (in some sense that's a big driving mechanism) and about the boy who would be archmage, Ged.Dragons and wizards are vividly depicted (this is possibly the most awe inspiring source for depicting dragons as truly magical beings), yet the book is really about human emotions and human weaknesses. These are explored as part of the overall theme and message of the book - anger, jealousy, strong-headedness, pride, just to name a few.The book emphasizes the power of words. I find that the book itself is the strongest advocate of this power. It's a keeper on many accounts and will be the kind of book that's still there, deep in your memory several years after you read it. You're likely to reread it later on only to discover its strength and maturity, the stronger and more mature you get.I cannot recommend this book more strongly. If you haven't done so yet, pick up a copy. You can thank me later by coming back here and writing your own 5 star review !!!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"If you are an avid fan of rubbish yet action packed pulp sci-fi such as those books by Terry Brooks, David Gemmel or Anne McCaffrey then don't pick up this book. You will not find an 'exciting' novel full of spacey contraptions, fights with orcs and cardboard characters.What you will find however is one of the most sublime and mature works of fantasy ever written. Le Guin has created a work of genius. Yes it is slow at times, however this book is outstanding. Not a pulp novel but a masterpiece with a philosophy of its own, it more than rivals Tolkiens work. And as for criticisms that Ged, the protagonist, is a poorly drawn and obtuse character, i cannot think of a 'hero' in modern fiction today more poignant than the quiet, deep and flawed Ged.Genius."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"It seems wholly appropriate that a work so well crafted, in which the words used are so perfect, should embrace as its central theme the power of words. In the land of Earthsea, magic is inexorably tied to the true name of a thing. Potential, in and of itself, can do nothing without knowledge. It is the two together that enable magic. Wizards spend their lives learning true names, without which, they can only perform charms and tricks.This book is a magnificent piece of literary art. It works on so many levels that one can only marvel at the facility with which disparate pieces of such varying sizes and shapes are moulded into a coherent whole. The result is a masterpiece.One level is dedicated to children. It is an adventure story of inner courage and strength of character. Another level is dedicated to young adults. It is a story of a boy's journey into manhood and the conquest of self-limitation. The deepest level is also the most mature. It is a philosophical rumination on the balance of life.There is more than the one type of magic here - the author submerges her themes into the story so naturally, that one is never aware of her literary magic at work. For example, she does not stretch for the philosophical. She eases into it, without hurry or seeming care. It is only afterward that one becomes aware of having experienced something profound.Another sample; this one a taste of the writer's lyricism: &quot;But Ged went on, falcon-winged, falcon-mad, like an unfalling arrow, like an unforgotten thought, over the Osskil Sea and eastward into the wind of winter and the night.&quot; The gift for vivid similes, the cadence of the sentence, the sheer potency in the words, all combine to weave a literary spell that surpasses any magic present in the story. This is a great gift, and not even the greatest.The greatest gift that this or any writer can give to her reader is that of self-discovery. In this work, as in each of the subsequent two, Le Guin crafts such a discovery so perfectly, that her work is elevated into literature. This is one of those books that change lives. Had she written nothing else, the world would owe Ursula K. Le Guin an immeasurable debt of gratitude for writing just this one."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Intelligent and thoughtfully written are appropriate adjectives to use when describing Ursula Le Guin's work. Many of her scientific novels are as profound as they are fanciful.\\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\" is the first in a trilogy of books begun in 1968. \\"The Earthsea Trilogy\\" has often been compared to Toklien's Lord Of The Rings and many times critiques have praised it has the greatest of the two.This first book in the trilogy begins the life story of a young boy called Duny at birth who is destined to become the greatest of all wizards in a world already renowned for its magic and power. Duny is a young headstrong boy who learns the first rudiments of magic from his aunt a witch. She begins to teach him minor weather control but most importantly she begins to instruct him in the true names of things. To know the true name of anything whether it is an object, an animal or a person gives you the power to control that entity.Using the knowledge that his aunt has imparted to him Duny saves his village from attackers. This brings him to the attention of the Mage Ogion. At the time of naming when one sheds his childhood name for his true name, Ogion bestows on Duny his true name Ged. However, since to know ones true name is to have power over that person the boy became known to the outside world as Sparrowhawk.Ged is impatient with his master's methods and when Ogion offers him the choice between staying with him or going to a famous school of wizards, he chooses to go to the school. There he meets his first rival Jasper and Vitch who will become his true friend.However, although his natural magical talent leads him to become a great student and his knowledge grows by leaps and bounds, so does his pride and anger. Ged in a moment of pride accidentally lets loose a dangerous shadow on the world. It is in the battle with this shadow that he comes to learn not only the true power of words but humility and duty.This book although written for adolescents will also appeal to adults who will appreciate the lessons taught in the story. Most children and teenagers may find the story a bit slow compared to current fantasy novels. Although children exposed to Harry Potter may enjoy the school of wizards and the interaction between Ged, Vetch and their rival Jasper.I must confess that although I like Le Guin's writing style and always appreciate her stories, I often lamented her treatment of women. In this book women are never equal to men. They are there to be avoided or protected. However, I do highly recommend this book because despite its minor flaws, it is fantasy at its best."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Let me start off by saying that it's very sad people dislike this book just because they heard it's of the same caliber as Tolkien's work and it turned out it wasn't. Ursula Le-Guin is a good author but even good authors have a hard time when they're compared to Tolkien. Was Tchaikovsky a lousy composer just because he wasn't &quot;as good as Beethoven&quot;? (whatever that means) Was Lev Landau stupid just because he wasn't &quot;as smart as&quot; Einstein? Mind you, Le-Guin's world lacks the depth of Tolkien's, but whatever she lacks in completeness she makes up for in compelling plot and characters. Ok, so much for my penny philosophy.I've read the Earthsea novels when I was a kid and have re-read them later on as an adult, and can say that, while I have no special affection for the fantasy genre, these books still stand out as being special. Le-Guin's choice of plot and characters makes this book very unique - instead of grand wizards and epic battles, she chooses a &quot;real life&quot; wizard and tells his story. Instead of the usual &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; theme she chooses his personal battle against a shadow that haunts him - due to his own actions. This book will never become a Hollywood production (thank heavens!), simply because there isn't enough eye-candy in it. That's one of the things I like about it. I am also very fond of Le-Guin's writing style, but that's a more personal choice.If you feel fantasy books are all about knights in armor and robed wizards and flying dragons speaking Shakespearean English and going around saving the world (or destroying it), give this book a try, it might surprise you (for the better, I hope ... )."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is a different fantasy story than what I am used to. Fantasy often involves page after page of trolls, dwarfs, elves and wizards with strange names locked in epic wars and quests. While that formula is all fine and good, by keeping action to a minimum and philosophy to a maximum, Ursula K. le Guin departs from it somewhat in the story &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea.&quot;The story involves the early exploits of the powerful archmage Ged, when he was a young man named Sparrowhawk. At a young age he is living with an abusive guardian, when he discovers he has magical powers. He then leaves this abusive person and goes off to wizard school to be learned in the arts of magery (sound familiar Potter fans?). There he befriends a fellow prentice named Vetch, and enters into a rivalry with another wizard prentice by the name of Jasper. This rivalry results in the release of a dark, evil shadow from the realm of &quot;unlife&quot; during a &quot;wizard duel,&quot; when Ged casts a spell beyond his control. Ged then spends the length of the book first running from the shadow, which seeks to posses him, and then pursuing the shadow, seeking to destroy it, trying to undo the evil he had begun in a moment of stupid pride.I have often felt that a good fantasy formula is pitting a fallible character(s) against the deeds of his errant actions. This formula is used in the Narnia books and also in Tolkien's stories. It is repeated in this book and works very well. While the obvious lack of action (although when there is action it happens with some amount of violence) may alienate traditional fantasy readers, the philosophy of the book and the examination of the balances between good and evil should appeal to adults and older children alike. The inclusion of maps and the well developed magic system, and the unique emphasis on names, also contributes to the plausibility of the book and gives it the characteristic feel of a good fantasy story. An excellent, highly-recommended book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Influenced by Greek and Norse mythologies in subtle but obvious ways, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" was, before the era of Harry Potter, perhaps the most famous example of a bildungsroman (coming-of-age story) in the wizard-fantasy genre. Adopting the aloof tone and narrative style of medieval saga, Le Guin tells the story of young Sparrowhawk (whose \\"secret\\" inner name is Ged) and the adventures he encounters and calamities he unleashes while he studies to become a wizard. In spite of its sparseness, this first entry in the series is rich in theme and characterization, especially in the presentation of Ged's inner struggle.The plot is simple: a precocious lad in the northern area of the archipelago of Earthsea shows promise in the art of magic. Taken under the wing of a local mage, Sparrowhawk soon bridles under his tutor's deliberate, methodical training, and he is sent on the long voyage to an island that hosts a school for wizards. The competitive nature among schoolboys, however, prods Sparrowhawk to unleash a fearful monstrosity (his own dark side, so to speak) and the young wizard spends the remainder of his young adulthood atoning for--and trying to correct--his rash mistake. Although his early mentor Ogion and fellow-student Vetch both have important roles to play in Ged's salvation, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" focuses almost exclusively on Ged's lonely quest, and it is at heart a psychological tale featuring a single heroic character.Initially written for teens (and marketed as such), the Earthsea books have transcended the \\"young adult\\" market--and deservedly so, since the author tackles so many themes in so few pages. One aspect in particular that has received much comment is its ecological message. Throughout their schooling, the young wizards are warned against the \\"butterfly effect\\" of their powers. \\"You must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. The world is in balance, in Equilibrium.\\" Evil in Earthsea is the destruction of the world's equilibrium, and a wizard's duty is, above all, to maintain that environmental balance.Le Guin's tales are sure to receive renewed attention because of the Earthsea miniseries on the Sci-Fi. So it's too bad that Le Guin herself has denounced the film version as \\"a far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned.\\" Perhaps Le Guin will someday meet the filmmaker she deserves."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the first volume of what would become a classic fantasy tetralogy about a world of islands (the other books in the series are &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; (1971), &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; (1972), and &quot;Tehanu: The Last Book of Earthsea&quot; (1990)). &quot;The Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is often a required text in college courses on speculative fiction as well as in courses in children's literature. It was originally written for juveniles and teenagers; yet, it achieved a much wider following. It won the 1969 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; Horn Book Award for Excellence. The story is centered about the young boy known as Sparrowhawk, later known as Ged, who goes off to be trained as a wizard. His pride and anger accidentally lets loose a shadow upon the world. Ged learns humility and duty and, after confronting a dragon threatening villagers, he goes off to restore the balance in the world by facing this shadow. The reader becomes well aware of the importance of words: words, by themselves, can become acts. We have to be very careful in what we say and how we phrase sentences. In addition, the reader sees Ged face his fears and discovers an aspect of the nature of good and evil that allows him to grow more complete."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"While LeGuin's prose is beguiling and her characters believable, somehow I felt a little more removed from the scene than I like to be when I'm reading a novel. I'm not sure why that is. I would have preferred to get more deeply inside the heads of the characters than I did. Otherwise, an excellent book - I felt that things were happening even without the bloody battles and lurid affairs that so often are used in fantasy novels in place of good writing to hold the reader's interest."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book is good and so are the other two books after it. It talks about this boy saving a girl from a life as a nun among other adventures. The fourth book is rather a disappointment. It takes place years later so I recommend that you don't read it.

It was straight to the point of the matter. It is a high fantasy classic that deserves to be shared with all. Ms. LeGuin rates up there with such authors as Tolkein and Anne McCaffrey. I'll never need to read another fantasy as long as I live. In A Wizard of Earthsea I have found the perfect one!!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"One of the very first fantasy books I read, &quot;A wizard of Earthsee&quot; brings conflicting emotions to me even now. At the time I first read it, I definitely didn't understand it and found it slow and unpictoresque. Now some 15 years later, I find it a great work on human nature and the &quot;stuff&quot; of which human relationships are made of. Indeed, when you think of somebody, you think about a name and a mental picture of what the persons represents for you; so, the idea of imbuing the name with the essence is in my opinion a nice one. Short : this is a book you should read when you're older, it takes a whole new meaning."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I first read this &quot;GREAT&quot; book when I was in the 8th grade, and loved it. But it wasn't until I picked it up again much later in life that I was able to fully apreciate it. I'm twenty six right now and I still re-read it every so often, and every time that I do I find something more to love about it. This book is definatly not just for young adults, in fact with some of the issues it tackles and addresses, I'm sometimes surprised to think that it is a book written for young adults."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I reckon that the Earthsea books are the greatist books ever so far Ive read A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore and Tehanu three times non stop!I first discovered this amazing serries of books when I was given the Earthsea Quartet at first I looked at the size of it and thought &quot;WHAT! I'm never going to be able to read somthing that big!&quot; And I shoved it aside for a copple of months.Untill finally I decided that I would at least give it a try and read the whole thing. Well when I'd finished it I thought &quot;Is that all plese god I hope that Ursula K. Le Guin is going to write more books to continue this sensational serries and decided to read the whole thing again and again. I just cant stop reading the Earthsea books over and over again! At times the book even had me crying for the character that had been lost (it even had me wishing that I was part of it!). tis is the greatist book ever with taking Dragons misterios shadows and heaps more!I think that these books are a must for every one and I hope that you have or will enjoy these breath taking books as much as I have.

Ten years of radical expansion in children's fantasy writing, and still nothing and no-one can surpass the effortless brilliance and subtlety of this marvellous trilogy. It's beautiful, it's memorable, and it's serious.The suspense is real, but it's moral suspense; a boy's soul is at stake - and so is the reader's soul. It is no exaggeration to say that this book once saved my sanity; it teaches you to accept your own darkness without demonising it or deifying it. People who prefer Rowling's simplifications are entirely welcome to them."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is just a wonderful story, and it is masterfully interpreted and read by Ellison.

Earthsea has a plot that involves an internal good vs evil theme. Ged, the protagonist goes learns many lessons throughout this novel. First Ged must find his place in as a wizard. Ged is faced with issues that will force him to enter conflict about how to use his magic. Tricked to use his wizardry at an inappropriate time, Ged battles the evil side of himself. Ged must conquer the evil to bring a balance back to his world.Earthsea is interesting at the beginning but lags a little at the end. I enjoyed the book myself but It can be boring and slow moving, especially toward the end of the novel."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea was written by Ursula K. Le Guin. This book may have been interesting to kids but it wasn't interesting at all to me. Personally, I thought that this book was very hard to get through. Earthsea is the story of a young boy named Ged who seems to be climbing the ladder of becoming the greatest sorcerer ever. After discovering that he has some power, Ged goes on a quest of trying to see what else he has power to do. Ged was not satisfied with a few things he had to learn and do more. Ged starts off being a curious young boy who wants to learn every trick there is. Later on down the line his curiousty caused many problems for him. After reading the book, I realized that Ged didn't really know who he was and throughout the book he was trying to figure himself out.This book isn't the worst but it isn't the best either. For all those readers who love fantasy, I would suggest this book. I like fastasy but not enough to really enjoy this book. I found this book so hard to get through that I'm not interested in reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This looked like the best book on my summer reading list. It wasn't. It is ok, but there is only about five pages of diologe in the entire book!!! It is like you are veiwing the plot from behind one of those mirrors that you can see through one-way. You have no insight to the charictors thoughts or feelings. This type of writing might be ok for a charictor that shows their thoughts by talking or actions. But sparrowhawk is so withdrawn that you can't tell anything about him. I was very disapointed."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This was purchased as a Christmas gift. He was very excited to receive it.

Of course it all comes down to personal taste, but to give you an idea I'd rank this similar to:Weis and Hickman - Dragon Lance / Death GateLloyd Alexander - Chronicles of PrydainThe series as a whole is quite different from most other fantasy series though. After the first book, they are more thoughtfully written. Possibly intended for a slightly older audience, but still quite good. The first book though is up there with the hobbit and the lord of the rings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I saw the movie so wanted to read the book.

Consider, how much we change each year as a child. Imagine then how marvellous it is that the same book can reach out to a child and then an adult, and bring fresh beauty with each reading.I recommend this to young and old. You will find strong lean prose to embrace, timeless truths, and a story that is as ragged, raw, and natural as a dragon."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book had a very classic fantasy feel. While it was faster and easier than Tolkein, it didn't quite wrap me up in it's story the way the Lord of the Rings did. Le Guin gives us the story of Ged, following his hero's journey. Book 1 tells of his humble beginnings and the mistakes he made. I recommend this to any big fantasy fan as a foundation stone of modern fantasy. But in the later books I hope to get more of an addictive feel. I didn't feel enough sympathy for Ged, the story was told from too much distance."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I have tried the Harlan Ellison audio book and didn't like his reading style. I much preferred the one at this link.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wizard-Earthsea-Cycle-1/dp/1874703531Go to www.amazon.co.uk and search for \\"Earthsea Archer\\" to find Karen Archer's audio book. It's a much nicer reading in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This woman is a master. Simply put, for those who've never heard of it, this is story of a wizard and his shadow. Sparrowhawk is a boy in small farming village when his aunt, the village witch, notices he has some aptitude for spellwork. She begins to train the boy herself, teaching him all the craft she knows. When his village is attacked by brigands, he manages to thwart the bandits by weaving together simple spells that he knows. This feat, especially by one so young and untrained, draws the attention of many, including the mage, Ogion the Silent. Ogion takes the boy on as an apprentice, but finding his tutelage under Ogion slow and exasperating, Sparrowhawk decides to leave his master and go to the school for wizards on the isle of Roke. It is on Roke that he finds the best and worst in himself and others. Le Guin's writing is pure poetry:\\"As their eyes met, a bird sang aloud in the branches of the tree. In that moment, [Sparrowhawk] understood the singing of the bird, and the language of the water falling in the basin of the fountain, and the shape of the clouds, and the beginning and end of the wind that stirred the leaves: it seemed to him that he himself was a word spoken by the sunlight.\\" p. 35, paperback.I realize this sort of high language is not everyone's cup of fantasy, but Le Guin has a way of getting under my skin like few other authors can manage to do. This is my go-to book for Harry Potter fans who need something new.I have read the book many times, but I highly recommend that if you can find it, listen to it on audio as read by Harlan Ellison. The man is obviously in love with the story, because he brings such a fine energy to the telling - he gets into every character, every description, every word, with everything he has.And of course, the story doesn't end there, although it can stand on its own, without sequel, the other books, especially the ones that primarily concern Sparrowhawk, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore, are just as enchanting and engrossing as A Wizard of Earthsea. Be aware that the later stories, Tehanu, The Other Wind and Tales from Earthsea are little darker in subject and tone, and are not as accessible to younger readers.And, please, for the love of Jeff, stay away from the movie produced a few years ago. Ged is not white. Le Guin made it a point to have people of many races represented, and the filmmakers did not honor her intentions."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ursula Le Guin is a good writer. She has a good command of the language, and is able to develop a story very effectively, with a good buildup in terms of character growth. However, the story seems a little boring. After all, Ged's interactions with other characters are few and limited, and the world has a very sombre, lonely feel to it, with little to differentiate the various races and cities.Perhaps the sense of drama and excitement is completely lacking because of Le Guin's motivation to tell a story within a Jung-style paradigm. There is little in the way of development of the individual characters, until the last fifty pages. I read this book once when I was around fifteen and then again 18 years later, and both times my feeling was the same. Well written, beautiful, but a little dull for such a short book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Growing up with the Harry Potter series, I am so surprised that it took me so long to even hear of this writer and series, but I am glad I finally did. It is a wonderfully paced beginning to what proves to be a fantastic tale of Ged of Earthsea. It combines all the good stuff you would want in a fantasy; dragons, magic and dark shadows with the clean, rich and guiding (not pushing like some other series) writing that Leguin seems to be so good with. Just Great!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Easily the best of this series of books. A Wizard of Earthsea is the story of a young boy named Ged, who becomes a wizard.Earthsea is a world of island archipelagoes, so a lot of boating and shipping goes on. Everything has a public name and a secret name, as knowing the names of things can give them power.Ged, or Sparrowhawk must master magic, fight demons, and work out what his role is in life."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I love this book. It is super awesome, to the max. The main character overhears his aunt casting a magic spell, so he goes out and tries it for himself. After finding this out, his aunt teaches him more and more magic in exchange for him agreeing to help her. He then saves his village from being destroyed by evil marauding bandits, but uses so much power he drained all of his energy. Then a great sage comes to heal them, and the boy starts his real magic training under the watch of the sage.This book was really fun for me to read because I love fantasy stories. Basically anything with dragons and/or magic in it will draw my attention and keep me occupied for a great deal of time. This book spent a lot of time developing the characters, which usually turns me off, but they threw in a great deal of excitement and interesting events, and making them feel real while still having a fair amount of action in it. This book is short, being only 197 pages, but it is still a great story and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy books. I am looking forward to reading the other books in this series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This book was very interesting. To me, it's a mixture of fantasy and anthropology(mostly human culture). The story's main character is Ged, also called Sparrowhawk. He goes to the island of Roke to train as a mage(if that's the correct term) and has many different encounters. He creates an evil creature called a gebbeth by accident. The creature is black and formless, has no head, and the body is shaped like that of a beast. But later on the gebbeth can change into different people Ged knows. In order to defeat the gebbeth Ged has to speak the creature's true name. Ged also encounters dragons, but I don't remember what the main dragon's name is. Men cannot look into the eyes of a dragon. But basically this book was interesting because it has many different cultures and different skin colors of people, not just one \\"race.\\" The fantasy of this book is quite odd because it doesn't seem to be true fantasy. There's no aliens, dwarves, or elves in it. Just humans, dragons, and other formless creatures(such as the gebbeth). The only thing I didn't like was how short the encounter of the dragons were. I wish Le Guin could have described in detail more about the dragon. Also, much of the book was just having Ged traveling across Earthsea by boat and trying to escape or catch the gebbeth."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the story of a young boy named Sparrowhawk. His true name is revealed to be Ged, and he journeys to be trained as a wizard at a school. He becomes a rival with Jasper and a friend with Vitch. This rivalry results in the releasing of a strong shadow and the death of a loved one. He runs from the shadow for most of his life. He then chases it with Vitch to the ends of the Earth.A great book, a story of hate and frienship, sadness and fear, an unbelievable outcome, and much more. I highly recomend this book to any fantasy or sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"In the Wizard of Earthsea, we are introduced to the character Ged who has to find out who he really is. He grew up abandoned (to some extent) by his family and denied the type of love that could only be given from a family. He accepted by the one societal institution that should have shaped him into an adult. Ged then finds acceptance and in the form of control over nature by learning a being's true name. This is the form of control that is exerted over nature and coincidentally is the way in which Ged makes himself accepted.Ged learns a powerful lesson in his drive for acceptance in the novel that readers can use in everyday life. He releases a demon of catastrophic proportions that will later become his greatest rival. A very powerful and great master of magick is killed when this demon is released and tried to kill Ged. This event brought a certain mortality to Ged which was not present before. He entered into an awakening of sorts and vowed to do right by his master and comply as he was being taught in magick school.The real life lesson is the death of the great man who selflessly saves Ged's life. He realized that he cannot control everything and that there are rules to life that must be respected and follwed to maintain harmony. This is true to real life because in our society, rules are set up to protest our race from self destructing. When an individual breaks the rule and laws, things happen that are not favorable to both the society and the individual. As humans, we learn from tragedy after adolescence leads us to believe we are indestructable. Ged learns this by accepting a dare of his classmates and performing the spell that released the demon."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A world steeped in mystery. A world where a name gives you power over a being. This is the world that young Ged, also known as Sparrowhawk begins his epic journey. After calling a mist to protect his village, young Ged is chosen to be an apprentice. The wizard he is first apprenticed to does not teach him the power words he wishes to know. An ego combined with bravado and ambition lead to great danger for our young hero.Using his power and a magic he does not understand, young Ged summons a great evil into this world after having his ego bruised. Full of himself and overconfident, he loses control of his spell and launches his own great tale of victory.This is an interesting book as it actually deals with the consequences of misusing magic. Ged suffers drastically for his \\"crime\\" and must set his wrong right. Not an easy task, he doesn't seek fame after his encounter, he merely seeks to make it right. This grand adventure that he undertakes and the taming of the dragon make him famous which is an ironic twist to get what he really desired despite the fact he gave up on it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I thought that this book was a very well written book. The story of a young man growing to be more than he expected more or less by accident is an excellent example of perfect fantasy writing.

The magic is unique. Instead of your standard 'Abracadabra' with a wave of a magic wand or a twist of willpower from a special 'kind' of person, a mage has to TRULY understand the object of his wizardry.The world is also believable. I've read books where the author made the whole world seem smaller than Chicago, and other books where the world seemed bigger than the galaxy, but very few authors I've run across that can do both at once. Earthsea is a vast place where the peoples of different lands are inextricably tied together, resulting in a believable vision of a reasonably sized world.My only objection would be that magic comes a little too easily to Ged. He's just a bit too much of a natural, with no particular area where he excels or struggles. He is just THAT good."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"I was forced to read this book for a literature elective and absolutely loved it. It is an awesome fantasy with a plot similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but utterly unique. Le Guin gives her world a feeling of everyday reality as well as believable fantasy elements.

I certainly recomend this book. I kept my copy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"Ged becomes the greatest wizard of earthsea with his use of Real Words.

I enjoyed the story, but missed much of Ms. leGuin's subtley and deeper meanings. I later returned to it and found in it a quiet sense of wonder which was deeply satisfying. The world of the book is consistent and the reader will be startled by how much seems familiar in this fantasy Archipelago. But beware - the &quot;fantasy&quot; label may not preapre you for the author's insights into good, evil, the nature of adulthood and the need for self-acceptance.

So I start to think,&quot;Oh brother!A report! On vacation! I''m supposed to have FUN, NOT doWORK!&quot;My mom took me to the library and I asked the librarianwhere I should look. I handed her my list of authorsand she skimmed down it. She said that Ursula Le Guinmight be good. Since these were supposed to be short storyauthors, I was not planning on doing that much reading.Then she handed me two of her books. They were shortstories. Good! Then she handed me &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;.&quot;A whole book!! I have to read a whole book!&quot;, I thought.Do not get me wrong. I like to read, but my idea ofvacation is not spending it reading. So when I got homeI read the two short stories and put the other book aside.The next day I was planning to go out, but my mom said I couldnot until I read atleat two chapters in &quot;A Wizard ofEarthsea&quot;.

After I finished it(Which has about 3 hours), I asked my mom to take me to thelibrary to get the sequel, but they did not have it.

A magical adventurewith the Wizard of Earthse"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea at first glance does not seem an original book. The plot - wizardry and defeating evil, seems like a very common theme in fantasy novels, so it doesn't seem extremely original or out of the ordinary. However, this book was published in 1968, when this theme was not so well explored, seeing as Harry Potter, Eragon and many other fantasies of similar theme had not been published, or would not be published, for many years. That makes the book different, and makes this review slightly less critical, seeing as there had not been as many books like it in the past.However, the book itself was nothing extremely special or amazing. Although it, at the time was \\"new\\" it lacked anything to make it less than a forgettable, everyday, dull book to read. The writing itself was dry and not lacking anything to drive the reader on.The general theme of this book is a young wizard born humble and poor, learning that he holds much power. The young wizard goes to a prestigious academy for young wizards, and being so ambitious and proud, accidentally unleashes a dark power that he must stop before it takes over. We are introduced to a huge world of Earthsea, which has many -full- maps of itself, which have about 500 tiny islands scattered about them - and the titles are almost invisible.The story itself does not seem original or different in any sense. It is predictable to the point it is not fun to read, and none of the characters are explored in depth. There are many side characters who barely have a few lines and not much influence in the story, only serving to carry on one plot point and not standing out as original people. It is as if the characters don't have thoughts, as we never really hear them thinking or having many emotions. They don't seem like real people at all, making the story even less convincing and unpleasant to read. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, as they all seemed generic and without a personality or many flaws. They were grim, without any interests or hobbies, just dull people carrying out heroic quests. Especially the character of Ged followed through with this.The writing style was another thing that made the book hard to enjoy. Although some people love extremely descriptive, long, fancy sentences, I can't say I do. I like descriptions, but the authors descriptions don't add anything to the story. It seems as if she does not think dialogue adds anything to a story, because there was almost zero conversation among characters. It seems the whole story could be summarized into about a page without all the needless detail.LeGuin created a huge world, yet she used very little. She spent pages and pages talking about all the different islands and geography of them. Yet they played a small role in the real story, and it seemed like she should have used all those pages making the characters, and the storyline, come to life."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Trilogy Ser.)","review":"This is the first in a series of books.

The first was its originality. The magic is well explained and thorough, as well as many other things including the geography of Earthsea and a touch of its history (actually the history was unsatisfactory...it gets much better in book two). LeGuin has clearly developed a very detailed world, and though it is not quite as in-depth as Tolkien's it is still beleivable.I also loved the characters. Though a couple were a bit shallow (like Jasper...why does he hate Ged?) overall they were compelling and interesting.I really liked the action scenes, of which there were quite a few, and they all were exciting wihtout being monotonous. A flaw in some books in my opinion is that action scenes drag on for too long without any new details.The major flaw in this book is that it is meant to be a series. The sequel, \\"Tombs of Atuan\\" takes us deeper into Earthsea into the Kargad lands. It explores the history of Earthsea and we are introduced to new characters and learn more about old ones. Sadly, though, Vetch does not reappear. \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\" shows what happens to Ged when he grows up. The results are very satisfying."},{"Title":"Hidden secrets of Kung Fu hand training","review":"I have owned a copy of this book since the early '80s and it is absolutely the most comprehensive, in-depth practical manual on the subject of traditional Chinese hand-training methods for the martial arts.

The publishers have tried to make old useful books available by reprinting facsimile versions, a laudable goal. But their work is so sloppy on this one that it accomplishes nothing. There are clearly many copies of the book that are in fine readable shape -- I have seen two in the only two libraries I have looked in -- so the blurred copy that they sell for $36.95 represents a careless attempt to make a quick buck."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For People Undergoing Surgery","review":"This guided imagery tape was a Godsend in helping me to prepare for retina surgery - for the second time in six months. I was most anxious the first time and wanted to be more relaxed for the second, more complicated procedure. So, I bought three tapes by different authors, and found that the guided imagery/affirmations on this tape were just right for me. I listened to the tape 8 or 10 times before the surgery. Two sentences were especially helpful - particularly when they came to mind as I walked into the operating room. The first described what I saw - &quot;a team of caring, competent professionals, busily getting ready for my surgery&quot;. The second sentence described what I felt- the support of friends, family, and &quot;magical allies&quot; who, according to the tape, were with me in the Operating Room. With this thought in mind, and a smile on my face, I went under. My post-op experience was similar to that described in integrative medicine journals about using guided imagery to prepare for surgery: I recovered more easily than before, felt little or no pain in my eye, and have done well since. I highly recommend this tape and I wish you well."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For People Undergoing Surgery","review":"I have owned this tape for 5 years.

I hoped for a tape I could listen to before I go and while in the hospital. There are two tapes -- one just has new age music on it, which I could get anywhere. The other tape has 20 minutes on each side. On the first side, she gives boring instructions for 10 minutes, then does 10 minutes of guided imagery. On the other side, she has 10 minutes of affirmations, then it just stops. So for a person, who's feeling helpless in the hospital -- it doesn't work. You don't want to hear her same instructions over and over again. The 10 minutes of imagery is good enough, and so are the affirmations when you turn it over. But it stops after 10 minutes, then there's blank tape for another 10 minutes. I thought it was a total waste of money."},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"Chapter 1 is crammmed with insights.

Bijoy Goswami paints an incredibly clear picture of the Maven, Relater and Evangelist (MRE) Framework and how one can utilize this to gain a better perspective of those that we encounter in both our personal and professional lives.As a business consultant, I continually challenge my clients to understand more about who their customer is and how to communicate with them. That requires my client first understands who they are and what their core \\"style\\" is before they can learn to interact and effectively develop a relationship with their client. By utilizing the MRE Framework as a base line, it allows one to more adeptly apply appropriate techniques and strategies to achieve a compatible result.I would highly suggest this book to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of those that we encounter in life.

It is mindful and reflective drawing me in as a reader and revealing much about the directions I taken in my life. My core energy has kept me afloat in all my roles. This is one book that will be re-read and dog-eared. Its internal energy has led me to want to Evangelize to others.As an educator of children and teachers I intend to spread this information as a way of anchoring their personal learning profiles for themselves and students to a new level. The Human Fabric gives key information to source of a personal profile. This information will allow all learners to work on a team and to have stronger inter and intrapersonal skills. These skills are highlighted in the SCANS report as key for the workforce of today and the future.If an educator or a learner knows their core energy personal work and teamwork will be more successful.

Even if you haven't had the sheer pleasure of meeting him though (and imagining his verbal torrent that Dave has so professionally scripted as your optic nerve devours the pages)the book is exceptional.I just consumed the whole thing on a plane ride and it glistens with that rare mental quality that can transcend the typically siloed patterns of time, perspective and experiences, all without the stuffy, academic psycho-babble that litters the bookshelves.It is a simple book for real people, by real people -- not grad students grasping for sources -- to help us all start iterating toward understanding ourselves and our interactions with each other a couple logs better; to quote Voltaire \\"We must tend to our own gardens first.\\" You can differ with what is expressed all you want but you will still see the innate and fundamental value in this work.Kudos to Bijoy and Dave. I can't wait to see what happens next."},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"In The Human Fabric Bijoy Goswami strides into the long tradition of types, styles and preferences with an inventive framework that both challenges and augments many of its predecessors. The framework asserts that there are three core types that weave the fabric of who we are and what we do, and that understanding these types will therefore lead to greater understanding of ourselves, our relationships and our organizations. As with any newcomer on a well established scene - the seasoned type scholar may be inclined to dismiss Goswami's framework until its mettle is tested over time. As an organizational development professional specializing in type for more than a decade, I say make some room for the new kid. The MRE framework is streamlined, intuitively sound, and ready to rumble with the clunkier older crowd.For type enthusiasts, on first blush it may seem introductory. There are no instruments, scores or complex coding rubric. However, the savvy reader will soon learn not to be fooled by its simplicity. The framework is elegant in its minimalism. It provides clear parameters and plentiful cases, yet allows the reader to interpret and self-navigate guided by their own experience and discernment. In so doing, it can be utilized in a highly sophisticated fashion, depending - like any good tool for personal transformation - on the effort applied.Granted, the author himself confesses many of his bold assertions are unsubstantiated by the same scientific or psychoanalytic research that supports longstanding cornerstones such as Myers-Briggs and the like. Yet the text is well sustained by diverse personal testimonials, the authors' keen insights, and an eclectic range of references from Aristotle to Rodenberry. The cool, straightforward style and rich narrative data create a credibility of accessibility that more than compensates for lesser technical authority.Goswami represents the framework as a good entry point for further exploration and self discovery ... leading to other models or typing systems if readers so choose. I agree, and having been immersed in the field for many years can easily crosswalk the MRE energies to a wide selection of other types and styles - from I Speak to DISC to the Enneagram. Yet I've found great value in the application of the MRE framework itself, and do not underestimate its power to stand alone. So if you're an expert looking for an innovative twist on type, or a novice seeking to better understand yourself, your team, or gain insight into your organization, start with The Human Fabric. Then decide for yourself if you even need to look further."},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"Very insightful; I would recommend it to friends and co-workers (and I have purchased copies for colleagues)."},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"\\"A man travels the world over in search of what he needs, only to return home to find it.\\" (Unknown) Whether we are conscious of it or not, knowing ourselves is the key to any successful journey. Sometimes the tools and direction we need are closer at hand than we realize. Most of us need a guide like The Human Fabric to figure this out.Bijoy Goswami has created a wonderful tool kit - a map, picture postcards, and traveling instructions all wrapped into one - for those who seek value in this world and want to derive and maximize it to their full potential. Though Bijoy is often associated with entrepreneurs and start-ups, the messages of The Human Fabric are powerful lessons for the walk down any life path. Bijoy dusts off thought leadership reaching back as recently as yesterday and as distant as centuries ago to show common patterns among those who truly shape their world and ours. The history lesson he provides is a wonderful frame of reference. The associations he highlights between thought leaders across time and geography shows keen insight and reveals his knowledge to be both deep and broad. But what is most striking and valuable about The Human Fabric is the way Bijoy makes it all real and relevant to every reader, right now, today. If you've every wondered who you are and how you can tap the real you to its full potential, you should read The Human Fabric.

The MRE (Maven, Relater, Evangelist) framework that Goswami presents is easy to comprehend and you can easily identify with. It has given me a lot of insight into my life, my needs and my career direction. I believe that the more you know who you are, what you identify with and your core strengths, the more you are likely to choose a better journey for yourself. The MRE framework also helps you find better business partners to fill in your \\"weak\\" spots. This is not a book that will give you answers to life. This is a book that will help you find those answers because you have those burning questions in you. It is a book that will aid you in your quest for personal enlightenment for personal or career development.

Bijoy does a great job of tying together modern management, eastern philosophy, and social sciences to provide a rather simple yet powerful framework for understanding and relating to people. This book is a must read for managers and team leaders.Manoj Saxena"},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"In The Human Fabric, Bijoy Goswami delivers an important book.Through the pages; he pulls at the disparate threads of eastern & western religious teachings, early & latter day psychological theories, stellar and stumbling business cases and gently guides the reader by weaving a tapestry which the early humanistic psychologists would surely admire.This book offers a roadmap to a better understanding of relationship dynamics---professional and personal. Rollo May and even ol' Abe Maslow would applaud."},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"Listening to Bijoy Goswami at a DallasBlue networking event in February opened up a new line of thinking for me. Rather than try to be something I'm not, I instead recognized my desperate internal struggle to return to my core.During his presentation and throughout his book, Bijoy hones in on the three types of people that comprise this wonderful world of ours. Mavens are driven by knowledge, Relaters are driven by relationships, and evangelists are driven by action. Each of us possesses a \\"core.\\" And, when we step too far outside that core we develop internal struggles. Instead of fighting it, we should use our \\"core\\" power to propel us to new heights.A quick read, the Human Fabric is made up of 7 chapters.Chapter 1 - Revisiting the Golden RuleChapter 2 - MavensChapter 3 - RelatersChapter 4 - EvangelistsChapter 5 - SynthesisChapter 6 - MRE for CorporationsChapter 7 - Broader ApplicationsI wholeheartedly recommend that you read this book. It's much easier to become successful in life if you understand what makes up your \\"core\\".As an example, Bijoy mentions in his book that the perfect startup company would comprise a Maven (with the technical expertise), a Relater (with a golden rolodex of contacts), and an Evangelist to persuade others to join the cause.------------------Michael Davis, Editor - Byvation"},{"Title":"The Human Fabric: Unleashing the Power of Core Energy in Everyone","review":"\\"The Human Fabric\\" helped me understand who I am and what pesonality my company should (of necessity) reflect.

One of the first grads of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, she married the naturalist Olaus Murie and honeymooned in the Arctic. Over the years, fearless Mardy even took her infant children on expeditions into the wild.The book is an indivisible combination of autobiography and nature writing. Murie has a remarkable eye; her descriptive powers rival McPhee's but her tone is more one of powerful affection rather than awe. My favorite story was of a young teenage Mardy, on her way to the Lower 48 to go to high school, catching the last mail sled out of town in the spring of 1918. This spring trip took many days; at each river crossing there was a possibility of not making it over the thinning ice.What an adventure! Combined with that adventure is a powerful romance, the lifelong relationship between Olaus, a professional naturalist; Mardy, the fearless and intrepid companion; and Alaska herself.Mardy Murie died only last year, at age 101. If you read this book, you will regret having just missed her; she deserves to be missed."},{"Title":"Two in the Far North","review":"I, first, heard of Mardy Murie and her husband, Olaus, while watching John Denver's The Wildlife Concert. He wrote A Song For All Lovers for their deep and abiding love for each other and for the state of Alaska. The song's beauty gave rise to my curiousity. And, recently, while watching a documentary of Mardy's life, I became determined to read this book about her life.This book is a must have. Mrs. Murie paints with words, a picture so vivid of Alaska's tundras and plains, that I felt as if I were part of it. The lifestyle was hard, but satisfying, and this woman's life was nothing short of fascinating. Mardy Murie is a living testament to the strength and beauty of women, and she leaves a shining example of what a woman can do. In her assistance in Olaus' work for the ANWR and other Alaskan Land Conservancies, to her carrying on of that work, she is a beacon to us all of what we can do.Buy it...read it. You will fall in love with Alaska and with Mardy."},{"Title":"Two in the Far North","review":"Mardy Murie is often referred to as \\"The Grandmother of American Conservation\\" and \\"The Grand Dame of the American Conservation movement, but somehow after reading her story, these titles barely seem adequate to describe such an incredible and personal woman. While we may liken Murie to women like Rachel Carson or Anna Botsford Comstock, Murie's journey is singular. We follow her from her childhood in Wyoming to graduation at the University of Alaska, through love, into the far reaches of the Alaskan North.Murie successfully bridges the personal and the political, her own life and her life's work, her love for one man and her love for their work together. You will laugh with her, you will cry with her, feel scared for her, and come to love her. She will become your hero.We must recognize Murie as an American treasure, but we must also recognize that Murie's inspiration is perhaps more important now than it ever was. The most obvious reason for this statement is the continuing struggle to preserve the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from growing oil interests. We must also recognize, however, that Murie could be the inspiration for the young generation of leaders in conservation-- a group of leaders that undoubtedly must include women. That there are very so few women leaders in conservation has caused the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women to recognize the struggle of women in their efforts to achieve leadership positions in the conservation movement. Other organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Sierra Club, and the National Wildlife Federation have launched campaigns to attract more women into leadership roles. The lack of women in environmental leadership reflects America's view of rugged individualism in our collective imagination...nowhere has this myth been more prominent than in the discussion of America's last frontier-- a very personal discussion for Ms. Murie.Not only is Margaret E. Murie a woman in the conservation movement, but she is an American treasure with a very personal and very political story to tell. Even as she approaches her 101st birthday in August, she continues to speak out for Alaska's lands, peoples, and wildlife. Her story is not one of fame, comfort, or glory, but it is her American story. Mardy Murie will become your hero, your inspiration and your friend. Take the journey with her."},{"Title":"Two in the Far North","review":"Margaret (Mardy) Murie (n&eacute;e Thomas) was a truly extraordinary person who lived for 101 years. This book is not really an autobiography although it is autobiographical, recounting her adventures in Alaska before she met Olaus, mainly with him, and then visits after his death. Anyone who has been to Alaska, is going to go, or has an interest in wilderness should read this book. Murie was a talented writer, leaving us an enjoyable legacy of vivid descriptions and, at the end, thoughtful reflections. Hang in there: this is a long review because the book is so worthy.The Murie and Thomas families represent a one-two punch that must be highly unusual if not truly unique. Both Olaus and Mardy had sibs ten years their junior, brother Adolph Murie marrying sister Louise (Wheezy) Thomas, born 1912 and still living last I heard. Both wives were devoted outdoor enthusiasts who accompanied their eventually famous, field biologist husbands into the wilds of Alaska and elsewhere.There are four major parts to Mardy's book, the first being when she came to Fairbanks at age nine. (At least one web site claims she was five, but that's not what she herself says.) Even today, one can get a sense of the town she describes for 1911. The streets are the same, the city having resisted tearing up downtown and instead forcing the shopping centers and other sprawl north of the Cheny River or south of the old town. Yes, there are now large hotels and an incredibly beautiful and absorbing visitor's center, but by and large the buildings remain modest. Some of the old cabins have been moved downtown and are occupied (with modern conveniences to be sure). The Masonic Lodge is still as Murie mentioned it, if a bit decrepit.The railroad was coming and the old relay system of dog sleds and horse-drawn coaches came to an end. At age 15 Mardy was the last ever passenger on a perilous journey by dog sleds to meet her genetic father and half brother. In some ways this is the most exciting story of the book.In the second major part she makes an incredible journey into wild Alaska to meet Olaus for their wedding in 1924, then setting off with him to study caribou in the drainage of the Koyukuk River. Alas, Coldfoot is no longer the \\"cluster of cabins\\" she found, but rather the major truck stop on the Dalton Highway, which parallels the trans-Alaska pipeline. Across the road is the modern interagency visitor's center, a joint venture of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. Nearby is an airstrip, home to Coyote Air run by Dirk Nickisch and his wife Danielle Tirrell -- both competent bush pilots and the kind of people Mardy Murie would have liked.Less than 15 miles farther upriver is Wiseman, which has managed to maintain an updated version of the settlement Murie describes. A new post office was built, but the old one she saw has been preserved. The dance hall, where she had to dance for nine hours as one of the few women in town, is also still there. In fact, that is where I bought her book, as building is now the breakfast room of the charming Arctic Getaway B&B; run by Berni and Uta Hicker -- again likable people of whom Murie would have approved.The book's third part is about a 1926 trip to the far north on the Yukon border in order to band geese. Although I've never been there, the chapter resonates, bringing up my own memories of banding birds. The Muries had their new baby son along, reminding me of research camping trips when our sons were still babies. The Muries had it much tougher than any modern field biologist as their boat's motor broke irreparably, they suffered the worst mosquito infestation known to Alaskans, and they had gear that was primitive by our standards. My wife, incredible as she is, never had to face the hardships in the field so cheerfully borne by Mardy Murie.Fast forward to 1956, after Olaus left government service and became head of the Wilderness Society. Cosponsored by three organizations and the University of Alaska, the expedition of the Muries and three other biologists were taken by bush plane to north of the divide in the Brooks Range, into an area then only proposed as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. How familiar to anyone who has camped anywhere along the north side of that vast east-west expanse of Alaska's major mountain range well above the Arctic Circle! Murie describes the wonderful world of miniature plants on the tundra, the rocky expanses separated by tiresome tussocks of muskeg, creeks and rivers, often serene lakes, towering mountains, large mammals, diverse bird life, and of course the changeable Arctic weather, which at times can be just plain dreadful.At the end of the book there are two comparatively short additional parts about much of the aftermath: creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1960, a return to the Arctic in 1961, Mardy's activities following the death of Olaus in 1963, in the Rose Garden for President Johnson's singing of the Wilderness Act in 1967, her eloquent campaigning to keep the pipeline from changing the Alaskan lifestyle forever, and so on. I think she never mentions the honorary doctorate conferred upon her in 1976 by the University of Alaska. After the book was written, she received in 1998 the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the country. Mardy Murie died in 2003 at her home in Wyoming.Read this book as a partial autobiography, or as a travelogue, or as an adventure story, or as a historical record, or as an enthusiastic celebration of wilderness, or just as an enjoyable \\"read\\" by a good writer.A Naturalist in AlaskaWapiti WildernessThe Wolves of Mount McKinleyJourneys to the far NorthAnimal Tracks (Peterson Flashguides)Wilderness Visionaries: Leopold, Thoreau, Muir, Olson, Murie, Service, Marshall, RutstrumTravels in Alaska"},{"Title":"Two in the Far North","review":"Margaret Murie was ahead of her time when she explored Alaska.

Later, after graduating from the University of Alaska (she was the first woman ever to do so), she married Olaus Murie - a scientist studying the migration patterns of Caribou in remote northern Alaska. Together they set off for the Brooks Range to explore wildlife in areas like Bettles and Wiseman and the Old Crow River valley.Murie is considered by many to be the grandmother of the conservation movement, and much of the passion she had for this territory that later translated into her advocacy for wilderness protection were born in the stories of this book."},{"Title":"Two in the Far North","review":"Enjoyed this book very much as it is based on a woman's life in Alaska.

The time period moves to the 60's, she's older, widow of am important environmentalist, and she gets wayyyyy too preachy. The flowery language becomes nauseating, and nothing really interesting happens from that point on.Except that she now lives in a Jackson Hole log home (no mention of how many trees were cut down to build that sucker, after all the care they took not to cut any live spruce on the expeditions up in AK), and flew all over Alaska doing who knows what for what reason, and didn't worry one whit about the noxious fumes that were spewing from the airplane's exhausts. I guess it's ok to become a hypocrite in your old age, as long as you've had your chance to see the AK wilderness and you would like to see most everyone else kept out (limit party size of trips to the Brooks Range to six people, indeed). Typical attitude for someone who's been supported by the taxpayers for years and doesn't have to worry about making a living."},{"Title":"Two in the Far North","review":"Parts of this book were very interesting and I respect the woman and the adventurous lifestyle, but parts were dated for me and other parts were too long.

I've held a fascination with the possible direct connection between early Hawaiian quilts and the Baltimore Album quilts of the the Eastern coast. This may be the only book with color plates of some of these beautiful early quilts that would offer clues to this connection. My favorite designs in this volume are Anthurium by Mary Manoi and Coconut and Pineapple by Meali'i Kalama.

The introductory chapter is the history. It is an easy read, interesting and the author pulls from a variety of sources, some of which I haven't read in other books on the market about Hawaiian quilts.Another reason I recommend this book is because the quilts included come from collections, public and private, around the US, not just Hawaii, so you will see quilts you have not seen before.What I noticed was that the usual echo quilting pattern associated with Hawaiian made quilts is absent from many of the quilts in this book. Other, more familiar quilting has taken it's place. Not too much was written about this fact, which was the only disappointment for me about this book.I recently gave a talk using the audiences antique quilts and sure enough, a beautiful Hawaiian fruit-flower type applique quilt, made in white on light blue was shown and it was quilted with a small grid pattern. I thought it was more uncommon than I now understand it to be.The book is oversized with one large quilt photo of each quilt, of excellent quality, making it is easy to see the quilt's applique details and quilted patterns."},{"Title":"A Mine of Her Own: Women Prospectors in the American West, 1850-1950","review":"This book fills in a gap, opens a hidden history of women who prospected in Nevada, Utah, and Alaska. It is hard to find any other books about women prospectors in the American West. It is written in an easy to read style, yet includes a lot of direct research from diaries, newspapers, and family biographies. This book describes the lives of women who prospected from around 1860 to 1940, women who preferred prospecting to any other kind of work, including housewifery. The reader gets an insight into their daily lives in the context of the times. Their marriages, partnerships, friendships, apparel, mine-site dwellings, society's attitudes toward them, even styles of child-raising are described. However, the book does not present any technical info on mining geology. It was surprising to learn that one of the women described in this book operated a very successful Nevada mine in a humanitarian manner, with a dorm, mess hall, and swimming pool for the miners. Others turned over child-rearing to relatives due to the isolation of prospecting. They wandered over mountains and desert, sometimes alone, or preferring men as prospecting partners because, according to the author, men provided more muscle strength for digging a mine. Some women were limited in their access to investors because they did not frequent saloons. Others jumped claims and swindled investors, exaggerating the potential of a claim. Not many got rich, but all loved the outdoors. Overall, they were women with a Can Do attitude who pursued their dreams, just like the cover photo depicts."},{"Title":"A Mine of Her Own: Women Prospectors in the American West, 1850-1950","review":"A Mine of Her Own: Women Prospectors in the American West, 1850-1950Sally Zanjani celebrates the lives of the many driven women prospectors who helped shape the western states.

It had good coverage of .NET PKI, VPNs, IPSec, and Kerberos security, etc, with emphasis on what is new in .NET Server. I wish it had more wireless security, but at least there was one chapter on it. The best chapter was by far the \\"Securing IIS 6.0\\" chapter. The book shows enough key differences between Windows 2000 Server Security that are upgraded in .NET Server, that you will probably be convinced to upgrade yourself sometime very soon.

I must confess I haven't been particularly pleased with the titles I've looked at so far in this area; rest assured this is the exception. A lot of the chapters read more like a tutorial than documentation, with lots of screen shots and tables of settings that explain more than you would probably learn by sitting through another teacher-reads-book Microsoft course.When I went through the book in detail I found some very useful nuggets. For example one chapter covers the \\"security configuration tool set\\", a complex and confusing aspect of Windows 2000. What's useful here are the series of examples that demonstrate some aspects of how to use these tools. Additionally, the book is full of definitions of security-related terms, insight to new WiFi-based applications and extensive coverage of Windows XP security features. XP's security is much of what is used within the .NET framework, so don't pass it by.Most of the book is like the above--detailed passages of useful information with more-than occasional implementation tips thrown in. This book is a must-have and sure to be the de-facto standard of .NET security references.

The descriptions can be a bit esoteric at times. It's fairly short. It is not exactly a page turner, the some parts can seem repetitive if you are reading big chunks without listening to the music as well. However, I think it is one of the best books on Indian music I've found in English. If you are looking for a good guide to assist in listening to and understanding great classical Indian music, this book serves that purpose very well. If you are looking for a book that includes contemptorary Indian musicians and has pictures of George Harrison, there are other books out there that can offer that kind of thing."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"In the early 1970's I first read the first edition of this book. In particular, the chapter on gay male sexuality was appalling. Filled with stereotypes and ignorance and treating bathroom sex as typical of how gay men relate sexually, I will never forget it. In his latest edition there is almost no improvement in his treatment of male-male sexuality. To him, gay men are still denizens of bathrooms and bathhouses. He does not seem to conceive of the idea that two men could manifest physical love to each other. From a mechanical standpoint he is also laughingly and hopelessly mis-informed. Why did the publisher revive this homophobic work?"},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"While Reuben has toned down his patently anti-gay bias, his &quot;I'm just telling it like it is&quot; attitude is still just thinly veiled and self-congratulatory ignorance. You have to wonder if he's ever met any gay people in his life. He certainly hasn't met any happy ones. That may be his experience, but he's doing a disservice to us all--gay and straight--by generalizing his experience to all gay people. If you're gay, look up this book by Peter Shalit, M.D. instead: &quot;Living Well: The Gay Man's Essential Health Guide&quot;. It's everything that Reuben's book should have been."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"I agree, if you collect older pop culture books, you'll love this. I was about 6 when this thing came out, and maybe 10 when I snuck iinto my brothers' room to rifle through their things and found this. Even then I knew this book was silly. Hard to believe it was written by a doctor! Example, a couple goes to the doc because they cannot get pregnant. He asks what sort of contraception they use. \\"What are contraceptives?\\" the couple asks. Boom! Right away the doc has the answer! He realizes the man has been (trying to keep it clean here) \\"putting it in the wrong place.\\" How did doc come up with THAT conclusion from a seemingly infertile couple by asking only one question? Just because the people don't know what contraceptives are doesn't mean they have never used them anyway! Were people really that stupid back in the 60s? Also, this was before abortion was legal, so the stories about dead women in bathrooms (from what I remember) scared the heck out of me. Now that I'm 43 and know a lot more I might pick up another copy to have even more laughs."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"Oh, where to begin with this heap of libelous garbage?I'll be reviewing the first edition of the book because it was the one I snatched up as a teenager after finding it in the free section of a used bookstore. As an asexual young person eager to learn about the obsession that the other ninety-nine percent of the human population harbored, I thought that Reuben's well-known bestseller would serve its promised purpose. The introduction asserted that no one could \\"live up to his human potential\\" without having an active, healthy sex life, which should have been my first hint that the author was writing with an agenda in mind. I don't know what the more recent edition says about transsexuals, and, for personal reasons, I don't want to know.)Well, it's been over forty years, and EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX: BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK has become more and more risible as more time passes. From start to finish, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX is a transparent attempt to convince the reader to practice vanilla-flavored marital intercourse to the exclusion of all other forms of sex. The descriptions of the male and female sexual organs, as simple anatomy lessons, are exempt. The chapter titled \\"Male Homosexuality\\" is particularly notorious for insisting that gay men are prone to anonymous hookups in public bathrooms, cannot live together lovingly (\\"The bitterest argument between husband and wife is a passionate love sonnet compared to the average conversation between a butch and his queen\\"), can be \\"cured\\" of their homosexuality by visiting psychiatrists, and, most bizarrely, get pleasure from penetrating themselves with foreign objects such as fruit and shot glasses. The \\"Prostitution\\" chapter is similarly defamatory--it is the only section of the book that discusses female homosexuality, and asserts that the lesbians who become prostitutes do it to take the money of the men they despise and infect them with diseases. Reuben bestows his blessing upon oral sex between a man and a woman but cautions them that they may have \\"emotional problems\\" if they prefer it to intercourse. \\"The ideal sex act\\" adds procreation to pleasure and an emotional connection, according to him. Yes, he actually uses the phrase \\"ideal sex act.\\" Plato may or may not be proud. Modern readers will also note that the book is totally innocent of the concepts of fisting, lesbian sadomasochism, and heterosexual anal sex.EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX does offer some entertainment value: the \\"interviews\\" from medical clients who are obviously the author's inventions provide most of the laughs. A prostitute visited in the daytime by a stingy john apparently dealt with him by saying, \\"What do you think this, the kiddie matinee? You can come over here for half price but you only get half a screw!\\" If you wish that your sex manuals of choice had the tone of judgmental sitcoms, this book may be to your liking. Just put \\"Reproduction\\" from GREASE 2 on repeat, and you'll be all set for an evening of stern lectures against almost every conceivable sex act. Otherwise, stay very, very far away from this thinly disguised propaganda."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"I read Dr. Reuben's book at age 13. My parents owned it. I truly thought most of it was awesome. Here was frank talk about an area that so many parents avoid. Unfortunately I knew at about age 5 that I was attracted to other guys and Reuben's chapter on homosexuality was so full of mis-information and prejudice that it was devastating for a first year teen.He spoke of lesbians not really existing, just actresses in porn films. He said my biggest thrill in life would be meeting a man at a bathroom in a Greyhound bus station and getting a shot glass shoved up my arse. He said all gay men were fat. Of course I didn't fit any of these descriptions but felt I was doomed. This is not the type of \\"medicine\\" or advice that a doctor should be giving.Years later before I publicly admitted I was gay, I came extremely close to killing myself and I'm sure the \\"good\\" doc's advice was a contributing factor. I don't know if he has tried making amends for the damage he caused but if not, let this be a lesson to future racists and homophobes, \\"If you've never walked in the shoes of someone else then don't pass judgment on what they are all about\\".Had the book been informative and factual in this chapter I would have given it 5 stars.

Well for what it's worth, I'm pretty young and pretty straight, and while I don't see what all the hubbub's about, I didn't find much more to admire than the rest of y'all.For one thing, at this point a better title might be \\"Everything you already knew about sex.\\" As far as the stuff in the book that's actually true, I would guess that anyone born after 1970 already knows 70% of it before finishing high school -- the bulk of it from 7th grade science, with general knowledge and common teenage talk filling in the rest. The book makes a pretty mediocre first impression, too, spending its first seven pages talking about dick size (har har). It's done in the most banal way possible, too, wasting space to philosophize about questions like how to make it look bigger (\\"trim your pubes\\" -- blinding insight there, guy!) or that porn stars aren't really as well-endowed as they claim. Finally, this Reuben guy's not much of a writer. He's short on style and wit, doesn't offer much depth in his discussions on anything, and I saw no trace of successful humor, despite an announcement in the Introduction self-declaring how funny he is. His only real accomplishment -- aside from polluting the narrative with ten tons of irrelevant Bible quotes -- was managing to make sex boring.As for the alleged anti-gay sentiments, well, this guy probably is a homophobe, if for no other reason than his religious nutjob nature (he also \\"hates porn\\"). But honestly, unless I just missed it from reading too fast, I didn't really sense bigotry in this revised 1999 edition, aside from maybe his over-associating gayness with anonymous bathroom sex and what he wrongheadedly classifies as \\"sexual perversion\\" (S&M;, BDSM, and the like). As far as gay people being promiscuous, I wouldn't necessarily call that assumption offensive; just dumb and uneducated. Here's a more accurate generalization: MEN are on average more promiscuous than WOMEN, and thus it follows that gay men would engage in more promiscuity than straight men ***because their partners are more accepting of the idea***, not because of gayness. (Said another way, men like to screw around, so in a community consisting of men with the the same preference, you can expect to see a lot of screwing around.) I'd only call the \\"gay=promiscuous\\" thing bigoted in that it entirely ignores lesbians, who have the opposite preference since they're women. Attitudes about sex and relationships differ by gender far more than by sexual orientation.Anyway, find something better to read."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"This book is the most dangerous piece of garbage I have ever seen.

Pain to me, who beleived what he said, pain to my mother, who beleived it. How sad his book became a cultural phenomenon.I really don't have much of an opinion about his other topics, but he seems very narrow minded and judgmental and self important.

It's well known that fear of homosexuality is a common cause of suicide in boys of this age, and books like \\"Dr.\\" Reubens can only contribute to this sad statistic. I know of a large number of gay men who read this book in the 70's, believing the hype that surrounded it, and who suffered deep bouts of depression and confusion over the lies the \\"doctor\\" advances.Of the ones I recall, one was that male homosexuals all wanted to be \\"women\\". This idea is as ludicrous as any that I've ever heard. It's true that a FEW enjoy dressing up in women's clothes, and that a smaller number suffer from a condition of gender confusion, which has little to do with homosexuality.He goes on to provide \\"interviews\\" with \\"those people\\" that he tries to pass off as being representative of the gay lifestyle in general, but which are equally as erroneous: e.g. gay men prefer to meet in public restrooms, or that a large number engage in sadomasochistic practices, with a description of a \\"typical\\" scene that reads like something from a Jack Chick religious tract.The OPINIONS of \\"Dr.\\" Reuben are largely unsupported by the mainstream medical community, and his sorry excuse for a book is little more than an exploitative screed that was originally written to cash in on the \\"sexual revolution\\" that came out of the 60's. Some of his supporters, with a clearly homophobic agenda, have suggested that its critics are either advocates of censorship or that they allege to know homosexuals themselves who privately admit that what the author writes is accurate, but they speak out of ignorance at best, and out of a desire to deliberately mischaracterize the subject at worst. I'm not advocating a denial of his right to author such trash: I'm just trying to warn people against taking it the least bit seriously. Do not rely on this book as your primary source of information about human sexuality.\\"Dr.\\" Reuben's inaccuracies do not end with male homosexuality, however. Some of what he attempts to promote as valid medical information is ludicrous in the extreme, other is outright bizarre. I have to question his qualifications as an MD (which is why I use the quotation marks) in light of this thoroughly discredited book.One final word of advice to parents who are considering buying this for their children: DON'T! You're doing them NO favors at all, regardless of their sexual orientation.

We honestly thought that the gays he supposedley interviewed thought it was a great prank, not knowing it would become a best seller and become the 'bible' of sorts to straight people who learned about a taboo topic from this book (anyone remember the Wonder Years episode about this book?). After the laughter died down we realized that it was media like this that made our parents fear and loathe our kind, because it was the only voice talking, and is still talking through shows like Will and Grace and Queer as Folk that don't go a long way to disprove what he writes in this book.

What I remember the most, though, were the fright stories about back-alley abortionists and women who died trying to abort an unwanted pregnancy. I don't remember much about the author's ideas about homosexuality, but for the most part I wouldn't take anything he had to say about sex seriously.

Tittilating information (in the 60's, sex was just starting to be openly discussed), a chatty, non-clinical format that relaxed the nervous reader(most of us in those days)and a medical degree to give it respectability, Great except for one thing, Dr.Reuben knew nothing of his topics. He had no psychiatric training(California law allowed any MD to hang a psychiatrist shingle) My favorite idiocy was the notion that syphillis and gonorrhea could be eliminated by giving everyone mandatory injections of penicillin.

He fails to see why anyone would be into BDSM as a way to express their sexuality.He also fails to describe the love and respect shown between both people in a BDSM relationship. He also claims that most BDSM scenes always go much farther than they should. I think it's obvious Dr. Reuben has nothing but disgust for anyone into any form of SM. He also is down on people with pierced body parts and is also down on same sex marriages.

The biased slant was clear from the get-go, and if Dr. Reuben didn't find it clear enough, he goes further to criticize any form of role-playing as well as foreplay which does not adhere to his apparently tried-and-tested methods of normalcy.The very thing about \\"sex\\" is that it has to be fresh, it has to be made interesting, it must arouse both parties (maybe more, but we won't go there... Dr. Reuben clearly doesn't WANT to go there) and everyone who's above 20 knows that boring sex is the first step on a way to a destroyed marriage.Dr. Reuben, for all his support of the traditional marriage-and-sex system, clearly doesn't want couples to stay together very much, for he proposes normalcy, routine, and repeatability.At times, it even becomes offensive, as he suggests that gay sex is nothing more than a matter of going into toilets, doing some footwork under the stall separations, and become something like an emotionless act of oral sex through holes drilled in the separations. Other times, he criticizes menstrual woman for their \\"masculinity\\", and for their decreased sex drive, which then suggests Dr Reuben is nothing more than a masochistic, male chauvinist with a medical degree, masquerading to be an authority, which he is anything BUT.I highly suggest staying away from this book.

For one, there is an anti-gay tone to all of the information on gay sex and culture. I am a 30+ hetero woman and I cringed at some of what was written here. I don't think authors should cater to a politically correct audience, but I was surprised that this came from a medical doctor with a specialty in psychiatry! At another point in the book, he talks about the IUD method of birth control almost as if it is responsible for sexually transmitted diseases. As far as I know, many women successfully use this as their birth control method...seems strange?! All in all, a fun read if you are interested in popular culture.

It's definitely a period piece!However, it is definitely NOT a book I'd recommend to anyone seriously looking for information or insight. It's hard to fathom how, as a psychiatrist, Dr. Reuben could have been so dismissive, clueless and judgmental when he wrote this. As a teenager during the mid-'70s, I purchased a paperback copy at a yard sale, and even at that age, was able to appreciate how ill-informed Dr. Reuben's opinions were. Anything he does not seem to understand, he dismisses as a sad, self-destructive deviation. It's sort of ironic that this book was so tied to the sexual revolution, given how narrow-minded and puritanical Dr. Reuben's thoughts and ideas in fact were.Hopefully, anyone looking for real information nowadays will have the good sense and judgment to look to any of the more recent books written by credible authors that have supplanted it. On the other hand, those wanting a good laugh should definitely look for a USED copy of \\"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex\\". (Don't bother paying full-price for a new copy, it's definitely not worth it.) Frankly, I was to find that the book -- *updated* or not -- was still in print."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"This book still is an intriguing read. I read this when it was first published and did not have enough knowledge to know what was inaccurate and what was opinion and what was fact. However, I did feel quite naughty and knowledgeable reading it at the time. It's scary to think how close I came to having an unwanted baby because of the birth control method mentioned in the original: shaken coca cola. (Imagine a cheap motel, a broken condom, and a scared young man running for bottled cola.) It's not forbidden to talk about sex any more, so you don't get the added status the original one gave to teenagers."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"This book should be banned because it offends millions of people and reinforces prejudice about the LGBT people."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"I read the original version of this book as a curious teenager. I became the envy of the neighborhood with my ability to answer my school chums &quot;dirty&quot; questions. This book was a very important release that shocked prudes everywhere and flew off the bookshelves at the same time. Alot of the information was factual, but alot was biased, especially about gay people. This certainly had an impact on America's homophobia in general. Still, I'm thankful I had this book to learn from when young instead of the lies and misinformation when you &quot;learn&quot; about sex like all the guys did."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"This is more of a testimonial than a review but after 16 yearsof marriage and two children my sex life was hell! My husband and Iread this book together and found all the answers to our problems. We put our sex back together again and I guess our marriage to. This is truly the users guide to sex, relationships and sensibilities. Thank you Dr. Reuben and God bless you."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"Like some other reviewers, I was surprised by the negative comments made regarding this book and its author. I didn't read any anti-gay bias in the book. In fact, on page 144, the author emphatically states, \\"But as a physician and scientist, I cannot pass that kind of personal judgment. Therefore nothing in this chapter [titled \\"Homosexuality\\"] should be--or can be--interpreted as being against or in favor of homosexuality.\\"Are those the words of a homophobic? Or are a few of the reviewers here in need of a chill pill? Yes, he does state that some homosexuals have casual sex, without getting to know their partners. Heterosexuals do this as well. Denying that it happens is intellectually dishonest. Then again, some people will hear only what they want to hear, regardless of the facts.He tackles conventional sexual subjects including puberty, masturbtion, menopause and menstruation with aplomb. He also tackles subjects that many wouldn't want information on, including BSDM and sexual perversion. I've also glanced through the \\"What's Happening to my Body?\\" books for boys and girls, and found them just as informative."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"There are answers to just about any question you may have about sex. Great book for a couple to read who may be having sexual problems or who just want to make sure their sex life doesn't become routine."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"This is definately one of the most important books that I ever read as a child, and I'm going to make sure that when they're old enough my children read it too. The author has his biases--name one who doesn't. So what if he doesn't choose to be politically correct and tell everyone how wonderful and right they are? What he did 30 years ago and today was to write a book that gives straight information on the human body and the human reproductive system. It's not a manual on how to have sex nor should it be. Thanks to this book I've known about my body and about other people's bodies since I was a teenager. As a result my sex life has been better and more fufilled. If you want to teach or learn a certain kind of morality then find a better way to do it, but don't attack a book for not doing something that it doesn't try to do. If you want to learn about the physical shell you inhabit then buy this book and learn from it."},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"Wow! What a book! I thought I knew a lot about sex but this book opened up a whole new world to me.His sense of humor is stupendous. When he described famous &quot;Honest Maid&quot; l etter, I couldn't stop laughing. And the description of how to grow a new foreskin w as hilarious. Even the description of a S &amp; M party had some touches of humor.On the serious side, I liked the chapter about birth control and how the oral contraceptives can really protect women from fatal diseases like cancer of the ovary. And the truth about those so-called &quot;date-rape&quot; drugs. I didn't know that some women take at least one of them deliberately before they go out on a date!The chapter on STD's was really useful especially as it explains why you real ly can't depend on a condom for protection as much as you thought you could. I didn't know there were 18 STDs to be aware these days. And I'm glad I kno w which ones can cause cancer there are 2 of those, according to the book. An d the explanation of how you can give yourself AIDS if you put the condom on backward was really something!But the thing I liked best was the upbeat tone and the sense of humor. When he describes the &quot;feel-good&quot; chemical that is released in your body every tim e you have an orgasm, it actually made me feel good. And his optimistic approach to the menopause and sex in the later years was really encouraging.It's a fun book to read and full of very useful information. I give it 5 star s!Solo 101"},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"had no trouble reading like a novel. very interesting and humurous at times even. may not be EVERYTHING you wanted to know about sex, but it sure comes close. may even give you a little more than you wanted to know. I definitely recommend reading this!"},{"Title":"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask","review":"Actually, I read this book when it first came out many years ago, and since I am currently looking for a book to read that is really funny, I thought of this one. Back then, I read this book to my sister-in-law late one night while we shared a glass of wine and we couldn't stop laughing! We couldn't believe how funny it was! And I can't believe the reviews of the people who take it so seriously. But of course, it was also educational because it answered questions I hadn't even thought of yet. Still....I want to share another evening of laughter with another special friend, so I am going to buy it again."},{"Title":"Enough!","review":"If you buy Donald Westlake's \\"Enough\\" you get a novel (\\"A Travesty\\") and a novella (\\"Ordo\\") -- two for the price of one. The former is very funny and well worth reading. The latter shows Westlake at the height of his powers:\\"Another thing. Every one of them was alone. They went up and down the aisles, pushing their carts past one another -- from up above, they must have looked like pieces in a labyrinth game -- and they never looked at one another, never smiled at one another. They were just alone in there, and from up front came the clatter of the cash register.\\"This is a short, melancholy piece that compares favorably with Westlake's best works (the early Parker, \\"High Adventure\\"). As usual, it has a happy ending. The Happy Ending is almost a Westlake trademark.It's the writing in between that really gets to you."},{"Title":"Enough!","review":"Very well written mystery thriller with a bit of humor. A twisted ending that is satisfying enough.When you find this paperback it will probably be old and yellowed and still worth the read."},{"Title":"Enough!","review":"Enough maybe isn't the most hilarious of all of Westlake's comic capers but it certainly is a very funny entertaining read. Westlake has written over a variety of genres throughout his career under his own name and various pen names (the most successful is Richard Stark). His collection of work known as comic capers (crime stories with humorous happenings and sometimes eccentric characters) of which this is one of are very hard and expensive to track down but well worth the search and money.Enough is the story of movie reviewer and womaniser Carey Thorpe whose life is going along quite well. He has a number of different female bed partners who know nothing of each others existence. However one night and argument with one of them, Laura Penney goes to far and before he knows it she's dead. Carey doesn't want to go to jail so makes sure all evidence he was at the scene is removed. However Laura's husband didn't trust her and a private investigator had been outside watching the building. He demands $10 000 from Carey or he'll go to the police. Carey doesn't have ten thousand dollars so has to commit more crime to get it. However the the violent sleazy investigator wants more from Carey so concerned for his safety gratefully accepts an invitation to accompany Detective Fred Staples (who is investigating Laura's murder) to another movie industry crime scene to give an insiders two cents. Carey solves the murder in two seconds impressing Staples and is henceforth called upon by Staples at every opportunity to play a Miss Marple type role. Meanwhile complications keep arising in Laura's case which Carey will have to deal with along the way if he's going to get away with murder.A classic Westlake novel. Carey like with most Westlake villains, although doing bad things, you come to quite like him. Quite an interesting character as is evident by one of my favourite ever Westlake character quotes, (p120) - \\"It was the first time I'd ever made love to a woman in a bedroom with a murder victim hanging in the closet, particularly a victim of my own, and I must say it made absolutely no difference at all. I was neither turned off nor were my responses heightened. Possibly I'm abnormal\\"Hopefully they'll re-release these classics again one day so you can get them at reasonable prices. Still tracking down some of these comic capers so haven't read them all yet but the best three at masterpiece level Westlake Comic Capers I've read so far areSmoke,The Spy in the Ointmentand aNew York Dance(also published asDancing Aztecs). Other comic capers also worth checking out are The Fugitive Pigeon, The Busy Body, God Save the Mark, Who Stole Sassi Manoon?, Help I am Being Held Prisoner, Castle in the Air and High Adventure. Of course you've also got to read the Dortmunder series and the Parker series (written under the pen name Richard Stark) as well. You've also got to read his greatest stand alone story novel of all timeThe Axthe ultimate solution to unemployment. Check out a Westlake novel today!This is a great classic, if you can find this 1977 published crime caper for a good price, grab a copy. By the way the way the only story that you get with the book I bought is Enough, there's no Labyrinth type adventure or any other Westlake story inside the book. Enough by its own is Enough though."},{"Title":"George Orwell's 1984: A Play","review":"A bastardization, this play attempts to capture the feel of Orwell's classic novel, and it fails miserably. It omits essential points of the plot and abridges several of the more important moments-- such as when Julia and Winston fall in love (a mere 1/4 page of the script). More importantly, because theater cannot \\"enter the internal thoughts\\" of characters as easily as books can (and this play has no monologs or soliloquies of that sort), the responsibility to imagine Winston's feelings lie wholly with the audience. George Orwell makes Room 101 real and terrifying; the play makes it a mockery. I would highly reccomend against this dramatization. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because as a completely original play, it's OK. But, audiences will expect something of the caliber of Orwell's book, and this will leave them disappointed."},{"Title":"George Orwell's 1984: A Play","review":"this play covers the main parts and plots of the book but misses more then its worth. i have done the play and read the book after words and wow. theres a diffrence there."},{"Title":"George Orwell's 1984: A Play","review":"Winston Smith began getting tired of his regular, everyday job for working with the Party in the future of London, England. Several countries were overcome by the US and transformed into a giant country called Oceania. In this future, set in 1984, there is a system called the Big Brother that watches over all of its citizens to make sure they do not try to rebel the government and throughout the story Winston gradually turns against the government and plans to overthrow it. Along his journey he meets a woman he supposedly falls in love with which is breaking a law and meets a man named O'Brien that is said to be working against the Party. Winston knew he was doomed with a life sentence for a while and eventually gets caught by the Party and interrogated. 1984 is a very well written book filled with great characters, mystery and vivid description to keep the reader reading the story.The main characters in this story were Winston Smith, Julia, Mr. Parsons and O'Brien. All of the characters were different in their behavior and all wanted to accomplish different things. Winston changed began the story as partially disliking the Party but kept his thoughts to himself and he changed through the story to a man with a severe hatred of the Party and tried to demolish it. Julia was a woman that lived a dangerous life and did not care about who she associated with. She had experiences with many of the members of the Party and no one had turned her in yet. Mr. Parsons was a quiet man that did what he was supposed to do without question but eventually got caught for hating the Big Brother. O'Brien was the man that turned in Winston and Julia because he was a sort of spy. He lured Winston into breaking the law and busted him.Mystery was a main characteristic of this story because judging by characters behavior you could not guess what the consequence would be. After Winston bought the journal from the antique store it was fairly hard to see if he would get caught and arrested because buying that item was illegal. He met with a man that Winston thought opposed the government but was not sure. Not knowing who this man was, Winston still discussed plans with him about overthrowing the government and the reader would immediately begin to wonder whom this man really was. Another event was when Winston became friends with Julia, which was breaking laws so the reader would then wonder when or if the two would get caught.George Orwell wrote this book very descriptively to show the reader everything that was occurring at that time such as talking about all of the setting, who was in the area and other important facts. One time of his great description was when Winston and Julia were alone in their bedroom above the antique store and they heard a strange but familiar voice from inside the room. The room was empty but still they heard the voice and steps approaching them. By this time the reader could picture perfectly how the two of them would be looking in all directions while a group of unknown people would be coming for them.1984 was an over all enjoyable book to read. Page after page was filled with something new and a new event to change the outcome of the story. The reader would think one thing would occur because of the event but another event suddenly altered the fate of the first event. This book should be read by all of the readers that enjoy futuristic books dealing with a grim government and total control of the population to lead to a revolution.- K Hurdle"},{"Title":"George Orwell's 1984: A Play","review":"Now a classic.

Thie book does not describe what COULD happen - it describes what HAS happened, at least, in some cases and to a certain percentage of the public. The information elite today, increasingly, is using cameras to monitor people - including - with those they target - in ALL areas of their lives. Likewise, people are alienated and rendered voiceless by this faceless elite who churns out lies and brainwashing (in my opinion) to keep them distracted and neutered. Authors names ARE being changed, gifts ARE stolen, composite characters ARE created, triple speak IS practiced, coverups ARE participated in. I know these things are true because I have seen and experienced them, as I am sure we all have, on a sliding scale. Likewise, society is dividing, more and more, into classes - those with insider information and privileges, and the masses who have &quot;freedom&quot; but cannot use it, and live like animals. I see this everyday. The &quot;threat&quot; is the hero of 1984, who dares to FEEL, speak the truth, try to escape conditioning. The villain is the machinery of the system, both in 1984 and today. A very good book on this subject (nonfiction) is Friendly Fascism, by Betram Gross - written ten years ago, and, in my opinion, an understatement of what is occurring, but nonetheless brilliant and illuminating."},{"Title":"George Orwell's 1984: A Play","review":"I highly recommend 1984, by George Orwell, in any edition or translation you choose, because I feel he was so very prophetic about the times in which we live.

I am familiar with the trails in LA and MS and the author's interpretation of the trails is very accurate from difficulty of the trail to trail condition. He did miss a couple of trails in LA. One is relatively new and located at Bodacau Park (army corps of engineers). Good technical trail. Off I-20. The Kisatchie National forest trails (caroline dorman and one other) are probably not good to ride right now as there are forest fires flaring in that area 7/00.

I had wished and imagined I could when I read it in high school. With all his flaws, Jean Christophe represents the unconquerable, undefeatable and ever-improving human spirit.

It just-in it's persuasive way-forces you to look upon the dirty, 'unworthy' ones with a new light, with pity-not disgust. The language simply cools down the heart like a mountain-full of ice by the beauty of it. And it's hatred for the world behind the mask just burns your heart as it did with Christophe. Down with pretense! Down with politeness! All in all, the tragedy of this impatient man who found peace in death will either pierce your heart with enlightment or choke you with laughter.

She'll tell you that herself. But hey, she's got one criminal justice course under her belt, time on her hands, and one of the richest pieces of real estate in the land on which to nose around when her friends need help with more than the latest social event.We're talking murder and mayhem in the glittering town of Palm Beach, of course, all of it cleverly stitched together in Cain's debut mystery novel. The story itself pivots around a wonderfully crafted plotline: Self-serving (and deserving) rich guy winds up dead in a swimming pool. No one weeps, but plenty of people care. After all, there's a gala ball coming up soon, and no one wants a dead guy stealing the show when the spotlight should be on Versace gowns and Tiffany pearls. That's just the beginning, though, and Wally has to tread carefully. It's one thing to violate protocol in a place like Palm Beach; it's another thing altogether to put your own life in jeopardy and Wally finds herself doing just that.But enough of the story. From my perspective, the heart of the book is its humor. You can count on a smile with every page. You'd best prepare yourself for belly laughs on about every third or fourth page. See, Carolyn Cain doesn't just know Palm Beach -- and make no mistake, this author's got a lock on what makes that island town tick -- she's got a grip on wit that's as engaging as her characters.My bottom line?

That's one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Time Travelers from our Future: An Explanation of Alien Abduction","review":"Although this book is not a religious one, I found it interesting that the author sights several passages in The Bible in which time travel is mentioned.I also found it interesting that the author mentions parallel universes. We all experience parallel universes from time to time temporarily. If you pay attention to the small details of everything, you will notice when you cross over into one.The author discusses the history of Lemuria (Mu) and Atlantis in detail and how they have shaped our world today. I found it interesting that the people during that time period were said to have been very tall (up to 9 feet), and this is where our stories about giants and even references to tall people in The Bible come from.The discussion about ET's (extraterrestrials) in the Earth's history was interesting and how it has influenced humanity, as well as, the influence of ET's on humanity today.This book also contains several meditations that allows its readers to do past life regression, view future lives, view the choices we have for the future during our current life, visit the 5th dimension, teleportation, etc. I have tried most of these meditations, and they have worked very well for me.I would highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning about the unrecorded history of the Earth and humanity, if you are interested in learning more about ET's and their involvement with us, if you are interested in exploring past lives and future lives and visiting the 5th dimension, etc.I would also highly recommend the following book, as its content is similar.

It is very gentle in the way it addresses parents' separation, and it emphasizes the positive aspects of the relationship between father and son AND mother and son. It takes pressure off children to relate the story too closely to their own exeprience by describing the relationships between the members of a bear family, not a human family. It gives my son comfort to see that there are \\"others\\" in the same situation that he is in, and that they are able to understand and deal with the parents' separation in a positive, matter-of-fact way. It also nicely describes the typical father-son relationship in a way that my son was instantly able to relate to. The illustrations are also very relaxing for him.

While the story provides a decent balance of the attributes (and reality) of the situation in general, there are two quotes from the story that I would draw your attention to that may effect whether you wish to purchase it or not:=== QUOTES ===Little Bear was \\"bored\\" at home with his mother:\\"......But the best thing of all was when Father Bear came......\\"Mother Bear explained to Little Bear why Father Bear no longer lived with them:\\"......That was when Father Bear and I still liked to be with each other. But then we started arguing......\\"=== PLOT ===The story begins with a little boy coming back from a visit with Daddy and he is angry and upset. His Mother consoles him and tells him a story about a teddy bear who lived with his Mommy in a cave, but would go out for visits with his Daddy. The baby bear wasn't happy about not being all together in one cave anymore. The Mother Bear goes about her chores in the cave, plays with baby bear a little and teaches baby bear what is safe to eat. It continues (pardon the typos; I type fast, not perfectly):=== ADDITIONAL SELECTIONS FROM THE TEXT ====\\"Every morning, Mother Bear woke Little Bear and they went out together into the forest. Mother Bear looked for food with Little Bear, and she showed him which things were good to eat and which were not. They played catch or hide-and-seek together, and Mother Bear let him climb a little and splash around in the stream.\\" But sometimes Mother Bear had work to do--cleaning out the cave or gathering fresh branches for their bed. It was boring for Little Bear, and it made him grumpy. And he didn't cheer up until Mother Bear was ready to play again.\\"\\"Every night she licked him with her pink tongue, from the tips of his fluffy ears right down to the last claw on his little hind leg. Then with a happy growl she murmured, \\"Sleep well, and sweet dreams, Little Bear,\\" and she laid him down on a fragrant bed of soft pine branches. Then they slept, snuggled close together, all through the night.\\"\\"But the best thing of all was when Father Bear came. He picked up Little Bear in his huge paws and threw him high in the air until he squealed like a piglet. Then they went out together, deep in to the forest, and Father Bear showed Little Bear animals that he never saw when he played with Mother near the cave. They saw the old badger in his burrow, and he growled at them. But Father Bear growled back, and that was the end of that. High on the cliffs, they saw the sly lynx, watching for prey. And above the cliffs they could see the great eagle, circling in the blue sky.\\"\\"Father Bear let Little Bear climb much higher in the trees than Mother ever did, and balancing on the shaky limbs was an adventure. When Little Bear was hungry, Father Bear scooped a fat fish from the river with one swish of his paw. And for dessert, Father Bear broke open a bees' nest. Delicious! After eating, they played rough and tumble until-at last!--Little Bear pushed his father onto his back. His father pretended to be beaten and they both laughed and laughted and rolled down a hillside. Then they lay together all calm and happy in the meadow and let the sun warm their fur. But when evening came, Father Bear took Little Bear back home.\\"\\"Little Bear plunked down in the opening of the cave, folded his arms, and scowled. Father Bear dusted him off and picked a blade of grass out of his fur--but Little Bear made a face and turned away. So Father Bear lumbered off into the forest. Mother Bear watched from the shadows, and then came and tried to cheer Little Bear up. But he bellowed and scratched the ground and didn't want to cheer up. Then he started to whimper.\\"\\"Mother Bear let him whimper for a little while. Then she padded over to the bed of branches and fetched him the ball of soft moss he liked to hug. She gently put it in Little Bear's paws, and sat next to him. \\"Why is he going away again?\\" wept Little Bear. \\"Because Father Bear lives in his own cave now,\\" said Mother Bear softly. \\"But he used to live here!\\" sobbed Little Bear. \\"Yes, that was when Father Bear and I still liked to be with each other. But then we started arguing. You remember. And it isn't good to live with someone if you're always arguing,\\" said Mother Bear. Little Bear thought about that. He thought about the animals he met in the forest. Some were friendly, and they would play together for hours. But he argued with some of the other animals--he didn't like being with them so much.\\"\\"But *I* didn't quarrel with Daddy Bear,\\" growled Little Bear. \\"That's true, Little Bear, and that's why Daddy Bear comes so often to take you out to play. You are his child and you always will be. He loves you more than anyone else.\\""},{"Title":"Good-Bye, Daddy!","review":"This isn't the best book read on divorce, but it is well written and is helpful for small children going thru a divorce.

In discussing McQueen's films Nolan gives some interesting insights (for example, Ali McGraw did not know how to drive when The Getaway was being filmed, despite the fact that the script called for her to drive a car at high speeds with McQueen alongside).One can only be impressed with the way McQueen rose from childhood poverty to become a talented actor and humanitarian."},{"Title":"McQueen","review":"The book gives greay detail relating to car and motorcycles owned or used by Steve in movies and real life.

The hero and heroine are engaging and believable, and the kitten that brings them together is sure to engage every catlover's heart. The plot is very fresh and original too, bringing a new angle on the Scottish tragedy at Culloden, and the author did a beautiful job of bringing this long-ago world to life again.This was a very emotional, very romantic and original story that fans of historical romance won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Starlight","review":"This is the first book that I've ever read by Miranda Jarrett, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. She has a fresh writing style and manages to find a time period which hasn't been totally stomped by either the harlequin era or the medieval era. Her story is quaint and refreshing while her overall tone is still recognizeable enough for historical romance fans.Cora McGillivray is in hiding. Her whole family was killed in the battle of Culloden and she has been sent to England to stay with a friend of her father's in England. For two years, Cora has lived in secret with her father's friend in fear of being hung for a traitor. Her only friend has been a wayward little kitten with seven toes and a white, star shaped patch on his forehead. Meanwhile, Alex and Diana Fairbourne have just arrived in London from the colonies. Alex is given the job of Diana's keeper and Diana is determined to find a husband. Their first day on the island, they meet with a mysterious woman who gives them a kitten saying that the little creature will lead both of them to true love. This kitten also happens to be Cora's kitten.Diana is staying in the same household as Cora. Cora and Alex meet out in the garden over a kitten fight and both are immediatly attracted and drawn to the other. What ensues is an engaging story about true love, magic, and kittens.Miranda Jarrett has a subtle talent for detail and many things are snuck into _Starlight_. I immensley enjoyed the fresh time period and the information about Culloden. _Starlight_ was by no means a heavy book and it was perfect for a historical, light, romance. Cora and Alex were, overall, very defined characters that were pleasent to read about. Most of their actions had clear meanings behind them. The plot was interesting with the new element of a kitten finding true love and it moved along at a snappy pace. The setting came alive and moved around the reader and the overall tone of the book is engrossing enough to keep up late into the night. Miranda Jarrett's sense of humor is not as pronounced as, say, Susan Elizabeth Phillips's but it is enjoyable and you will probably get a few laughs from this book.The only complaints that I have are few. Cora was an overall complex character with a well thought out personality, but when it came to her belief that Alex was the man her father said he would send to take her home, she was extremely niave. Her stuborness and blind faith got a little tiresome after a while. The villain was very believable at the begining of _Starlight_, but as the plot progressed, his motives got muddier and muddier and by the end, his intent was so mangled that it was hard to see him as a true character.Still, these are not enough to lower my opinion of the book, and overall it is very well written. I would suggest this book to romance fans who have gotten tired of the same plot found in romance novels and want something new. It is engrossing, well written, and enchanting. It's also a great book for cat lovers, as the kitten in it is fantasticly adorable."},{"Title":"Starlight","review":"In 1747 London, Massachusetts shipmaster Alexander Fairbourne hates the rules of engagement that gentlemen must follow when mingling among the aristocracy. However, he puts up with it to a point for the sake of his sister, Diana, who plans to take the city by storm and make a suitable marriage. Meanwhile, while walking together, an elderly woman accosts the pair and gives Diana a kitten that allegedly will find her true love for her.Alexander holds the kitten when he meets Cora MacGillivray. She insists the kitten is hers and takes off with it. To his surprise, Alexander is very attracted to the enigmatic Cora. In turn, she wonders if he is the one to save her and bring happiness back into her life.Miranda Jarrett's eighteenth century romances are always a delight due to the strong charcaters and the feel of a bygone era. Her latest tale, STARLIGHT, is another winner for sub-genre fans. Alexander and Cora are an enchanting couple struggling with a seemingly forbidden yet desirable attraction. The story line is fun and filled with non-stop action as expected from a Ms. Jarrett novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Starlight","review":"STARLIGHT tells the tale of Alexander Fairbourne and Cora Margaret MacGillivray, two people who meet over......a cat?! Yes, a cat. Alex picks the seven-toed kitten for his sister from a mysterious woman who claims the cat will lead its owner to true love. He encounters the cat later - in the arms of Cora, who claims he is HER kitten, Starlight - and the magical tale unfolds from there.These two are among the most unusual characters I have encountered in a novel: their personalities are so vibrant and real. Alex's sense of honor is wonderful to behold, his sense of humor is fantastic, and his sensuality is incredible. I envision Cora as a metaphor for Sleeping Beauty in the sense that she has been buried by the tragedy of losing everyone she holds dear on the fields of Culloden and then Alex comes along and shows her how to live again. The way Alex draws Cora out of her fearfulness shows his tender and caring side, and allows the reader to see that Cora is not some wimpy miss who hides from the world, that she is a brave as Alex claims she is. These two protagonists make a wonderful couple; their relationship is strong, and realistically portrayed in Jarrett's romantic prose.The secondary characters are strongly represented as well. Over the time of the story, Lady Waldegrave's secrets are revealed and she is shown to be more sympathetic than she appears at the start. Diana, Alex's sister, is a delight, full of youthful mischief and nave inclinations. I look forward to reading her story in STAR BRIGHT. Starlight is a very willful animal, in the way that only bold exploring kittens can be. I laughed until I cried over his adventures in the print room!STARLIGHT was my first Miranda Jarrett book, but it will not be my last."},{"Title":"Starlight","review":"In Miranda Jarrett's STARLIGHT, a black kitten with a white star on its forehead brings two unlikely people to love.

But soon she can't stop thinking about the handsome stranger, and wonder if he is the only one that can save her from her difficult situation. And with Alex, he can't seem to stop himself from falling hard into love with Cora.STARLIGHT is full of humor, and exciting events.

Because of number of contributors, the information is a little repetitious and each author strayed a little into the other's subject area. What should have been a decision based on science and economics became heavily weighted down with political considerations. The facts show it was a flawed decision making process. Some of the contributing authors seem to say that the optimum place for Nuclear storage was not found, that the Yucca Mountain site was a political decision. If there had been a free exchange of knowledge and facts, then the correct site would have been chosen. The public furor is the result of a bad decision making process, totally ignoring the strongest sentiment that drives the public with projects of this nature, \\"Not In My Backyard\\", no matter what the scientific facts may show. Can science and some theoretical hand waving be relied upon to safely judge one site better than another for the duration of the next 10,000 years?The book's chapter on how other countries are dealing with their nuclear waste was the most beneficial part of the book and also very succinct. The authors lead the reader to topics about Carbon 14 leakage, other country's storage systems, and \\"engineered barriers\\", but after leading the reader to these terms little or no explanation is given. This is good book to get a slice of information about the Yucca Mountain decision process. This reader believes the subject matter is too narrow to really inform most readers about the process of storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain"},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"Synge had been a writer in Paris when a friend urged him to go to the Aran Islands. He learned Irish while there. As an outsider, he was a person of great interest. He spent a lot of time talking with people, including some who knew only Irish. He took down many tales he was told. The book describes the way of life in about 1900 and relates many of these tales, as well as some poems. However, his story is weaker concerning how the Islanders made their living (but does have graphic tales of seamanship in rowing and steering a curagh through very rough weather). For an insider's view of traditional Irish island life at this time period, the books written by the Blasket Islanders are a better source. I give it a lower rating than most others based on this comparison."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"My dad was born there in the 1950's and i was named after it. not a bad place, not much to do but nice to visit. the book is informal but informative."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"People have often said to me that they find Synge's account of his time spent honing his Irish and collecting folklore on the Aran Islands to be one of the slowest and most boring reads they've ever encountered. I must heartily disagree.While the work doesn't exactly &quot;swing like the pendulum do&quot;, the rhythms of his narration are very much like that of the changing tide and the rolling of the waves to which the islanders have grown accustomed. Synge's narration-- like time on Inishmaan-- moves slowly and steadily, washing over the reader if one will let it.Remember above all that this work is essentially a series of journal entries, meant to document the people Synge met, the conversations he had, the stories he heard, etc. Perhaps the book's greatest contribution to the world is as a document of a way of life no longer in existence. This book is also a document of the the Irish Literary Renaissance, and-- for its occassional pretensions-- should be ! considered as such. This text might also help to give greater understanding to any reading of Synge's plays, as he alleged that the story for such works as &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot; were derived from tales he heard in the Arans."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"\\"The Aran Islands\\" is a delightful rendition of the experiences of J.

Isolated by the sea, the Arans, like the Galapagos in the natural world, preserve the language and customs of traditional Ireland.The book is a narrative of what Synge saw and the stories he heard during his stays in the Arans, told by a master storyteller in the finest Irish tradition. The language is delightful, the stories are entertaining and the insight into the Irish soul is profound. A must read for any lover of the Irish."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":". . . on Aran as everywhere else. I have had the privilege of spending two weeks on Inish Mor, one 4 years ago and one in the summer of 2001. The difference between the two visits was enormous . . . where on the first visit I saw perhaps 5-6 cars a day on the little roads, now there are minibuses beetling along everywhere. The pony carts are strictly for the tourists. I missed the women setting up kiosks on the road, selling their beautifully made sweaters. At the same time, throughout the summer, the young people put on a nightly concert featuring traditional Irish music and dance -- and it is fantastic! So wonderful to see the beauty of the old traditions taking hold in the hearts of the young men and women.BUT ... what is quaint to the tourist translates into abject poverty for the native.

Synge's book about life on the desolate Aran Islands is a very well written look into a society that could only exist until that time, and in that place. The Aran Islands, a group of islands off the west coast of Ireland, were at the time almost completely cut off from the mainland, except via the 'hooker' and the skin covered 'curagh' that plays such a critical part both in life on the islands, and in the book. Life there was very hard and made the character of the prople very unique. The islands were, and are, one of the strongest 'Irish' speaking cultures, and the ability to find life in the midst of it all is profoundly apparent throughout the book, as is Synge's obvious appreciation of the simple life and simple beliefs found there (note the comparison he makes to the 'busy' and 'lost' world in Galway, merely across the bay). It is a book of it's time, and shound be read in the context of the beginning of the 'Irish Revival' then beginning."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"This book describes the adventures of J.

Synge followed his suggestion, and made four lengthy trips to the islands. In this book, he recounts his experiences on the islands, together with some of the stories and poems that were recited to him there.The book is a unique collection of travelogue, journal, and research notebook. Synge describes his relationships with individuals on the islands, as well as some of the common traits and customs observable there. He tells us about harrowing sea passages that he took from island to island in small rowed boats, and records a number of folk-tales that were shared with him by island residents. Synge was to draw on all of this material in his later writing career, making the book quite interesting for those who enjoy his plays. The book also provides informative details of what daily life was like in this remote region at the time."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"The search for authentic experiences is regarded as an important theme in postmodernism. John Millington Synge's book demonstrates that this quest for authenticity has been an important part of cultural inquiry for a long time. This wonderful book was written almost one hundred years ago, but it reads like a contemporary ethnographic inquiry. He provides vivid descriptions of daily life and wonderful presentations of the folklore of the Aran Islands. The book is primarily descriptive, but there are interesting textures and conclusions throughout Synge's writing. I would recommend reading this book and then watching Flaherty's film \\"Man of Aran.\\" Follow up that visual feast with Stoney's \\"The Making of the Myth.\\" To complete your excursion, top things off with a reading of Synge's \\"Playboy of the Western World\\" and \\"Riders to the Sea,\\" two fine plays that he set on the Aran Islands. The stories, descriptions, and textures within Synge's book will become very clear when you're finished."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"Not only does this book describe a time long past but Synge has a deeper sense of the psychology of the inhabitants of the Aran Islands and how it differs with that of \\"civilized\\" people of the time. Anyone who is interested in this topic and enjoys this book would do well to read Twenty Years A-Growing by Maurice O'Sullivan, which is a personal account by Mr. O'Sullivan of his life on Ireland's Great Blasket Island and is a wonderful, lyrical read that shows alot of humor as well as love for the natural world around him."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"This book definitely starts slowly, and initially one may be put off by a sense that Synge is trying to adopt an appropriate voice and is uncertain where he fits in with the picture. Give it time, however, and both the description of the time and place, and finally Synge's place in it, become really interesting. He was young but also something of an invalid at the time, and the perspective varies movingly and thought-provokingly, from total outsider to partial insider, thanks to huge but under-stated effort on the part of Synge, driven by both a desparate urge to amount to something in his short life, and a wistful desire to partake of a &quot;normal&quot; life that would elude him."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"...at least the far western end, if you exclude Iceland, as is generally done. The Aran Islands are a chain of islands, composed of three principal ones, which are just off the western Irish coast, from Galway bay. I learned of this book from Tim Robinson's excellent accounts of the totality of life on these islands, in hisStones of Aran: LabyrinthandStones of Aran: Pilgrimage. Robinson published his accounts in 1986, based on his life on the islands, commencing in 1972. In both of Robinson's books, he references Synge's account of life on Aran around the turn of the century (nowadays, we need to specify that is the beginning of the 20th century). I made that proverbial mental note to read Synge, which I was finally able to fulfill, stumbling on this 1993 version in a used book store in nearby Santa Fe.Synge was enjoying \\"La Belle Epoque\\" in Paris, determined to be an authority on contemporary French literature when he met William Butler Yeats, who was from Ireland's west coast, near Sligo. Yeats urged him, essentially, to \\"get back to your roots,\\" with the ultimate Gallic experience being available as far away from Britain as possible. And these islands fit that specification. At the time, Britain was directly ruling Ireland.Robinson lived on the largest island in the chain, Aranmor. Synge sought out life on the middle island, Inishmann, under the idea that life there would be less \\"corrupted\\" by modern influences. There was no \\"steamer\\" service to this lesser island; transport was by a small rowboat, called a curagh. Picturesque in calm seas, but often perilous, as Synge recounts, in the stormy Atlantic. Synge states that life on Inishmann was the most primitive in Europe, and underscores that with a startling fact: there were no wheeled vehicles on any of the islands.Synge has an ethnographer's ear for native folk tales which he faithfully records, but does not particularly analyze. One of the longest concerns the killing of giants in order to win the hand of the daughter of the King. He also relates the story about a person who promises a \\"pound of flesh\\" as a debt, but does not mention that Shakespeare incorporated this into one of his most famous plays,The Merchant of Venice. Synge also carefully describes the clothing of these \\"natives.\\" He is less strong on the economic basis of the society, but does describe the process whereby kelp is collected, and iodine extracted. He also has a memorable section concerning when the landlords, via the police, evict various residents from their hovels for non-payment of the rents. He says: \\"The land is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed the following year, so the rye-growing is carried on merely for the straw, which is used for thatching.\\"Synge anticipates Paul Goodman'sGrowing Up Absurdby 60 years: \\"It is likely that much of the intelligence and charm of these people is due to the absence of any division of labour, and to the correspondingly wide development of each individual, whose varied knowledge and skill necessitates a considerable activity of mind.\\" He also focuses on the language abilities of the residents, and even on these remote islands, English has largely penetrated. The descriptions of the natural world are sparser, but he can wax lyrical at times: \\"Looking back there was a golden haze behind the sharp edges of the rock, and a long wake from the sun, which was making jewels of the bubbling left by the oars.\\"Robinson is, by far, the polymath; his account is much longer and more comprehensive. If I was going to Aran (as I hope to do), and could read only one author, I'd choose Robinson. But Synge's account rings authentic; he also is a keen observer of the islands, more than 70 years before Robinson's arrival. Fortunately I've now been able to read both accounts; would recommend them both. Now all I have to do is get to Aran. 5-stars."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands,","review":"J.M. Synge might have been one of the best Irish writers in history, but despite that fact and the fact that his subject, the life on the desolate Aran Islands, is a very interesting one, I cannot help but be bored by this book. The Aran Islands is a group of islands outside the west coast of Ireland, and the life there is very harsh. The sea, the wind, the lack of good soil... all this worked to make life here very hard and shaped the culture and the attitude of the individuals. Furthermore, the islands were almost totally cut off from the mainland at the time this book was written (now it's a popular tourist spot where you can visit &quot;Synge's cottage&quot;). Synge went to the Aran Islands five or six times during as many years, and wrote this book to &quot;express a life that never found expression before&quot; (Yeat's words). The life on these islands, far from the modern civilization that takes place only a few hours away on the Irish mainland, is indeed of interest. But nothing happens. In the whole book. It starts with Synge being on the Island, his first day there. It ends with Synge leaving the Islands for the last time. In between, all there is is the interesting description of the islanders' life, which could have been described better in another way, and Synge's mixed emotions of them. As a reader you get the visitor's view of the island, a visitor that wants so badly to be accepted at one time, the next minute, he thinks of them as primitive. It is worth reading because of the informative contains, however. And if you plan on visiting the islands, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"Don Lapre's What & Where To Sell On the Internet","review":"Kevin Trudeau is a convicted felon.

We believe healing starts in the mind; with keeping a positive outlook. I was grasping for any kind of help, when I randomly selected this tape. I am so very pleased I did. This wonderfully relaxing, and life-affirming tape gave my husband peace, and a quiet determination to endure. He slept better, when BelleRuths' voice softly instructed him, and he felt less pain and anxiety, as she empowered him to will his body to heal. Next to a loving mother, this was the most comforting and encouraging thing we had. No one can say for sure if suggestion cures cancer...and we don't do that now, but we know for sure it made our journey easier. We have since bought 8 more tapes for our friends, and each was grateful we did.

Buy this tape...and God Bless."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For People with Cancer","review":"Simply put, this disc is the best of its kind available.It consists of three tracks covering instructions, a guided visualization, and affirmations. As the instructions point out, different people will find the visualization more helpful than the affirmations, and vice versa.

Its effectiveness only grows with repetitive use."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For People with Cancer","review":"I bought the original cassette tape version of this a decade ago. Having not used something like this at the time I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the product. In the recording Belleruth introduces the process in her gentle, calm voice, and then guides you into relaxation and then a healing visualization journey. I found upon repeated listening what I experienced during the guided imagery changed from time to time. At times it was quite moving and healing. I found it a huge help with feelings of sadness and very relaxing.Also, a few years ago I was suffering from an illness and wondered if one of her newer CDs might help with my healing. I wrote her via her website, and was pleasantly surprised to get a thoughtful email back from her personally recommending which CD she felt would be best for my situation. She also mentioned other CDs (since produced) she was thinking of making. Her personal email even further reinforced the feelings I had that this person cared about the people she was helping, and not just making more money.So I highly recommend this CD.

Surgery and chemo are part of the solution... but you have to rally your own strength to deal with cancer. I believe that this tape allows you to do that... in several ways. If you don't jive with one part of the tape, there are others. One of them is bound to touch you in a meaningful way."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For People with Cancer","review":"By far Belleruth's tapes are the best in applying guided imagery to health and healing.

I have mild depression so I don't know how it would work with someone with more severe depression but it is worth trying!"},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For People with Cancer","review":"I had battled depression all my life and was continually trying to find something--anything--that would help. After countless purchases (CD's, books, therapy, medications, you name it), I happened to buy this to try it. And wow. It changed my life. That was more than a decade ago. Now I see my life as divided into two eras: before this CD and after this CD. At first, I had to listen to it every night for the effects to be consistent, but then, I would listen to it once a week, then once a month or so, and now I only listen to it when I need a boost. I have no idea why it's so powerful, but waking up each morning after listening to it is a joy--I can feel a life force in my body; I'm surrounded by self-love. This feeling is in stark contrast to the utterly morbid feeling of waking with depression. Probably the biggest relief is feeling in control now. When I do start to feel depression coming on, I know what I can do to prevent it. It's like having a piece of magic. I can feel the healing take place. I've worn out many copies of the CD over the years (and bought friends many more), so I finally captured it digitally and keep it with me all the time.

The elder Mr. Vonnegut mentions it one of his books (I don't remember which one, but I'm pretty sure it's Fates Worse Than Death, or maybe Timequake), and I probably would never have picked it up (or even heard of it) otherwise. That said, it is a fascinating and very delightful book, full of insight and well worth reading. Not many books tackle the admittedly difficult issue of describing insanity from the inside out (i.e., in the form of a first-person recollection), and this book is truly useful for those looking for such a work. It's hard to imagine anyone doing it better. I can see this as a practical \\"must read\\" for medical professionals looking to identify more closely with their patients, or for anyone who just wants a more personal account of the subject matter than that often offered by dry, sterile medical textbooks. Mark's writing style is quite good, but also highly personal. He doesn't seem aloof or like somebody with whom we can't identify (as many people who have experienced mental illnesses inevitably do): he seems like just one of us. The emotions and problems he was going through are certainly things that many of us can relate to (especially those of us who lived through the times that the the book describes) - although the cause for his schizophrenia was never, of course, fully discovered, a lot of things, as Mark says, \\"happened all at once\\": his steady girlfriend cheating on him, his parents breaking up, his father becoming famous. Although Mark's writing style is nothing like his father's, the two do share a similar sense of humor. This, coupled with the delightfully personal aspect of the prose, makes this a great read for those interested in its subject matter. Reccommended."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Mark Vonnegut went through three severe schizophrenic episodes in the early '70's, yet is able to maintain a sense of humor about what befell him. At that time, in his early 20's, he was going through his hippie phase, living with friends on a farm in Canada. Everyone, including Vonnegut, seemed to think what hit him was the result of oppressive society, as explained by the silly writings of ain't-no-mental-illness Thomas Szasz and the even sillier ones of mental-illness-can-be-a-good-thing R.D. Laing. Yet it turns out he was sufferering from a biochemical disorder, possibly brought on my malnutrition. What brought him back to reality was commitment to a mental hospital and some Thorazine, followed by some rather massive doses of vitamins and a better diet. I've never quite read anything like this. His descriptions of how schizophrenia crept up on him and how he thought there was nothing wrong with him, even when he was babbling gibberish, not eating and sleeping for days, are priceless. Although written in 1975, it is still relevant today, and very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"There are only a handful of memoirs about schizophrenia, and this book and &quot;The Quiet Room&quot; are probably the best ones available. The author apparently inherited his father's excellent writing and storytelling abilities, as this is an engaging and insightful description of life in the 1960s and the descent into and emergence from schizophrenia. The description of the illness alone makes the book worth reading, and is in some ways reminiscent of &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;. The book is also quite humorous. Highly recommended. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Two years ago I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and have since been put on medication and fully recovered. My therapist suggested that I read Mark Vonnegut's telling of the descent into schizophrenia. I've read other accounts of schizophrenia, but Mark's definitely takes the cake in terms of realism. I'm not even sure if I can finish the book, the book is so unsettling for me. If someone you care about has schizophrenia, read this book, it will help you understand what this disease does."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I had taken several classes in psychology in college and really thought that I had a grasp of what it was like to live with schizophrenia. Not so! This book takes you into the world and mind of a person with this disorder. Mark Vonnegut is so honest and open and you really gain a real world feel for what it is to be a person living with schizophrenia. If you are at all interested in this topic, I really feel it is a must read!"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This is a pretty scary look into the mind of a schizophrenic, from his shakily maintained environment as a late 1960s hippie to his complete psychotic breakdown. It is the worst possible thing you could imagine happening to your child I think, a waking nightmare: Vonnegut describes, with startling talent, his visions. Many of them are remarkable, from a face coming towards him until he is lost in one of its pores, to intimate interactions with angels, while resurfacing in reality every so often. Not only is the horror and lack of control brought to life, but so is the beauty and untapped potential of the human mind, such as his recitation of Moby Dick from memory.While many of the reviewers scorn the author as a silly naif, I find him sympathetic and brilliant, indeed courageous to explore and expose himself in this way. In the process, he debunks a lot of what was common talk of the period, such as the society and not the individual being \\"sick\\" or the total freedom that he thought he could find. Thus, it is a lament on the illusions of the time and about growing up, issues that many critics of the 1960s would do beter to acknowledge. I was also a Vonnegut fan, so the inights into his family interested me.It is but one window, of course, into a horrible state of existence. Recommended."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Perhaps eclipsed by his more famous father, Mark Vonnegut has never received the recognition he deserves for this fine work. Courageous, honest and at times extremely funny, Mark tells his tale of madness without a hint of the pretension that often creeps into such works. Especially interesting is the way he tries to reconcile his schizophrenia with the hippie lifestyle he was living in the 60's, when many thought the line between sanity and madness was nonexistant at best, and that &quot;madness is a sane response to an insane society.&quot; After a prolonged hell where he lost the ability to eat, sleep, or have a moment's peace, Mark ended up embracing and being helped by good old fashioned square western medicine, without losing the depth or sincerity of his countercultural leanings. His evocation of the experience of madness itself outstrips anything I have ever read on the topic. A very good book."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. Not only because the commune was located in my home town of Powell River B.C, but also because many of us, myself included, were experiencing the same feelings as Mark Vonnegut in the late 60s, early 70s. I have been to the commune many times, and still feel a connection to the book, and the era, each time I go. An extremely good read; thought provoking!"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I bought and read this book many, many years ago when my son was just a happy baby, still less than a year old. I enjoyed it immensely and tucked it away on my bookshelf, until several years passed away and many moving days later, it perished in disastrous house fire. By then I had become aware that my son was almost certainly schizophrenic, but he refused counseling, obtaining a formal diagnosis and therefore any of the medications available for his disorder. Finally less than a year ago he became afraid of what he might do to others or himself, so much so that he resolved to ask for help and has started down the long road, on and off medications and seeking counseling. It was a rough and heroic thing for him to have done, beginning his recovery by his own decision at nearly thirty years old. He has depended on and trusted enough in one of his twin sisters to assist him along the way. He doesn't yet trust me, his mother, enough to speak to me right now. I remembered reading \\"The Eden Express\\", and I thought that it might help him to know that others like him have had success, and that there was real hope for him. In all I have bought five copies of this book in the past month: a copy for him, one each for his two sisters and another to replace the copy that disappeared in a puff of smoke for myself. I hope that he will read it at some point in the future and that he will appreciate it enough to someday speak to me again.

I know that this is a chronicle of his ever-steepening slide into insanity and I guess Vonnegut is trying to take the reader along the same dysfunctional, confusing and sometimes scary path he was on - if that was his goal, he totally succeeded. It was an interesting topic to read about, especially from a firsthand account, and I was totally absorbed by some of the experiences Vonnegut had. I liked that he shared his experience so honestly, sometimes brutally so, and it gave me a very real insight into schizophrenia that made me much more sympathetic to those inflicted with mental illness.I wouldn't say this book is a gripping page turner but it's definitely well worth reading."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"An excellent book - a very intelligent person describes two psychotic episodes.

Vonnegut does a wonderful job of describing that culture and time even as his illness pulls him toward complete estrangement from it and everything else. The events of the story carry the reader, and Vonnegut himself, along as fascinated spectators, so while his eventual diagnosis and treatment are chemical you can't help but think that he is really suffering from the contradictions and congitive dissonance of the isolated, counterculture life he's living. He is in the wilderness without a map, and loses his bearings.

Beautifully written. Way beyond ironic that this is no longer in print, since every one of his dad's piece of crap books are."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This book is valuable on many levels, not least of which is that it provides an early account of cannabis induced psychosis, a phenomenon only recently being studied and appreciated. Most reviewers dont mention that Mark's episodes were directly precipitated by cannabis, yet it is obvious in the accounts he gives us in the book. Anyone sceptical of the connection between cannabis and psychosis must read this book. It is a warning to all those susceptible, if pot makes you feel 'paranoid', STAY AWAY from it, it WONT get any better, and could get a WHOLE lot worse.Mark Vonnegut gives us a valuablecase study of a young person who had natively intuited and systematatically explored synchronicity for some years prior to his episodes of schizophrenia. It makes me wonder - how much the onset of his illness was due to this practice of his cultivating synchronicity. And how much the debilitating nature of the illness was due to the anxiety that resulted when it manifested more and more. I wonder if in a culture that accepted and understood the phenomenon more, would he have not suffered as much?There are so many similarities in the neurological metanoia/metamorphosis transformation of schizophrenia and mysticism, it seems so clear to me they must be very close together on the spectral distribution of human ways of being.To the handful of readers who are interested in these aspects of consciousness, I would recommend Victor Mansfield's 'Science Synchronicity and Soul Making', and Louis Sass's 'Madness and Modernism'.Oh well, disregarding all that metaphysical blather, Vonnegut's eloquent descriptions of the despair of modern life as seen from the eyes of a 20 year old make the book a timeless classic of cultural criticism, it seems to me.

Once you start really getting into the book you cannot put it down. It not only describes what he is going through, but the detail of the time period and his own personal experience is incredible. I had a friend who knew his father Kurt (Mark's father) at one time, which I did not know he knew him, and told him how incredible this book had been and that he should read it. Andre was and still is a film writer. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I love others but this one really touches the inner self. By the way Andre - does anyone want to buy a couch (inside joke)."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Mark Vonegut has written a fascinating account of hippie life in the late 1960s. I'm about his age so I can really appreciate his experiences, especially since I am now dealing with mental illness of a 20-something age family member, so book is valuable for me on two levels. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Fascinating look at the hippie world view and lifestyle. About as good an attempt to describe a psychotic break as there is. What it was like growing up as Kurt Vonnegut's son. I liked it so much that I read the sequel. I liked that too. The only complaint I have is that it's a little hard to keep the various commune members straight. Although Mark Vonnegut isn't a writer by profession, the book is well written, fast moving and really made his experiences come alive for me. My motivation in reading his two books was my curiosity about how someone with such serious mental illness could achieve as much as he did and continues to do."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Delivered promptly in great condition. Mark Vonnegut really does give you an inside look for schizophrenia in a writing style that keeps you interested."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Well written and very intriguing. Recommended for anyone interested in psychology or neurology in particular, but can be an enjoyable read simply for its story."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Mark Vonnegut is a very good writer. He clearly describes, in a very convincing way, his spiral down into and then climb out of serious psychosis. As a mother of a young man recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, this book gave me an insight into what my son might be feeling and dealing with. It has also given me hope that he too will climb out of his madness and have a good life in his future."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"First of all, this book is not by Kurt Vonnegut but by his son Mark.Once I started reading this book I found it very hard to put down. I highly recommend it.The description from the dust jacket of the hardcover edition explains what this book is about better than I can:\\"In 1969 Mark Vonnegut graduated from Swarthmore College. Bored with East Coast academia, suspicious of his father's sudden literary notoriety, and determined to stay true to his principles of hippiedom, Mark headed for the wilds of British Columbia to build a commune and find his panacea. Two years later, on Valentine's Day, 1971, Vonnegut was committed to Hollywood Psychiatric Hospital in Vancouver - diagnosed severely schizophrenic.What is schizophrenia? Vonnegut himself has no simple answers, but his account gives us a startlingly clear and chilling vision of what it is to be mad, and he offers practical, down-to-earth suggestions for patients, friends, families, and medical professionals on how to deal with mental illness.\\""},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Brutally honest, and at times extremely humorous, this account of a young man's journey through insanity is a splendid read. This narrative takes you on a ride through Heaven and Hell, and lays bare the inner-workings of a mind gone rotten. As his father before him, the author leaves no violator of his honor or goodwill unscathed. Be it human or non, any and all things are vulnerable to the young Vonnegut's scorn. Not only is the story strange and thrilling, but it also serves to educate the reader about schizophrenia in a new and unique way (though it is quite a few years old, it was never fully accepted into the mainstream and still retains an amazingly individual view of the matter). Amid biting sarcasm and the indomitable fear of losing one's grip on life, a timeless and beautiful message shines through: &quot;There's no shame, there's no blame... there's hope. That's what this book is all about&quot; (Mark Vonnegut)."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager and have been trying to find it again for several years. I picked it up at the time only because I was a Kurt Vonnegut fan back then and reading a book by his son interested me. This book had a tremendous effect on me."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This book by Mark Vonnegut has been haunting my mind since I originally read it over 20 years ago. My mother was diagnosed as a schizophrenic when I was 2, which prompted my interest in the subject. She has since recovered (mostly) in spite of the medical community and their trial and error approach to the illness. I was taken by Mark's ability to communicate what being a schizophrenic was like and his ability to cope with the illness. Twenty years later I have been curious to re-read this book and see if it is as moving an experience now as it was to me then. Unfortunately, it is out of print and I am hopefully awaiting my copy from amazon.com!"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This book is excellent as everyone else has said..but what what most don't know is that Mark pulled himself together and has become one of the top 10 pediatricians in Boston. He was my children's pediatrician and now he is the doctor to my grandsons. He is an articulate, intelligent and multi talented man. And if you knew him you would see that he is not overshadowed by his father at all. He shines in his own right. His honesty and candor in this book gives it it's impact and reality. He is a wonderful author, a wonderful doctor and a wonderful man."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"What a valuable work this is! Unlike many hippie reports and reminiscences, it is clear and direct. The author conveys the horror of his disease, the joy (yes, joy!) of his disease, and the tenor of the times brilliantly. It took me back to the days when we'd put the dogs in the car and drive to Central America. I read a yellowed, battered ancient paperback lent reluctantly by a friend in British Columbia and now must send it back. I want my own copy--which I'll lend with care."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"A beautiful, terrifying memoir about one man's descent into mania and insanity. As the only son of a father who was a paranoid schizophrenic, who died before I got a chance to know him and understand his condition, Vonnegut's book answered many questions I've had for a long, long time. What the disease does to the diseased, the consequences it has on friends and family, social and cultural implications...Vonnegut approaches all these themes and ideas while maintaining a cohesive narrative that is both entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I came upon Mark Vonnegut's book during a summer of unemployment. I read Kerouac, Burroughs, Ginsberg, and all the first person accounts of Woodstock. I read Kurt Vonnegut, and in a lucky stroll through the Sci-fi section, I read Kilgore Trout's 'Venus on the Half Shell'. When I came upon Mark Vonnegut's book, Eden Express, I thought I was getting into a 'son-of' phase.Eden Express details the experiences of Mark Vonnegut as he comes to terms with a brain and a mind that no longer follow his dictates. It is a tale of hard lessons, filtered through expectation and dreams.A book of exploration, it ends on a note of healing; it encourages self determination with respect to treatment. It is a thoughtful examination of ability, hope, and healing.I sincerely hope Mr. Vonnegut reissues this book, and offers his impressions since his earliest struggles with mental illness.&quot;It is no measure of sanity to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society&quot; Krishna MurtiThank you Mark... and best wishes."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"The book very effectively captures the feeling of being schizophrenic (I think!), with rushes of overwhelming thoughts following from the most mundane of stimuli, and a loss of all sense of time. Being in the medical profession, I've had the opportunity to meet several schizophrenic patients, and I now feel like I have some modicum of understanding of how they must feel.The book also offers a fascinating insight into the '60s counterculture, in which the authors' friends enable his mental illness for months, defending it as a form of free thinking, until he's undeniably ill.But I had a hard time getting through the book. It's mercifully short, but after 200 pages of psychotic thinking, I couldn't make myself read the last 30. Understandably, the story basically goes around in circles -- initial illness --> recovery --> relapse --> mild recovery --> worse relapse. There isn't really any sense of progression.In some ways, it reminded me of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. Beautifully evocative of a certain era and subculture, but after ambling back and forth across the country a few times, I had had enough!"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I have read and re-read this book at least a dozen times over the years. A true masterpiece from a gifted writer. This autobiographical account of a young man's battle with madness will touch your heart and soul. I would love to meet Mark Vonnegut for an informal talk. Does anyone know how to reach him? Please let me know."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This book is amazing!! I read it as a senior in high school and the passage about grace was like a slap because I saw it, too. Now I'm a sophomore at the Newhouse School at SU, and I'm trying to find Mr. Vonnegut to see if he would let me interview him for the campus online magazine I write for, or even just meet him. If you know how I could get in touch with him or want to talk about Eden Express, float me an e-mail! Thanks."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"When I read it nearly 10 years ago in Germany, I fell in love with the writing, clear and with deep compassion for all the people that he came in contact with. His ability to tie in the overwhelming impulses of the schizophrenic to the everyday pressures we all experience is truly priceless. After reading it, I realised that others were wrestling with the same fears of failure, disappointment, and acceptance. Truly a wonderful book. Hopefully, Amazon.com can find a copy for me."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"One of the most moving books I've ever read. A must for any ex-hippie, hippie wanna-be, or anyone interested in American society of the 1960's and 1970's. Mark Vonnegut (yes, he is Kurt's son) describes growing up in 1960's counterculture, and what that culture can do to a confused young man. This book will make you think twice about yourself and your world."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"No kidding--in my early 20s madness courted, descended and moved in lock stock and kitchen sink for several difficult but very interesting and ultimately valuable years. I shoplifted this book out of a fine bookstore on the main street in Annapolis, MD (a stone throw from the handsome 18th century state capital building), and saw hope for a path out.Many other factors came into play, including of course the fact that health insurance used to actually pay for mental health treatment as decided upon by the patient/doctor. team. There was also plenty of other money and general resources including a stubbornly loving family and ultimately a real human being who also happened to be a shrink (a very rare cooincidence).Vonnegut took a similar ride and if you are too, or a loved one, friend or acquaintance may be, try to get 'em a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This was a very personal book, written by the man who was my pediatrician for 18 yrs. He had his first psychotic experience in his 20's and describes the details in exceptional detail, as well as how he begins to recover a normal life."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"Mark Vonnegut is the son of the famous author Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. In this autobiographical book, Mark chronicles his mental unraveling. Mark describes in unparelled detail his internal process as he drowns in the waves of schizophrenia. The realistic internal dialogue will have you experiencing the harrowing affect right along with Mark.This inspirational book brings to bear the awful burden of mental illness on both the sufferer and loved ones and how close each of us step to the border between sanity and insanity.Fortunately, for Mark, he has made a complete recovery and his triumph is the crowning achievement of this saga.This book will have you riveted to the page. Don't miss out on this roller coaster ride. (Be sure to fasten your seatbelt tightly!)"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I first read this book when it came out and at the time wondered how it was to be the son of the famous Kurt Vonnegut, and how being in the shadow all one's life couldn't be good for the development of his son.

I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to grasp the 1960's with all it's various shades and colors."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"&quot;~Unbelievable that this is out of print.

I have reread it at least 3 times, and recommended it to many friends. It is enlightening on both a pyschological and a human level. You feel both the times and the emotions of this man. I am compelled to find another copy to keep forever and I wouldn't mind having a long heart to heart with Mark himself. If you're out there.. can we do lunch?"},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"This is most likly the only book I have ever read that is comparable with the living master novelist Kurt Vonnegut. To bad it's the truth, he could have (and still might if he ever writes again) easily keep the legacey of his father alive."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I first read this book my junior year in college as a class text for a psych course in disorders. I wish all my psych texts were half this interesting! This is a personal account of what it's like to develop scizophrenia, go through treatment, recover, relapse, etc... My only criticism of this book is that I wish he had waited longer to write it and told more about his life since recovering. One other thing to note: this is a really funny book. If it weren't for all the heavy stuff in this book, it could easily be a comedy book.The thing about this book that makes the deepest impression on me is that even in his most wacked out, deeply scizophrenic episodes, he still gives you the impression that it's the rest of the world that's gone crazy and he's just floating along trying to keep his head above water.The author is the son of the famous Kurt Vonnegut, which he references occasionally in his book, but it's not a predominant theme by any means. I think part of the reason for that is that his dad wasn't famous until he was almost an adult and then had this &quot;son of a famous guy&quot; thing cast upon him just as he was trying to strike out on his own and make his own life.Anyhow, this is a must-read book, and is one of my favorites of all time."},{"Title":"Eden Express","review":"I came upon Mark Vonnegut's book during a summer of unemployment.

Her misadventures in Paris, prove challenging to those around her,and amusing to the reader. It's am amusing collage of seemimgly misplaced dialogue and eccentric characters, yet is easy to read and laugh with.(Note: Queneau is, I think, an underappreciated genius. You can find out more about him by looking up the book &quot;The OULIPO COMPENDIUM&quot; here at Amazon, which contains his extraordinary &quot;One-hundred-trillion sonnets.&quot; &quot;Oulipans: rats who build the labyrinth from which they plan to escape&quot; -- Raymond Queneau).Zazie is less of a labyrinth and more of a amusement park, a good introduction to this imaginative writer. Probably not for those easily offended (nor is &quot;Zazie&quot; herself), but a little treasure worth looking for."},{"Title":"Zazie dans le Metro - 4 Audio Compact Discs","review":"Like his hero Lewis Carroll, Raymond Queneau was a polyglot, and a mathematician with a love of patterns, forms and games. He wrote a study of dog language in Carroll's 'Sylvie and Bruno', and 'Zazie' is his update of Alice to the Parisian Wonderland of the late 1950s, although it is not clear whether Zazie is an anti-Alice, bringing chaos to a normal society, or whether she is a precocious, sensible, curious (if foul-mouthed) child faced with a blinkingly unstable universe: Zazie is notably passive in the book's final third, when the linguistic, philosophical, temporal, narrative, spatial and sexual dissolutions collapse into a frenzy of barmy physical violence.the book as a whole sees Rabelais and Diderot rewriting the Arabian Nights. Each chapter plays like a Ionesco drama, a sustained, rhythmic dialogue where the disparity between bizarre event and the disintegrating attempts of language to express it, creates a gap where logic contracts, explodes and comes back together in an hilarious anti-logic. Not only are the borders of dream and reality, plausibility and fantasy, role play and identity broken down, but Queneau's narrative procedures - at once Joycean in its plenitude, and startling in its gaping ellipses - further confuse the reader.'Zazie' is Queneau's most 'plausible' novel, in that much of its fun lies in its Parisian locales, and its comedy at the expense of romantic cliches about the city; but it is also a true Surrealist novel, both in breaking down the normality of the real, and in asserting that the only way you can get what you want is to dream."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Many inspirational pieces...Also, some technical info that proved helpful.

There is more eye candy than is possible to comprehend in a single sitting - and the ideas put forth by the artists in the book are nothing short of amazing. Ms Perrella had a stroke of genius with this book - and the pure talent she has is showcased beautifully in Alphabetica. The other artists in the book stand on their own, adding to the inspirational factor - each artist produces fascinating work. The interplay between each contributor is awesome - although each work is interesting and makes you want to grab your supplies, the pieces play well together - there is not one single instance where the pieces are competing for the spotlight. There is definitely something to be learned from every page of this great book - whether you are a novice artist, or find yourself further along on the experience ladder. Alphabetica is a book you'll refer to time and again - as much for technique ideas as inspiration. I'm definitely a fan of Ms Perrella's after reading this book - she fills the roll as writer very well, and as artist with raw excellence.

Not every artist's style appealed to me but I can appreciate their processes, their techniques, and the way their individual works fit into the whole.Not a how-to book, but full of ideas.

Perrella also details at least a dozen techniques to transfer both black &white and color images in a way that's clear and concise. I was fascinated with the studio exercise on color and the chapter on surfaces and materials. The emphasis is on using what you have. The section profiling the studio essentials and influences of each artist is another piece to savor, it's like a personal studio tour and a chat with the artist. Each chapter is filled with inspiring quotations and there is a starting place for everyone, whatever your artistic background.

Once I got it, I recommended it in a lot of the art related Yahoo groups that I run or belong to actively. I have all of her books and have not been disappointed yet. I steer away from technique books now, but this one is more than a technique book. Even though some technique is given, I liked it for its variety and creativity. I was able to glean a lot of ideas from it for me to try with future projects. I love to use metals in my art and there was a lot of that in there. I also liked that it did not cater to the ever popular distress/vintage winged fairy theme. You could tell each artist's style come through the pages. I especially liked that there were so many different mediums shown throughout the book. I enjoyed the little stories that went with each piece of art. This is definitely not a newbie technique book. This is a book where even experienced artists well entrenched in their style can get a few ideas."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Lynne managed to do it again...with her dazzling second book she inspired me to pick up my art materials and get to work! The book is beautiful, and there are some new ideas to get your creative juices flowing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the book was just a tad repetitive of the first one (a lot of the same artists using the same techniques giving the book the same general feel)."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"This is not a book for people who don't want to be messy. This is a book about digging into your art supplies and learning what they are for and learning the ones you love to use.This book is truly wonderful in that it gives examples of top-in-their-field artist examples, shows many different styles of ORIGINAL work, tells the steps the artists used to get there, gives \\"Try This\\" ideas to get your wheels turning and finally, gives a small glimpse into the artist's studios and their lists of who inspires them.This book does assume you have some knowledege of artistic supplies already. It does not give step-by-step instructions on \\"how to\\" do a journal page. It does discuss gesso, acrylic paints, dimensional items and so much creativity it is incredible. The \\"Try This\\" segments run throughout the book and give easy to find items and outlines for you and your creativity to explore yourself and your own style of work.Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Just when I think I've seen everything, along comes a fabulous book that's full of great techniques and ideas.

You couldn't ask for anything better in this form of art. AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Perella and Pals ought to have been the title of this book, as it 'showcases' the work of said artist and her chums. It gives virtually no creative guide to anyone that I can imagine, no hint of the process that leads to any of the finished work, and some of the work is plainly terrible. An awful lot of what passes as mixed media or altered art these days is just crap that someone throws together, distresses a little and puts some stupid inspirational word to ('dream', 'friends', 'voyage' - you *know* the rubbish I mean), and I am afraid that a lot of the work in this book falls into that category. I bought the book, I read it, then re-read it, hoping to see something jewel-like that I'd missed the first time - I think I even shook the book in case something might fall out. Alas."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"a second book is always a scary endeavor, especially with the first book being such a success. as the date approached for ms. perrella's new book to be released, the excitement of anticipation began. this book is awesome! a fine follow-up for the first book and more indepth information for those using her books as learning tools. i can hardly wait for book number 3! way to go!!"},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"I collect a lot of books as an artist because I like to have multiple avenues of inspiration around me when I'm creating. This book definitely has many ideas but my one problem with it is that it's not that well organized. It covers each letter in the alphabet, like the title suggests, but jumps around, is not sequential, and the connections to each letter are not predictable so you really have to look through the whole book to find each idea. Letters for key words are repeated throughout the book...though the ideas are all original. For example: B is for buckle; B is for blocks; B is for brainstorming...etc.For a quick reference however, it's great. Nice imagery and exemplars, with some inspirational ideas. If you are a book artist looking for more ways to alter and express your ideas, this is a great resource. If you are an artist looking to enhance your journals...this is a great book. If you are a teacher, this is also a great resource.The back end of the book has 27 pages of workshops with detailed ideas. Here are some examples: Faux & Ancient Surfaces; Transparencies; Attachments; Building a Surface with Patterning; Metal Tape and Altered Images; Creating with Recycled Papers; Working Intuitively.Each workshop page has an inspirational related quote, what to try, how to get started, tips, creating, a list of influences/exemplary artists, and studio essentials- a list of materials needed to complete this workshop."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"I first heard of this book in the 14th Issue of The Gleaner Art Zine (TheGleaner@aol.com), and anxiously awaited it's January release as I really admire Lynn's work. Once it became available, I ordered it right away! It was well worth the wait -- I was BLOWN away by the creativity and resourcefulness of all of the contributing artists. The author's voice is delivered in a conversational tone, and the reader is prompted, throughout, to 'Try This' (highlighted suggestions for approaching various projects and techniques).This may well be the best reference/source of inspiration I have on my art bookshelf! It is awesome, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the altered arts."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"If you've seen \\"True Colors\\" or read \\"Artist's Books and Journals\\", you've basically already viewed this book. Pretty much the same artists are featured in all these books. However,I did like the section at the back about the artists \\"must-haves\\" in their studios - by far, the best part of this book.Lynne Perella is excellent at what she does, but she would be better if her books weren't so much alike. Hopefully, she will feature new artists in her next book."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Lynne continues to be an inspiration of epic proportions. She somehow manages to take ordinary, every-day items and turn them into intricate, layered, and stunning works of art. This book is heavy on the eye candy, with plenty of other talented artists thrown into the mix. For the beginner or experienced collage/book artist, this book is sure to provide endless inspiration. Lynne's work is so detailed, it takes many views to absorb it all, and each look reveals new details. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"The new book, ALPHABETICA by Lynne Perrella is beautiful. Each time a work that looks this clean, this well crafted, this undumb and elegant is successfully published it changes the face of alternative art for the better... toward credible, toward competitive (in the viable and valued sense), toward recognition and worth. As a working artist, I appreciate how this clear and crisp presentation imparts it's message without sacrificing energy or excitement. Lynne is a dynamic and commanding artist, a great collaborator and a true visionary. Once again she has brought together a wonderful mix of talent showcasing everyone in their very best light...a must have for your inspiration library.

The photos are great - I could almost feel the texture on the original artwork. There is an endless number of ideas and techniques that can be applied into many mixed media projects. This book will keep me inspired for a long time."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"This book is inspirational. It is like the art version of Pride and Prejudice, if you open it to any page you must delve further. I actually have two copies: one in the studio, and (I hate to say it) one in the bathroom--what can I say ideas strike at the oddest times.I can look at it daily and read something new, get a new idea, or be inspired visually by something I could swear I had never seen before (yet I know I must have).Love! Love! Love this book! Buy it! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"I am an avid journaler and a beginner in scrapbooking and decided to try out Lynne Perrela's newest book. I must say that I was not dissappointed. Not only is the book filled with beautiful, unique and personla art, it has art from many different artists, therefore, unlike some other altered art and scrapbooking books, you dont get bored with seeing just one style.This is not a How-to book but it is very inspiring. Just the beautiful pictures did it for me. However, as an added treat, it also contains fun and useful \\"try this\\" tips. And each of the collaborating artists then have two pages dedicated to them towards the end of the book and they give their own personal tips.This book was not nearly as stiff as the Scapbooking Encyclopedia (Creating Keepsakes), or as limited as as The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery (Karen Michel).All in all a beautiful, fun and creatively inspiring book."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Lynne Perrella is a prolific mixed media artist. Her work is beautiful, and her new book, alphabetica, is simply gorgeous.One of the things I love about Lynne is her collaborative spirit. She seems to thrive when she is making art with others, which is one of the reasons she is also a brilliant teacher. I found some of my favorite artists through Lynne's book True Colors, and I was thrilled to see new projects by some familiar faces in Alphabetica. Check out Lesley Riley's book cover (pg. 30) where she used an antique spelling wheel and Linn Jacobs birds (pg. 103).The Masters artists workshop section of the book is chock-full of great tips. I had to play with Karen Michel's metal tape tips immediately after reading the book. I also really enjoyed Teesha Moore's essay on trusting oneself and one's ability to make art.If you have True Colors in your bookshelf, you should most definitely get Alphabetica. You won't be dissapointed. This is one of those books that I will return to for inspiration when I am having one of those art days where nothing seems to be coming together."},{"Title":"Alphabetica: An A-Z Creativity Guide for Collage and Book Artists (Quarry Book S.)","review":"Avidly waiting to read Lynne's follow-up, I was NOT disappointed! This book fairly BURSTS with colour and content.The wealth of photographs, tips and jump-starting information from some of our favourite paper and textile artists had me itching to get at the paint, fabric and threads. The workshop section was a bonus, with each 'collaborator' freely giving of her material and experience.One reviewer found it repetative, but I thought it actually complemented Lynne's first book, and has pushed me to experiment and look beyond my usual practice. Already a firm favourite frequently referred to."},{"Title":"Metaphoric Mind: A Celebration of Creative Consciousness","review":"The author introduces and explores the concept of &quot;the Metaphoric Mind.&quot; He admittedly does not originate much of the thought in this book, but rather collects it from a variety of sources and then adds his own opinion to it. Still, it is clear that the author is making an additional contribution of his own. In a nutshell, the metaphoric mind is the sort of intuitive, preconscious, &quot;right brained&quot; counterpart to our rationale, logical, &quot;left brain.&quot; Some of the material is dated (see Robert Ornstein's _The_Right_Mind_) in terms of the physiological basis for the metaphoric mind. Nevertheless, the concept holds today and the most valuable part of the book, the case for recognition of the metaphoric mind as the necessary and appropriate counterpart to the rationale mind, is intact. All-in-all a thought provoking book which should be of special interest to anyone pursing the topics of Zen, Right/Left Mindedness and Creativity.Table of Contents: 1. In the Beginning2. The Rational Side of Metaphor 3. Metaphors of Cycle and Line 4. Rational Mindscapes 5. Shadows of Balance 6. The Gift of Beginning 7. Metaphoric Mindscapes 8. A Short Editorial 9.

My training is in art and psychology, and I was developing a speciality in sand tray therapy with children. In contradistinction to the last review I found this text to be a wonderful study demonstrating the importance of play in the process of learning. I still use several slides photographed from the book when I teach about the process of play therapy and sandplay therapy. Most children intuitively learn about the world in a series of excursions from right brain knowing in the process of play to left brain comprehension and verbalization.

This and the book, Drawing on the Left Side of the Brain, influenced my thinking on consciousness, on the logical vs. the holistic in our thinking. It is a thought provoking book, non-religious, which leans towards the nature, Zen, in finding innner peace, in finding the whole from the fragments. It is a good commentary on the way our society has come to focus on the logical, measurable, rather than the higher pursuits of thinking and the peaceful/free things of life, such as the cover illustrates.I enjoyed the book, it helped me think more deeply about our present society and it inadequacies, and at the same time to place higher value on develpoing the mind in the intuitive and holistic. I would recommend it as a research book for college students, or for anyone trying to break free from OCD type of thinking."},{"Title":"Metaphoric Mind: A Celebration of Creative Consciousness","review":"and I did not find one sentence that made much sense at all!Not one.It's a Miss Macintosh, My Darling for the psychology set.Kudos to the author on getting this published."},{"Title":"Addie (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Jack Hunter is known for his adventure fiction, but this novel shows a true literary genius that goes beyond the genre."},{"Title":"Cessna Warbirds: A Detailed and Personal History of Cessna's Involvement in the Armed Forces","review":"I have waited a lifetime for someone to come forward with the dedication to Cessna Aircraft's military history. I am looking forward to reading in depth about Cessna's different models. Walt Shiel was a pilot, I was a mechanic, we were both involved, at different times, with the airplane that took fuel and converted it to noise. Long loved by the people who worked on and flew them, I am referring to the Cessna T-37. Walt has done an excellent job in preparing this book. Long past due, Cessna deserves the credit due its involvement with all phases of pilot and navigation training. Without Cessna, there would be no military pilots to fly the warbirds that often take all of the credit. And Walt derserves the credit for bringing this to light. I will cherish and use his book. Thank You Walt"},{"Title":"Cessna Warbirds: A Detailed and Personal History of Cessna's Involvement in the Armed Forces","review":"Cessna Warbirds : A Detailed and Personal History of Cessna's Involvement in the Armed Forces by Walt Shiel is a great book detailing the military application of Cessna aircraft, including one Cessna helicopter. Cessna Warbirds is a pleasant blend of hard fact and personal anecdotes from the author and numerous military pilots interviewed while writing this book. It was fun to read about how the same planes I have flown in civilian aviation were used in military applications. It was also interesting to see how the planes were altered to fit their intended service.Shiel's writing is clear and his anecdotes are relevant and, when appropriate, thoroughly amusing making what could have been a dry list of figures a very human story that's easy to relate to. Because Cessna Warbirds contains specifications and histories for each Cessna aircraft used in a military fashion this book is a great reference source as well. It is obvious to anyone who has read either this book or any of Sheil's many articles on military aviation that he is a thorough researcher who is immersed in his subject. Reading the author's bio, I can think of few people who are better qualified to write this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough to anybody who is interested in aviation."},{"Title":"Cessna Warbirds: A Detailed and Personal History of Cessna's Involvement in the Armed Forces","review":"Shamefully, I passed on picking up Cessna Warbirds when it first appeared, and only purchased it recently when the price hit bargain basement levels! This is the best single source reference on military Cessnas. While some aircraft have been given more detailed coverage elsewhere (such as the T/A-37 and O-1), it's great to see information in print on types such as the O-2, U-3 and T-41.The first hand accounts make for an interesting read, and a different perspective than most titles in this genre. The book has plenty of detail - I love the note from the O-2B manual advising pilots to carry spare D-cell batteries for the onboard tape recorder, used to broadcast propaganda. Those looking for extensive photos may be disappointed - while the book is well illustrated, the photo reproduction is not great. The photo captions suffer from a number of errors, for example a RoKAF O-1 is labelled as belonging to Nationalist China; however this does not detract from the overall quality of the book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cessna Warbirds: A Detailed and Personal History of Cessna's Involvement in the Armed Forces","review":"Walt did a very good job of making &quot;Cessna Warbirds&quot; a very readable,fact filled and enjoyable book to own.I'm doing two Web Pages about the T-50 Bobcat and Sky King and found this book very helpfull.The detail and many mostly unknown facts about the earlier T-50 were a great help to my research.The book will recieve an honored place on my shelf for future referance.

You will also find out what these planes fly like, what characteristics make them ideally suitable for the tasks they have been assigned, and what characteristics they have that can bite you.The book is made particularly entertaining by the inclusion of a number of 'war stories', many of which are quite amusing.All in all the book was most informative, while being an enjoyable read.Thanks to Walt Shiel for giving us the benefit of his experience and knowledge, combined with his own writing style to make an emminently readable book.

The essays chosen for inclusion are thoughtful and varied. Just take a look through the table of contents and you'll understand its breadth. Its first chapter pays homage to some classical thinkers and their works. Its a respectful gesture that proves the enduring importance of works like The Republic, written in another context and before the style of modern academia came into its own. The next chapters deal with how we define and classify literature. More focused segments on the components of literature itself follow. The collection manages to maintain coherence and focus, so you feel the works were chosen intentionally. Best of all, the texts are condensed to be more focused and straightforward. It's a gift to be able to actually get through a piece in one sitting. The end result is that you can cover a variety of subjects and navigate adjacencies as you please. The goal of philosophy instruction, as I see it, should be to encourage exploration. This book allow that, meanwhile giving students a working knowledge of notable theorists and their works.It's also a rather significant volume, with a great deal of different texts. I could see it being used as a catch-all reference for beginning and intermediate students of the field. It gives you the foundation you need to advance to more specialized books related to your interest or academic focus. Since it's clearly marketed as an anthology, I am not going to insult the editors by pointing out minutia I would have liked to seen included. Frankly, I am nowhere near the level of expertise necessary to do so. I would prefer a general overview to obscure and narrowly-targeted pieces that were frankly never intended for mass audiences, and woud lose their intricacy if given a fleeting treatment.The font is readable and definitely aided by the two-column layout. Once again, the presentational approach foregrounds the content and gives it the attention it deserves. The book, because of its readability and core value, has deepened my interest in the field. I see reason for average people - especially those who value the arts in their daily lives - to pick this one up. It's thorough and comprehensive. It begs important questions about fiction, characterization, criticism, and more. Take a look, and think critically about what you read - in this volume, and everywhere else."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Literature: Contemporary and Classic Readings - An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)","review":"The size of this book and the subtitle give the impression that this book covers the whole field.

See \\"A Book Worth Reading\\" for a different and systematic approach to this new branch of philosophy.The articles in this anthology are almost all by philosophers who have only a passing knowledge of literature. The results are sophistic and at time sophomoric.Missing also are some famous contributions to the field, such as Sartre's What is Literature? a book which raises some serious problems for literature.

The author as well as other poets were taken to court on the subject matter of the poem was obscene, which it was latter ruled not to be.Many will tell you in todays world that Ginsberg as well as all the other Beat poets were overrated and hyped up to be something that they really were not, well this is all a matter of opinion but that opinion is just wrong.Regardless of whether the beats were 'hyped' and if this poem had not been taken to court there is no way it would have been this popular but that does not howeve mean that it would be any less powerful and well written.So in the end you must read Ginsberg for your self and form your own opinion.

What I really hated was the communist paranoia going around and the Joseph McCarthy inspired communist witch hunts which put a lot of innocent people in jail and made people leave the country by exiling themselves(the Great Charles Chaplin). The racism and the segregation made me sick.Just about the only good thing going on in that decade was the Jazz scene-Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Gerry Mulligan/Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Clifford Brown and Max Roach, and Art Blakey. Little did I know, the beats hated the scene of the 50's also. They rejected the conformity and the tight conservative grip on society in that decade. Jack Kerouac especially, they were avid jazz listeners and didn't like where the United States was going at that time-nowhere-just like today, sadly.I promise this book will be an interesting experience for you and you will get a very entertaining history lesson."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"When I first read this book in high school, I found it both disturbing and profane. Now I still do, but it's in a much better way....Ginsberg came of age in a time of both terror and hypocrasy. During the Presidency of Eisenhower, we were edging toward hot war with the Soviets and on our own people. Kids were just finding psychoactives for the first time-- they were just learning to bend their minds and change their souls. Americans were just hearing of Louis-Ferdinand Celine and Andre Gide and Oswald Spengler and all of the other literary people who can be heard in the words of Ginsberg....And he processed them (though some of them now would seem more high culture than him) and came up with the knowing, tortured voice of a generation. A voice that is not so different from the voice of my generation-- one of trouble, angst, unhesistancy, and spiritual malaise. Whereas he saw his generation starving, hysterical, naked in a mental institution, we do not even have the clothes to care so much....However old you are, read this book. It will make you think. Read Gregory Corso too.... he was wonderful but has been forgotten...."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"This work is more than a poem, it is prophecy in the truest sense of the word, a &quot;forth-telling.&quot; It is a call to action and to live life with our eyes wide open. The ferment that this poem has started began with the Beats and continues on to our own time. So many poets, writers, and artists owe so much to Ginsburg and this shot that he fired. He inspired the writers of the Beat Generation on up to writers of our own day (I am thinking here of Geoffrey B.

It is probably the easiest to read but On the Road and Naked Lunch are the perfect places to continue your Beatnik adventure.

The famous opening line, \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked...\\" sets off a force of vivid description and incredible depth. Howl continues through the devious Moloch, to rest in Rockland where his love laid. A Supermarket in California is sweet understanding, peaceful and simple in public. In the other poems live the Sun's power, life exposed in the presense of dead flowers and the baggage of life. In Song, the most gorgeous of the collection, love's force is bowed down to.

However, no matter what its immediate influence on my generation it nevertheless spoke to me more than any other modern poem since reading T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland back in high school.In retrospect I would pay a very high price to have been able to be there in San Franscisco in that garage in 1956 sipping a little wine and listening to the great yawlp. And Howl is very definitely a poem to be listened to and only read later to try to figure out what all the symbols mean. Walt Whitman finally had company as Ginsberg spoke in one song the anguish that his generation was feeling about the turn industrial society had taken.On a recent re-reading I found it rather funny that the scandal that surrounded publication was such a big deal with most of the language and references to sex, including homosexual sex now rather commonplace and unremarkably. Finally, does anybody feel as I do that if one did not know that the poem was written over 50 years ago that that it could have been written about today's technologicaly-driven society. Timeless, in short just like Whitman."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Allen Ginsberg's poem &quot;America&quot; in the Howl collection is excellent. Ginsberg has been called the best post-1945 poet in America. I think that is certainly true of his poetry from the 1950s and '60s, if not later. It's funny that &quot;Howl&quot; was called obscene when first published and such a big fuss was made about it--drawn-out trial, etc. It really is one of the great works of poetry of the 20th century, in the same way that Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is of the previous century. What Ginsberg did with language was something radical, refreshing, hip and new, and his messages had great appeal to those disgusted with the Establishment and with various forms of social injustice. As you read Ginsberg, some of his poetical phrases can be hard to decipher, but for every obscure line the poem is often saved by the next line which is beautiful and crystal-clear. What he writes about in &quot;Howl&quot; is somewhat of a different world from ours, physically--a world of Dharma bums, hipsters, Jazz, Buddhism, Dadaism, Communism, etc... but emotionally, what he writes is very relevent to our times because his work is an attack on America's materialism and social complacency.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;"},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Ginsberg, an American icon of poetry, delivers his full capacity in this short collection of poems. &quot;A Supermarket in California&quot; portrays a place where famous poets of past generations are shopping in convenience as they alienate Ginsberg and each other in their yielding to technology and progress.HOWL is full of unrealized cravings for something that never came. Ginsberg relates to his reader that instead of satisfaction at ideals being realized, he must find contentment merely in his own &quot;nakedness.&quot;It's a stellar glimpse into a genius of words that has come through our times.

I've read Howl (or got 2/3 of the way through it) a couple of times without really understanding it or enjoying it.I've heard it recited on stage a couple of times by Jean & John Waggoner's City Lights Review, and even saw/heard Allen Ginsberg himself perform it at Cheltenham Literary Festival circa about 1992. And while appreciating the passion of these live readings and recognising a few references: \\"Neal Cassady cocksman...\\" etc. I didn't really get it. I knew that two very intelligent friends of mine got a big buzz out of it, so knew I must be missing something.So when I got Allen Ginsberg 'Howl & Other Poems' CD and seeing that Howl wasthe first track on it, I put it on my player, lay on the bed, closed my eyes, settled down and listened. Through Allen's distinctive matter-of-fact voice the poem unfolded, revealing itself to me. It was the same story as Jack Kerouac's On the Road (correct me if I'm wrong) containing nearly all the same characters and a few others, yet told in impressionistic verse, instead of Jack's long prose poem. A take on the same era/scene/ emotion but from a different angle.It's the paean of the underdog, concentrate: wonderful imagery. Let Allen lead you around the scene and show you that time, incident by pictured incident. As he reads it see it on the inside of your eyelids. You're back there with him. He describes Neal Cassady and his love-making escapades perfectly, sums up the life events of many 1940's beatniks to be repeated by the same crashes and compromises of 1960's hippies. Lives and dreams crushed by the materialistic grey morning commonsense it's-always been-this-way boulder of inevitability, learning ways to grease their bodies so they slide around the boulder and feel less its weight.If you've read On the Road three times and would like to take the trip again in a different seat in the car, try Allen's.

With haunting phrases and cadences influenced by sources as disparate as Hebrew liturgy and ad copy, Ginsburg evokes the joy and despair of a affluent Post-World-War-II decade lived in the shadow of the Bomb and Eisenhower's grim military-industrial complex. 'Beat' writing is a unique, experimental genre which transcends the strictures of contemporary academic style and content, dealing forthrightly with drug abuse, homosexuality, and other taboo subjects of the time. Allen Ginsburg and his creative associates were the stellar grass-roots poets of their generation, and deserve a careful reading both for enjoyment and understanding of an important time of transition in American society.

Ginsberg's views on America are still considered unorthodox and radical, but his observations both in the Hedonistic underground in the Baby Boomer-Leave It To Beaver 1950s, and his mentally ill friend Carl Solomon are as poignant as any poem written now, and represent a diminished sense of innocence in American culture, which predated feminism, the sexual revolution, AIDS, Reaganomics, ENRON, and even the full blown massacre of the Vietnam War.

It is one of the most remarkable products of the Beat generation, possesing the all-encompassing sprawl of Whitman and the raw cultural reflection of Morrison whil creating its own unique voice. It is a dynamic, raw, and beautiful representation of America, stuffed with discord, sweetness and the gorgeous raucous of Americn culture. It is a poetic counterpart to Keroac's narrative and a modern rendition of Whitman's &quot;Song of Myself&quot; as it bustles the reader on a fantastic journey accross America, diggin in crevices, moving through city streets and sitting on kitchen counters.It sings, in free verse, the soul of America."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Before starting, allow me to mention the fact that I am reviewing solely the poem \\"Howl\\" in Howl and Other Poems.I read \\"Howl\\" this summer as a 16 year old and it changed my outlook on the world. As far as enjoying the poem I was entirely too confused by it the first time I read it to actually enjoy it; so let me start by giving the reader of this and prospective buyer of Howl and other Poems the advice to read \\"Howl\\" several times before forming a concrete opinion about it. There is really nothing in \\"Howl\\" that I dislike but there are many stanzas in which I cannot fully appreciate the writing because I do not understand all of it. The main strength of Ginsberg's poem is to expand the mind of the reader, even if that means confusing the reader. Take for example the stanza:who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue, amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,an absolutely mind boggling sentence, attacking the areas of fashion and advertising and the powers of editors in newspapers. Stanzas like that are why I enjoy this poem, it is a critique of the time that Ginsberg lived in and allows one to see parallels in the current day and age."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; is a raging, sleepy, vibrant, dirty and phosporescent, as it captures the grime, the delight and the sway of American life. It is a gripping piece that thrusts the reader into the heat of the city, the purr of the suburbs and the spray of popular culture. It is one of the most remarkable products of the beat generation, possesing the all-encompasing sprawl of Walt Whitman and the raw reflection of Toni Morrison while creating its own unique voice.

While Howl does reach the soul, I find that Ginsberg's poems America, Sunflower Sutra, and A Supermarket in California are much more effective this and a lot less annoying to read. I found myself plugging away through Howl because it got redundant and boring. The other poems are fresh and more personal than Howl. Howl is a great poem and it is easy to see how it receives so much acclaim, but as a fan of Ginsberg's work, I find that Howl pales in comparison to Ginsberg's America. By all means, purchase this book, but don't buy it with the expectation that Howl is the best poem in there, because it isn't."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Ginsberg's poems are electric, alive, divine. They make everything burn. &quot;Howl&quot; is a bird that flies, a maggot that wriggles and sickens the reader, a slick fish who gleams in clear water sunlight. It is, in a way, one of the most beautiful love poems in the English language. Another poem in the collection, &quot;A Supermarket in California,&quot; is my personal favorite. To me, it is about the love of one writer for another, the passing down of a legacy, and the burden of passing (and sometimes the failure to pass) that legacy on. If you have felt this way about any artist, you will feel in this poem a kindred spirit. Even the introduction to Ginsberg's poems is glorious -- William Carlos Williams writes something so poetic, so reverential, so appreciative, so breathtaking -- it should be the envy of all who have ever had to (or wil ever have to) write about a piece of literature. Read this book from cover-to-cover. Carry it with you, if you are so inclined. Open it to a random page, and inhale, and read. You will feel like dancing, like painting, like screaming, like laughing, like cursing, like saying &quot;I love you,&quot; like killing yourself, like inventing names and colors. THIS IS LIFE!"},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"HOWL defies comparison with anything. Ginsberg cracks open the mind of America--while riding on an hallucinogenic roller coaster--and takes a studied look inside. The style is incredible, pyrotechnical, it transcends words themselves, taking on the characteristics of a hieroglyph. Using all elements of the profane, he creates something holy. Should be required reading in all bars, bowling alleys and elementary schools."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Easily one of the best book of poems to hit the scene in the mid-50's. To really get a good feel of Howl and some the other poems in this collection I encourage you to listen to recordings of Ginsberg reading the poems.

That Allen Ginsberg's Howl is one of the finest American poems of the second half of the twentieth century may be a matter of opinion (though it is my opinion), but that it was the most important is simply a matter of fact, and this modest black-and-white cover City Lights edition, with a selection of wonderful shorter poems besides Howl and a classic introduction by W. C. Williams, has for half a century now been riding around in the back jeans pockets of students, drifters, and hipsters. The reviews here and in innumerable other sources will give you a good idea of what the poem is like, so I'll only add that anyone interested in modern American poetry, literature, or society should have a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Looking for one book, I found this slender volume that I believe I bought at the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco more than 30 years ago. I haven't thought of Ginsberg much--he's not among those poets I'll pick up now and again. However, as nostalgia for the '60s is gathering with the force of a tsunami, I've been seeing more and more photographs of the man in the company of this or that celebrated individual.One could be kind and call him the \\"Beat Zelig,\\" or unkind, and judge him as a committed careerist. I met him a few times in the '80s and early '90s, never liked him or took him seriously. Nevertheless, as I had the book in my hands, I thought I'd read \\"Howl\\" and its companion pieces and see if I came away thinking more highly of the man, his craft and his vision.My short review: \\"Howl\\" is a little overwrought and self regarding. It is a work by a man who knew what he was doing, which while industrious is not particularly poetic. Ginsberg has less Blake or Whitman in him than a hip Robert Frost, by which I means he wants to be both accessible and popular. Read \\"America\\" and you'll understand what I mean by this comparison. It's not a bad poem but utterly contrived.Writing this, I'm happy to concede that the poems \\"A Supermarket in California\\" and \\"In the Baggage Room at Greyhound\\" are excellent, really gems, and deserve to be read today. These poems have something important to say, and say it beautifully, unlike \\"Howl\\" which seems a self-conscious \\"Song of Myself\\" addressed to America's post war, increasingly disaffected, youth. In the end, more a Yawn than a Howl."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Howl\\" was probably the dividing line between two Americas, two generations, two sexualities, two cultures. He was of course indicted and arrested and this poem barred from publication - of course again making it sell a lot more copies eventually - but in a way he was America's first great modern poet. The first line became a sort of countercultural national mantra:\\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked\\"\\"Howl\\" presents a view of contemporary society, placing a source of human woe within human consciousness and perception. In his poem, Ginsberg uses the word \\"Moloch,\\" for the condition of the mind. The narrator declares\\" Mental Moloch!\\"... Moloch who name is the Mind!\\" According to Ginsberg, we are born in a state of \\"natural ecstasy\\" but Moloch \\"enter's the soul early\\". He pushes for an emergence from the belly of \\"Moloch,\\" or the monster of corrupt institutions that devours us, \\"bashe[s]\\" and eats \\"up our brains and imaginations.\\"One of my favorite poems of all time and an absolute must read."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"This is an amazing book.I wrote a small review here:[...]The book is a compound of marvellous poems written by one of my favourite Beat Generation writers."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"In February 2012, the book discussion group at the LGBT Center in NYC had a large-ish group, many of whom had read the poem before and were re-reading it after a couple of years, but many of whom were reading it for the first time. Even those who had just read it the day of the meeting we able to comment on its surreal and powerful effect.Many readers thought that \\"Howl\\" was dark and disturbing, the hallucinations were too strong and too drug induced. But others thought that (as Ginsberg intended) \\"Howl\\" is an ultimately uplifting poem, full of praise for the youth who were its market and who would carry the poem into the future and make it as famous as it is.Some of the readers had a \\"facsimile\\" edition showing the careful and multiple edits that Ginsberg made to bring the spontaneous-seeming poem to life. A few others had done research and realized that all the events of the poem (especially those in Part I) were based on real events: Ginsberg in a mental institution, Jack Kerouac driving across country, Carl Soloman (to whom the poem is dedicated) introducing Ginsberg to a rich full life both in the mental institution, lovers and sex and drugs and poetry readings and visions and explicit gay sex (in 1955! more than a decade before Stonewall! !) and catalogs of people and events (like Walt Whitman) and a world of knowledge and mystic thought (like T.S. Eliot).But the highlight of the meeting was Joan, a 93-year-old resident of the village and poet who knew Ginsberg (\\"the sweetest man I ever met\\") and Kerouac (\\"what a drunk\\") and told us stories of her meetings with all the beat poets. Wow! I was blown away. She was a major surprise, completely entertaining, and was able to point out a couple of things that only a contemporary of Ginsberg know: In 1955, the horrors of the Holocaust were still coming to light. Ginsberg, as a non-soldier and as a Jewish author, was overwhelmed by the stories that were emerging. Some of these images made it into \\"Howl.\\" And the H Bomb was still very real and an overwhelming threat in 1955. The image of the bomb threads its way through the poem in ways that may not be immediately obvious to contemporary readers.More on Ginsberg-friend Joan: Interview with a Poet: [...]This was an amazing meeting where EVERYONE learned something powerful about the beat poets and the area around The Center in the 1950s."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Ginsberg is both tragic and dynamic, a lyrical genius, con man extraordinaire, and probably the single greatest influence on American poetical voice since Whitman.

Both of these statements are true, in my opinion. The only beat poet who comes close is Gregory Corso, though they were poets with completely different styles, making them difficult to compare. Howl is extremely poetic and artistic, but in a way that envelops and expresses thoughts at a basic human level. The style is raw, loud, cacephonic, even vulgar in a good way because it is real. As you read Howl, you see and feel the joy, pain, and anger of humans living in the modern world, as they struggle through the crowd and the buildings and the machinery that make a this world operate. Howl is real, human, raw, and any number of other adjectives that are not necessary, because the message comes through with a serious reading of the poem.

Eliot's \\"The Wasteland\\" bringing up a close second. With Howl, Ginsberg totally reinvented the way poetry was written, and you can clearly see this influence in the slam poets of today. Howl is both raw and reserved, for while it punches you in the face with graphic detail it holds back key emotional points that leave one questioning. This is a very emotional poem, but these emotional points that I speak of are left vague for a very important reason: so that every single reader draws their own conclusions and so the reader is forced to bring more of themselves into the poem. Like \\"The Wasteland\\", Howl is not a poem you can easily read in emotional detachment; for, if you do, you miss the key elements of the poem. But, if you are searching for a poem that will first drag you to the lowest of the low and then, gradually, slowly but surely, bring you back up to where you can finally see daylight again, this is the poem for you. It is a sad poem, but it is also a poem that has the ability to take a sufficiently imaginative person from the depths of suicidal depression (which I know) and bring them back to where they are able to function as some kind of human being again.In short, this poem gets a bad rap, but it is essentially optimistic, although it starts off from a pessimistic viewpoint. If you look, the beauty is there; but if you approach it with preconceived judgments, you will most certainly not see the poem's bright side."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Don't get me wrong.

I 'absolutely' consider his oratory style of delivery and poetic verse and style amazing and brilliant and so very very entertaining and inspiring.. but the 'greatest' epic poem or poet of his century I just can't agree with. Gary Snyder made such an impact with introducing the marriage of Zen and the Orient into modern poetry style of his day (as Vincent vanGogh and Gauguin did in painting in the Expressionest era in painting/art), and Gary's poems of the passing of a day's events are so brilliant and open and revealing, and Jack Kerouac's style and impact, and Ferlinghetti's brilliance stemming from such a variety of different drugs...

But we actually have reverted, we actually believe that it was 'only' Russians or Chinese or Cubans or the Germans of WWII who were lied to or not told the truths by their governments whether led by Political Action Groups, Special Interest, drug companies, oil companies, insurance companies, etc. The rending of the veil of sleepiness of being 'content' socially is what Howl is all about, the 'rage' against that as we should be enraged against the last moment of breath to deaths' face as deat come to take us to the next realm.

A true visionary like Blake. *Howl and Other Poems* is his best work--his equivalent of the *Songs of Innocence and Experience* More than just a poet, of course, he is also a mystic and prophet. He sees the truth behind the surface. The beauty behind the pain of America's idealistic outcasts of his generation as they go &quot;mad&quot; from having seen to much and hoped for too much and pushed things too far. The ugliness and desparation that hide behind the nice orderly facade of everyday life. Ginsberg's poetry can express the most absolute dispair (the &quot;Moloch&quot; section of &quot;Howl&quot; still feels like a close brush with death even though I've read it hundreds of times), but he can also express such amzaing spiritual joy. In this regard he is more like the Sufi poets than anything Western. This sense of the divine within all things and all experience. The &quot;Holy! Holy!

C'mon, City Lights, what book is this supposed to sit on the shelf with?!"},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of self-appointed critics who, in order to try to convince others of their own individuality and intellectual honesty, feel the need to let everyone know that they consider Ginsberg (and every other so-called &quot;Beat&quot; for that matter) to be an overrated hack and more of a celebrity than a poet and blah, blah, blah, blah. It is true that Ginsberg's style has been imitated by far too many lesser poets who, obviously, don't posess anything close to the man's talent and it is also true that there's an equal number of people who claim to love Ginsberg but have never actually bothered to sit down and really read anything beyond the first page of &quot;Howl.&quot; Inetivably, one wishes that all of these presumed literary critics (regardless of where they stand) would just shut up, read the poems for themselves, and form their own opinions regardless of what the current trend is. For if they did, they would discover a very talented poet who, even if he occasionally seemed to be repeating and parodying himself as he got older, still created some of the strongest American poetry of the latter 20th Century. While Kaddish remains his strongest work of poetry, his much more famous poem &quot;Howl&quot; still carries more of a raw, exhilirating anger. Written to be read aloud, Howl is basically a cry against the conformity of 1950s America but the anger found within still reverberates almost half a century later. Certainly, his vision of a drug-abusing community of outcasts wandering along darkened city streets remains as relavent as ever. Like any apocalyptic poem, it can be credibly charges that at times, Howl is superficial and there's not much beyond shocking images. I don't necessarily disagree with this -- Howl, for instance, doesn't carry the same emotional weight as Ginsberg's more personal Kaddish. However, if Howl is all image, they're still very powerful images. Would I feel the same passion for this poem if I didn't know the much-reported stories of Ginsberg's &quot;best minds of my generation destroyed by madness?&quot; In short, if the beats hadn't been so celebrated by the media, would this poem have the same power? Honestly, who cares? The fact of the matter is that yes, the beats were celebrated (or hyped depending on your point of view) by the media and Howl is a powerful poem. All other considerations are simply unimportant doublespeak. As for the other poems contained with Howl, they are a mixed batch but all have their value. Some are a little too obviously based on Whitman (much as countless other poets based too much on Ginsberg) but they all have their points of interest. Its obvious that none of them were chosen to overshadow Howl but to a certain extent, that works very well. After the rage and madness of Howl, its good to have these other poems to &quot;come down&quot; with.With all this talk of anger and rage, I should also mention that Ginsberg's sense of joy is a component of his poetry that too many critics either fail to mention or ignore all together. Whatever you may think of his talent, it is obvious that Ginsberg loved poetry and found his greatest happiness through the discovery of new forms of poetic expressions. For all of its apocalyptic ragings, Howl never grows shrill because one can sense the fact that Ginsberg had a lot of fun composing (and performing) the poem. A few years before his own death, I was lucky enough to attend one of Allen Ginsberg's readings. Though he read mostly from Kaddish and his shorter poems (perhaps, understandably, trying to make sure we understood he actually had written other poems beyond the one everyone kept citing), he also read a bit from Howl. He proved to be an amazing reader, going over these words he must have seen over a million times past, with an almost childlike enthusiasm and joy. As he did this, I looked out at the others in the audience and basically, I saw rows and rows of identical looking &quot;intellectuals,&quot; all posessing the same dead-serious expression on their face, nodding at each relavent point as if to make sure everyone understood that they understood genius. Contrasting their forced seriousness with Ginsberg's uninhibited joy, I realized that there was only one true tragesy as far as Allen Ginsberg was concerned and that was the fact that his self-appointed acolytes always took him for more seriously then he did himself. To consider Howl and Ginsberg without joy is like considering language without words."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"I reread this little book before attempting to review it. I remembered that it was a mad mantra of transcendent power from the heart of hell, but I didn't remember how nondated it was. This work is fresher and more relevant than 99% of what passes for poetry today. How can something last nearly 50 years without going stale or becoming trite? How can it be even more real now? Maybe it is because Ginsberg ripped it live, screaming, and bleeding from a place beyond time and beyond space. He tore it from the living bowels of MOLOCH itself and showed it to HIM. After all, what does divine madness know of time?This poem is transcendence itself. It demonstrates that when you plunge into the deepest pit of hell it either kills you, or perhaps it burns out your insides so that you become a soulless zombie, OR you transcend it and rise howling to become a Mad Poet Saint who can truely encompass the Sacred in the Profane.Read this poem, and the others like America, A Supermarket in California, Sunflower Sutra, Wild Orphan, and In Back of the Real.

Picking this great pocket edition up at my local bookstore, I had no way of realizing what kind of effect it would have on me.This book is full of some of Ginsberg's most classic works. His unorthodox style bleeds through the poems whether they are shorter, narrative odes to important figures in his life or sprawling, staggering, frenetic pieces which pull the extremes of life itself into the lines.Because of this book I am now persuing poetry in college.This should be required reading for Life in general."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"This book is totally amazing. I have read a lot of Ginsberg's work and I love it all. I am only 14 and I don't get why people think this is so inapropriate! I mean sure, it can get racey at times and maybe for some people it could be too much but it is art! Art is beautiful so why does profanity matter if it is written in an elegant way. And he isn't just swearing for fun, Ginsberg and all his peers were trying to get a message across. That message is a good one, one we should all pay a little more attention to because it applies just as much to today as it did back then in the 50's. The Beat style of writing is inspiring and beautiful, the way the words flow on the page and the rhythm to it all. This collection of poems totally rocks, from his classic and most famous poem Howl, to his firery America, and the wonderful Sunflower Sutra. When I was first introduced to the Beat generation work I thought, oh, okay, this looks sorta interesting... but as soon as I started reading I became utterly imersed. Because of the work of poets like Ginsberg I have been inspired. These writings are what made me want to become a writter and a poet when I am older. Ginsberg was right when he said, \\"Poet is Priest.\\"-GIVE PEACE A CHANCE"},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"&quot;Howl&quot; is perhaps the most aptly titled poem ever. What Allen Ginsberg does with his poetry is exactly that: scream and howl and tear away at all notions of conformity. The epitome of Beat Literature is it's uninhibited energy, of which Howl is a primal statement. Ginsberg unleashes all demons, social to sexual, and leaves the reader with a sense of a man who is in tune with himself and his environment. Gone are the rigid structures of verse and meter, instead they are replaced with a zest for life and a zest for the uncompromising truth. Beat Generation writings thrive on the sound and the fury their literature contains, not bothering with too many pretentions and conventions.As for comparisons, Howl follows in the tradition of Walt Whitman (who is given a strange but touching ode in Howl), with it's yelps and ecstatic screams. Like Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, &quot;Howl&quot; expands the boundaries and concepts of what poetry is."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Howl and Other Poems by Allen Ginsberg is quite possibly one of the greatest American epics ever written. With its nightmarish violent and sexual imagery this will last forever. Let me just tell you if your new to Ginsberg (which I am not)I would recommend reading Reality Sandwiches or Kaddish first; if the overtly homosexual imagery in Howl doesn't bother you. Reality Sandwiches is a bit more toned down than Howl although in my opinion not better. Ginsberg's epic is a psychological drug induced (Ginsberg wrote Howl while under marijuana's influence) head trip into the minds of his fellow fallen hipsters and junkies. It is about a howl of defeat and a stench of death. If you are a beginning writer and\\\\or wish to write w\\\\more freedom I highly recommend picking this up not only for enjoyment but also for a style book of sorts because Howl shows how to free onesself in the literary sense (trust me I'm a published poet and have been reading Ginsberg for awhile he is one of my main influences). The first part (the actual poem Howl is divided into 3 not including holy, holy)is one long sentence never utilizing a period until the end. I could write a whole essay on Ginsberg but I'll leave you with the man, the myth, the legend; just pick up his work if poetry interests you and definently pick up Howl if you are not too sensitized.\\"...the mad man bum and angel beat in time; unknown, yet putting down what might be left to say in time come after death...\\""},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"I used to think that people didn't read things like &quot;Howl&quot; because they didn't understand. But as I have grown older I've come to the realization that is has much more to do with their NOT wanting to understand. It is easy to read, but not easy to understand. It causes one to think -- no, to have to think. One has to think about \\"Howl\\" if one reads it. It is one of those weird things you still think about years later on some lame Tuesday afternoon while paying bills. So, most people avoid it so they don't have to try and come to grips with the affects it can have on their minds. Football and movies are easier for people to deal with most of the time.I don't know if this is a bad thing anymore. People want to live comfortable lives, and if one thinks uncomfortable thoughts, then life can become uncomfortable. One is forced into action to try and help right the wrongs of this world, and that is not easy. Wrongs stay in place in large measure because people don't know how to fix them. Sure, we can quote RFK and say, &quot;some see things that never were and ask why not&quot;, but saying things like that is the easy part.Reading, &quot;Howl&quot; changes a person. Makes them uncomfortable, but it means to do that. It is a great piece of writing. It is probably the best piece of poetry written in the last half of the 20th century in the United States.But beware; because it causes one of think of change. Change can be good, and it can be bad.

The staccato beats of the stanzas, the raw and potent language, as well as the cross-country travels in the poem are all worth exploring in detail outside of the realm of Ginsberg's cultural experience. With powerful imagery, specific American locales, and references to John Milton, William Blake, Neal Cassady and the Bible, the 1956 poem ushered in not only the age of Beat poetry, but a lasting piece of fury, compassion and madness.The opening line, \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness\\" sets in motion a seemingly endless list of unnamed, but mostly male, people whom the narrator apparently knew who lost their sanity in the streets, subways, back alleys and bars of America. Written as a single, run-on sentence, the rhythm scheme is structured as mini-tales, each passage of a new, mind-blowing experience beginning simply with \\"who,\\" connecting back to that first line of the poem. The sense of dislocation within familiar terrain is the theme repeated throughout, with places in the heartland like Laredo, Texas and Arkansas as sinister and terrifying as Chicago and New York City. The people of the narrator's generation come from and travel to all points on the U.S. map, but share the common states of sorrow and confusion, unable to feel grounded within landscapes that no longer hold the same security and dependency that they once did. When the \\"angelheaded hipsters [...] / [...] bare their brains to Heaven under the El\\" and \\"[drink] turpentine in Paradise Alley,\\" the America that once made sense is transformed into a jumble of seedy and depressed places where screaming at God, poisoning oneself, and having meaningless s*x for an almighty, capitalistic dollar is the current norm.Time, space, eternity, the universe and Plato are invoked throughout the narrator's journey across America, allowing Ginsberg to delve into the big questions asked by man, albeit without attempting to directly answer any of them. He is ambitious in his reachings, detailing the concerns and experiences of an entire generation, his only judgments coming in the form of labeling the various acts performed as the actions of an insane group of people. He then follows the list of his generation's misdeeds with a section devoted to Moloch, invoking the biblical Canaanite who also shows himself in poems by Coleridge and Milton. The third and final section addresses Carl Solomon, a real-life friend to Ginsberg, to whom the poem is dedicated. It continues the societal course of madness to its logical conclusion, with Solomon in a Rockland, N.Y. mental hospital receiving treatment for the destruction of his, the best, mind."},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"_I reread this little book before attempting to review it.

But aside from the oceanic rhetoric, there's not much in these poems; it's the kind of poetry that no doubt sounds great when recited before a crowd, but doesn't really bear much scrutiny. I was tired of hearing about the best minds of Allen Ginsberg's generation long before the bombastic, repetitive verses of the title poem came to a close.

I myself, speaking of &quot;Howl,&quot; would use words very similar to those Tennyson used in describing &quot;Sordello&quot; -- I liked only the first line of it.

So, I do understand that, if this was the first main stream poetry book to have been published with this message, that it is considered relevant, not necessarily for its quality, but for its boldness, and plainly for being the first.On the other hand, there is no rhythm, no rhyme, it feels more like reading prose than poetry.

It's a substantial, quality production -- cloth spine, illustrated board cover, heavy paper stock, in a 9\\" x 13\\" size.\\"The Days of Real Sport\\" -- the cartoon's actual title -- is a large single panel, with often a lot happening in both foreground and background. It was a nostalgia piece even when these cartoons first appeared in 1911-1913, harking back to Briggs' growing-up years in the last quarter of the 1800's. In the times depicted here, iPods, video games, and cell phones were more than a hundred years in the future - and boys in small towns appear to have had a lot more fun things to do than they do today.It's not a complete collection of \\"Real Sport\\", but a selection of cartoons (61 by my count) from the first three years of its run. The book follows the course of a year, starting with New Years' morning and ending with Christmas and covering the seasons and seasonal pastimes in between -- cold mornings, April Fool's, summer sports, back to school, hickory-nuttin' time, Halloween, the first frozen-for-sliding sidewalks, and lots more.Each cartoon is accompanied by a short verse, by Wilbur Nesbit, on the facing page. The author of the book's afterword thinks the verses were unnecessary, but I found them both entertaining and occasionally helpful in understanding what's going on in the cartoons. In one, for example, a suddenly-popular boy is surrounded by eager new friends because he's carrying a new football -- but until I read the verse, I thought it was a watermelon! Footballs were shaped differently back then...At the end of the book there's a new, 8-page afterword/article by Jeet Heer. I would have liked to learn how long \\"Real Sport\\" ran, and also its frequency -- I assume weekly, it's hard to imagine Briggs drawing one of these more often -- but Heer doesn't say. Instead he provides an overview of Briggs' life and career. In the early years of the 20th century, newspapers and the cartoonist's profession were viewed differently from today, and Briggs was successful enough to attain a rock star/movie star level of celebrity (which brought some strain on his health and personal life). It's interesting, but -- the publisher, maybe in an overzealous attempt to distinguish the afterword from the book's original content, has printed the afterword on red-tinted paper; and small type and red paper are a really poor combination for legibility.

At the time, it was already a piece of nostalgia, celebrating the artist's (Clare Briggs's) 1880s childhood. I read and re-read it as a child in the 1950s. It was like having a great grandfather who was a captivating storyteller.The setting is a rural midwestern town. Each cartoon has a dozen or more characters, hitching a ride on the runners of a sleigh, running through the water plug's stream, skinny-dipping at the reservoir, cadging ice off the ice truck in summer, playing post office, hanging out on Saturday night (and pulling the wooden tub out of the closet for the weekly bath), and mocking a poor kid's first long pants.

The content was originally published in 1913 and largely depicts boys at play, although many contain a section where a young boy is caring for a toddler, often holding a handkerchief and imploring a harder blowing of the nose.However, having spent my childhood as a boy, I can attest to the fact that most of what the boys are doing in the cartoons was revisited in my childhood. The clothing, speech and mannerisms are certainly different, but the actions were the same. We played football and baseball, played many other games such as tag, swam in the creek, and were embarrassed by our friends when we paid attention to girls. We were always hungry, sometimes begging for more food but often sneaking it out of the cupboard.Times change yet they don't, unfortunately the advent of cable television and video games have rendered outside activities to be less of a priority among young people.

It explains exactly how Venice created its Empire, what it was like to live in many of the various elements of the Empire, the history of the area and the feeling of sailing throughout the Empire. The gradual loss of the Empire to the Turks, bit by bit, forms a large part of the story of course, but the dominant theme of the book is the strength and pride that being a part of the Empire provided. The author does not shy away from making value judgments about such varied characters as Enrico Dandolo and the martyr of Cyprus, Marco Antonio Bragadino.We are leaving on a sea voyage of the Empire and it was therefore perfect for us, having already digested the wonderful history of Venice by John Julius Norwich, which, although providing extensive detail about Venice, doesn't provide as much information about the disparate parts of the Empire."},{"Title":"THE VENETIAN EMPIRE","review":"This very vivid presentation of ancient live of venetians all through Levant gives you a picture of live, not just historical facts of those distant times.

I have been mentally stretched by some of her other works - notably I found Trieste And The Meaning Of Nowhere a bit of a melancholy struggle, and got as lost in the historically \`learned' details as I did with Patrick Leigh Fermor's work Mani, but I eventually enjoyed reading both books. Venetian Empire however, failed to engage. I am puzzled as to why this should be so, and I suspect the problem lies with me as much as with the rather dislikable Venetians, robbing, plundering, consorting with Islam while betraying and deserting their Greek populations.As I positively devoured her other works, particularly the Pax Britannica series and her travel narratives, I was looking forward to this book and feel an almost disloyal in having to recommend that any new Morris reader start with any of the other titles before delving into this heavy tome - and even the title deceived me, this is not a travel narrative, not a journey, and certainly not a voyage."},{"Title":"THE VENETIAN EMPIRE","review":"The readers who found this text pompous should take on or revisit the author's \\"Venice\\". The \\"The Venetian Empire: A Sea Voyage\\" was written 20 years after Morris' most famous work and seemingly benefited from his drift towards a more restrained style. Yes, he slips into \\"virtuosity\\" now and then, but one is not likely to find here the feverish uber-eloquence that in 1960 made the author feel that some divine substance is trailing his pen.This book gave me a very useful angle to look at the Venetian imperialist policy. The indignation at the Venice-led attack of Constantinople has become a trope in most of the texts describing the conquest, \\"Christians slaying Christians\\". The fact that the invaders and invaded belonged to the different creeds, Latin and Orthodox, just lingers somewhere on the margin. Morris brings it into the spotlight, and the overall picture looks a bit different now. A candidate to the Byzantine throne has promised the crusaders to lead the populace back to the Western Church. In a way the task of bringing the strayed flock into the hand of Rome could've been considered a mission no less worthy than fighting Muslims.Also the description of the Venice's religious policies in her colonies was very revealing - the republic is considered to be a haven of tolerance, but evidently at the conquered maritime territories the people of different faith were not enjoying such a bliss. The pressure was less heavy on Jews and Gypsies here and there but only because these communities somehow made themselves almost immune to repression by contributing heavily to a colony's prosperity.Well, as much as one is tempted to pass a moral judgement, to do so is infantile. Yes...the Venetians were not nice, and in a picture perfect world such a quaint and pretty city should have been breeding a better men, not these opportunistic adherents of Realpolitik. And if you have an interest in Venice that exceeds a plan of a 2-day visit to skim the sights, the books presenting a more accurate portrait of the republic and it's nation have a great value, \\"The Venetian Empire: A Sea Voyage\\" is definitely one of these.P.S. I can't be sure about the book's accuracy in details, I have to take the author's word for it in all the instances except one: Morris writes that Peter the Great sent sea cadets to Dolmatia to become experienced sailors in 1626 - and the monarch was born in 1672. OK, it's almost nothing, it's not like putting some crucial event a century earlier or later, just lets hope there is not a lot of such lapses in the book."},{"Title":"THE VENETIAN EMPIRE","review":"Fairly deadly. Text so tortured and pompous it interfered with the subject. I got seriously tired of it after a chapter and have not resumed reading it. Maybe some other time, but I am not hopeful."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"Fowden, as a writer, is admittedly no model of lucidity; at the same time, he is writing for academics, and is thus able to compress a huge amount into a small space. If you are not used to academic prose, you will find this book very difficult; it would also help if you know a certain amount about the reception of the Hermetica in 19th and 20th century historiography, and perhaps a bit about the late Classical era.At the same time, this book has been reprinted for a reason: it's the single most important historical argument about the Hermetica. For a long time, the Hermetica were understood to be purely Greek, essentially Hellenic misappropriations of pseudo-Egyptian ideas, recast in Neoplatonic style. What Fowden does is to show that these texts do have an important base within the dying Egyptian traditions of their day.For non-specialists, this may seem like small potatoes. But it changes everything. If you have read Frances Yates, for example, she argued that these texts were grotesquely misread by Ficino and the Renaissance tradition, on three counts: (1) they thought the texts were really, really ancient, more or less contemporary with Moses; (2) they thought the texts were Egyptian, not Greek; and (3) they thought the texts were really about magic (and not philosophy). Now there's no question that the Hermetica are from 1st-2d century Alexandria, but they are _not_ simply Greek; they are, in a sense, Egyptian formulations that draw on the then-influential Greek modes of philosophical thought. Furthermore, it means that the texts we usually think of as the Hermetic Corpus can and should be correlated with the PGM (the Greek Magical Papyri and their Demotic associates), changing the whole character of the texts by giving them a wildly different literary and ritual context. In other words, the Renaissance got the dating wrong, but in many respects got the rest more or less right; as a result, Fowden's book not only changes the way we read the Hermetica in their Alexandrian context, but also how we make sense of the Renaissance magical revival (Ficino, Pico, Agrippa, Bruno, etc.).If, having read this review, you think, &quot;Who cares?&quot; then this book is certainly not for you. If you think, &quot;Wow! That's fascinating,&quot; then this is essential. I have seen the odd quibble with small points in Fowden's arguments, but I have not seen any serious attack on the main thrust of the book. Considering when it was first written, that's extraordinary.But you do need to be comfortable with academic prose."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"The curious writings on Magic, Astrology, Alchemy, and Spirituality traditionally attributed to the Egyptian god Hermes Trismegistus have fascinated scholars, theologians, mystics, and occultists alike for almost two thousand years. Since the early 1600's most academics regarded the spirituality oriented &quot;philosophical Hermetica&quot; as the products of Greek philosophy and Gnostic Christianity with no Egyptian religious content. In this influential and often referenced book, Garth Fowden establishes these works as a blend of Greek and authentic Egyptian sources in a classic &quot;east meets west&quot; scenario. Hence the title &quot;The Egyptian Hermes&quot;.Leaving aside the disputes of the learned, what I found most interesting about this book is Fowden's attempt to understand the mindset and social and religious environment of the anonymous 2nd and 3rd century creators of the Hermetica. For instance, even though I am trained in physics and chemistry, I now begin to understand why a first century Greek-Egyptian could find astrology, alchemy and magic to be sensible pursuits. I was also intrigued to find these so-called pagans sought a transcendent union with the single god who created the cosmos, which includes the other gods. These and other unexpected mixtures of pagan and typically Christian beliefs serve to illustrate the broad range of religious and philosophical ideas in the Roman Empire during the time that Christianity was becoming established. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of religion or philosophy, not just to students of Hermetic philosophy.Be warned, however, that this book is not an easy read. Fowden is an academic writing for academics. Specialized terms are often not explained and the writing style is complicated rather than lucid. Keep your (unabridged) dictionary handy. He also sometimes indulges in that annoying academic habit of not translating quotes from languages other than English. If you are willing to put in the effort, this book will be richly rewarding."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"The origins of Hermes Trismegistus, the sage cult hero of Graeco-Roman Egypt, to many people has seemingly been lost in the midst of time. This is the first investigation undertaken into his mystic by a social historian. The technical and philosophical aspects of Hermetica as normally seen as separate entities, but the author argues for their togetherness as was typical of philosophy and religion of that era. The book has no illustrations or photos and in that sense it is quite scholarly. Definitely for those who are religion-orientated, especially and more precisely interested in Hermes."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"While Fowden's prose does occassionally get wearisome (personally, I think that even considering the academic tone necessarily employed by him, he could have done much better), this book nonetheless remains a truly unsurpassed study of the syncretic influences of the Alexandrian period and the Hermetic traditions that arose from it.Fowden carefully traces out the variety of Greek and Egyptian influences that went into formulating the body of thought and literature now collectively referred to as \\"Hermetica,\\" or \\"Hermetism\\" and convincingly demonstrates that ultimately these things did in fact have a clear precedent in pre-Ptolemaic Egypt. Much as Wilkinson and other Egyptologists have done for pre-Hellenistic Egyptian thought and religion, so Fowden has done for post-Hellenistic Egyptian thought, in demonstrating a kind of continuity that was previously dismissed by academics as overly \\"idealistic\\" (i.e. a general continuity of thought carried forward from ancient Egypt into the Classical world).As another reviewer rightly noted, this has immense implications for the field of Graeco-Egyptian studies, and for the study of all \\"esoteric\\" modes of thought and literature that follow it.The book is also wonderfully concise, and does not droll on endlessly as some academic works tend to do. So, despite the sometimes excessively dry language, Fowden manages to say just what needs to be said - no more, and no less. This book is a genuine accomplishment, and a must for any serious student of the Graeco-Egyptian period, or of the Hermetic revival(s) that later drew upon it."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"The Egyptian Hermes is a very concise and rich analysis of the Hermetic mysteries in late Antiquity. Fowden draws parallels between the Hermetic system and other esoteric philosophies and movements of the time, like Iamblichus' Neoplatonic theurgy, the Magical Papyri, and Gnostic literature. The result is a brilliant scholarly work, that is possibly the most valuable survey of the Hermetic movement written so far. Fowden's writing style is a bit convoluted at times, and the beginning student may have some difficulty absorbing all the information on the first read, but aside from that this book is a work of genius. Fowden's book, plus a good translation of the Hermetica (like those of Walter Scott, Brian Copenhaver or Clement Salaman), is all the reader will need to begin a serious study of Hermetism."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"This is a very interesting book on Hermes centered Egyptian-Greek religious practice in the pre-Christian era, much more illumination than the mere reading of mythologies.

It is a trip back in time to read this now archaic speech.This book deserves 4 or 5 stars except for its unreadability. It is difficult and arduous reading, as I found myself having to parse each sentence to extract it's meaning. I could only keep it up for short periods of time and hope to be able to finish the book someday.If only the publishers were to have the book rewritten by someone with a broader writing ability, this book would be an invaluable addition to anyone's library with an interest in Egyptian-Greek pagan religion as practiced in that era.Even with the books faults, the subject matter is so interesting that it may be worth the trouble for the hardy."},{"Title":"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind","review":"Fowden does a good job of tracing the orgins of Hermitist to Ancient Egypt.

(on a side note yates has been proven wrong by the nag hammadi library regardless ).

I felt like the whole point of the story was to show that architecture was the only good thing that came from the Middle Ages so for heaven's sake, don't tear those buildings down! We could never build something like that again! This book saved the Notre Dame Cathedral by giving people a reason to care about it and showing how Gothic architecture was beautiful even though it was different (which is a theme in the novel that applies to the characters as well). Victor Hugo likes lists that are very, very long full of even longer names and I found myself falling asleep a lot in the first half of the book. Then suddenly I get hit over the head by this steamy, passionate, action-packed, gruesomely violent second half of the novel complete with forbidden love. Didn't see that coming. I found it surprisingly modern in that there are a lot elements in this story that are popular in novels, especially young adult ones, today. Though I can't help but think that the girl would have been turned on by the whole forbidden/creepy love thing if it had been written today instead of her being horrified by it. And can I just say how shocked I was when he used the word \\"vampire\\" AND talked about Nicolas Flamel? There was some great sarcastic humor in here that had me smiling. This was Hugo's first novel after writing plays and it reads like one. There are lots of action scenes and he writes an excellent mob. He almost makes me want to grab a pitchfork. I walked away from this book thinking about what beauty and love really are."},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"Notre-Dame de Paris by Victor HugoAny fan of great literature, beautiful prose, French history, architecture, or Victor Hugo will love this ebook.

Notre-Dame de Paris is one of the finest classics ever written."},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"This is the second time I've read Notre-Dame de Paris (the first time was with a different translator, but I don't see any real difference with the writing), and I certainly have a better understanding of the story. The book's main character is Notre-Dame, and the supporting characters are Claude Frollo, La Esmeralda, and Quasimodo. Frollo is the Archdeacon who lusts after La Esmeralda. Quasimodo is the hunchbacked bell-ringer of Notre-Dame. La Esmeralda is a 16-year old gypsy girl who is the target of witchcraft by the Parisians. What happens in the novel is sophisticated: basically Claude Frollo & Quasimodo fight for the love of Esmeralda, and it doesn't turn pretty as Esmeralda has fallen in love with Phoebus de Chateaupers, one of the King's captains.One of the things I particularly enjoyed was Hugo's descriptions of the gothic cathedral itself. The chapter entitled \\"A Bird's-Eye View of Paris\\" is a pleasure to read. Another thing is the switching of POV's in every chapter; Hugo made a brilliant execution of this. Despite a few flaws here and there (such as Book Ten/Chapter Four interrupting the very important assault on Notre-Dame), \\"Notre-Dame de Paris\\" is of course a classic in the world of literature. And it's almost sad that most people recognize the book with only the english title \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\". Almost sad, because Quasimodo is not the central character. I hope more and more people will understand that the cathedral itself is the actual central character (even though it's not human)."},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"Heritage's Notre-Dame of Paris was released in a black slipcase with textured, pictorial, two-color cloth.Illustrated with color paintings by Bernard Lamotte.

I am not sure what Disney has to do with this novel, other than to make a cartoon that uses it as a starting point. I write this review to say this: if you know this novel and this story, and you watched the Disney cartoon, you cannot have missed \\"Hell Fire\\" the song solo by the Frollo character. In my opinion, the lyricists and artists for that song got it all perfectly right: the historical dimensions, the moral, ethical, social and even the political. That song was the plea of a man, to God, who knew he would risk death and eternal damnation to possess a woman that burned him down to his soul. In the song, he plainly explained that he would do ANYTHING to possess her, including throw over his religion and his piety and his god, and that he would literally jump into a pit of sin to get her. This cartoon song, forgive me, is one of the most powerful objects of art ever created by Disney and may I say, perhaps by all of American civilization. It encapsulates all that it is to be a human, and all that being a human implies. Frollo was but a man, and Esmarelda but a woman. Put the two together, throw in some wealth and political intrigue, and you can have hate, or extreme passion, or hell-fire, or maybe good art, or even stranger, it might just be one heck of a damn good movie."},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"The novel which is so poorly mistranslated as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; is one which sadly few people have read. Disney has done this novel a great injustice. Hugo paints an elaborate and incredible picture of 15th-century Paris. The main character is not Quasimodo, the infamous hunchback, but rather the cathedral of Notre Dame itself. It is a complex and powerful character who shifts dramatically depending on who percieves it. Hugo is a brilliant writer; each image is beautiful, each line a poem. The book is four hundred pages of pure poetry. I highly recommend this novel for anyone who appreciates good literature."},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"I still do not have the faintest idea as to why Disney could possibly make this book into a children's movie. First of all, I would rate the unabridged book itself &quot;PG-13&quot;...but anyway. This book, more popularly known as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (even though the plot circles around the Cathedral, not Quasimodo) is like a twisted &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story sans star-crossed lovers. The real protagonist (in my opinion) is Esmarelda, the sixteen year old gypsy dancer. She falls passionatly in love with the chauvanistic stuff-shirt Captain Pheobus whotakes advatage of her love while meanwhile courting a young, rich noblewoman. Meanwhile, both Quasimodo the deaf bell-ringer and Claude Frollo the fanatical archdeacon fall madly in love with Esmerelda. So naturally things get quite chaotic when the gypsy is sentanced to death for &quot;murdering&quot; the captain.

P.S: my favorite part...Esmarelda's &quot;marriage&quot; to Pierre Gringiore, and also Gringiore's unhealthy obsession with the gypsy's goat"},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"Unlike a great number of the people giving this book a positive review, I was and still am a fan of Disney's movie. Yes, the movie distorted the book quite liberally--but this is to be expected of a children's film adaptation. I view the movie's existence as positive since it encourages older fans of the movie to go and seek Hugo's book to get the complete story. It is a sad fact that most people have never read the book, however, the Disney movie brought attention back to it--a victory, in my opinion.As far as the book itself, it was marvelous! Hugo's writing style is ornate and an artistic work in itself. As far as who the main character is, I would daresay that this is up to the reader's interpretation. I agree with the fact that the British translation regarding the title is misleading, as I find Quasimodo to be a bit distant from the focus of the book.Hugo seemed to be preoccupied with portraying both Notre Dame and 15th Century Parisian society when writing this book. From that stance, it would seem as though both Cathedral and time period were the protagonists of the story.As far as in-context, living characters, I would again like to state that Quasimodo is not whom I would nominate as protagonist. Esmeralda is a tempting choice, however, she is not given too much detail as far as personality. I would daresay that the most developed character in the book is the antagonist, Claude Frollo. I could write volumes on this character alone, as he is my favourite. If he weren't already antagonist, I would deem him a good candidate for protagonist.Ah, Claude Frollo. He is the main reason behind my love for the book. (To Disney fans--his story does not unfold as in the movie!) I find his constant struggles and painful past to be some of the most intriguing parts of the book. The parts which included dialogue predominantly on his part were certainly my favourite ones. Claude and his constant battle with his feelings, his devotion, his jealousy and his belief in fate colour the book like no other character could.Ultimately, the message of the book is that appearances are deceptive. Hugo portrays this most obviously with Quasimodo. In my opinion, however, he gives the reader this message through every main character. Phoebus, for example, is at first presented as a gallant officer who rescues Esmeralda but later turns out to be a vulgar womanizer. Clopin is first encountered as a mere beggar but is in fact the king of the Gypsies, holding power within his circle of vagabonds. Quasimodo is first thought of as a monster but is given a more tender place in the reader's heart by the conclusion of the book. Esmeralda is described as beautiful and she at first shows mercy to both Gringoire and Quasimodo, but is later revealed as superficial and vulgar in her taste for men. Claude Frollo appears as a studious priest, but is in reality a passionate, tortured spirit and so much more.To all, I encourage you to read this book! You will feel what the characters feel as your eyes follow Hugo's words. I recall with clarity reading the part where Claude observes as Phoebus attempts to manipulate Esmeralda for his own purpose and, enraged, stabs the captain with Esmeralda's dagger. I remember how my stomach turned as I read. I could feel Claude Frollo's every emotion. It was like magic. It was, in fact, magic. The magic of excellent literature!"},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"The story takes place in 1482 and 1483, when Paris's center was, as today, the Ile de France, surrounded by the Seine, where there emerges the marvelous Gothic cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, a work of the people, of the years, and of Gothic architecture. The book begins with the popular festival where Quasimodo is crowned as Ugly King. Quasimodo is a deformed creature: hunchback, deaf, blind in one eye, but in posession of an extraordinary physical strength. Abandoned, as a four-year-old, at the Cathedral's gate, he was adopted by Claude Frollo, the arch-deacon of the cathedral, a nobleman with a tragic story and a younger brother who, in spite of having been nurtured and loved by Claude, has betrayed him with his licentious and illegal behavior. Frollo hates women, in particular the young gypsy Esmeralda, a lovely young girl who, with her white goat, dances, sings, and divines the future, to the scandal of the good consciences, including Frollo.This is one of the most powerful stories ever created, a masterful adventure into the depths of the late Middle Ages. Surrounding the tragic love story between Esmeralda and the Hunchback of Notre Dame is a deep reflection on the demise of Medieval times and the slow but inevitable onset of the Renaissance. Hugo inserts chapters about the Cathedral's history and the description of Medieval Paris, its different neighborhoods and urbanistic setting. Frollo explains, to his astonished listeners, how and why the invention of printed books will mean the death of Architecture, at least as an art. \\"The book will kill the building\\", he says, because the printed book \\"is the greatest event of humanity. It is the mother of Revolutions\\". Before the press, the Church was able to control thought and speech. People expresed themselves in architecture, when they participated as artisans in the construction of public buildings, true works of the people. Not anymore: the book will allow a clearer and more powerful means of expression; fluid, eternally changing, from then on literature will be the most transparent way to express oneself. We know the printed book precipitated the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaisssance and Modernity, but Frollo submerges into bitterness and his terrible sexual frustration: he hates Esmeralda because he desires her immensely.The plot thickens with the whole crazy, tragic love story involving the pretty gypsy, the hunchback, the captain with whom Esmeralda falls in love, Frollo, his brother, the mad crowds, and king Louis XI, sending his troops to take the cathedral. Impossible literature in our days, \\"Our Lady of Paris\\" is a prodigy of imagination, of the recreation of a bygone world, of an integral work which articulates history, political and ecclesiastical power, and the whole of society, from the rich and noble, and the bourgeois, to the miserable and criminal rubbish, peopled by unique characters, yet a reflection of their time and place. In spite of being a somber and desolate story, Hugo tells it with an epic tone, not a sociological one, and therefore makes it an endearing and not a sordid story. I wonder what Dostoevsky would have made with this material!An emblem of Western culture, it is much more than a story, because it includes a grand reflection on the age: architecture and the printing press, a changing society, urbanism and people."},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","review":"I still do not have the faintest idea as to why Disney could possibly make this book into a children's movie.

Although the suspense was pretty well-written, it of course lacked the suspense carried by the movies. In the movies, Michael Myers is a silent predator who stalks his prey at a slow pace and is able to slip up on them unnoticed. This is what makes him truly terrifying. In this book, he practically runs into peoples' houses, throwing things around, and making himself known to everyone. He also growls way too much. I found this kind of unbelievable and not very effective. The characters were also kind of unbelievable. Worse than the Dr. Loomis character in the HALLOWEEN movies, the hero Jeff constantly repeats himself like a raving maniac with &quot;Michael Myers is out there! He's out there! He's out there!&quot; and constantly runs into stupid situations! The heroine Amy is totally blind to the danger and those around her who want to help her. Haddonfield, IL, is supposed to be a quiet midwestern town. I hardly think that there would be that much action from teenagers there. Remember, in the movies the teenagers usually got stuck babysitting or throwing small parties in farm houses on Halloween night. In other words, this novel could have been better with a little work. I also did not like the references to the original movie. The year of the original attack is named as 1985 instead of 1978 and Laurie Strode, Jamie Lee Curtis's character in the movie, gets no mention. The only straight reference is Judith Myers and the 1963 murder. But still, I must applaud O'Rourke's imagination that is put into this novel. It was a good effort!"},{"Title":"The Old Myers Place (Halloween, Book 2)","review":"Halloween:The Old Myers Place was okay. The story was good,but the problem was it talked too much about the teens.

Based on primary sources, some only recently rediscovered, this is the most well-rounded portrait of \\"The Pride of The Yankees\\" as there may ever be.I found the Lou Gehrig who appeared on these pages to be---well, far more boring than legend makes him. Gehrig was the quintessential \\"quiet man,\\" whose preferred activity away from baseball was fishing.Despite Gehrig's fame, he was not a fan favorite, largely because he was painfully shy and hardly could carry on conversations with strangers. He was an impressively handsome wallflower who blushed and became tongue-tied when he spoke to women. He lacked charisma. The sportswriters that could make or break a player's public image largely ignored him except as an adjunct to Ruth. (He was known as \\"Babe Gehrig\\" in his earliest playing days for his prowess at the plate.) He was not quotable. His kindnesses were kept private. He had no vices (except pipesmoking). For most of his career he played in the shadow of Babe Ruth, who WAS eminently quotable, who loved the spotlight and engaged in showy philanthrophies, and who was an epicurean in all realms of hedonism. The public embraced the seemingly teddy bear-like Babe. After Ruth's departure, the press embraced Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, making him the next Yankee icon.During all these years there was Gehrig, playing in game after game, setting records. His consecutive games record of 2,130 was eventually broken by Cal Ripken Jr. and was his hits record by Derek Jeter, but both these records stood for a half century, and in the absence of steroids and sports medicine. Not for nothing was he \\"The Iron Horse.\\" In so many ways he was a living embodiment of all the best American virtues, an icon in and of himself. Still, the public kept their distance from the indefatigueable \\"Iron Man.\\" As much as paragons are extolled, they are often unloved.Yet, Gehrig was hardly inhuman. He came from an immigrant family that had buried three children, leaving him the sole surviving son. As a result, he was hugely overprotected. He grew up with the immigrant mentality of never risking his employment. Hence, for years the Yankees shamefully underpaid him, playing on his fears of being cut from the lineup. His father was a cipher, but his mother dominated him to such an extent that he often brought her along on Yankees road trips.\\"Babe tipped the two call girls. Gehrig kissed his mother goodbye.\\" This brief quote illustrates like nothing else the vast difference between the two men. The Babe was a celebrity, the Iron Horse a naive albeit extraordinary ballplayer. They were friends by dint of their sequential place in the Yankees' batting order, and by their incredible talents on the field which made them natural allies. The Yankees took advantage of this, touring them together and creating competing novelty teams (The \\"Busting Babes\\" and the \\"Laruppin' Lous\\") which they each captained in exhibition games.Gehrig remained the sidekick for years, a relationship which suited the Babe perfectly, but did little for Lou. Yes, they were friends, but they were never truly close. No one seemed close to Lou Gehrig, except perhaps his mother. Gehrig stayed away from the usual male vices of liquor and women (Eig speculates that he may have been a virgin well into his twenties); no woman was good enough, not by Lou's lights but by his mother's. Mrs. Gehrig interfered successfully in every relationship Lou had until he was thirty when he married his wife. A grand war erupted between the two Mrs. Gehrigs that lasted their lifetimes.Eleanor Twitchell Gehrig may have been played by Theresa Wright in the movies, but she was a harder, more savvy woman than the film portrays, a former flapper, and a somewhat jaded drinker. She was dedicated to having Lou promote himself (once, he was asked by \\"Huskies\\" cereal, a sponsor he endorsed, what his favorite breakfast was, and he answered \\"Wheaties!\\"), and she was dedicated to driving a wedge between mother and son. Eig never comments on the Gehrig marriage, but it seems that it was hardly bucolic---Gehrig suspected Ellie of having an affair with Babe Ruth, and never spoke to Ruth again. He seemed to have no close male friends, and no confidants.Gehrig's rock solid dependability led Manager Joe McCarthy to name him team Captain, but (as Eig states) \\"he was not a fiery captain.\\" He was helpful and friendly to the rookies and the younger men who sought the benefit of his experience, but he looked askance at some of the behaviors of his more seasoned teammates. He snubbed men he thought were not giving their all. He moped over his own errors, and often wept at losses, particularly when he failed to come through in the clutch.Much of Gehrig's insecurity seems fearsomely misplaced. He played in every Yankee game from 1925 to 1941. He was a bulwark of the Yankees, and indeed a bulwark of the game of baseball as a whole. A power hitter par excellence, Eig gives us a picture of Gehrig around 1935: \\"His torso formed a perfect V . . . not an ounce of fat on his belly . . . his thighs were wider than most men's waists . . . calves the size of hams.\\"This seemingly superhuman specimen though, was carrying a ticking time bomb inside himself. Exactly when ALS first attacked Lou Gehrig is unclear. Eig postulates an early onset date of January 1938 and a late onset date of June 1938, but Eig also documents a few anomalous moments in Gehrig's life that may (or may not) have been harbingers of the disease---a chronic cramping backache which recurred at intervals in 1937, and \\"a strange tingle in his spine\\" that same year. Gehrig fell into a batting slump at the end of the '37 season. Of course, having played some 1800 consecutive baseball games to that point may have just been wearying.ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is a disease in which the motor neurons become brittle and nonfunctional. This leads to progressive muscle wastage, and eventual death. There is still no effective treatment available, and most patients die within five years.ALS devastated Lou Gehrig. His power at the plate simply vanished overnight and his ability to field faded. Once he fell over backward from the momentum of a caught ball. Gehrig figured he needed more work, and pushed himself harder in batting practice, but at best he could wring out an occasional good game. Fans booed him and opposing players razzed him. The Yankees were mystified. All athletes eventually lose their edge, but Gehrig didn't lose his edge, he fell off the edge. Clearly, something was very wrong, but a collective delusion of denial infected Lou's teammates, friends, family, fans, and Gehrig himself, and this denial carried him through the 1938 season. In photographs taken over that year Lou seems to be shrinking, but no one seemed to take notice.By Opening Day of 1939, denial was no longer an option, but neither Joe McCarthy nor Gehrig wanted to face facts. Gehrig had often said he wanted to play 2500 consecutive games, and over the years McCarthy and Gehrig had cooperated in keeping the streak alive (once, a flu-ridden Gehrig took the first at-bat in a game, struck out messily, and retired to the clubhouse). In '39, Gehrig bravely played eight games, but his deteriorating skills were costing the Yankees their standing in the league. He benched himself in his 2,130th game, although he continued to dress for the games and captain the team. For a while.In his decline, Gehrig caught the imagination and the sympathy of baseball fans everywhere. Where he couldn't command attention in his prime, where he was seen as remote at his best, the fans embraced him sympathetically as he lost his skills. Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, July 4, 1939, during which Lou uttered the immortal phrase, \\"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth\\" transformed him into a folk hero, vulnerable and gracious under pressure, and beloved. He blossomed briefly, becoming a gregarious raconteur, as though he wanted his baseball memoirs to be recorded before he lost the power of speech.There was little that could be done for Lou, though he tried experimental drugs such as histamines and superdoses of Vitamin E. Interestingly, his correspondence to and fom his doctors in this period was full of encouraging though ultimately false reportage from his doctors, mostly for purposes of morale. Lou reported \\"improvement\\" himself from time to time, but every \\"improvement\\" was followed by a sharper fall-off. Nonetheless, he maintained a positive attitude, even in the face of his own mortality. He made the most he could of the last few months of his short life, working until April of 1941. He kept smiling, and kept reassuring everyone of his \\"50/50 chance,\\" even as he obviously lay dying. Lou Gehrig passed away on June 2, 1941.Although Lou Gehrig was a great ballplayer he did not attain personal greatness until faced with the ultimate crisis of his life. It is the quiet dignity with which he addressed his condition that made him the \\"Pride of the Yankees,\\" and for which he is so well remembered."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"In LUCKIEST MAN, Jonathan Eig accomplishes the exceedingly difficult task of humanizing a baseball deity. What emerges through 420 utterly absorbing pages is a moving and authentic portrait of a heroic, modest, dignified, anxious, and somewhat aloof man who exhibited remarkable courage and grace in the face of terrible personal tragedy. Eig deftly manages to provide equally deep insight into Gehrig's life both on and off the field and, in doing so, has produced a comprehensive biography that really brings its subject to life. To read this book is to know Lou Gehrig. A smooth and inspirational read, LUCKIEST MAN is a must addition to any baseball library."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"If you like Lou Gehrig or just want to find out about his life, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Luckiest Man chronicles Gehrig's transformation from a shy and awkward son of immigrants to the Yankees' legendary first baseman and power hitter, and then through his decline from the illness that now bears his name. Using skills honed as a reporter for several of the nation's leading newspapers, author Jonathan Eig weaves threads of previously unpublished information from Gehrig's personal correspondence -- along with a mountain of newsprint and newsreel footage from the period -- to bring the hall-of-famer to life.For baseball fans, Luckiest Man provides a deeper understanding of the colorful characters and events that shaped the game in the \`20s and \`30s. Readers less familiar with America's favorite pastime will find themselves entranced by how Gehrig's work ethic enabled him to quietly rack up record after record, even as the flamboyant Babe Ruth dominated the headlines. Then, as the narrative begins to describe Gehrig's diagnosis and rapid decline, all readers will be moved by his heroic struggle.Luckiest Man is a thoroughly researched and well-rounded portrait that chips away at the myths surrounding Gehrig and exposes a humble man with tremendous athletic gifts, who lived his life with conviction and bravery."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou Gehrig has always been an interesting subject for me. I'm a so-so baseball fan, but I am a fan of individual's who appear to have the same values and morals that I hold.Jonathan Eig does a very nice job in this book of focusing on Gehrig's baseball qualities and his qualities as a man. I really enjoyed the book that gave a tremendous insight into how Gehrig acted behind closed doors.A few things that really interested me:I didn't know he was nearly that good of a baseball player. If ALS wouldn't have ended his career he might have gone down as the greatest first baseman ever. Eig did a very nice job in citing statistics and comparing those to other players in Gehrig's era and in the modern era.I also didn't know that a number of times Gehrig would play an inning or two and get credit for a game. I appreciate the fact that the writer didn't get caught up in the legend of Gehrig and pointed out the streak and how it lived basically because of the manipulation of Gehrig and Yankee manager Joe McCarthy. That definitely diminshes the accomplishment of consecutive games played in my mind... not by much because Gehrig did play with a lot of injuries and issues.... but it does diminish it. It also puts that much more of a wow factor into the consecutive games streak of Cal Ripken because I believe he had to play 5 innings to get credit for a game.That said, Eig did a really nice job in pointing out that Gehrig really was much more than just \\"An Iron Horse\\" at first base. The stats, the clutch hitting, etc. were well documented by Eig.I also liked the detail that Eig provided on ALS and Gehrig's final years. As I was reading the book, I was thinking we are sure flying through his playing career and there is a whole lot of book left here. That was because Eig wanted to take some time to describe in detail Gehrig's final years and he did a very nice job.I would suggest this book to anyone wanting to know more about Gehrig, Yankees history, or if you just want to read a great account of a man who should be well-admired for his work ethic and moral values.A great book and great subject matter."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Jonathan Eig has done the fan of both sports and American culture a great favor with his brilliant biography of Lou Gehrig. With exhaustive use of primary sources including Gehrig's letters to his doctor, he pieces together both Gehrig's career and especially the last couple of years of his life. I came away with a greater understanding and respect for a player who I didn't think I could possibly repect more.Eig works hard at peeling back the layers of sportswriter myth making that was common in the pre-war years and gives a clear picture of a complex, driven and ultimately doomed man. He is kind to the side players, while drawing them with clarity.I wish this book could have been written 20 years earlier when more of his contemporaries were still with us."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Nice read. Eig does a good job of giving a balanced portrait of a complex man. Not being a big baseball follower, it gave interesting insights into the game and some of the legendary players.

Most importantly, it gives the reader a good and solid understanding of the man. I have always been a Lou Gehrig fan but I have never fully appreciated the complete humility of the man. Additionally, the description of baseball and its players, clearly illustrates the tremendous differences between the game as we know it today and the way it once was."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This was a very well-written and moving book. As a huge Yankee fan and someone who has read many baseball books, this book is great. One gets a real sense of the times, along with Gehrig the person, and the beauty of the sport of baseball. As a student of the important philosophy Aesthetic Realism (www.aestheticrealism.org) founded by Eli Siegel, poet and critic, I've learned what makes a thing beautiful from a work of art to a great leaping catch in baseball. Mr. Siegel stated, \\"All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves.\\" Certain sentences and descriptions in this book I found beautiful -- they have a relation of energy, zip and also exactitude. These are opposites that the game of baseball has too. I have recommended this book to others."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"A must read.

A book that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This book is a marvelous, life-enriching reading experience, and a sports classic that should stand for years to come. I read a childhood biography of Gehrig by Van Riper at the age of 8 or 9 that left me hooked on reading in general and Gehrig in particular, and this is the bio he has deserved and I have longed for, for years. Highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou Gehrig was a quiet, shy and intensely private person. Sportwriters of the time found him colorless, and never regarded him as a go-to guy for a good quote, as they did more extroverted teammates like Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio. Although a home-run hitter second only to Ruth, and peerless at batting runs in, he is chiefly remembered today, as a player, for having played in a then-record 2,130 consecutive games, which until Cal Ripken Jr. broke it in 1995 stood as the most boring record of all.But as Jonathan Eig makes clear in this meticulously researched biography, Gehrig was not only one of the greatest Yankees between the white lines, he was one of the finest off the field as well. Eig brings colorfully alive the vanished world of early baseball, and succeeds remarkably in getting into the interior life of one of baseball's most private characters. Gehrig emerges largely as his contemporaries probably saw him: a decent, gentlemanly exemplar of the values of hard work and good sportsmanship. But, basing his narrative largely on newly discovered private correspondence and on interviews with those who knew him, Eig also depicts Gehrig as an unexpectedly complex person who was at once competitive, cheap, and self-effacing, who worried constantly about fulfilling his obligations to the fans, his teammates, and his family, and who loved baseball for its own sake but cared little for the trappings of celebrity. And the courage and lack of self-pity with which he faced his personal tragedy make him even a greater hero than did his considerable exploits on the field.This is destined to be the definitive biography of one of the greatest Yankees of all. Essential reading for any baseball fan."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This book is unusual among biographies of baseball players in that the focus is more on the man in all his complexity than on the baseball career. The book is very well written, not afflicted with lots of baseball jargon. Whereas most sports biographies focus extensively on the on-the-field exploits of their subject, this book focuses on the subject's character and personality, and his relationships with those around him. While hardly a psycho-biography, it is a rare attempt in the field of sports biography to try to probe beneath the surface and figure out exactly who this man was and how he operated. As such, it is constantly fascinating. My only adverse comment is that I felt perhaps there was not enough of the more traditional account of on-the-field heroics. Here is a man who played 14 full season with the NY Yankees, appearing in every scheduled game for 13 of those seasons, whose hitting abilities were truly extraordinary and who developed into a first-class field player as well, and who participated in many extroardinarily dramatic moments. And yet I had the feeling at times that the author was rushing through some of the Yankee seasons and not giving as much of the flavor of the ballgames as one might like. In other words, I could have done with a book that was 50-100 pages longer with more detail. But then that might have taken away from the very effective portrait of the man himself, so I can understand why the author decided to be selective with that kind of stuff. (And, after all, one can easily seek out earlier Gehrig biographies that do give lots of that kind of thing.)At the end, a truly superb achievement by the author and his editor.And - just to reflect a moment, consider that during his last full year with the Yankees, 1938, when Gehrig was struggling under the early symptoms of ALS - he managed to appear in every scheduled game (albeit just briefly in a few toward the end of the season), bat .295, hit 29 homeruns and bat in 114 runs. His on-base average that year was over .400. These statistics are comparable (indeed a bit better overall) to his achievement during his first professional season with the Yankees back in 1925. And, more astonishingly, compare these final year statistics to the average then or today. Gehrig seriously compromised by a fatal illness played better than the average fully healthy ballplayer of his own time and better than many who would be considered star players today. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is a very good book. It is easy to read. It does a great job of capturing Lou Gehrig's career as a baseball player and what kind of person he is. Eig also does a good job of discussing Gehrig's death in a moving and informative way. It is probably the best part of the book. He did a great job of capturing the sadness of the situation and the strength and courage that Lou Gehrig went about his death.Another highlight of this book is Eig's descriptions of players, teams, and important games of Lou Gehrigs career. He spends a lot of time on these subjects. But his descriptions never become dry or dull. He relays the important stats without becomming bogged down in numbers.While I enjoyed this book, thouroughly, I think a few things could have been improved. I would have liked to have seen more information about the important people in Gehrig's life, especially his mother and wife. Although the first part of the book describes Lou's relationship with his mother, once his wife is introduced into the narrative his mother is almost forgotten. His wife is discussed when they first met and later got married, but after their honeymoon is written about, she is almost forgotten as well. It would have been interesting to see the dynamic between Gehrig and the two most important women in his life. As well as the dynamic between the two women, who almost never got along. Eleanor, his wife, left behind a decent amount of written material, including letters and an autobiography. Those could have been taken advantage of to create a better picture of their life together.I also felt that the book did not offer enough insight into baseball at the time. It did offer a small amount, such as how pitchers were much more important before Gehrig and Ruth tore up the league. Older players, such as Ty Cobb, did not accept the new form of baseball, which was more reliant on the home run. Other than that, though, very little is discussed. Perhaps that was not the intention of this book, but some other reveiws tend to suggest that the book has more insight into the wider world of 1920s, 30s, and 40s baseball.Overall, this was an enjoyable and easy book to read. Just note the short comings when diving in."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is what baseball should be all about. Completely steroid-free. A classic.

Though he is considered by many to be in the historical \\"Top Ten\\" of all players, his actual contribution on the field and his incredible statistics have not been fully appreciated.His retirement years have not been considered to the extent they deserve, as those post-1939 years seem to be overshadowed by his immortal words at Yankee Stadium in July of 1939. (And it's ironic and sad that the full speech is rarely referred to). This book covers that territory and provides many details on the disease itself; Gehrig fought that battle in the same \\"Iron Horse\\" manner that he applied to his profession.Some very interesting details are included that might surprise those who believe Lou was a uncomplicated, compliant, \\"company man\\". He was \\"Yankee\\" all the way but he did defy the powers-that-be on occasion.

The story of Lou Gehrig is so different from the modern sports star, it is hard to believe athletes like Gehrig once lived. Mr. Eig's biography is a story of a simpler time, when athletes were happy to have their jobs, and they lived much like the rest of society. Better paid, yes, but not so far above the rest of the working men that they no longer could relate.Lou Gehrig, in Eig's portrayal, was a humble, shy man. He appreciated his talent but did not think of himself as a superstar. Eig's book is best in portraying the environment of the 1920's and 1930's both on and off the field. One cannot but admire Gehrig's work ethic and dedication to his team and sport. Most poignant is Eig's new information on how much Gehrig struggled to fight his ALS. He stayed positive and kept as active as he could for as long as possible.Most modern players would be well served to read about past stars and understand how lucky they are to do what they do. Gehrig, of course, cared about money, but he was not obsessed with making the last nickel. He was a professional and his legacy was of a man who was a craftsman and most important a decent human being."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou Gehrig has always been a hero of mine even though I am not a Yankee fan. I have always be enamoured with the mythical Lou Gehrig and wanted to understand him as the person behind the myth and when I came across Eig's book I bought it without even opening the cover. Needless to say I am glad I did.Eig's writing style flows and as a result I rapidly flew through this book much faster than I had anticipated. It is a very easy and readable book that fills out the life of Lou Gehrig, giving insight into his personal life as well as his public one.I came away from this book with a much better understanding of Lou Gehrig and his times as well as an even deeper admiration for the man that I wish more athletes, both young and old would emulate."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This book is a great baseball biography on one of the most iconic Yankee Heroes: The Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig. I appreciated the way the author elaborated on his humble character and the hope he represented to America during the Great Depression. Apparently, he was much more than a baseball player. He was a great human being as well.I highly recommend this book to all Yankee and baseball fans."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"The title is very appropriate. Lou Gehrig called himself \\"the luckiest man\\" in his farewell speech at the Yankees' stadium. Among ALS patients in his time, he was very lucky. He was lucky to be physically talented to the degree he could play a game for a living - at the highest level. But he was very unlucky to be afflicted with ALS.The book also portrays him as a very modest, humble person who let his actions speak for him. Though quiet, he was gracious and respectful in his dealings with other people. His personal attributes, added to his baseball accomplishments earned him a huge outpouring of support from friends, fans, and associates in his struggle with ALS. Most ALS patients do not experience this level of attention and support. He considered himself lucky in this respect, but he also earned tremendous support by being the person he was.The main negative thing as I was reading the book: the author seemed to skip around in time and I was confused as to the sequence of events. A minor item: The baseball statistics at the end of the book are almost unreadable on my e-book."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"In depth story of Lou Gehrig, the early days of baseball and how the game evolved.Inspirational book about hard work and dedication. Also a very interesting historical perspective of baseball.If you like biographies, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I got back into baseball recently and have to say I enjoyed this book. The book is well written and flows nicely. It is a great story and he does it justice. I would recommend it to any baseball fan."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Exhaustive bio of baseball legend Lou Gehrig. More than a baseball book, this work describes the heroic journey of an American legend, a modest man who lived his life despite the dark storm clouds of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) looming large and cutting short a promising future. Eig's writing is so crystalline and crisp that you can feel the summer heat, taste the gritty dust and hear the crack of ball against bat. And when ALS strikes it's hard to keep eyes dry. This book is highly recommended for baseball fans and non-fans alike, the latter camp of which I am a staunch member."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"The most completely informative book on Lou Gehrig.. A pleasure to read and recommend it to anyone young and old!"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Just finished ready \\"Luckiest Man.\\" Much more than just a baseball storyor statistics, it was a marvelous biography of one of America's courageousheros, Lou Gehrig.I was very impressed with the way the author compiled and transformedhis research into an enlightening and entertaining read. As a longtimebaseball fan, I knew of Lou Gehrig, but in reading \\"Luckiest Man\\", I waseducated in some of the nuances about Gehrig and his disease. As I readthe book I found myself on more than one occassion practically being thereas Gehrig was trying out for the Giants, or hitting a game winning homerunfor the Yankees!Even towards the end of the book as Lou fell ill, the author documentedvery well how in his last few years Gehrig struggled to stay positiveand make sense of his ultimate battle.Kudos for author Eig for keeping Lou Gehrig's spirit alive and doing ourgeneration a favor in sharing his story! Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"The book progressed well with a good pace through each season.The use of previously unknown letters added more than just standard fare. It would be more interesting if his complete medical records existed and if his parents and associates had lived in an era when complete oral histories were done without embellishment."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"The life of Lou Gehrig is almost ready-made for the biographical treatment in pretty much any way imaginable. It contains the requisite amount of success, adversity, and drama to make it more compelling than anything a fiction writer could ever come up with.The great thing about this book, however, is that it follows the \\"K-I-S-S\\" (\\"keep it simple, stupid\\") method of writing. Whereas some bios will spend pages and pages talking about the lives of the subject's parents or other sometimes mundane details that only the most overly dedicated readers will enjoy, Eig instead gets right to the point. There are insights into Gehrig's character, to be sure, but Eig manages to pull them out without having to lay absolutely every detail on the table. This makes for a writing style that both the casual and seasoned sports fan (or anyone else, really) can enjoy, while still providing all the necessary information.Particularly of interest in \\"Luckiest Man\\" are the events the precipitated Gehrig's departure from baseball due to the ALS disease that now shares his name. It is at times both heartbreaking and inspiring to read how Lou dealt with the \\"bad break\\" as he so eloquently put it.Overall, \\"Luckiest Man\\" will highly appeal to both sports/baseball nuts and just the general reader looking for an interesting biographical tale. Don't for a second be scared that it ever might get bogged down in the details. Eig makes sure that doesn't happen and the text is readable (and enjoyable) by all."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This book was the best biography I have ever read. I absolutely hate the Yankees with all my heart, but this book makes you love the Yankees a little bit more. Eig gave a good balance of personal life and baseball life where he excelled in both. The only complaint I have is that the 2-3 chapters of ALS coverage was really boring. All the letters to read were a pain and I just wanted to get done with it, but don't be discouraged to read it because everything else is flawless."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Gehrig's place in baseball history is permanent, as a man he was admirable, but as a biographical subject he is difficult: there were no hair-raising stories of drinking and brawling and cheating and womanizing. If he did not die young of a terrible disease which now bears his name, he would have been remembered as a physically-gifted man who played hard for 2,131 consecutive games and then went home to his parents and wife. He had no vices except cigarettes. His main diversions were fishing and cards. How does one make this man come to life?Eig does so masterfully by placing Gehrig squarely in his times. This biography is a general survey of baseball and society in the 1920s and 1930s with Gehrig at the center. Eig describes the barnstorming baseball teams of the teens and 1920s, the advent of night baseball, contract negotiations, baseball strategy in the early \\"deadball\\" era, and the Rise and Fall of Babe Ruth. He introduces innumerable character studies of those who formed the constellation of Gehrig's life - his parents Christiana and Henry, his managers Miller Huggins and Joe McCarthy, Yankee boss Jacob Ruppert, innumerable teammates, his ambitious wife Eleanor, and ultimately his doctors at the Mayo Clinic and New York.It takes a while to warm up to the Iron Man - early on, his appears as a self-absorbed jock, albeit talented and hard-working. His fairly blank profile during the early years makes for a slow beginning. But over time, Eig's narrative reveals what a remarkable man Gehrig was. He was plagued by shyness and insecurities, was personally ambitious but always a teammate; and worked best within the top-down hierarchy of owners-managers-players. In his Farewell Speech at Yankee Stadium in 1939, he thanked, among many people in his life, his mother-in-law \\"who takes sides with you in squabbles against her own daughter.\\" How many mother-in-laws have been recognized in front of thousands at such bittersweet time?Eig turns pitch perfect phrases - describing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as \\"shutting down the body's functions, one-by-one, like a night-watchman switching off factory-floor lights.\\" He brings tiny details back to the reader - the weather during key games, the flapping of a flag, the pull of a muscle. This picture-painting is crucial in telling the story of a non-flashy athlete.Has there been a public life as ironical as The Iron Man's? He was a man-of-few-words who will forever live through his tear-jerking Farewell Speech; a wall-flower at parties who rose to fame during the flashy, publicity-crazed 1920s; and a superb physical specimen with arms the width of most men's thighs who died at 36 of a muscle-wasting disease that would bear his name. Eig tells his story with patience and humanity. The Gehrig that emerges was given a very bad break, but made the most of his time on Earth in a way few men ever have."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Eventually, there may be a more detailed account of the life of Lou Gehrig, but I doubt there will ever be one better.'Luckiest Man' is a well-written, nicely paced biography of a baseball legend that seems to get everything right.We all know the bullet points. One of the greatest to ever play the game gets tragically cut down by a rare disease that now, colloquially, bears his name. Eig takes that as a starting point, and expands upon it to paint a three-dimensional portrait of this great man.Eig gives you a decent idea of how scary good Gehrig really was. The way he ran the bases. The way he hit the ball. You'll yearn to see him play.The author shows Gehrig warts and all, as they say. His plain, simple demeanor. The thorny relationship between his mother and his wife. His insecurities. It felt very real, authentic.The Yankee career highs are high indeed. While Eig is more reporter than poet, those dizzying years of Ruth and Gehrig and baseball are no less intoxicating to read. Fun facts are sprinkled in...I never knew how Ruth and Gehrig got their jersey numbers. No WAY it was that simple! Names from baseball lore...Huggins, McCarthy, Ruppert, Wally Pipp, DiMaggio and of course, Ruth, form a cast of characters that most baseball junkies already sort of know. Those years...especially that magical 1927...seemed to be about as good as it got back then.This makes the decline we all know is coming is all the more agonizing.I felt this was the most powerful section of the book. This magnificent specimen of a human...the description of his body make you think he not born but hewn from a boulder at the foot of Mount Olympus...is inexorably chipped away by this horrific disease; it's painful to read.Gehrig's concern about his declining abilities, wondering what was happening to him, hit me hardest.I'm a doctor. I read those letters from Gehrig, printed here in the book. I've heard those words, those sentiments, from my patients. They broke my heart. He was scared, so scared. As any normal human being would be. This was REAL.Yet what he did...carrying on with his duties with the Yankees, or with a short-lived job on the Parole Board in NYC...despite being scared, despite his body being segmentally taken away from him, shows bravery in a way few people could ever manifest. You know he must have been told that his disease was incurable, yet he pressed on. Eig suggest he may have withheld the severity of his disease from his loved ones, to protect them. Such inner strength.As he lay in his room, the end nearing...mind you, I have some idea of what happens to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)...I can imagine only too clearly the nightmarish torture he was going through.I thought, how can somebody so weak be so strong?Jonathan Eig's book tells you exactly how.I was so caught up in the book, I didn't want Gehrig to die.How silly is that? I'm reading a non-fiction book, where I know what's going to happen, yet there was a little voice in my head saying, \\"Please no. Please no. Please no.\\"I was drained when I closed the book when I finished. Emotionally drained. This is some kind of book here.Be prepared for a bit of bitterness in the epilogue; the few women in his life certainly did not agree on much.I'm a baseball fan; I could have used a bit more baseball stories...I mean, there's a LOT in here, but I can never get enough of that sort of stuff.Other than that, this book belongs in the library of anyone who loves to read about baseball. I wished this book was longer...which is high praise, no?"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is the by far the best Gehrig book available (I named my son Gehrig and have probably read most of them). It gives a more personal look at him than the others. If you want statistics and information on his baseball exploits, this may not be the book for you. If you want to learn about a truly remarkable man of integrity, this book will offer you a glimpse of him that has not been offered before."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"If you enjoy first-rate biographies, this book is for you. And one need not be a baseball fan, either; I don't know an outfield assist from my a**, but I appreciate good writing and, boy, Jonathan Eig provides it in spades. This book provides all the requisites: Gehrig's humble formative years, his rise to fame with the powerhouse Yankees of the late 20s, the barnstorming tours with the \\"Larrupin' Lous\\" in the midst of the Great Depression, his steady, determined performance throughout the 30s, until his sad decline and eventual capitulation to the ravages of ALS. Eig's prose is insightful, lively, and laced with wry humor - he etches memorable portraits of Gehrig's parents, his headstrong but supportive wife, and a rogue's gallery of baseball players from a bygone era. Gehrig's unique and sometimes troubled relationship to the expansive and colorful Babe Ruth is given particular scrutiny. One smile-inducing description: \\"While it was clearer than ever that Gehrig was not cut out to be one of Ruth's closest chums, Gehrig still admired Ruth and Ruth still enjoyed being admired.\\"Best of all, Eig's book gives us the real Lou Gehrig - beyond the brief newsreel impressions, or the admiring but facile portrayal of the \\"Pride of the Yankees\\" film. After reading this compelling book, I have great admiration for this ambitious, hard-working, and yet insecure, modest and sensitive man, who demonstrated integrity and courage in both his professional and personal life."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Even though it's 70 years after Lou Gehrig ran the bases, Mr. Eig has crafted a moden masterpiece that brings this athlete to life before our eyes. We see his rise to stardom as a quiet hero, and we see his hearbreaking descent into the physical hell of ALS. The power of Eig's writing is this: everyone knows how this book will end, but even so, the final act will leave you weeping.What a man Gehrig was ! Strong, respectful, stoic, gentlemanly, polite. He played, lived, and especially died with grace and dignity. Eig has written a book that will haunt you. It is simply brilliant and well worth every dollar spent buying it and every minute spent reading it."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Luckiest Man by Jonathan Eig provides an engrossing, encompassing portrait of Lou Gehrig -- a complex man who despite his many insecurities became one of baseball's and America's finest heroes. Eig presents it all, ranging from Gehrig's growing up with a very domineering mother, to his humbleness and constant self-doubt despite his many outstanding achievements, to his relationships with his teammates and especially Babe Ruth, to his desire to let his actions rather than his mouth promote his abilities, to his relationship with women and his wife, and finally to his courage in battling the disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), that he contracted at the zenith of his careed and that ultimately took his life at the young age of thirty-six. Eig's skill as a writer is demonstrated by his ability to make you want to stay glued to your seat while absorbing a wealth of information about this fascinating man. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Luckiest Man -- just a person who enjoys learning about a man who deservedly has become an American icon."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate LUCKIEST MAN. Certainly there's enough diamond action to satisfy the sport fan, but Eig's objective seems to be more of a psychological analysis of the great Yankee clean-up hitter (Ruth hit third).Eig goes into great depth about Gehrig's relationship with his mother. Apparently no woman was good enough for her son. Gehrig was thirty before he finally took a wife and that seemed to be an act of desperation as he sent Eleanor a diamond necklace before they actually went out on a date.For me the best part of the book was when Gehrig found out he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Talk about grace under fire. Gehrig established a relationship with the doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, reminiscent of hero worship. He collected bats and balls and other baseball paraphernalia and sent them to the Rochester youth. He signed autographs as well as soliciting signatures from his teammates.Probably the saddest episode was Eig description of Gehrig's final eight days playing for the Yankees, during which time he repeatedly fell down, dropped throws, and managed only four hits. His manager, Joe McCarthy, refused to take him out. Gehrig finally removed himself from the lineup.The last third of the book deals with Gehrig's life after baseball. Eig recounts the entire farewell speech at Yankee stadium, something he had to piece together since the audience, including the sports writers, were so caught up in the speech that they only managed to copy parts of it.Eig then describes how Eleanor and the Mayo Clinic doctors handled Gehrig's treatment. Eleanor insisted they not tell him he was going to die. He underwent various treatments, including an immersion of vitamin E. Almost until the last he thought he had a 50/50 chance. He even took a job as a parole officer working for Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.Eig leans over backwards to avoid hagiography. He includes an anecdote from Rocky Graziano, who spent some time in the Tombs as a youth. Apparently Gehrig was so condescending that the Rock wanted to kill him. Eig also furnishes numerous examples of how tight Gehrig was with the penny and how submissive he was around authority figures. For instance, he never would have given his famous speech, if Joe McCarthy hadn't insisted.One of the greatest baseball movies ever made, The Pride of the Yankees, which garnered nine academy award nominations, was made about Gehrig. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it. Gary Cooper has Gehrig down pat. But see it in conjunction with reading Eig's book. The biography includes recently discovered letters Gehrig sent to the doctors at the Mayo Clinic as well as other inside information."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is truly a phenomenal book about a great individual. Lou Gehrig is someone that we all can aspire to and emulate. The book relates it all: his reserved character, his great baseball records and clutch hitting, and his experience with ALS. It is all here. Although I've read and seen and heard many examples of the \\"luckiest man\\" speech, this book does the best job that I've seen of sharing it - the background leading up to the day, Lou's humility during the speech and the results. (He received more letters from fans reacting to that speech than ever before.) Being a New York Yankee fan from way back in my youngster years, I was interested in reading about this great baseball hero. And heroic he was - the number of times that he won World Series games and his clutch hitting resulted in World Series wins which are related in some detail, even on a batter by batter basis. The fact that he was one of the best clutch hitters of all time (just look at his number of RBIs and grand slam home runs). This book is worth the read. It is great to read about such a great man so that we can all try to emulate him. After reading this book, I can truly say that Lou Gehrig was the greatest New York Yankee of all time."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Gehrig has reached such iconic status in baseball lore that for biographers he has become something like George Washington or Robert E. Lee --- almost impossible to write about without slipping into hagiography. I only reluctantly picked up this book because I was afraid that I would have to endure more hero-worship. Happily, this was not the case --- Eig has presented a well-balanced, well-written account.Eig's writing style struck me at first as being a little term-paperish, but by and large I found this to be easy to read. He is especially good at constructing the book in such a way that there is little foreshadowing of the onset of Gehrig's ALS...he really captures the feeling of a life that is moving along smoothly, business as usual, only to be suddenly derailed by an unexplainable ailment that changes as priorities. This was indeed the best feature of the book.Eig also --- thankfully --- avoids the typical traps of a sports biography. While he does discuss a number of Gehrig's on-field performances in some detail, his book does not simply read like an extended sports column. He has also done much better research into primary sources than a lot of sports biographers, and does cite his sources conscientously. He does not make Gehrig into a saint, nor does he treat Eleanor Gehrig with kid gloves. The reader gets to see Gehrig as a relatively colorless baseball star (if he had not died young, I think we would remember him today much as we remember Rogers Hornsby), but a man with driving ambition both on & off the field. Eleanor Gehrig, while not coming off as a gold-digger, nonetheless is portrayed as a wife who recognized her husband's unexploited potential and who worked hard to make her husband more marketable as a star athlete. The marriage was not a perfect one, and Eig does not try to over-romanticize it.Eig is not trying to be controversial, nor is he trying put Gehrig up on a pedestal. Instead, he has written a well-crafted biography which will probably stand as the definitive account of Gehrig's life for quite some time to come."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I'm a Yankee hater, but I loved this book. I always found the story of Lou Gehrig to be an inspirational one. Jonathan Eig did a great job of not only telling Gehrig's story, but also making you want to root for Gehrig to survive. At times I found myself forgetting that he dies in the end, only wanting to read more about his amazing feats on the ball field. A great book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Looking through the glass of hindsight, everyone just flat out looks better. Life is funny that way. If you were mean in reality, history may classify you as \\"gritty.\\" If you were thoughtful, history may remember you as \\"genius.\\" Or if you were fat, you may be labeled as \\"stout and strong.\\" The story of Lou Gehrig is not necessarily an example of this. In reality I will never know. The author will probably not know either. Lou is painted as larger than life in \\"Luckiest Man.\\" He was thoughtful, kind, humble, and amazing. Not only that, but he brought to the public the story of ALS and its affects. It became real and tangible to the whole world. His personal health tragedy no doubt amplifies his kinder qualities, as it would in most people's remembrance. Not to say it is undeserved, but in this book, it seems exaggerated. Gehrig is not really made into a real person. He is made into a monolithic figure. In baseball, he was one, but in his personal life, he would have hated this.I have always had a soft spot for heroes, especially heroes in baseball. No doubt Lou Gehrig is a hero in this regard. He played in the shadow of one of the largest figures in history, Babe Ruth. Not only did he thrive, but he made a name for himself that, in my opinion, out shined Ruth on the field. No one could outshine him off of it. I have no doubt that if the opposite had occurred, Ruth would never have made it in Gehrig's shadow. His accomplishments, unlike his character and personality, are in black and white. His statistics say it all. Amazing in his steadfast play, he also shone when it counted most, the World Series. Back in those days baseball meant something to everyone, and he had the privilege of playing and delivering in those times.Gehrig was a great role model, and a great player. His character and approach to the game are things I would teach my children, and plan to. These type of stories may not be completely true, but sometimes it is the legend and myth that build from simple beginnings that can shape our lives and build on our own morality."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I read several books a week, however despite being a big basball fan have not read one on this subject in well over a year. My dog recently passed away and I thought this title could be just the ticket help lift my spirits. Although not a short book, I became obsessed with finishing it and did so in just 3 days. I was compelled by not only Gerhig's story, but also the writing style of Mr. Eig, the author. If you are looking on the definitive story on Lou Gerhig's growth, baseball career, personal life, disease and death-look no further.What I thought Eig did particularly well was pacing. I never felt as if he dwelled too long on any particular subject and understood what the average reader/baseball fan would find compelling. Eig also did a good job of not being too dramatic regarding Gerhig's ALS disease, which would have been easy to do. Overall, if you are a baseball fan-this is a must read. Gerhig is as important a historical figure in this game as there is. I was especially pleased that Eig has a newer book out about Jackie Robinson's first year in the majors. That will be my next read.Also, one cannot help but be somewhat overwhelmed at the courage Mr. Gerhig showed in the face of this terminal disease. I certainly feel lucky after reading it."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I felt a connection to the story which surprised me.I lived in Rochester, MN for most of the 90s, I've been to many of the places outlined in the book, I worked for the Rochester newspaper, which has several mentions, and I've seen the Lou's cancelled check, which is on display at the Mayo clinic.From that background, I felt this as a completely real story of both heroism and tragedy. This is real stuff, a completely honest telling of the rise and fall of a man who might have been any of us."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is a wonderful book that really takes you into the life of Lou Gehrig and reveals so many details about the man. It's written with compassion and a real flair for the language. I don't think it's just a baseball book. It would appeal to anyone who loves a fascinating story about a great life, or a struggle against adversity. The most amazing part is the letters that Eig found between Gehrig and his doctor. How often do you get an inside look at a true celebrity in his bravest, most personal moments while fighting a terrible fate? This is a tale of a real baseball hero, how nice to read when baseball heroes are hard to find."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This was a very insightful book as there were alot of insights behind the scenes and how Lou's upbringing impacted him in life.

I also enjoyed Edward Hermann's superb job ofnarration."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it reads like a novel. Lou Gehrigs's life reads like Roy Hobbs' life in \\"The Natural,\\" by Bernard Malamud (not the movie!). Both men are gifted and decent players, whose lives and careers are cut short by disease. I'm a long-time fan of both Gehrig and baseball, and was captivated by Eig's writing, and the details he put down about baseball back then, as well as Gehrig's life.Superb."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I've just finished reading this book and throughly enjoyed it. Just this week there was discussion in baseball about a true World Series in August, involving players playing for their home countries. Gary Sheffield, present day Yankee already said he would not play since he does not get paid for that. Real Yankees like Gehrig, Ruth and Mantle must turn in their graves when they hear this. The Yankees one year played in doubleheaders five days in a row in August and Gehrig playing in all games. On off days the owner would force them to play exibition games (read that again if you don't believe it). Gehrig gets beamed in a game in Norfolk, Virginia on an off day, taken to the hospital and plays the next day in New York. The writer adds all of these interesting facts which I had no idea. The book is about Gehrig, his family life, both with his parents and with his wife. He also wanted to be an actor. The mother and wife relationship was very interesting. I read the DiMaggio book and in some ways enjoyed that more but saw Diaggio in a whole different light after finishing that book. This book also makes me see Gehrig in a all different light. Except for the author's occassionaly mentioning of Gehrig's cheapness with money, Gehrig was an unbelievable figure. I could only imagine if he entered some other line of work, doctor, teacher, science, who knows what he could have accomplished. He was Superman before Superman existed.The book contains many interesting little known facts, too many to list here, it is a quick read and you will feel very good after reading this book."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Major League Baseball has proven to be a resilient national pastime. It has weathered Senate investigations, anti-trust violations and scandals of various sorts. In this steroid tainted season, Eig revives Baseball's dignity once again through the stirring specter of Lou Gehrig.Eig revisits Gehrig's illustrious career with the determination and dedication of the \\"Iron Horse\\" himself. The author's passion for detail reveals new insights into the Gehrig persona, his family, and his relationships. The author addresses topics that biographers feared were taboo. Eig exposes all facets of Gehrig's life and debunks several myths. We see his character flaws and strengths, and his desperate struggle against ALS. Rather than tarnishing Gehrig's image, Eig is able to humanize the legend. In this manner Gehrig's accomplishments become grander and his personal battles become more poignant.This book is a well-researched, gritty biography of a remarkable and courageous man. The reading can get dry and tedious at times though. The author assumes the role of a stoic \\"play-by-play commentator\\" rather than the role of a fluffy \\"color commentator.\\" The true testament to Eig's work is that the reader comes to understand Gehrig's motivations and share a real tear with him as he emotes, \\"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\\""},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Well Gehrig of course played well before my time and my earliest memories of him come from Gary Cooper's portrayal of him in one of the finest sports movies ever. As good as the film was it was still \\"Hollywood\\" and Jonathan Eig's book really brings the whole story home about this giant of a sports legend. Gehrig was pretty much the polar opposite of the more flamboyant Babe Ruth. A quite, unassuming son of German Immigrants whose shyness presented what was perceived as a somewhat dull personality.It's a classic story of the poor kid growing up in a rough area as his mother strove to provide a better life for her son and the father who comes off as less supportive than his movie counterpart. You see Gehrigs rise to the big leagues and that fateful day when he took over for Wally Pipp to begin his streak of 2130 straight games, a streak which lasted over 50 years. His relationship with Ruth was indeed interesting and one gets the feeling that each were a bit amused by the other.The book moves along well but as we move into Gehrig's latter career, and the onset of ALS in 1938, it does become painful to read. That's something that wasn't nearly covered as strongly or tragically in the film. Now so many years later we have a greater understanding of what ALS is it makes Gehrig's strength and determination to play on that much more heroic. Eig's thorough research provides the most comprensive look at the life and career of one of baseball's all-time greats. A true legend and role-model. We could use a Lou Gehrig today!"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou Gehrig has risen beyond mortality, into mythology. His life and death are part of our lore more than our common history. But Eig does a beautiful job of chronicling both in human, concrete terms, not in the poetic abstractions of baseball memory. Don't get me wrong: I love the poetic abstractions of baseball, but here we get a glimpse of the kind of flesh-and-blood hero we haven't had for a long time, engaged in a rise and fall unlike any we see in a media-saturated 21st century.Eig's writing is full of the pain, celebration, quiet nobility and raw physical strength that made Lou Gehrig. The fact that a sports figure remains a figure worth our money, time and interest 60 years after he died is testament to his contribution to the sport and the impact of his personal courage.Gehrig wasn't without flaws. Rather he was a perfect antithesis to teammate Babe Ruth, a significantly flawed fella who wasn't without his personal qualities. Together, they stand as icons of the golden age of the sport, and Eig's biography pointedly (and poignantly) paints Gehrig as a myth-in-the-making, utterly unaware of his deity-to-be.And that's how it should be."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"In his biography of Lou Gehrig, Jonathon Eig offers up a portrait of an iron willed individual, complex to a fault, who achieved the highest level of success in a sport dominated by oversize personalities such as Ruth, Cobb,and Alexander. Lou may not have had the talent of those men , but his work ethic and boy scout persona honed his skills to the extent he became the greatest offensive force in the game in the late 1920's and 30's. Not just a portrait of a superior athelete, Luckiest Man examines Lou's struggles with the disease which would become linked with his name. A wonderful read which draws you into the golden age of sports,providing a link from Babe Ruth to Joe Dimaggio, Luckiest Man is a rare sports bio which offers a dose of humanity of such a complex man ."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Like most people I had heard of Lou Gehrig. But I didn't know much about him beyond his being part of the great Yankee teams and the ALS that struck him early in life. So I picked up this book with the idea of reading something baseball related during Spring training. I'm glad I did.I appreciate how this books tells a story. It doesn't guess, it doesn't project, and it doesn't over dramatize. It just tells the story of an amazing man. And what a man Lou Gehrig was. I have a much deeper appreciation for him after reading this book.If you love baseball, you'll love this book. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Jonathan Eig has given his 2005 biography of Lou Gehrig the title \\"Luckiest Man\\", Gehrig's own description of himself; but he has added the ominous subtitle \\"The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig\\". Perhaps Gehrig, more than any other athlete, is remembered as much for his tragic death as his victorious life. He has been called the best first baseman in the history of baseball; and Babe Ruth may have been the Sultan of the Swat with his 714 home runs, but Gehrig certainly wasn't backward with his 493. Consider also that Ruth's career lasted 21 years, Gehrig's only 16. A brobdingnagian teenager, he received his first serious attention playing football, not baseball, and he was considered one of the biggest and strongest players ever to stand on the diamond, playing 2,130 consecutive games, voted MVP in '27 and '36. Eig balances Gehrig's personal and professional lives skillfully. Born and raised in New York of German stock, Henry Louis Gehrig (he was nearly named Heinrich after his father) spent his early manhood dominated by the Game and by his mother, one of those quietly oppressive women who didn't think any girl was good enough for her Lou. By the time he was thirty he was discontentedly still a bachelor when he met Eleanor Twitchell, a strong-willed woman who decided she was going to be Lou's wife, Mama or no Mama. Needless to say, the two Mrs Gehrigs never got along. (Eleanor had been a part of Babe Ruth's somewhat louche social set, which raised a few eyebrows. Of the 35 photos in the book there is one showing Ruth giving Gehrig a friendly wrestling hug, but the two men didn't really care for each other.) Like many athletes in that period Gehrig was offered parts in Hollywood, including the role of Tarzan, which Johnny Weissmuller had just vacated. He wasn't too successful. In fact, Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, wrote Gehrig: \\"Having seen several pictures of you as Tarzan ... I want to congratulate you on being a swell first baseman\\". But for the most part Gehrig was indeed lucky: solvent, popular, happily married. Then in 1938 the problems started, a weakness, an instability that affected his game. They became so obvious he finally went to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where the awful diagnosis was made: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which became known in America as Lou Gehrig's disease. (In Europe ALS is known as Charcot's disease, named for a 19th Century French physician. The average European, of course, has no idea who Lou Gehrig was.) Gehrig struggled valiantly, but his condition deteriorated till one June 1939 afternoon in Kansas City he caught a line drive which knocked him flat on his back. He never played professional ball again, and three weeks later he made his famous speech in Yankee Stadium. Eig seems to have researched his book very well, but there are some odd lapses: another reader has pointed out that Eig refers to Kenesaw \\"Mountain\\" Landis, as though Mountain was a nickname, which it wasn't. There is also a reference to Billy Graham which in context is anachronistic; I suspect Eig meant Billy Sunday. But this is a warm biography, and in the end we see how appropriate Eig's subtitle is. Gehrig's life was one of Herculean achievements, but his early death turned that life into mythic legend."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"As a Columbia graduate, I liked to stand on the porch of Butler Library and guess where home plate was when the Columbia baseball team played their home games on South Field, of which all that remains is a large lawn split in two by a long sidewalk. Gehrig's legendary home run that broke a window in the Journalism building was a long shot to left-center field. Gehrig remains one of Columbia's two most famous dropouts, the other being Alexander Hamilton (whose studies were interrupted when the College closed for the American Revolution).Despite his fame, Gehrig is much less known than his famous teammate, Babe Ruth, who was larger than life in so many ways. Unlike Ruth, he came from a solid family and remained close to his parents, who were not so happy about his dropping out of school to play professional baseball. And his wife was not exactly the angelic figure, as she was portrayed in Pride of the Yankees.Eig brings the whole man to life: his insecurities, the tension between his wife and parents, his feeling overshadowed by Babe Ruth and how his public persona did not crystallize until he was diagnosed with Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (better known as Lou Gehrig's disease). And you get to see some of what pushed him to play 2,130 consecutive baseball games, despite having broken every finger at least once. And you finally understand how a man who knew he was dying could call himself \\"the happiest man on the face of the earth.\\""},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This was a gift for my uncle, who they suspect has Lou Gehrig's Disease....and he's not a reader...but has really enjoyed this book...and has related to it, and gotten some comfort from it. To me, that makes this a very wise investment."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is a review of the Lou Gehrig biography, \\"Luckiest Man,\\"written by Jonathan Eig and published by Simon and Schuster in 2005.For those who do not know, Lou Gehrig was the stalwart, slugging firstbaseman of the legendary Babe Ruth-led New York Yankees team that roaredthrough the 1920s and eventually morphed into the streamlined Joe DiMaggio-led Bronx Bombers of the 1930s.The subtitle of this biography is \\"The Life And Death Of Lou Gehrig,\\"which accurately describes the contents of this book. But that subtitledoes not accurately describe the gracefulness with which this book iswritten.The book does a very good job describing Gehrig's early years, the struggleto survive and how his German immigrant parents sacrificed much so theirLouie could have the best they could afford. And, unlike many children,young Lou Gehrig understood and appreciated their efforts which surely inspired him to go to great lengths to achieve what he did although his parentsdid not really understand the concept of professinal sports.But where this book really shnes is the printing of the many letters from Lou Gehrig to his wife discussing the possibilites of the fatal diseaseand detailing his fight to beat what eventually he had to accept washis killer.Lou Gehrig was an admirable man to the very end and I recommendthis book to anyone as a source of inspiration, a baseball biography,a treatise on American life a century ago or just a good read.The film, THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES is still one of the all-time great baseballmovies as well as a darn good biography. And Gary Cooper really does resembleLou Gehrig in many ways except his voice. Lou Gehrig had what we would call a New York accent and if you want to see /hear him in action he did star in a 1937 B western called RAWHIDE that, while no great shakes as a movie, displays what Lou Gehrig really talked like and even how he carried hmself in real life.So I have rated Jonathan Eig's \\"Luckiest Man, \\" five stars because it echos,in its prose and its subject, a man who we were lucky to sort of know, even at the great distance of many decades."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"fast read, interesting for both a sports fan or not. the game today needs more lou gerhig's."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This book was suggested by a Social worker at the VA Hospital. I was told I have Lou Gehrig's or ALS diesease. I am interested and learning about the Mam thus Disease gets its name from. This book has the whole history of the New York Yankees. If You are a history buff this book will be for you. I have not finished the book but continue to read it each day. not only for the history but for an insight on what living with ALS will incure. I was happy I found the book on Amazom.com for duch a low price."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"If you're looking for an exhaustive biography of Gehrig, one of the best to ever grace a diamond, look no further. Eig has written a wonderful book that gives great insight into not only Gehrig the player, but also Gehrig the man.It's obvious from the discussion of his upbringing that Gehrig was not a \\"typical\\" Yankee star, one who would enjoy the bright lights and fame. As a child, and continuing into his adult life, he was a shy, modest person who wanted only to work hard and do his best. His relationship, or lack thereof, with fellow superstar Babe Ruth, is given a lot of coverage, and is one of the more interesting aspects of the book. Given Gehrig's background and social anxieties, it's not really surprising that he and Ruth (along with other teammates) never seemed to mesh.While the coverage given to his seasons with the Yankees is comprehensive, it's the anecdotes and off-the-field stuff that really add to the existing knowledge we have of Gehrig. And even when we know towards the end of the book exactly what's going to happen, Eig still manages to present the onset of his illness and eventual death dramatically, without simply playing on emotions. I was surprised to learn that his ALS had begun its onset in '38, and not a year later when he was forced to call it quits.Eig presents Gehrig well, without romanticizing him or turning his book into a hagiography. While I think any baseball fan will love this book, I don't think being a fan of the sport is a prerequisite to enjoyment. This is a great biography of a genuinely good man, one who always seemed unsure about being in the spotlight. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I have read other previous biographies on Lou Gehrig such as Ray Robinson's effort entitled \\"Iron Horse\\" and Frank Graham's book entitled \\"Lou Gehrig: A Quiet Hero\\". Both books are well done, but Jonathan Eig's book is the most in-depth effort on Gehrig to date. Gehrig had an over-bearing and protective mother and a passive insecure father. While Lou had great admiration and respect for his mother, her influence probably contributed to Lou's insecurities regarding himself. Lou's mother viewed his wife as a threat to her control over her son, and both mother and mother-in-law were in constant conflict over the son and husband. Even after Lou's death the wrangling continued over Lou's estate. The author provides ample coverage of Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day on July 4, 1939, when Gehrig delivered his Gettysburg Address speech at Yankee Stadium between games of a doubleheader between the Yankees and the Washington Senators. Significant coverage is also provided on ALS, the disease that now carries Gehrig's name. Gehrig always expressed his appreciation for the care he received at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and exchanged letters with physicians in charge of his care. He always looked for miniscule signs that may indicate the disease wasn't getting any worse, but by the spring of 1941 he knew it was just a matter of time before the inevitable took place. This book is also a rare treat in that it isn't laced with profanity. If you have a young reader around ten years old who is reading at an advanced level, feel free to give them this book as a gift. It will be one that will be appreciated for years to come.P.S.--I don't know why Amazon lists this as from an \\"Audio CD.\\" This review is from the hardcover book."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"In his brief 37 years, Lou Gehrig couldn't catch a break. Incredibly shy, he never cashed in on his movie-star looks. He adored his mother, but she sabotaged the few relationships he had enough courage to persue. When he finally did marry, the two women in his life quarreled endlessly, a rift that would remain even after his death. As a ball player, Gehrig was too insecure to seek the salary he deserved, always fearing that his next paycheck might be his last. When he became a star, his personality and accomplishments were overshadowed by the larger-than-life presence of Babe Ruth, and after the Babe retired, it was a young Joe DiMaggio who caught the public's fancy. Struck by a fast-moving fatal illness, the Yankees held Lou Gehrig Day on July 4, 1939, but not a single media outlet recorded the entirely of his famous farewell speech. And when death came, two years later, even the birth date on his tombstone was wrong.As a fellow journalist who routinely deals with rigorous fact-checking, I congratulate Jonathan Eig on one of the most meticulously researched -- and thoroughly sourced -- sports biographies I've come across. I am on my third reading, and each time I soak up something new from every chapter. \\"Luckiest Man\\" is a smooth-flowing, well-organized masterpiece that unearths precious new details about this admired, enigmatic, and intensely private figure.Unlike the gushing Gehrig biographies of yesteryear, Eig goes beyond baseball, the statistics, and myth of the the Iron Horse, or Biscuit Pants as his teammates sometimes called him, to reveal an individual of tremendous character, but entirely human. Gehrig was a misfit. In an era when ballplayers were swashbuckling tough guys, \\"Columbia Lou\\" was a sensitive college boy. While his teammates were carousing, Gehrig's joy was to indulge in simple pleasures -- going to the movies, fishing on Long Island Sound aboard his little row boat, and returning home after a game to eat dinner with his parents. He was a loner who smoked too much and hated to part with a buck. When the Yankees lost or he failed in the clutch, he sulked, even cried.Eig's year-by-year chronicle of Gehrig's maturation is fascinating. But what makes this book truly remarkable is the treasure trove of largely unknown correspondence the author has tracked down. It reminds us that Gehrig's real greatness had little to do with home runs and runs batted in. In a series of deeply personal letters he wrote to his wife, Eleanor, and the doctors who treated him in the final two years of his life, we get to peak inside the heart and mind of a man who knew he was going to die, yet one who showed no bitterness or anger -- only hope and concern for those around him.Through his own words, we learn how ALS sapped Gehrig of his strength day by day, the treatments he sought, his unflinching optimism, the friendships he made, and how he tried to live a normal life as his body withered away.For all of its sadness, \\"Luckiest Man\\" is an uplifting story of a role model for the ages. Jonathan Eig has given us a gift to cherish."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I'm not as avid a sports fan as many of my friends, and I haven't read many sports bios. This book, though, surpasses the usual expectations for sports books. Reading it is like reading a vivid fictional book with many fascinating characters who seem bigger than life yet with imperfections and flaws, too.I'm sure any baseball/Yankees fan who like to read would get a lot out of this book. Anyone who is curious about Lou Gehrig should obviously read it. But its appeal for me went beyond baseball because it just tells the story of a humble and great man who lived a short, brave life and struggled with a terrible illness he could not understand. These are all powerful themes in and of themselves, but Eig clearly uses the English language to make Gehrig's story even more inviting. I kept reading waiting to get to a dull sentence or a cliche, but did not...it's just page after page of lean, tight writing and colorful detail, like a really good New York Times feature story.Eig tells an old story but in so many ways it is timely. It's pretty interesting to read about Gehrig and his baseball friends who played for the love of the game in much simpler times, for money that may have been big in their time but not hugely extravagant, the way sports contracts are today. They didn't complain about fans or the media. Baseball was starting to be a business, yes, but not Big Business. The players didn't take steroids or say that anything about their behavior was justified because they were just \\"entertainers.\\" They were honest and hard-working athletes. They signed autographs and felt flattered to do it. It's just so refreshing to learn about how baseball used to be.The final parts of the book, about his ALS, are grim and tragic but tell so much about the strength of Gehrig, and the author found a lot of material (like letters to Gehrig's doctor, talking about the disease). It's all fascinating, and makes you understand ALS and feel for its victims.To sum up, I'm glad I bought this and think you would not be sorry to read it if you are excited by baseball, enjoy solid biographies, the history of the 1920s-1930s, books about heroic fights against illness, or if you just like colorful-but-true writing that's not at all difficult to read."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Jonathan Eig does a wonderful job painting a human portrait of Lou Gehrig and evoking an earlier time. His rendering of Gehrig isn't designed to mythologize the man; it offers a more complete picture than that. Still, you can't help but gain greater respect and admiration for The Iron Horse.This book -- like Tom Stanton's \\"Hank Aaron and the Home Run That Changed America\\" -- is a welcome diversion from baseball's current steroids scandal. Along with \\"Three Nights in August,\\" these three rate as my favorites this baseball season."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is an amazing book. Eig has done a ton of research (check out the list of primary sources in the back!), and lets you see Gehrig as a man, not just through his stats as a baseball player. After reading this book, I really felt like I had some insight into Lou Gehrig's personality, his upbringing, his motivation, and especially his courage as he faced a slow death from ALS. By seeing Gehrig as a complete person, including his faults, I believe Gehrig becomes even more of a hero.This book is very well written and could be enjoyed by baseball historians, casual fans, and those who might only know the name Lou Gehrig. I'm proud to have this book on my shelf next to great baseball writers like Lawrence Ritter, Robert Creamer, and Harold Seymour."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is a wonderful, well-written book. The amount of research and attention to detail put into this book is easy to see. Not just research about Lou Gehrig's life and career, but about the disease that now bears his name--ALS. When I read about the changes in Lou Gehrig's body I could see them happening as they did in my father who also suffered from ALS.More importantly, however, Lou Gehrig stopped being baseball statistics and the man with the disease--he became a person."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou was brought up in the early 1900's-1910's in the (then)German immigrant section of Yorkville-NYC. His father appears as a ne'er do well, his mother a hard worker doing about anything to keep her family going. In fact, many of Lou's siblings died of childhood diseases now hardly ever killers. So Lou had more than the usual obstacles to overcome. Fortunately, Lou's mom got a job working as a housekeeper at a Columbia fraternity, which helped Lou into the Columbia extension school program. Definitely not a great scholar, Lou was a record smashing player at Columbia, at first shunned by scouts because he had a tough time hitting a curve ball, a problem Lou worked on, and eliminated. Shy and introspective,somewhat of a mama's boy, the portrayal in THE MOVIE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES seems very close to the mark! When Wally Pipp, a very formidible Yanks 1st Baseman, was injured, it seemed clear as day that Lou would take over for a long time, 2130 games to be exact! The \\"Quiet Man\\" of the great Yank teams of the 1920's and 1930's proved to be the perfect man for the job, a nice foil to the wild and crazy Babe Ruth! Lou's long career and life are beautifully done, through his famous LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE speech, and his sad and slow death of Lou Gehrigs Disease.A perfect biography, and with a photo of an upcoming singer/actor/autograph seeker named Frank Sinatra with Lou from the 1939 World Series. Needless to say, how many Pro Athletes today have the character of LOU GEHRIG!"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I've never read a Lou Gehrig biography before, Ray Robinson's book having been long out of print for most of my adulthood. I'm not sure how well Jonathan Eig's \\"Luckiest Man\\" will be regarded by future generations, but it does serve as an excellent early-21st-century look at one of baseball's great icons. Its well-researched year-by-year account reminded me somewhat of Leigh Montville's look at Ted Williams, or Mark Kriegel's recent Joe Namath bio -- albeit with fewer scandalous revelations.Perhaps Lou Gehrig's reputation did need a little bit of restoration. The term \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\" has become a laugh-out-loud punchline on recent episodes of \\"Family Guy\\" and \\"The Sopranos\\". His consecutive games streak has long since been eclipsed by Cal Ripken, and his signature sentence -- \\"Today, I consider the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\\" -- has been so misused (showing up most out of place in Don Sutton's Hall of Fame acceptance speech) that it still comes as a jolt to remember that Gehrig was dying when he said it.Far from a trashy expose, \\"Luckiest Man\\" celebrates Gehrig's ballfield heroics and personal integrity, while showing how Gehrig was a late bloomer in thrall to his mother who had only just started to come out of shell when tragedy struck. The years fly by and the accomplishments pile up, while Eig methodically works through the evolution of Gehrig's subservient relationships with his mother, Babe Ruth, and finally, his future wife.The descriptions of New York City during Gehrig's youth are quite evocative. Manhattan was a much larger place back then, with the cultural divide between the snooty Upper East Side of Jacob Ruppert, and the Yorkville of Gehrig's impoverished youth being highlighted here. Such differences in today's Manhattan are belied by the fact that you can walk from one place to the other in less than ten minutes.Similarly compelling is Eig's breakdown of how ALS struck Gehrig stage by stage over the final three years of his life. These symptoms are supported by newspaper clippings from the 1938 baseball season, and then by quotes from correspondence Gehrig traded with his Mayo Clinic doctors. This is remarkable research, although with a somewhat morbid end result as we see Gehrig dying by inches. Eig does have the decency at least to pull the cameras back a little bit and allow Gehrig's death to occur in shadow.On a smaller note, Eig also reminds us frequently of Gehrig's child-of-immigrants Bronx accent, which was captured not at all by Gary Cooper in the dated film \\"Pride of the Yankees\\". Listen especially to how each man pronounces the word \\"Earth\\". This is certainly the most authentic account of Lou Gehrig we're likely to see, either in print or on film."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Reading this book made me wonder, \\"Are there any men of this caliber of character in MLB today?\\" My immediate answer would be, \\"No.\\" Who in today's big leagues would feel almost embarassed to get a raise? Who would play for such a quiet love of the game?A ballplayer from the 80s, Ryne Sandberg, does come to mind. Of course, he was nowhere the player of Gehrig (who is?), but he always seemed like a gentleman who gave it his all.God Bless Lou Gehrig and all he stood for. Read this book if you want to be inspired by a genuine American role model and hero."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Paints an informed and vivid picture of a complicated man with an inspiring and unbelievable work ethic. Great for baseball fans, but also great for anyone seeking inspiration in the face of adversity. Often when talented people are brought down in the prime of their lives, they become martyrs and their accomplishments are embellished over time. For the story of Lou Gehrig's life and death, martyrdom and embellishment are neither necessary nor appropriate, and Jonathan Eig skillfully avoids both of them. One can only wonder how long Lou Gehrig's streak would have lasted had he not been stricken at such a young age."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Author Jonathan Eig has written a nice tribute to the player they called \\"The Iron Horse\\", Lou Gehrig. Gehrig would have stood out in his life and career, anyway, but his tragic, early death made him that much more of an attractive and historic figure in baseball.The first two thirds of \\"Luckiest Man\\" describe Gehrig as a shy but pleasant sort of person....the antithesis of Babe Ruth. That the two men ever got along is astonishing. Gehrig's closeness to his mother is revealing, but not surprising, given the make-up of his character. Yet Eig's narrative here is ploddy and uninspiring. Turning the pages in this part of the book is not something one does grippingly.However, the final chapters of \\"Luckiest Man\\" suddenly come alive as Gehrig begins to confront his disease and his destiny. Eig's narrative changes....the sentences become longer and his words take on a propelling force. The author's description of \\"Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day\\" at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939 fills in many of the gaps for those of us who have seen the few snippets of film from that day. Best of all, Gehrig's conversations and letters to his doctors at the Mayo Clinic, especially Dr. Paul O'Leary, have a poignant quality and Eig begs the question, \\"to what extent did the doctors tell Gehrig that his demise was most likely to occur?\\" and \\"how much could Gehrig surmise about his own condition?\\" These questions make a central, compelling case to read \\"Luckiest Man\\"."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Luckiest Man. The 4 Stars rating is due to being \\"The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig\\" I was slightly very little about the legacy and continuation of the respect that MLB and the Yankee faithful have for Gehrig.The entire book is riddled with even the tiniest details about Gehrigs childhood and his upbringing, and even teachs a fair bit about ALS. 5 of 5 stars for the first 7/8ths of the book by far...just left me wishing for more about his legacy after his passing.Excellent read if you want to learn about the Murderers Row Yankees and one of the Greatest Yankees of all time."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou Gehrig is a heroic icon; yet his very name elicits paradoxical, contradictory images: one a ballplayer of seemingly indestructible endurance, the other a victim of a disease (which now bears his name) that irrevocably destroyed his exquisite body. Jonathan Eig's perceptive, compassionate and authoritative biography, \\"Luckiest Man,\\" will not only cement Gehrig's lofty status in our national consciousness; it permits us to understand Gehrig as a conflicted, complex and compelling man. Eig invests the \\"Iron Horse\\" with a humanity that corrects the media-created image of Gehrig as the earnest Yankee, the quiet but machine-like second-fiddle to the flambouyant Babe Ruth. Painstakingly researched, \\"Luckiest Man\\" is deeply moving. Several passages simply cannot be read without our own tears belatedly joining the thousands that were shed when Gehrig gave his short, storied speech reverently remembered for its gracious and humbling self-description of Gehrig as a \\"lucky man.\\" It is the reader who is lucky for the experience of reading Eig's stirring work.The Lou Gehrig that emerges in Eig's biography is that of a man whose tremendous physical talent hid an ego that was painfully insecure. The only surviving child of an immigrant family whose powerful mother established the emotional atmosphere of the home, Gehrig consistently wrestled with his sense of self. As Eig noted, \\"He was built to conquer, yet programmed for failure.\\" A sensitive and inquisitive man, \\"he lived and worked in an environment in which the expression of deep thoughts incited teasing.\\" He consecrated his life to a work-ethic modeled by his mother; he believed in following the rules established by his managers, playing the game he loved with complete devotion and eschewing publicity for most of his career. Eig thoroughly debunks the notion that Gehrig was not aware of his consecutive game streak. Gehrig played through broken bones, concussions and back pain, proud that he \\"had built a legacy on determination and grit.\\" Never taking a day off -- establishing a record for endurance -- became a \\"bigger\\" goal with each game, a streak Gehrig \\"cherished.\\"By the 1930s, Gehrig had become a symbol for the hard times of the Great Depression. He was \\"durable, dependable and dignified.\\" He gloried in dedication, and he believed in hard work. \\"No one prepared better for a game...and no one hustled harder on the field.\\" He \\"flung his body over railings to catch foul balls\\" and often used his bare hand to catch poor throws to first base. Gehrig said, \\"There is no excuse for a player not hustling.\\"These archtypical American values were not in vogue when Gehrig broke in with the Yankees in the 1920s. Those years belonged to Babe Ruth, the living embodiment of the Jazz Age. Eig paints a complicated relationship between the two men -- Ruth, larger-than-life, libertine in lifestyle and perpetually forgiving; Gehrig, the company man, painfully shy around women and content to simply do his job better than anyone else. It was a contrast between \\"the mama's boy and the rascal.\\"In truth, Gehrig's greatest challenges occurred off the diamond. Unapologetically bound to his mother, Chrstina, Gehrig did not attain any semblance of adult maturation until he married the headstrong and dynamic Eleanor Twitchell. Eig chronicles how Eleanor encouraged Gehrig to capitalize on his name, to open himself to the possibilities of tasting life, to develop what we would now label emotional intelligence. It is with his beloved wife we see Gehrig sobbing at the opera \\"Tristan and Isolde.\\" It is his trusted wife whom he cannot stand the idea of disappointing. Even when stricken with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Gehrig endeavored to lessen her worry, her discomfort, her fears. Through Eig's sensitive descriptions, we see Gehrig as a loving man.Eig makes ALS understandable and places the disease in historical perspective. The general, and understandable, ignorance of the medical community made diagnosis difficult and treatment haphazard and variable. Though Eig shares Gehrig's admiration for the Mayo Clinic, the author does not share the patient's absolute belief in it. In fact, when the Mayo Clinic finally made public Genrig's condition, it did so with an inept and inaccurate allusion to polio. This misinformation led sportswriters to not only preposterous assertions, but downright ugly ones. One benighted scribe blamed Gehrig for infecting his teammates with his energy-sapping disease, thus causing an early season Yankee slump.Just as Lou Gehrig took demonstrable pride in his craft, Jonathan Eig has done so with his writing talents in \\"Luckiest Man.\\" It is obvious that the author respects and admires his subject, but his biography is never fawning. \\"Luckiest Man\\" is meticulously researched (it contains nearly 30 pages of footnotes) and contains numerous quotations from those who played with and against Gehrig. The work also benefits from the discovery of Gehrig's post-ALS correspondence. Eig's prose is clean and clich&eacute;-free. Most importantly, it is convincing. In this definitive biography, Lou Gehrig deserves the revered place he holds in our hearts."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"From the Gary Cooper movie, I thought this would be a great book. I was disappointed. My biggest beef was how anyone who Eng found that ever crossed the shadow of Lou Gehrig was quoted. It was almost as silly as \\"Bill Smith was a peanut vendor at Yankee Stadium and Gehrig once spoke to him....\\" It got ridiculous. Please don't quote other people. Write me a narrative. I threw the book away since it had no resale value and read Ray Robinson's book instead. Totally better. A joy. My favorite baseball author is Roger Kahn. Can't touch him. Of course I'm a Dodger fan."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"The sign of a good biography is when a reader can glean answers to specific questions that the author did not necessarily intend to cover. I picked up this book to form a personal opinion about what caused Lou Gehrig's eponymous disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and I found what I was looking for. Beyond the customary smoking and drinking, Lou Gehrig's diet was exemplary, but one thing stood out: he was an avid fisherman. His favorite haunt for fishing was Long Island Sound. From the early 1800's to the mid-1900's, the hat-making industry of Connecticut used mercury to convert animal fur to felt, and polluted the waters and sediments of Long Island Sound with large amounts of the heavy metal, especially in times of flooding. It is noteworthy that after Lou Gehrig's symptoms commenced, playing ball away under the hot sun on trips away from New York seemed to ameliorate them slightly (sweating is one way to excrete mercury). At the same time that Gehrig's nervous system was breaking down, his wife, Eleanor, suffered from inexplicable rashes on her face and scalp, a clue to another potential symptom of mercury poisoning, which like any toxin, can affect different people in different ways. If Gehrig's doctors at the Mayo Clinic had any inkling that his condition might have been caused by his consumption of mercury, they did not let on, at the same time that they failed to inform him that he would likely die in a couple of years. In fact, we will never know for sure how much information his doctors possessed, because Gehrig's medical records have been sealed for all time."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"service was excellent. and i am so gladi have this book. price exceptional.go to Cooperstown and compare price.this was a bargain. and i received itquickly...thanks."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Eig gets past some of the veil-hazed Gehrig mythos, especially about his two years in dealing with the knowledge of ALS.By going into detail about Gehrig's initial visit to the Mayo Clinic, he makes it clear that, at the start, Gehrig knew more about this disease than the traditonal mythology portrayed. When he first gave his wife the news, in fact, it was him hiding some things from her, not the other way around.True, she eventually did further research, but Eig relates nothing to support the myth that Mayo doctors were feeding here more realistic prognoses behind her back.Rather, Gehrig, a bit like Ronald Reagan, *wanted* to believe -- and did. Yet, as Eig poignantly shows, he looked past his own web of deceit to the outside world his final months, as if he and his visitors were looking at some sort of inside joke whenever he said things like \\"fifty-fifty chance.\\"An excellent book all around."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This book is a masterpiece of sports biography. Until I read it, all I knew about Lou Gehrig was that he was a Hall of Fame left handed hitting Yankee who played with Babe Ruth.

Actually, the book itself is masterfully written. I was 4 months old when Lou Gehrig died. I love biographies and baseball books and this is one of the best of both.My problem with the Kindle edition is that it costs more than the printed editions and contains no photographs at all. I wouldn't mind that if I were told that some of the money would go into ALS research (none does).Moreover, the one graphic, a single sheet of Gehrig's baseball lifetime stats is in a type font so tiny that it can't even be read when enlarged.Still, I read the whole book so it would be dishonest to return it for a refund. And I feel no shame in writing that Chapter 23 made me cry.But if you really love baseball, get a printed copy. (I can't do that. We are retired and living in Dominica. The wretched Kindle is our only book option other than the equally inadequate Nook.)"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I latched on to Lou Gehrig as a child back in the early 1980's and ever since he has been my all time favorite player.

I would recommend this book for any baseball fan to learn more about one of the sport's most important historical figures. While you are at it check out my baseball novel, 33 Summers, about a baseball player with tons of talent who just might throw it all away with drugs and alcohol.33 Summers"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"This is a well written, informative book.One of the best sportsbooks I have ever read."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I truly enjoyed Eig's meticulously researched book. I was unaware of the relationship between Babe Ruth and Gehrig, and this book solidified my previous view that Lou Gehrig was one of the greats in the American amphitheater of professional athletes. It's sad that today's adolescents don't have sports heroes of the same high caliber and character.One unrelated element that turned me off was the author himself. I took the opportunity to meet him at a local book signing and gave him a brief note asking if he might e-mail me so that I could ask for some writing advice for a book project of my own. I never heard from him, which was kind of a disappointment for me. Usually, writers are a tight community of gracious individuals who don't hesitate to help others' out, but with Eig, this didn't seem to be the case..."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Lou Gehrig was one of the greatest ballplayers of all time, but his life has become typecast in the clich&eacute;s of \\"The Iron Horse\\" followed by courage in the face of crushing adversity. Gehrig was all these things, but there is much more substance. Although a major figure in the baseball world of his time, Gehrig's persona lacked color and producing an interesting and significant biography must have been a challenge beyond a methodical listing of his accomplishments. Jonathan Eig pulls this off in Luckiest Man by focusing on the people and world around him. We learn of his devotion to his mother, ups and downs of his friendship with Babe Ruth, respect for authority such as managers Miller Huggins and Joe McCarthy and Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert, self-doubts and reluctance to assert himself in contract negotiations, and the relationship with his wife, Eleanor and finally his doctors. Luckiest Man gives the reader something of the flavor of major league baseball in the 1920's and 1930's. I particularly enjoyed descriptions of a barnstorming tour after the 1927 World Series and his brief career in Hollywood. At several points in his career, there are quotes in which Gehrig articulately explains his contentment with a simple and relatively frugal life. As his career proceeded into the mid-thirties it appears that Gehrig was an intelligent, driven man who would have blossomed in middle age both within and outside baseball. A dark cloud is sensed throughout Luckiest Man to those readers familiar with his tragic illness. At the age of thirty-five in 1938 and still in the prime of his career, Gehrig began exhibiting the effects of ALS or what has become known as \\"Lou Gehrig's Disease.\\" Undiagnosed for at least a year, Gehrig continued to play until his retirement early in the 1939 season as his skills gradually declined until nobody, including Lou, could deny that something was wrong. This portion of the book is painful to read, but riveting. I can only admire Gehrig's optimism and doggedness and consider it to be a classic piece of sports biography. Unfortunately, ALS is still an incurable disease. The last part of the books deals with the two years after his retirement and before his death. Gehrig tried a number of treatments and stayed optimistic and upbeat around others until the end and faced his predicament with undeniable courage. As I read the final page, I was touched in a way that no biography has done for me before."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I'll be totally honest, this book made me cry... twice. I've read towering biographies before that were informative and enlightening, but read like phonebooks (see \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" by Edmund Morris). \\"Luckiest Man\\" reads more like a novel, a story about a shy guy who deeply loves his family and tries to always do the right thing. About how this guy did everything he could for his mother and did everything he could to succeed in baseball. You're there with him emotionally just as he finally begins to embrace his fame and enjoy his celebrity, as he breaks out of his shell of shyness and finds true love. And you're there when he gets thrown the biggest curveball of his life, blames himself for his mysterious decline, and hopelessly believes that there may be a cure. This book is as informative as it is heart-breaking. I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Having read a number of biographies about Lou Gehrig, I was looking forward to reading this one and I was not disappointed. Mr. Eig gives us insight into the childhood of Gehrig, along with the domineering role that his mother played in his life. As he begins his professional career, we are privy to the insecurity that he experienced, even in times of success. In addition, we see the conflicted Lou when he marries and it causes problems with his mother. Finally we watch as A.L.S. chokes the life out of a strong and courageous man. This in an awesome and insightful work."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I was biased to read the book because I'm a life-long Yankee fan and I appreciate Gehrig's role in shaping the Yankees. Ruth may have built Yankee Stadium but it was Gehrig who influenced the Yankees for decades with his quiet, focused professionalism. Gehrig set the example later followed by Mattingly, Bernie Williams, and Jeter.I think this book needed to be as broad as it was because Gehrig is a complex person who in some ways has several distinct parts of his life. His evolution from shy, akward Momma's boy to reluctant hero, to his being pushed by his wife to become a more public figure - an event which may have distanced him from his mother - is an interesting character study about how a person can evolve.The need to show how superb he was as a ballplayer is a must as this book is probably most of interest to baseball fans. When you realize that he had already developed signs of ALS at the beginning of 1938 and STILL managed to hit .295 with close to 100 RBI's you recognize how great he truely was. Personally, I think that was one of the single-greatest seasons ever by a player, all things considered.Finally, the last few chapters that deal with his illness are a portrait of someone who, at least publicly, shows the same determination off the field as on to overcome. His farewell speech is the \\"Gettysburg address\\" of baseball.In some ways, I think Lincoln and Gehrig are similar in that they are complex people and their stories aren't easily told in one volume. I realized that similarity when you realize the both Lincoln and Gehrig are remembered for what they did during their latter years - behavior/achievements far beyond what one might have expected when you read about their lives before that point. In Gehrig's case, an introverted, shy person who makes one of the greatest speeches of all-time.Eig has done an admirable job with this subject given there are few still alive who were central to the story and Gehrig wasn't the type to keep a diary where he bared his inner-most thoughts.I'm not a big believer that kids should view athletes as role models - except when they show themselves to be far more accomplished as people than they ever were on the field."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Reading this book made me wonder, \\"Are there any men of this caliber of character in MLB today?\\" My immediate answer would be, \\"No.\\" Who in today's big leagues would feel almost embarassed to get a raise? Who would play for such a quiet love of the game?A ballplayer from the 80s, Ryne Sandberg, does come to mind. Of course, he was nowhere the player of Gehrig (who is?), but he always seemed like a gentleman who gave it his all.God Bless Lou Gehrig and all he stood for. Read this book if you want to be inspired by a genuine American role model and hero."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"When I was a child I read over and over again a biography of Lou Gehrig written for children. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the author . It was truly inspiring and in a way the hardworking , slow - running Lou, who every day ran to school in order to pick up his running speed was even more of a hero for me than the Babe or Joe D. other major Yankee heroes.Now Jonathan Eig has written what the New York Times calls one of the ' best sports' biographies' of all time. It is a book not simply about a baseball player, but about a brave, modest heroic human being, a dedicated, hard- working ball - player whose love of the game led him to set the astounding, once thought unbreakable record of playing in 2130 consecutive games.Gehrig was an athlete of another time, who for years was paid less than he was worth because he feared he might antagonize management and lose his job. His whole story including that of putting himself through Columbia and while there helping his mother wash dishes to support their family exemplifies this kind of modesty and dedication. Eig tells the story of his sudden illness with crippling multiple sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig's disease) and how he struggled with such great fortitude to maintain the most he could of his skills for as long as he could. He also tells of Gehrig's family relationships, his closeness to his mother, his marrying relatively late to a wife more capable of handling his business interests than he was himself. He tells of the odd friendship and great contrast between Gehrig and the Babe. He gives a spellbinding account of the famous ' Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth' speech.This is a work that every single reviewer on Amazon has highly praised. It cannot be more highly recommended."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I'm a 53 year plus Yankee MLB fan. I already knew from Lou Gehrig's statistics he was the greatest first baseman of all time! I wanted to learn more about this fascinating Yankee and great human being.Johnathan Eig wrote a great 419 page book. Its jammed full of facts both about baseball and Lou Gehrig's and others life off the field. I couldn't put it down. I read it in 2 1/2 days. There are some great B/W pictures too.We see Lou's very young sister dieing in early childhood and his German father and mother in the US. They lived poor. He big mom was stern, but loving and always made sure Lou had enough to eat and wore clean cloths to school. Both parents worked at jobs when they could get them.We see Lou putting on the pounds, gaining strength and size and being able to play ball with the older kids. We see his start in baseball and a little football, growing up and playing college baseball at Columbia University. He was only a C student and after about 2 years he asked his professors if he should stay in school or play professional baseball. They looked at his grades and said play ball.The NY Giants let Lou Gehrig slip through their hands as he was watched and did not hire him because a routine grounder went through his legs. Talk about one of the worst baseball mistakes for the Giants and the good Luck for the NY Yankees to sign him.We see Gehrig teaming up with Babe Ruth the party animal, flamboyant, womanising, big drinker and boastful (INMO the best ball player of all time...great batter, Hall of Fame, incredible statistics and records, plus if he had stayed a pitcher could of been a Hall of Fame pitcher). Also lots of other great Yankees and other team players shown. I learned a lot.Lou Gehrig develops more and more into a power hitter with a great average. Lou was quite and was the exact opposite of Ruth. He was shy with woman and not a party animal and listened to management. Even though he played part of his carrier in the depression INMO he should of commanded a greater salary than he did. He got much less than Ruth as he was not the flamboyant loud superstar that Ruth was. For his great baseball Gehrig INMO should of got maybe $15,000/year less than Ruth. The \\"Colonel\\" owner of the Yankees took advantage of Gehrig in contract negotiations. We eventually see Lou Gehrig developing with power and batting average into the greatest first baseman ever. Some say he will break all Ruth's batting records except maybe Ruth's home run record if he stays healthy. He is on course to do it.He marries a loving wife Eleanor who helps Lou become more assertive and outgoing. We see Lou loved fishing too and riding his small boat the Water Wagon. Lou was a little tight with his money but living in the depression who can blame him.We see his consecutive game playing record (his nickname was the Iron Man...he played games hurt with broken bones, other injuries, fever and sickness) that last for decades. His record finally broken by Cal Ripken Jr.Then in the late 1930s he has major problems. Not slow old baseball man deterioration but a rapid physical collapse. His baseball playing becomes terrible. No one knows what is wrong. Lou tries everything and one jerk doctor thinks its his gall bladder. Eventually Lou goes to the Mayo clinic and finds out he has ALS later named Lou Gehrig disease. His great big strong body rapidly wastes away and his nervous system is wrecked. No cure. Death in a few years.He has his appreciation day and is celebrated by the fans,players and media.Having problems standing and severe physical problems, his manager whispers in his ear and Lou reluctantly and with difficulty gives his \\"Luckiest Man\\" speech, one of the greatest,humbling, sportsman's speeches ever. Not about himself but thanking all for the opportunity to play ball and the great time he was grated playing ball with some of the greatest people ever. I won't ruin this tear jerking ending for you. I shed a tear as I saw the way one of my baseball heroes died.One of the greatest baseball books ever about the greatest first baseman ever and a great, humble, and caring human being Henry Louis Gehrig. 5 stars"},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I just finished reading this outstanding book, Luckiest Man, and I want to share with others how much I enjoyed it. I'm a SABR member and a baseball historian of some note and I've read a lot of baseball biographies. This is certainly right up there among the very best. By the time I finished it, I really felt that the author had captured the essence of the man, Lou Gehrig, greatly surpassing the superficial baseball persona that we're all familiar with. I felt like I came to know Lou, and could even anticipate accurately how he would react to the different events that occurred in his life. This made the final tragic chapters dealing with his demise and death very moving.In addition, I enjoyed the character development of his parents, his wife, and the many others personalities in Lou's world. Eig's engaging writing style made the book enjoyable to read, and I found the pages were just flying by. As a baseball historian, I read the text with a critical eye, but found absolutely no factual errors.Jonathan Eig has written a wonderful book - the definitive biography of the great Lou Gehrig, and has made an extraordinary contribution to baseball history. Available for exactly one cent, used, from Amazon, this has to be the baseball bargain of the decade! If you love baseball history, do yourself a favor and order this book."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Luckiest Man is one the the finest books I have ever read. I do not usually read biographies, but this book did not read like any biography, it made Lou Gehrig come to life.

I highly recommend this book, it is such an engaging read and you do not need to know much about baseball in order to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I have not read any other works on Lou Gehrig, save a couple of juvenile biographies many years ago, but it's difficult to imagine a book that could relate the Iron Horse's life better than \\"Luckiest Man.\\"Jonathan Eig has written a \\"couldn't-put-it-down\\" account of a sports hero almost too good to be true. One of the best aspects of the book is that, while this is essentially a \\"warts and all\\" biography, the author doesn't try to create warts where none existed. If the worst one can say of Gehrig was that he was a mama's boy, a cheapskate, and a corporation man lacking in both rebelliousness and \\"color,\\" than it's the worst one can say about millions of young Americans, especially the immigrants and sons of immigrants, of his generation. Eig realizes that the drama of Gehrig's life doesn't need to be invented or enhanced. If anything, he patiently understates the tragedy that Gehrig faced as his powerful physique was ravaged by an incurable disease, as a superb athlete helplessly watched his athleticism deteriorate and his career, then his life, destroyed.As portrayed by Eig, there is something almost childish about the optimism with which Gehrig confronted his debilitation and death. But it was not in Gehrig to be cynical, or to feel sorry for himself, at least not for long. One wonders if he could have, or would have, made his \\"luckiest man\\" speech in the weeks before he died (he actually made his famous remarks almost two years before his death, when he genuinely believed he might beat ALS). Yet one finds in those glorious words the gratitude and generosity that Gehrig seems to have always felt for his family, his teammates, and the fans who gave him the opportunity to make a comfortable and enjoyable living playing a game he loved.Eig has plumbed all the expected source materials, including the memories of many old ballplayers who knew Gehrig, and he's come up with new sources (correspondence between Gehrig and one of his principal physicians) that shed more light on the man. He also does a fine job in capturing the complex relationships that Gehrig had with his mother, his wife, and his teammates (especially Babe Ruth)-- again, reporting the facts and neither romanticizing nor villainizing any of them.In short, this is terrific book, both as an entertaining read and as as chronicle of a sports superstar from a more innocent age. Eig avoids comparisons of Gehrig to modern-day sports stars, but I will say that Gehrig's feats on the ball field, and his modest grace off the field, would be becoming to any ballplayer today.P.S. -- I have to mention one error: Eig refers a couple of times to the former commissioner of baseball as Judge Kenesaw \\"Mountain\\" Landis, but the quotation marks are unnecessary. Landis's given name was taken from an 1864 Civil War battle in Georgia, at Kennesaw Mountain."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"Jonathan Eig's book about the iconic \\"Iron Horse\\" is an extremely well-written, engrossing, and engaging book.

One sees a reluctant, shy star and reads about his heartbreaking illness that felled him at the prime of his career. Tbe book read like a novel, not a dry non-fiction tome.

Luckily for him, his baseball immense talent helped him sever or soften the unhealthy tie his mother kept over him.Even if his \\"Luckiest Man on earth\\" speech is an historical masterpiece from a Great Man and the stuff of legends, you'll be also moove by what he did of his few remaining days.Luckiest Man is probably the best baseball bio there is."},{"Title":"Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig","review":"I found this book to be an excellent history of Lou Gehrig's life.It was the right mix of stories, statistics and photos.

And, for a two-hour movie, this approach was appropriate.

He was also able to communicate his novel information effectively because he had both extensive firsthand experience with early automobiles and planes and because he was continually involved in teaching. Victor Pag&eacute;'s early twentieth-century work demonstrates both what have become mainstream techniques in technical communication and a number of unique rhetorical strategies.\\""},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"This was Macleans third novel and it is one of the weaker books that he wrote.It starts in 1942 with the fall of Singapore and we get to see a bedraggled group trying to get out of the country before the Japanese catch them. One of the characters has some important military papers on him and he must get to the safety of the allies so that he can pass the papers on to them.As always with his books, we get a ragtag collection of individuals and throughout the course of the books, their character is tested where some fail and some shine. The plot is quite unlikely and the adventures that they go through are farfetched even for Maclean.This is not one of his best books but it is an entertaining adventure story that moves along well, there is limited violence (nothing graphic) and the romance is kept to a minimum (this is a trademark of Macleans).One surprising aspect is the authors strong depiction of the Japanese soldiers as being totally without redeeming qualities. He was quite vicious in their portrayal while in this book and other novels, he was careful with his depiction of German soldiers. Found this to be a little surprising but as someone who fought in the Second World War, maybe the author had had some experiences with the Japanese."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"Book was delivered in a timely manner and securely packaged. Very pleased to have been able to find this title as previously owned books were destroyed by water in basement. Thanks again!"},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"\\"South By Java Head\\" is the kind of book you might enjoy more if you just had a bitter breakup with your Japanese girlfriend.The Japanese are the villains, of course, it being World War II and the protagonists a group of mixed civilians and English military personnel escaping Singapore a half-step ahead of Tojo's Army, but this 1958 effort by Alistair MacLean was written well before the advent of political correctness, and its racism is not only troubling but actually a detriment to the thin story.Meet the lead villain, Col. Kiseki. As described by a Javanese villager, \\"Colonel Kiseki is not human. He is an animal, a jungle animal. But the jungle animals kill only when they have to. Kiseki would tear the arm off a man - or a little child - as a thoughtless child would pull the wings off a fly.\\"Later, we meet one of Col. Kiseki's grinning underlings, who assures us his prisoners will be tortured before they are killed because \\"the strong have no need\\" of international conventions. Special treatment will be dished out to the female nurses, he adds.Yes, the Japanese often employed cruel tactics in World War II, but here instead of merely allowing them to be villains with the appropriate degree of intelligence and menace, MacLean turns them into savage brutes so bent on cruelty and killing that it literally causes their defeat. Meanwhile, the protagonists whose story we doggedly follow from one mess to the next seem done in or saved by odd spells of luck, both bad and good, rather than their own devises, about which little is clear in this convoluted narrative.I only docked the book one star for racism; it's otherwise terrible enough. MacLean served up many cardboard characters and cheap plot twists in his career, but here, in only his third novel, and following the two classics \\"H.M.S. Ulysses\\" and \\"The Guns Of Navarone,\\" he seems to be serving up a foretaste of his worst writing to come.It's a shame because MacLean's plot idea is unique, a refugee ship trying to make safe landfall, and the opening chapter describing Singapore under siege just hours before the Japanese takeover is a good example of MacLean at his descriptive, Conradian best. But it all falls to pieces quickly as MacLean loads up his story with secret documents, double agents, traitors, and bad romantic subplots, not to mention so much pain and anguish as the party comes under repeated attack from the Japanese and the elements that you almost wish they would just capsize their craft and be done with it.I love reading MacLean books, even the rockier later ones, because of his craft and his wit. But this was a painful read for me on many counts, and the hardest of his books to get through. Unless you're a completist (like me), give it a miss."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"I don't think it was one of his best books. The tale seemed to drag on for me. Yes, it had MacLeans normal twist and turns but I don't think the story was as strong or as interesting as it has been in many of his other books. I feel each time he started a new chapter it lost its flow entirely, and it took several pages to get reinterested in the story. I think most all of his books start off real slow, but once you're in, you are hooked. Not so with this one. He is an entertaining author so that's why the 3 stars, and because he has written worse. I still recommend &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; or &quot;Satan Bug&quot; among others."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"I always loved Alistair MacLean novels. For adventure, I found him to be one of the most consistent and satisfying authors out there. This is one of his best. It has twists and turns, as always, but is also a bit more harrowing than some of his other novels. All of which sets everything up nicely for a great denouement."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"Alistair MacLean's 1958 \\"South By Java Head\\" is evidence both of his tremendous talent as a story teller and that he was still learning the writing trade with this early novel.\\"South By Java Head\\" is set in the fall of the British stronghold of Singapore to the Japanese Army in February 1942. A mixed collection of soldiers, nurses, fleeing civilians, a small boy, and at least one spy attempt to escape the burning city aboard the Kerry Dancer, a battered freighter manned by a disreputable captain and crew. When the Kerry Dancer is crippled by Japanese war planes, the refugees are rescued by the Viroma, a tanker also fleeing the Japanese. Thus begins a terrible ordeal, as the Viroma itself is sunk by the Japanese and the survivors take to open boats. Led by stalwart First Officer Nicholson, they will attempt to flee to safety across the South China Sea, relentlessly pursued by the Japanese and equally at risk from traitors in their midst.\\"South By Java Head\\" has touches of real brillance. The description of the fall of Singapore is as moving as anything MacLean would write after \\"HMS Ulysses\\", and the twisting plot presages what would become the standard of MacLean's adventure stories. Although Johnny Nicholson doesn't even make an appearance until the second act of the story, he is clearly the hero; the rest is told from his point of view. He is a perfectly adequate Maclean hero, honorable, humane, but tough and enduring in a crisis; he is ably assisted by a strong, silent side kick who seems to rise to every occasion.Unfortunately, MacLean tries to pack too much adventure into the storyline. The core characters roll from one life-threatening crisis to the next; their continuing survival becomes less and less credible. MacLean gives himself rather too many characters to manage. Several get promising introductions, only to be killed off as plot devices. The secret that gives rise to several betrayals hardly seems worth the trouble it costs both the pursuers and the traitors. Nicholson is given a promising love interest, but the romance doesn't get a lot of development. The Japanese, fair or not, are flatly portrayed as savage monsters.\\"South By Java Head\\" is highly recommended to Alistair MacLean fans. The casual reader will likely find it to be an entertaining adventure story."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"This is an outstanding book for those who enjoy stories loaded with adventure and intrigue. I've read many Alistar MacLean novels and enjoyed every one.What I find quite stunning is one reviewer claims MacLean's depiction of the Japanese Military of the time is \\"racist\\" while another says MacLean depicts the Japanese conquerors as \\"savage monsters\\". I've got news for you...they were indeed savage, brutal monsters. Many of the leaders of the Japanese Imperial Army during those times were the most rabid of racists. The reviewers obviously have never spent time in SE Asia and talked to any of the inhabitants that were alive during the Japanese occupation of those countries. They'll be the first to tell you how absolutely cruel and brutal the Japanese Army truly was. These reviewers have no idea of the incredible hardships imposed by the ruthless Japanese conquerors on the people of Viet Nam, the Phillipines, Malaysia, Burma, Thailand, etc. I look at such reviews as incredibly naive.Talk to a survivor of the Bataan Death March about the humanity of the Japanese Army. Wake Island was captured shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. When food supplies started to run scarce on the island, the Japanese lined up a large group of American civilian contractors they had taken prisoner and shot them all to death on the beach. The non-racist Japanese convinced the civilians living on many of the islands they had conquered not to surrender themselves to the Americans who the claimed would enslave them and torture them to death. They ordered those people to hurl themselves off tall cliffs and kill themselves rather than surrender to the Americans. Unfortunately countless numbers of those civilians believed the Japanese and followed their orders. Savage, brutal monsters indeed!"},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"After success with the more conventional wartime thriller 'The Guns of Navarone', Maclean's third book feels like a return to the \\"epic\\" scope of 'HMS Ulysees'. We follow a large and disparate variety of characters (wounded men, soldiers, nurses, pirates, and the crew of an oil tanker) as they attempt to flee the fall of Singapore. Through circumstances all these people come together, and are forced to brave Japanese attacks and the harsh environment in a seemingly hopeless quest to reach Java Head and the protection of Allied forces. While the plot revolves around some secret Japanese plans, this is not really central to the story. For most characters, the goal is simply survival.With such a large and varied cast, it is inevitable that some either fade into the background or are jarringly killed off, but there are some well-drawn characters. Johnny Nicholson is a fairly standard Maclean hero, with other crew members such as McKinnon also fitting the Maclean mould. More interesting are the enigmatic duo Farnholme and particularly Van Effen; the latter is arguably the best developed of the lot. And, three books in, Gudrun Drachmann is the first female character and love interest to appear in a Maclean book. Drawing three-dimensional heroines was never a Maclean strong point, but Nurse Drachmann is one of the best of them; courageous, dedicated and intelligent. Note that in contrast to the Germans of the first two books, Maclean has no sympathy for the Japanese whatsoever. They are portrayed as ruthless and inhuman, with their actions disturbing even their allies. Whether or not this is historically accurate, it does add to the tension considerably.In all, the book is not quite as strong as 'Ulysees' or 'Navarone', although when Maclean describes the hellish chaos of wartime Singapore, or the relentless heat and humidity of the environment, the book comes close to reaching the heights of the first two. The circumstances are a little too unrealistic to be believable, and there are perhaps one too many lucky escapes and fortunate twists to satisfy (an issue that also arose in his next book, 'The Last Frontier'). And the romantic subplot is a bit clumsy, although I do think Gudrun's presence and her scarred face add a strong emotional element to proceedings. These flaws aside, 'South by Java Head' is a strong entry in the Maclean catalogue and a worthy successor to his first two classics."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"South by Java Head features fundamentals I find so promising: a nautical adventure set in Southeast Asia during World War II, written by a prominent screenwriter. Nonetheless, the story falls flat and I found it just barely compelling enough to finish; the plot moves slowly, punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another, the descriptions of action are confusing, and the characters mere outlines devoid of development. I hoped this book would be as good as a 1950's nautical adventure i highly recommend, The Wreck of the Mary Deare, but unfortunately Java Head is just disappointment. For other SE Asia World War II fiction, Clavell's King Rat is also a good place to start."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this is not one of MacLean's best. Realistic story lines have never been one of MacLean's strong suits, but this one can get a little ridiculous at time. The plot never really seems to go anywhere, and in my opinion, the ending is very disappointing. The book is entertaining, however, and an easy read. If you are a MacLean fan, this book would be alright for you. However if you are new to the author's works, start somewhere else: &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; or &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot;."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"This book is classic Alastair MacLean! The action is non-stop but it is blended with the characters in such a way to make them come alive as it keeps the plot plausible. It is not just \\"action for action's sake.\\" I know this is an older book but it is well worth the time is takes to read it!"},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"My least favourite book from MacLean's early period (HMS Ulysses through to Last Frontier.) The plot lags through the middle section of the book, and then finishes too fast. However, it is well written and contains the usual MacLean theme of men fighting against seemingly unbeatable odds and pushing themselves to the limits of their physical and mental endurance. Worth a read for anyone who is a MacLean fan. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"Title":"South By Java Head","review":"MacLean is a fine writer but this is not his finest novel. In my view, the opening chapters are the best: the description of Singapore under assault from the Japanese has an \`end of the world' quality that is both eerie and threatening. The problem is that the opening chapters seem to set the scene for a quite different novel. They promise a gritty realism comparable with, for example, \`The Cruel Sea'. In fact, the book quickly turns into a thrilling adventure on the high seas. There is lots of stiff-upper-lip heroism against the rather two-dimensional Japanese villains. In spite of many injuries and deaths, the improbability of some of the heroic escapes stretch the reader's credulity. MacLean is very good at evocative description - for example, describing the feel (the pressure wave) of a bomb exploding rather than just its sound. But most of the characters are very thin indeed. You could lift many of them bodily out of this novel and put them into an Agatha Christie mystery and they'd feel right at home.So, this is a bit of a mix bag, on the whole. My advice would be: don't be deceived by the opening chapters. This is not a serious depiction of people at war. It is a fast-action, ripping yarn. As such, it succeeds moderately well."},{"Title":"Three-Quarters of a Footprint","review":"This review is simply in appreciation to Joe Roberts for a wonderfully wry and descriptive book of Southern India. My daugter is planning to spend a college semester in Kerala and I have been searching (mostly in vain) for an unbiased travel book on the area. Guide books don't convey the sounds, smells, color and people one meets. Three Quarters of a Footprint certainly does, in addition to informative footnotes explaining complicated history and religion. The only things which would have improved the book would be a better map identifying Joe Roberts' trips to various towns and villages and perhaps some photographs. All in all, a very good read."},{"Title":"Mates, Dates Boxed Set One: Mates, Dates, and Inflatable Bras; Mates, Dates, and Cosmic Kisses; Mates, Dates, and Designer Divas; Mates, Dates, and Sleepover Secrets","review":"As i bookseller with specialty in kids and teens, I must really give this series the \\"thumbs up\\"!They are great \\"light reading\\", but with substantial contents for their target group.

The names may not mean anything, but in the bowels of the major intelligence agencies documents lurk, on such subjects as UFO crash retrievals and communication with aliens.

I suppose it could be the case that the NSA, DIA, CIA etc. are fabricating interest in UFOs and blocking/censoring the release of supposed/fabricated UFO documentation in order to justify increases to their budgets. According to the documents in this book, it seems that at least some agencies and governments collaborate to enforce UFO secrecy.The author, an army sergeant, found himself harassed in his job, following his inquiries to the NSA about Project Snowbird.

I bought it thinking that it was something else - I don't know exactly what -, and I don't regret it, but it's not what I expected it to be... Thanks God I have a pianist friend so he can play it for me :-)Anyway, it's a must-have for every 'Cabaret-collector' out there."},{"Title":"The Complete Cabaret Collection: Vocal Selections - Souvenir Edition","review":"I have to be completely honest with you, I think the love story behind Cabaret is extremely unnerving, even grotesque, However, I love the music, the music is beautiful.Although I like all of the songs, I do not think the singing from any of the productions can compete with the explosive performance combination of Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli in the film version of the show.Thankfully the book does not make you choose one production over the others, you get all three, and for a very low price.The book has three glossy pages in the front, each representing a different rendition of Cabaret with brightly colored pictures. On the bottem of each of these pages are the Tony or Academy Awards that were achieved by that specific production.A Small note: The musical Cabaret has won 12 Tonys and 8 Academy awards in its lifetime.The rest of the book is music, except for the chapter or show titles, which have black and white pictures from each production.The music is great, however, it is the orchestral scores from the origional productions translated into piano, so not all of the music is there.You could compare it to &quot;Raphsody in Blue&quot; being performed on one piano rather than by a whole orhcestra, there are many notes missing when you try to put an orchestra into one piano.This is why I gave it 4 star. My music teacher has the music score from the movie for piano, and from seeing that sheet music, I can say that if you buy it from the productions individualy, you will have more accuracy in your music and lyrics, since each production has its own variation.In this book there is only one version of &quot;Money,Money,Money&quot; the movie version, and only one version of &quot;Willkommen&quot;, the origional 1966 version. The problem with this is that &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; is very differant in the new broadway production, and &quot;Willkommen&quot; is done differently in each production too, but only one version of each song is availiable in this book.I am still thrilled with the book, it's a wonderful addition to any music collection. It is harder music than your average broadway musical, so if you cannot play the piano, and do not plan on learning, I would advise you not to get this book.&quot;Maybe This Time&quot; is my favorite song in the book, a beautiful slow ballad. &quot;Mein Heir&quot; and &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; are next to it; they are wonderful songs.The songs from the revival are obsolete in comparison to the earlier numbers, although, many of the numbers cut from the origional 1966 production are very worth while.The 1966 cut production number that have been added into the book are what make this book worth buying, they are fabulous numbers that never really had a day in the sun.I am still tempted to give the book 5 stars because it is wonderful music. If you like Cabaret at all, its music, or Kander and Ebb, its the perfect book to have, not just as a collecters item to sit on the shelf, but as a book you can play from all the time.&quot;What good is sitting alone in your room?

Maidie's life is a collection of memories saved from her constant moves, which leave behind estranged parents, remote sisters and two ex-husbands. Currently working in Tuscon as the curator of the Museum of Domestic History and Home Economy (which functions better as metaphor than as museum), Maidie begins to catalog her life : abandonment--by mother ; neglect--by first husband ; verbal abuse--by second husband ; happiness--with boyfirend--current. But although Maidie thinks often about her past, it isn't until the last third of the novel that she confronts the fragments of her life and visits her family.

It's now in the realm of bookcrossing.com hopefully inspiring other readers to look into more of Ms Monroe's work."},{"Title":"The Kural","review":"This set of approximately 1300 couplets is divided into three subcategories: Virtue, wealth and love. It gives plenty of advice in the Hindu and Jain tradition, not of asceticism, but of one who is active in the world, but wishes to be a good person and to have a good practical understanding of his or her faith. The poetry is simple but effective. Valluvar is on par with Valmiki in my opinion -- the reader of this short little book (167 pages) will come to learn that Tamil is juat as important a source of religious ideas as is Sanskrit and it is in use even today. A must-read for all seekers."},{"Title":"The Kural","review":"Have read this book many a times and have been a constant companion in the times of distress and it has taught me many a things about like.Sage advice on life ,on politics has been just great.He tell you with his razor sharp insight about life as to what is this world really like.He tells you the reality and how to handle the world.1300 shloks or Couplets are the best in the world and are applicable to indian and to the western Audince.Buy it and follow it you will not regret the Great SAGE's Advice on Life"},{"Title":"Druglord: Guns, Powder and Pay-Offs","review":"If you have read \\"Powder Wars\\" by the author, then you're gonna like this.Goes deeper into the background of Hasse and his downfall.There are more quotes from the main players and Johnson has obviously done his homework with this one.I'm only half-way through the book, but feel a positive review is worth the effort already.On his day, not many True Crime authors out there like Johnson."},{"Title":"Himalayas","review":"The English language hasn't invented words sufficient to describe the photographs in this magnificent book. Shirakawa's photographs are so mind-blowing that they almost reach out and grab you and propel you up to the Roof of the World. There are full page and double-page photos galore, and some foldout plates that will literally take your breath away. Shirakawa took his photographs at all hours of the day and night; we see the Himalayas in all their majesty in the muted shades of dawn, glowing crimson and purple at sunset, sharply etched at high noon, snow and ice crystals glittering like an overturned jewel box, and lushly green valleys in the foothills. The book is divided into four sections representing the Nepal, Punjab and Sikkim Himalayas, and the Hindu Kush range in India. The text is absorbing and relates the geographical evolution of the Himalayas, as well as giving us a brief look at the history and culture of the people who live in their shadow. But the text is a pale shadow to the incredible, magnificent pictures. Looking at these awesome photographs, one can almost believe in the existence of Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Himalayas","review":"The main feature of this book is that Yoshi photographed the jewels of the earth with NO filters or manipulations. The photos are straight 35mm, with many different lenses, but only pure glass laying down the image to film. I have met the author at a book signing and was impressed by his diminutive stature but strength of spirit. I am fortunate to own the first edition of this tome with its ivory clasps and hardboard covers. It will remain a family treasure and inducement for travel for my family."},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"Covers: 1) The relative worth of the pieces; 2) Most every type of pawn position ever known ( the most instructive part of the book); 3) The Struggle for open lines ( open files; the minority attack; Controlling open files etc.); 4) Weak PawnsDespite what the publisher says above, this is not a book for the novice.The concepts are subtle. ( The games given illustrate the author's points, and should be studied in the general framework that the author's present.) The best part of the book is the explanatory prose at the start of each chapter. It is general in nature, but then borne out ny the games that follow.The binding is horrible. My book is in two pieces with several pieces of tape holding various parts of the first half of the book together. Minus 1 star for that."},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"(NOTE: For some reason Amazon sells te two volumes of this book--\\"Static\\" and \\"Dynamic\\" features-seperately. This review refers to both volumes.)Buy this book. It is well-written, instructive, and will help your rating. It is also... honest, modest, and civilized. With the reader's permission, I will explain these three less common features first.By \\"honesty\\" I mean that this book--by a world champion (Euwe) and a strong gradnmaster (Kramer) is obviously not the case of the world champion lending his name to the book and letting the other author do all the work. Clearly--as can be seen by the inclusion of many deeply-annotated games by Euwe (as well as by Kramer), he did a lot of the work himself. By \\"modesty\\" I mean that the book often includes lesser-known games that both Euwe and Kramer *lost*--as long as their opponents played in an instructive fashion. The authors don't try to make themselves look like invincible supermen; they only care about teaching the reader. By \\"civlized\\" I mean that the writing style is sober and to the point. The English translation (and presumably the original Dutch) is refreshingly free of slang and superlatives. So is the analysis itself: when the authors speak--for instance--about different pawn formations in the center, they note which type of formation usually arises from what kind of opening and how to play it, and give instructive games as examples. C'est tout. They do not include any waffle about \\"development\\" or \\"the center\\" in general as space fillers, explicit or implicit promises that if you only learn to play these formations you will become an expert/master/grandmaster/world champion (as some unscrupulous authors do), or games full of \\"!!\\" punctuations for moves that merely follow the correct general plan.So much for style. What about the chess content itself? The book is divided into a few large topics, each of them excellently presented. The first volume is wholly occupied with \\"static\\" features: pawn formation, material imbalance, etc. The second deals (first of all) with two types of \\"dynamic\\" issues--that is, issues that depend not so much on the *number* or *formation* of the pieces but on their *activity*: the initiative, second, attack and defense against the king.These issues are crucial to becoming a better chess player. What's more, Euwe and Kramer deal with the matter in severely practical style. They concentrate on the \\"problem-solving\\" issues players face: \\"when to exchange pawns or lock the center, and when should I keep the tension?\\" \\"what are the most important goals a defender must keep in mind?\\", \\"when I have two rooks for the queen, what should I do?\\", and so on. This is a far more practical way to improve than merely learning general strategic principles, since it connects directly to features of the common positions amateurs can actually recognize over the board in their actual games. In particular, the initiative is not seen as some mysterious, Grandmaster-only feature of the game, but defined clearly and distinguished from the *attack*--something amateurs very, very often confuse. How to correctly turn the initiative into an attack--a crucial feature of master chess that's utterly lacking from most amateur games--is dealt with in a particularly enlightening fashion.The latter sections of the second book is worth the price of both books all by themselves (without diminishing the importance of what comes before). They deal with two exceedingly important issues for amateurs: when and how to exchange pieces, and how to avoid the two most common strategic mistakes amateurs make (snatching material and premature attack) in a very enlightening fashion. Most amateurs know vaguely some general principles of the \\"exchange pieces when ahead in material\\", \\"don't grab pawns\\", or \\"attack only when ready\\" but there is a *lot* more to both subject than that. Read the book and learn.The only section of the book that may be a bit over the head of most amateurs is that of \\"style\\". In it, the games of various greats are examined in terms of their preference for positions with one type of feature over another (say, master X prefered piece activity to solid pawn formation, while master Y was best in positions with two bishops, etc.) The one problem is that the student better know VERY well what these elements of the middlegame are before he can begin to understand what preference for one element over another really means (I haven't reached that stage, myself.) That said, this section, as all the others, avoids superlatives (e.g., the \\"genius\\" of Capablanca and Morphy, etc.) in favor of concrete games and examples of their style."},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"These are wonderfully instructive books. Full games are used to illustrate specific points. If enjoy Euwe and Meidens's Chess Master vs. Chess Amateur, let these be your next books on strategy. (I suggest sticking with an author you like.) These are probably most helpful for someone rated between 1600 and 1800 USCF. (Never waste time on chess books that are over your head.)If you have trouble with the binding, search the web for the books in ChessBase format. They are encrypted, and the key is found in the books themselves. So once you have bought the books, you can read them in ChessBase at no extra charge.4 stars for the books, plus one for the files."},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"The last guy to review this book down below apparently meant to give it 5 stars, but instead gave it zero.

Watch your rating climb!"},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"Want to be trained by a world champion? Impossible you say? Although it would seem a miracle of chance that such a fantastic thing would be possible, it is possible, and it is this book! If you approach this book in a studious manner, you will get better at chess. This book is not some hit and miss title with a sprinkling of good ideas. This book will help you get to the marrow of chess, to really pluck out the important concepts that can be applied to every chess position. A serious study of this book will reap rewards beyond just the middlegame. The things you will learn in this book will spill over into your opening study because you will understand the purpose and aim of the opening, instead of just following rote moves like an automaton."},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"Max Euwe was a great chess player, and with real insight into what separates masters from the rest of us. These books won't teach you how to play the middlegame. For that you need \\"My System\\" and \\"Pawn Power in Chess\\". But if you are already a competent tournament player, who wants an enumeration of all the major pawn structures that you might encounter, along with classic examples of grandmaster play, buy these books."},{"Title":"The Middlegame - Book I : Static Features (Algebraic Edition) (Bk. 1)","review":"This book is a classic. It goes through numerous starting middle game positions that arise out of the different openings and explains the strategies of each middle game position before illustrating some representative examples.
