I highly recommend Edinburgh's Dick Tracy (DI John Rebus). This is the fifth book in this series, and as always it's best to start at the beginning, but if you don't and start with this book that's OK too. Rebus has morphed by this book. He is a really strong character with the tenacity of a bloodhound when he's on the hunt. When a close colleague is mugged in an alley, Rebus is drawn into a case that began five years ago when a famous hotel burned to the ground. When the smoke cleared a body with a bullet hole in his head is found. The body has not been identified by the time Rebus gets on the case. With the help of his new DC Siobhan Clarke, they try to bring down a huge crime ring that has been terrorizing Edinburgh for ages. This is an intelligently written, hard-hitting, tightly written book that kept me turning pages."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"This is an earlier novel by the author. I did not give it five stars because I had trouble keeping some of the characters straight as the plot moved between characters. The novel is partly a mystery, and partly deals with the love life of Inspector Rebus. When a DC working with Rebus is assaulted, Rebus looks into the matter and is drawn into a cold case. A man was murdered five years earlier, and the body was found in a burned out hotel after the fire. Rebus is assigned to investigate a case of loan sharking, and the two cases eventually come together.The novel as an evil villain who enjoys hurting people. He has a reputation for chewing off a man's ear in a barroom brawl (they never found the ear, so draw your own conclusions). He can make people disappear. There is money involved, and a suspicion of people being paid off. There are questions of who was in the hotel at the time of the fire. Someone is applying pressure to get Rebus off the case.Along the way, Rebus is caught up in the internal politics of the police and the back stabbing of people within the department competing for promotions (I have experienced this almost everywhere that I have worked during my career). As an added note, you do not want to get on the wrong side of Inspector Rebus. He has some ways of his own for administering justice."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"\\"The Black Book\\" is one of the earlier Rankin novels now coming out in reprint. It deserves the renewed exposure as it meets the author's high standard for zig-zagging plots and wonderfully, over-the-top characters. The protagonist Scots detective in this book (and the whole series) is a go-it-alone type, who is constantly in trouble with his superiors as he pursues unorthodox paths to track down the perps.

He drinks, he doesn't smoke, he drives, he gets hit by a car, he ends up back in his apartment which is masquerading as a college dorm and drop in, he gets hit on the head, he gets called on the carpet and suspended. But in the end he sets all things (well almost all) to right.Three loose ends are: What is going to be the final determination for Brian Holmes, is this the end of his relationship with Dr. Patience (and the beginning with a certain DC), and will he ever be able to shut-up, behave himself so that the Farmer can promote him.A great read, plan on finishing in two days, if you work hard at it."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Author of a Gold Dagger Winner and Edgar nominee, Ian Rankin writes of a detective in Scotland that champions a 5-year old murder investigation.John Rebus, the protagonist, is a rough-hewn character with uncanning ability to 'play' the other characters. Although Rebus's character is fully developed, I found Rankin left many characters lacking substance. This dissonance was illuminated through Rankin's difficulty to transition between chapters, which he delivers in an arbitrary and awkward attempt to expand minor-character attributes.The foundation of this novel (approx 225 pgs.) is a little weak, but the final 125 pages will keep you engaged. I had a difficult time following all the minor character developments, which I believe distracted from the strength of John Rebus. \\"The Black Book,\\" is substantially short of a knockout and much closer to a blackout.This novel was recommended by a friend of mine, but I would be hesitant to read this author in the future. In a saturated genre like crime-novels, I suggest that you only read 5-star books, because there is a cornucopia available. This is not a 5-star novel."},{"Title":"The Story Hour","review":"This is certainly a wonderful collection compiled by Esther M. Bjoland. This review is in reference to the 1976 revised edition.

You don't have to be interested in Madagascar to read this one for sheer pleasure."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"This is a truly great book, very well written, well researched, and a joy to read. Tyson shows us a virtual continent that is largey unknown to the rest of the world, home to bizarre wildlife found nowhere else on earth and enigmas that still confound researchers. Tyson addresses many issues relating to Madagascar. Why are so many plants and animals unique to Madagascar? Why did they speciate so wildly? How did they get there to begin with? Describing in detail the extinct megafauna of Madagascar - giant lemurs, giant tortoises, pygmy hippos, and the mighty elephant bird - he addresses issues of how they lived, research relating to them, and how they became extinct - if all of them are indeed extinct, as some may still exist in unexplored corners of the giant island.Tyson also addresses the history of the island, from its original settlement apparently around the time of Christ to the present day. The origin of the Malagasy people is still a mystery, and Tyson explores Indonesian, Africa, and Arabian (as well as later European) influxes and influences on the island, not only in terms of history and archeology but also religion, culture, society, psychology, and how the people of the island make a living. The Malagasy are a fascinating blend of Indonesian, African, and Arabian peoples, showing diverse traits from these cultures and providing a continual mystery to researchers.Tyson closes the book with a detailed and comprehensive look at the effort to save the last wild areas of Madagascar. Showing how a new national park is working, he shows that much has been accomplished on the island, but much remains to be done, and the preservation effort is fraught with peril. If conservationists are to save the unique chameleons, geckos, tenrecs, lemurs, serpent eagles, and other wildlife of Madgascar, as well as its unqiue flora, Tyson shows how they must address basic issues of human dignity, the economy, land rights, and basic education as well.A truly great book, a wonderful introduction to Madagascar that I just can't recommend highly enough!"},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"I can't more heartily recommend this book if you have even a smidgeon of interest or curiosity in Madagascar! No nature writer has yet compiled so much information into such a readable format. The author tends to veer off his researcher accounts into side topics with regularity, all the while skillfully relating them and never failing to lead us back into his main subject. The way he weaves the history and culture of the Malagasy people into his narratives is clever and accurate. If you are considering a personal visit to what is truly the last 'Lost World' on our planet, absorbing the information in this superb work is the single best way that I can suggest to prepare for the experience!"},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"I'm a huge Madagascar fan and finiding books on one of my favorite places is a rare treat for me - this book is no exception. It's written wonderfully and has useful factual information. Before travelling here, I would suggest that you find all the information you can and this book is one of about 3 that I could say are appropriate for this."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"About 15 years ago, I had a conversation with a Malagasy soil scientist, who told me, in an even tone, that his countrymen were destroying their watershed by extending rice cultivation into the forests. I forget his exact words, but they were a version of a statement I have often quoted from Harry Hopkins: \\"People don't eat in the long run, they eat every day.\\"It sounded as if the island was being set up for a demographic collapse similar to the one that affected Ireland in the 19th century, and the concern about preserving an island watershed resonated as well, since I, too, live on an island with a watershed that is deteriorating. But I did not rush out to help the Malagasy save themselves from themselves, nor even make any effort to learn more about their situation. They are, after all, as Neville Chamberlain said about the Czechs, a distant people of whom we know nothing.Besides, at that time Peter Tyson had not published his excellent \\"The Eighth Continent,\\" which while formally a report about conservation studies by westerners in Madagascar is practically a very long encyclopedia article about the island.A magazine writer with a taste for hiking, Tyson made a number of visits to field research projects in the \`90s, each lasting at least long enough to do some observation on his own. These reports are woven deftly into reports from earlier travelers concerning the anthropology, political history, natural history, economic activity etc. of the island over the past couple of hundred years. There is some material about earlier times, though sketchy, as the Malagasy did not write until Christian missionaries reduced their language to paper less than 200 years ago.Since they were in contact by -- and partly descendants of -- Arabs, this illiteracy is surprising, but then, most things about Madagascar are surprising. It had the world's largest birds and all the lemurs.One of the surprising things about this book is how little there is in it about lemurs, the charismatic animal group of the island today. It is a meaty volume nevertheless, as much for what it does not say as for what it does.For example, in travels all over the island, Tyson never reports encountering a policeman, and virtually no representative of central government of any kind in the rural areas. The place is so poor as to be effectively ungoverned; even if the government had any interest, it has no resources.Tyson finds the people attractive and kind, though wary, although their history is extremely violent, and given the lack of any order-making authority, appears to be very violent still.A cover blurb from Discover magazine describes the book as \\"part field report, part travelogue,\\" but this does not really capture its range. It does read like a travelogue of the better sort. I am mistrustful of travelogue writers, having found that all that I have checked up on are liars, but the only obvious error that I found in the whole book was a reference to the \\"heady scent of blossoming bougainvillea.\\"The first 90 percent of the volume is expositional in tone, but there is bite in the final pages, in which Tyson exposes the entire conservationist project -- with which he obviously has deep sympathy -- to a searching critique. This is fair-minded of him and so unexpected given the tone of most green literature of the past decade (\\"The Eighth Continent\\" just makes it into this dismal decade, having been published in 2000).Tyson says some have called Madagascar an eighth continent because it is so big (as big as Texas, or, as we have recently learned to think of these things, as Afghanistan), and because of its long isolation it possesses (or once possessed) a true continent's worth of characteristic plants and animals. Nevertheless, it is still an island and still subject to the harsh constraints of island biogeography. Should the people of Texas or Afghanistan eat themselves out of house and home, they can retreat to Oklahoma or Iran. The Malagasy have no place to go."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"I hate to disagree with the majority of the reviews, but I only found this book \\"okay.\\" It's worth reading but it's not to rave about. The best parts deal with the Malagsy people, culture and history. The descriptions of the animals, plants, and ecosystems are weak. There are few photos and those are not highly informative or high quality. I recommend sections of David Quamman's book, Song of the Dodo, which has a much stronger biological bent to it."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"I have come away from this book with a strong desire to visit Madagascar and a good understanding of the country's wonders and challenges. In a very entertaining style recounting his travels and sharing tales of the island's lore, Peter Tyson gives us an overview of both the Malagasy people and fauna ( and somtimes flora ) and how they relate in light of its conservation issues. He also outlines the limited knowledge that exists as to how this unique island has come to be so different from anywhere else on Earth, opening the scope for unlimited wonder and whetting a thirst to find out more. A great starting point for an interest in Madagascar and a thoroughly enjoyable read.I would recommend reading Mike Eveleigh's, Maverick in Madagascar, after this."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"Madagascar in my mind has always been one those wild exotic places. This book does a very good job of introducing the place and providing insights into wildlife, culture, orgins, and a possible plan for the future of conservation in Madagascar. It reads well and doesn't bog down very often. The chapters about the herps of Madagascar were my favorite, but I am biased towards herps. The conservation issues are presented in a balanced way, and the opposing opinions about the success or failure of the Community development/national park conservation plans are pretty well explained. I recommend this book to anybody wanting to learn more about Madagascar, it is a great introduction would be a worthwhile read if you wanted to travel to Madagascar and be more than just a bumbling tourist."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"Madagascar is like Australia in some ways - a sort of zoological attic, filled with animals the rest of the world forgot about or never met. Tyson has probed the fauna of this island for many years, and his doscoveries, adventures, and insights make for a most informative book. Some of the most interesting passages deal with his inquiries into animals reported by some of the indigenous people but not yet confirmed by science. Tyson doesn't take all the animal stories he hears at face value, but he doesn't discount them, either. He believes we have more to learn about the creatures of this island - and we must learn it quickly. Development and other pressures are eroding the island's biodiversity at a frightening rate. Tyson conveys that urgency along with the wonder of this unique and special place."},{"Title":"The Eighth Continent:: Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar","review":"This book makes you feel like your on the trip through Madagascar with the author.

If you want to know the difference between a contest and a sweepstake--and more importantly which one is better for your marketing situation--this book is for you.

A must read..."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"Stanley Bing delves into the world of coroporate paranoia and loneliness in this novel, told by the perspective of world-weary Fred Tell, who explains in pungent, fast-paced, insightful prose how his business friend Robert Harbert must suffer all sorts of bizzare accusations from his one-time friend and assistant CaroleAnne Winter, a scandalously-dressed woman who becomes convinced that the office, headed by Herbert, is out to get her. The trial, based on CaroleAnne's bogus lawsuit of sexual harassment, examines a major theme in the novel, namely America's inability, through its often bovine-minded populace, to discern between rational and cheap argumentation. Fred Tell suffers from a viable fear that the jury is too uneducated and brainwashed by unexamined emotionalism used by CaroleAnne's attorney to see through her paranoid delusions. I'll let you read the book's conclusion to see what the jury decides.The themes of corporate loneliness, suffocating paranoia, and insanity, rendered so well in this book are also done well in two companion novels, Moral Hazard by Kate Jennings, and The Ignored (a horror novel, if you can believe it) by Bentley Little."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"I ripped through this book in two days! It was a funny spoof of office life, (particularly in a big corporation). The plot centers on a lawsuit charging sexual harrassment in the office. This allows a thoughtful look at how ordinary office interactions, the ones that allow us all to express a bit of personality, a little humanity, even within the confines of the corporate mold, may be twisted and misinterpreted to seem unfair and oppressive.The narrator is a sketch, a very funny \\"unreliable narrator\\" who tells us all we need to know without always realizing it. It is rare to find a book that captures the corporate ethos the way this one does -- the camaraderie, the understanding of rank, latitude in behavior depending on position, the helplessness of the senior managers without their support staff, the addiction to expense account living.The ending is bittersweet, the only ending possible. Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"This is one book that will genuinely affect different readersmany different ways. Although mainly told from the perspectiveof a narrator who is a friend of all concerned and is the headof corporate HR, many readers will identify with differentplayers in this drama. Plus, the corporation that employs allthese people is part of the problem and possible solutions.Throughout the personal drama involved, and the tragedy that isplayed out on several levels, the corporation seems to have themost impact on the greatest number of lives, even though corporations are supposed to have no souls and therefore, nopersonal feelings.The head of a special &quot;quality&quot; division is on the rise, as ishis division during the days of corporate growth and profit,and when a lovely temp solves her first big problem in such aneasy, smooth way, she is promptly hired as an assistant to thathead. Everyone in the division seems to like the woman, andshe is helpful and hard-working, but her personal life intrudesinto her business life, as it often does; in her case, that personal life is a hard one, and she shows up at work havingobviously been beaten by a thug of a husband. Everyone feelssorry for her, and they all try to help her through that trauma.She gets promotions a little too early, and she gets nice cashbonuses ahead of time, and she grows in importance as so manypeople lavish extra attention and graditude on her. She advances in the corporation beyond her experience or education,and no one seems to mind because she is so dedicated to the company and its profits.But about the same time the company begins to stagnate economically, the woman starts to act in an odd manner, andshe begins to criticize, and even attack, beyond reason, andeveryone notices, but, in true corporation fashion, no one triesto get a grip on the situation. As the woman begins to deteriorate emotionally, and perhaps mentally, everyone beginsto fear her, and she is allowed to continue on her destructiveway.Then, when the proper leaders of her division see she should notbe allowed to continue in her job, everyone begins to get afraidof a possible law suit, so, again, they do nothing while thebad situation escalates into a worse situation.The co. even tries to promote her in order to get her into adifferent division, with less stress, where she might settledown into normal corporate behavior. But she refuses the promotion, and she insists her place is right where she is.Then, as the division is beginning to dry up and shrink, forall the business reasons, the woman assistant offers to resign,but, again, for reasons improperly altruistic, her resignationis refused, so the company loses its last chance to get her outof their collective hair.She repays all the promotions, bonuses, personal help and easypath to corporate success by then quitting and suing the company. As the saying goes, &quot;no good dead goes unpunished.&quot;Throughout the string of personal problems, and then the corporate legal manuevering, the one who suffers the most is theone guy who truly worried about her, and cared about her as a human being, without asking anything in return. Because he hascared so much, and tried so hard to do good, he is the one mostdamaged by the accusations. Then, as further reward, the corporation begins to doubt his worth to the company, and theybegin squeezing him out, probably hoping somehow that will defuse the lawsuit.The story is complex, and it shows how many people suffer, andto what depth that suffering can go, when one person is allowedto poison the corporate atmosphere that is nurturing so manypeople. Because of the one woman's obsessions and mental deterioration, which the company did nothing to check, careersand even lives are permanently damaged, and even personal livesare broken.The results seem hard to believe, but to anyone who has triedto survive corporate life, and become a productive part of it,the story will ring too, too true. Hard work is ignored, goodpeople are destroyed, the best of intentions are undermined,and the corporation goes on, usually run by the least-sensitive,unimagative, single-minded, greed-driven people possible.This story shows too well, and in a very complex, emotional way,what can happen to people who care too much.As said above, different people will react in different ways tothe story, but it is a good, solid story well worth reading.Whether read from the view of an individual striving to succeed,or from the corporate side only worried about profit, there ismuch to be learned here.A good, emotionally-charged, entertaining read."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"As a fan of Sun Tzu Was a Sissy, What Would Machiavelli Do?, and Throwing the Elephant I couldn't pass up the opportunity to read Bing's novel.

The novel is broken into three \\"books\\" introducing us to Robert \\"Harb\\" Harbert, his enigmatic assistant CaroleAnne, and narrator Fred Tell as well as other key players.

Hilarious, literally lol funny... centers on a comic but horrible and all too plausible trial. \\"At this point the judge literally stood up on his dais-- which made him slightly shorter-- and screamed \\"I've had it with you, Buster!\\"This is the story of a corporate scandal, told by Tell, the head of human resources-- and naturally, the person who knows everyone in the company. But if you think this is a kind of Bill/Monica tale, think again. This book takes on a larger picture-- Harb, the Executive Vice President in charge of Total Quality, who is accused by his offbeat but incredibly efficient secretary CarolAnne, is a hapless Everyman. What this book is really about is not so much the manipulation of sex in the workplace, but about the way Work and the Office have become Life for so many of us. Harb's real tragedy is not so much his infatuation with CarolAnne which is more chivalrous than anything else, but his discovery of himself after years of distraction with empty pursuits, travel, material achievements, brought on only by this unjust persecution. It's not only his tragedy, but also the tragedy of his wife Jean, who realizes too late that she loves her husband as a person and not a role, Tell, Harb's friend who comes to see how the office cameraderie can never be the same, and for the reader who had been seduced into the \\"Lou Grant/Mary Tyler Moore\\" chumminess of the corporate world. The book stayed with me. The author doesn't fake either a happy or a tragic end but one that is ambiguous, leaving me to reflect on where happiness lies. This is a fascinating look at the dangers inherent in human communication, and in where we put our joys."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"For me, YOU LOOK NICE TODAY was in the couldn't-put-it-down category. My husband felt the same way, so that makes 2.The Publisher's Weekly review does not describe our experience of the book. I don't think many people would call YOU LOOK NICE TODAY a legal thriller, and we certainly didn't find it slow going at any point.The book is a satire of corporate life, and is very, very funny at the start, then poignant and even painful toward the end. The plot has a twist neither of us saw coming. We expected a standard anti-P.C. trajectory, but that's not what the book turns out to be in the end. Or not entirely.YOU LOOK NICE TODAY reminds me a bit of the movie AMERICAN BEAUTY. The book has the same strong narrational presence & ironic tone as the film, and, as in the film, you discover only gradually that it is about more than 'the banality of suburban (or corporate or bourgeois) life.'Not to sound pretentious, YOU LOOK NICE TODAY is about life itself. Life and loss."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"The ramifications of utilizing sexual harassment charges as a workplace weapon have been explored by other authors. But, few have shown those consequences more pointedly than Stanley Bing does in You Look Nice Today. Bing portrays how just the mere allegation of sexual harassment, unfounded or not, is enough to make one a pariah in their workplace. Through this depiction, Bing also casts a painfully bright light on the modern corporation's survival instincts. The picture of a workplace that is as ruthlessly efficient in eliminating potential internal problems as it is in delivering product is one that will ring true to many people.The book does drift a bit when its protagonist decides to disconnect from society. But, while it is focused on the harassment charges and the subsequent trial, You Look Nice Today is as concise as a business textbook. Given the book's honest situations, realistic characters, and biting wit, many will find You Look Nice Today too close to non-fiction for comfort."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"I've always enjoyed Gil's, that is, Stanley's, business column writing as funny yet insightful. In this novel, his second, he somehow achieves the same result. Both the corporate and human dynamics are well done, well written, and interesting. His insights on the loneliness of achievement in higher corporate life are illuminating and touching. Maybe those fat cats aren't so fat after all."},{"Title":"You Look nice Today","review":"Michael Crichton gave sexual harassment a bad name when a power-hungry, highly sexual female practices reverse sexual discrimination and now Stanley Bing again puts the idea of sexual harassment charges brought by a woman in bad light, only this time the wrongfully accusing woman is sexy, demure, unassuming, competent, and driven by religion, not sex.Robert (\\"Harb\\") Harbert is the victim in this story yet he is more foolish than innocent. His Boswell is Fred Tell, the VP of Human Resources, who ought to know better. Tell offers his view as a seemingly disinterested observer, only to become uninterested about the time the book becomes uninteresting. Tell presents the first third of the book as history and background. For example, a boss says \\"take out this trash\\" and CarolAnne thinks it is aimed at her personally. Harb, hearing heavy pounding outside his office, asks her what she is killing, and she claims he's accusing her of having an abortion. You get the picture. The multimillion dollar lawsuit and trial follow and then a relatively brief conclusion. Tell describes the accuser, CarolAnne (one word, capital 'A') in physical terms while he also praises her incredible work talents. She has excellent work skills, is apparently very overqualified, but she has a load of personal and work history baggage that even a nave HR assistant would not fail to question. But first Harb, and then others, are smitten by her combination of knockout skills and miraculous work output, and the rest, as they say, is history. The biggest problem seems to be that his firm hired in haste and then repented at their leisure. And boy, are they leisurely. At times, the firm's management makes Richard Grasso's directors look like a bunch of Ebenezer Scrooges. Salaries are astronomical, raises are rapid, and expense accounts, well let's just say that Harb casually assumes his $15k a month expense account habit will be supported for most of his first year following his termination. And Bing makes the corporate quality movement something trivial and a passing fad, an apparent demotion for Harb to get the head job and an office quickly closed when times go bad. So much for corporate quality.The best insight here comes from the judge at the trial. Unfortunately, he has about ten lines throughout the book, including transcripts from the trial that are intermingled with the narration. There is little need to describe the moronic behavior of the opposing lawyers or the outcome of the trial. There is humor in some of the characters and their actions and some insight into corporate life. Even the loser at the trial seems happy. By the end, the only victim in this book is perhaps the reader."},{"Title":"The Letters of Danny Coyle","review":"This is a wonderful story that can be enjoyed by all.

Having taught fourth grade in California for ten years, I thought I had a good understanding of the relationship between the native Americans and the Spanish. This indredible story of a Kumeyaay Indian woman, took me to new heights of understanding, and stirred emotions in me from compassion and sadness for the natives, to rage and disgust of the Spanish. The author does an exceptional job of bringing her characters to life. I literally could not put the book down as I raced to learn the fate of these intriguing characters. Margaret Wyman writes with passion and ingenuity. I highly recommend this fine book."},{"Title":"Mission: The Birth of California, the Death of a Nation","review":"Besides telling the dirty truth, this book will keep you reading and biting your nails until the very end.

Surprising twists and turns are followed through the intertwining of the lives of the natives, the Spanish soldiers, the Mexicans, and the \\"black robes\\". Good and Evil, sanity and madness, religious fervor and native beliefs are all portrayed in this novel.I hope that her future titles will be as readable."},{"Title":"Mission: The Birth of California, the Death of a Nation","review":"Mission: The Birth Of California, The Death Of A Nation is an historical novel set against the conquest of Southern California by the Spanish crown, set at the same era as when the United States was fighting for its independence. A brutal tale of the subjugation, forced religious conversion, enslavement, and massacre of California's native people seen through the eyes of a young woman who personally experiences the worst and most vicious of the conquistadors' treatment. A disturbing but highly recommended saga by Margaret Wyman, Mission accurately depicts the historical, genocidal impact that foreign settlement had on California's native population."},{"Title":"Mission: The Birth of California, the Death of a Nation","review":"Margaret Wyman was blessed with the gift of story telling.

Even those vividly dreadful souls who stirred my empathy and anger, and who made me want to turn back the clock and change history, were strong and determined survivors.This is an educational, fascinating, and thought-provoking book.

I was impressed that these ancient diaries had been preserved and had been brought into the printing world. I was not impressed with the content. Pitti's diary did not tell me anything about Florence. He traveled too much because of his affinity with the French. He seemed to me like a conservative, wealthy extremist who wrote the diary for his own self indulgence. My understanding of Renaissance Florence is no sharper than before this book because the life of this man could not have been indicative of the rest of the population of Florence."},{"Title":"The Bearer of Gifts","review":"I was absolutely delighted with the warmth and imagination contained in this childrens book. The idea of bringing Santa and Jesus together was wonderful and helps to remind us what Christmas is all about.The illustrations are well drawn but uncomplicatd so don't detract from the story at all.This book also contains a wonderful little side story. Can't see it? Just follow the dog in the illustrations. It is very amusing and compliments the joy brought through to us in the main story.As a childrens yuletide book I have not found better. It is a pitty I have run out of kids to send it to."},{"Title":"The Bearer of Gifts","review":"Searching for a way to integrate the true meaning of Christmas with the story of Santa Claus? Search no more. This book helped solved my dilemna on Santa Claus - since he's become so commercialized in our society and kids have become greedy, I hesitated to tell the story of Santa in our house. This book changed my mind. Santa begins as the true bearer of gifts to the Baby Jesus. He continues to spread the story of the Savior's birth and his miraculous visit to adults and children everywhere each Christmas, while bearing handmade toys for the children. A great book to teach young and all the true meaning of Christmas."},{"Title":"The Bearer of Gifts","review":"This book beautifully balances Santa Claus and the Nativity in a story that is both inspiring and engaging. The colors and folk art drawings are a delightful departure from the typical seasonal fare. The most fantastic picture has to be the one depicting the subtle change in Santa's appearance when he gives the baby his humble gift.If you are looking for a story that doesn't diminish the lore of St. Nick and his generosity but doesn't overshadow the Nativity, look no more. You've found it!"},{"Title":"The Bearer of Gifts","review":"What does Christmas mean to you? As a child, I was one who couldn't get enough of its wonder. Santa was a huge part of this feeling.Yet time passes, wonder fades. Knowledge drives out belief. The world grows hard and dull.The greatness of The Bearer of Gifts is that it tells two tales wrapped together in one story. The wondrous truth of Christmas and its meaning are expressed in a fun remaking and retelling of Santa's story. Fused together, this creates an honest little book that haunts the memory even as it delights the soul.The retelling of the story of Santa Claus is brilliant. Wrapped in the icy mists of its Lapland setting, it is an invigorating blast of cold that gives the tale of Santa a new freshness. Any staleness brought about by the constant retelling of the Santa story is blown away by Steven Kenneth's stark vision.This Santa story is masterfully woven into the true meaning of Christmas--the Free Gift of God to all people in His Son. Santa leaves his home in Lapland to follow a star across the winter sky. His journeys take him far from home--the foot of a stable.The Bearer of Gifts is a book that is both simple and profound. Its loving illustrations and spare language make it something truly special. This book peels back layers of obscurity and heartless commercialization that have dulled the meaning of Christmas in the heart of many.Christmas is a time of wonder. If its wonder has grown cold in your heart, I can think of no greater way to rekindle it than to curl up with this book on a winter's night. I give The Bearer of Gifts a strong recommendation."},{"Title":"The Bearer of Gifts","review":"I found this book at the library last year and it has quickly become my favorite Christmas story.

Gorgeous, unique illustrations.I will buy it for every child on my list as well as some adults."},{"Title":"Gendering Wisdom the Host Biblical Invit (Journal for the Study of the Old Testament)","review":"In the introduction, McKinlay attracts the reader with an intriguing concept: the figure of Wisdom appears either directly or indirectly throughout the Bible, yet transitions from definitely feminine in Proverbs, to concealed femininity in Ben Sira and Sirach, to significantly masculine in John (this is at least the angle of the book that interested me). Unfortunately, with every page McKinlay's argument falls deeper into a mire of academic language, non-stop quotations of varying quality, and alternative interpretive allowances that her point finally dissolves into a non-statement. McKinlay obviously has the scholarly equipment to conquer the subject matter, but she weakens her argument at every chance possible, until in fact it appears that she does not actually have an opinion but is merely pointing out the perhaps one could be had. The structure of the book fails; there is no satisfactory conclusion to chapters, sub-sections, or even the end of the book. Without a strong guiding hand from the author, the read is wholly unrewarding.I am glad that I took this book home from the library, for I felt that the topic presented an interpretive challenge for the Biblical scholar. However, I found the same general information presented in concise, fluid form, in the notes to the New Interpreters Study Bible. There are a few good lines interspersed at great intervals throughout the book, but I feel that in toto, it fails. Read the intro at a university library if you want to know more about the subject matter."},{"Title":"Winning With the Fischer-Sozin Attack (Batsford Chess Library)","review":"I think that this book is highly reccomended to all players who don't like to simply win a chess game! The lines are analized with clearness taking advantage of what grandmaster practice has done with them. Lane chooses beautiful and instructive games for each line and he gives the strategic plans that are behind any possible continuations (all the notes are strictly connected to this feature). This is very important because this variation doesn't admit any misjudgments and so the moves must be carefully calculated, this is why it's most wiseable to me that you can understand the way you make that move instead of learning the move from a book. This book allows you to enter the secrets of the Fischer-Sozin without putting in your memory a lot of move orders without explanation. The only reason I didn't give 10 rating is that I wanted to see much more games than the 48 analized inside... But I can assure you this number is anyway worth of it!"},{"Title":"Winning With the Fischer-Sozin Attack (Batsford Chess Library)","review":"I don't have much to add to the other review. I will say that I occasionally stop playing 1. e4 all together, because I don't want to face the Sicilian. But this is silly. Why play chess at all if I am scared of certain lines? After all, it's only a game. My point is that when I come back to 1. e4 and try to decide what to play against the Sicilian, I always end up turning to this book by Lane (that is, after I try and drop the Smith-Morra [too gimmicky], the Alapin [too passive], the Grand Prix [too aggressive], and the Closed [too Closed!]. The Bc4 scheme makes a lot of sense, and is consonant with chess principles and chess history (Fischer used it, and he is the closest thing to what Morphy may have been like in the modern era). Excellent book with a good index in the back and nicely produced by Batsford."},{"Title":"Hunting and Gathering on the Information Savanna: Conversations on Modeling Human Search Abilities","review":"A quirky but very useful and well-written book about the information search process and its analogs in the world of natural selection and evolutionary adaptation. There are essays about submarine chasing and skip tracing by Brian O'Connor -- not the usual dry stuff of academic texts on human search behavior. At the same time, there is a strong (and well-cited) intellectual underpinning to everything here. The editors call their work &quot;intellectual hopscotch&quot; -- the same metaphor could apply to the human search behavior they describe. This is a worthwhile and compelling book."},{"Title":"Examine the Evidence: Exploring the Case for Christianity","review":"The case for Christ is unfortunately not a simple one. However, I feel this book does a fair job at explaining in the simplest terms possible the various points that cover everything from Old Testament prophecy, ancient history, archaeology, and biology that make up the case for the undeniable truth that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior.Still, this book does require a great bit of intellect to comprehend. For example, the book describes (very well) the differences between micro-evolution and macro-evolution and why there is imperical data to support one and not the other. By the way, this book reconciled evolution and creation for me in ways many other books could not. This alone made it worth my while to read. However, there are many other points that are made as brilliantly well.The book is broken up into 40 chapters and is formatted in a way that makes it possible to use in a group study. However, the chapters are a bit long to, say, read 5 a week for an 8 week study. That said, I'm still going to encourage my small group to use it for a study. The case is an important one to understand, so hopefully we'll be up to the challenge so as to share this information with others in an evangelical manner.My advice is to read the first chapter. You'll either put it down right away (like the other reviewer) or be compelled to read on. Either way, all Christians should know why it is that we can trust the Bible better than any other source of information on this planet!"},{"Title":"Examine the Evidence: Exploring the Case for Christianity","review":"Of the dozens of apologetic titles that sit on my shelf, this one is my absolute favourite.Ralph Muncaster has done a superb job of collecting information from many realms of apologetic fields and collating them into one book. This book covers everything you could ever want: it fights evolution's universe-origins theories, fights biological evolution, provides archeological evidence for the OT & NT, provides information on ancient text, canonisation, historical literature, demonstrates a map of time with events, gives a run down on other religions, outlines fulfilled prophesies, provides a strong case for the deity of Christ, and answers alot of common questions.Of all my books, this is the one i keep reaching back for, when i need to recall how to refute an argument.It's true that this book might be considered quite technical to some, but that all comes down to the individual reader. The statistical information and layout of facts is so compelling.The only downside i have is that it takes an old-earth-age view (which it explains why that view is taken), and as i share a different view, i simply source that topic from alternative resources... but the rest of this book is excellent... not only that, but the topics are layed out in the perfect order that allows an individual to go from \\"newbie\\" to \\"expert\\" in one book! A must for all serious apologists."},{"Title":"Examine the Evidence: Exploring the Case for Christianity","review":"When I was youth pastoring I found it imperative to give the young beleivers in my care a reason for their faith. While teaching lessons designed to enforce beleif in the Christians of my group, and to confront the skeptic, I often times found myself using material that was \\"above their heads\\".Because of this I searched high and low for a soundbook that had real depth, without being overly verbose. This book HIT THE SPOT!!!It has GREAT quotable one line defenses for different claims of Scripture, as well as full page explanations. It IS NOT overly technical, but it is not written for dummies either.Makes a great book for small group study, and as an introductory text to basic Christian apologetics.!!!"},{"Title":"Examine the Evidence: Exploring the Case for Christianity","review":"I over see 6 small groups and use this book with them.

The selection is by Dr. Violet de Laszlo, who also wrote a very interesting introduction. The Preface is by Jung himself."},{"Title":"The decline and fall of the romantic ideal","review":"It is a great service to scholarship to keep this wonderful book in print. As the reader might know, Lucas was a Cambridge academic with service in the great war and brilliant service at Bletchley Park during the second world war. He was on Hitler's hit list of intellectuals to be murdered if and when the Nazis conquered Britain.Lucas was a poet, editor, translator and expert on literature and psychology. The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal reads like a book by a very old and very wise man; Lucas was 42 when it was published. The book explores \`romanticism' (which he describes as the exploration and freeing of the unconscious) from antiquity to the present, in Greek literature, Roman, German, Italian and, principally, English and French. There are many long, untranslated French quotes in the text, a possible obstacle for the modern reader.While Lucas is sympathetic to romanticism he wants it to be done very, very well and he is aware of the dangers when it descends into decadence or silliness. Given its prominence in his time and its remaining prominence in ours, his voice is a very important one.It is the kind of voice one seldom hears in contemporary literary criticism. Lucas takes firm stands, offers lean and pointed distinctions and discriminations, names his favorite writers and skewers those of whom he is not particularly fond. It would be uncommon today because of the breadth of its references and because of the author's facility with language. It is also distinctly uncommon since it rather suddenly ends with a travelogue essay on Iceland (with many reflections on the medieval saga literature and its potential importance for us today).In short, this is a splendid book--important for scholars but a beautiful read for the lover of poetry who enjoys a sweet and strong voice."},{"Title":"The Doggonest Puppy Love","review":"Ms. Sanders' loved the pictures.

The book arrived recently and had my mouth watering. I wanted to rush into the kitchen and fire up the oven after reading through recipes like Sour Dough French, Rustic Baguettes, Cracked Wheat, and Olive and Walnut.

Among the anti-Zionists? Irene Siegel was there, and she has some great propaganda for us.But first, I think we need a little perspective that Siegel omits. The Arab war against Israel has been going on for quite a while. It is simply a continuation of the Arab war against Jewish rights in the Levant that went on before Israel became a state. That war began as a result of Jewish emancipation, much as the Ku Klux Klan began its war against the Blacks as a result of the emancipation of Southern Blacks. We ought to realize that the Arabs are not simply innocent victims of some mysterious aggression and theft by a mythical unarmed but militarily unstoppable race of aliens.While the Jewish claim to their land does not depend on ancient history, anti-Zionists sometimes pretend that the Jewish presence in the Levant ended in the first century AD. In fact, the Jewish population diminished significantly in the first and second centuries, and then went down some more in the ensuing few centuries, but it never really vanished. Anti-Zionists also often pretend that Jerusalem was traditionally Arab, but in fact, even in 1844, the Jews were a plurality there, and by the start of modern Zionism later in the century, the Jews were the majority in Jerusalem, especially in the Old City. True, the Jews were a small fraction of the population of the Levant as a whole, due to a variety of racist laws that prevented most Jews from moving to the Levant, getting jobs there, buying land there, or building houses there, but the entire land was rather lightly populated at the time. There was plenty of room for settlements and plenty of opportunity to restore a land which had been badly run down.Anti-Zionists like to pretend that the Jews stole the land from the Arabs and displaced them. But the Jews were unarmed and paid high prices for land. And when they did so, they actually increased the Arab populations in the areas they moved to by improving the economy there. Anti-Zionists often pretend that the Jews failed to buy much land, ignoring the fact that they bought a very substantial amount. Anti-Zionists sometimes say that there was no legal basis for Israel's claim to their state, the West Bank, or Gaza. But actually, there is such a basis, formalized by the League of Nations. They often call Zionism a form of colonialism, and pretend that Great Britain and the Zionists were partners in an anti-Arab conspiracy. But that's false: the British were the ones who came up with the White Paper of 1939, which condemned hundreds of thousands or more Jews and others to death by banning their entry to the Levant. Anti-Zionists also pretend that the United Nations has treated Israel fairly. In fact, the UN has spent a disproportionate amount of its time attacking Israel in a most arbitrary and unfair manner. Not only that, anti-Zionists often pretend that Israel is in violation of major resolutions as well as the Geneva Convention when in fact it is in compliance with them.As for the West Bank, only Pakistan and perfidious Great Britain recognized Jordan's occupation of it in 1948. That land was supposed to be open for Jewish settlement according to the League of Nations. And it actually is disputed territory, although some Arabs seem intent on stealing it, and they look like they may succeed.After the Six-Day War of 1967, the world was treated to the supposed creation of a new people, namely the Levantine Arabs! They had never been a people before, they had no language or religion to differentiate themselves from other Arabs, but they were declared to be a special and ancient people whose land had supposedly been stolen from them by the Jews! But this \\"people\\" turned out to be no more of a people than the Sudeten Germans, and their leadership turned out to be no more representative of the Arab residents of the area than the Mafia is of the residents of the United States.Irene Siegel is right that there's violence in the West Bank and Israel. But she's pretending that the Israelis are at fault, not the Arab aggressors. And that means that she's swindling her readers. In addition, she pretends that Israel is somehow getting away with something by letting Jews live in the West Bank. But the reverse is true, Arabs are getting away with something by getting international support to evict these Jews from their land there. Siegel pretends that Israel is engaging in ethnic cleansing by letting Jews live in the West Bank. But in fact the only people who are getting ethnically cleansed are the Jews, who were recently removed from Gaza and may be removed from parts of the West Bank next. And she pretends that Israel is greedy by wanting to be able to have Jews live in the West Bank. But Israel is in fact land-poor. If all people were allowed to buy land at auction no matter what their religion, Jews would wind up with far more Levantine land than they now have. In addition, Jews ought to be acknowledged to have as much right to settle in the disputed territories as Arabs. If the Jews are denied this right, that is pure theft of their land, prejudging any negotiations, since the status of land can not be in dispute if only Arabs are allowed to be there.This article is simply propaganda to support the theft of Jewish land and the denial of human rights to Levantine Jews."},{"Title":"Visitor Volume 2","review":"Volume 2 of Visitor left a lot lacking in the plot development department. Nothing really eventful happens in this volume until the closing pages, which barely makes up for the lack of the preceding 160 pages. Hyo-Bin and her on-again off-again friend Mi-Soo Kim continue to find themselves in a blood-spattered corpse-strewn room nightmare every night. Ji-Hwan continues to manuever himself into position to be Hyo-Bin's love interest, while his best friend, the more upright Gun-Yang pushes his feelings on Hyo-Bin even more. And she pushes them both away because she is afraid they will get hurt.Volume 2 was basically just more of the same. We have no further clues as to what is going on in the two girl's nightmare. It's starting to seem as if the horror element is taking a back seat to the shojo elements here, so maybe the occult plotline should be jettisoned so the author can focus on the whole girl/boy dynamic. If not for the last few pages I would not pick up Volume 3. But as for now, I can still have hope that Visitor will get back on track."},{"Title":"Women of a Certain Age: The Midlife Search for Self","review":"Though written many years ago, this book is still relevant today. As a college teacher of Psychology, I assigned this book to students many times. A great many students told me they had purchased a copy for their mothers, who had found it both helpful and comforting.

I highly recommend it, particularly for any readers with an interest in the history of the Erie Canal and Upstate NY.Canal Town tells the story of the early days of Palmyra, NY through the eyes of Dr. Horace Amlie. Dr. Amlie arrives in Palmyra looking for a prosperous trading town to hang his shingle, and settles to serve the local community. At the time the book starts, the canal is still being dug and the town is gearing up for the excitement and riches that they are sure will follow. The book is packed with the details of that early life-- fever and dysentry follow the progress of the canal, modern medicine is starting to emerge, temperence reformers fill the churches, and the taming process of what was then the western frontier begins in earnest. Eventually, the young Dr. Amlie becomes involved in a medical mystery that threatens his entire career.Adams, who grew up in Rochester NY, was a prolific writer who lived and wrote between 1871 and 1958. He began his career as a muckraker for Collier's, attacking the patent medicine industry. He became famous for his novels of the Jazz age, writing under the pen name of Warner Fabian. Although he himself characterized much of his writing as potboilers, he was well-respected for the quality of his writing and friends with many of the greats of the day.In the Case of Canal Town, Adams' background as a medical writer combined beautifully with his writing skills to create an entertaining and gripping read. The 466 pages went by much faster than I ever would have expected, and I kept myself up into the night to read the resolution of the mystery.If you are a fan of writers like Wilkie Collins or if you like very strong historical fiction, then I suspect that you will find a lot to like in this book. Readers should be aware that abortion is a central element in the story, albeit obliquely."},{"Title":"Canal Town: A novel","review":"A remarkable book. The author successfully carries several different fascinating themes through the book. Most important, historically is, of course, the building, operation and economics of the Erie Canal. The book is excellent for filling in your understanding of the Canal's importance - and you will hardly be aware of learning this important piece of history.Socially, the book explores the social strata in a small- to mid-size upper New York State, early 19th century community. You get to know the well-to-do, the middlin', those in poverty - not to mention those on the seamy side. And all as affected by the advent of the Canal, with all its commerce.Then there's the medical thread. The author's protagonist is a small-town doctor in competition with an \\"old-school\\" practitioner - and the competition is both lively - and deadly. Through it all, the reader learns a great deal of medical history, the easy way - by being entertained.Best of all, really, is the actual story. It makes the rich historical detail barely noticeable by combining all in an excellent story line. There's romance, violence, betrayal, and mystery - all nicely woven together. Published in the mid-40s, there is no annoying political correctness or graphic sexual content, but you will hardly miss those things.I bought mine inexpensively as part of a book lot, but this one is worth getting at Amazon prices! It's out of print, so you will have to buy it used. Disappointing that books this good are not currently in print, but good copies are not that hard to find. Get it and enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Vikings Myths and Legends: Coloring Book","review":"Reading Level: Young Adult. This excellent little coloring book is chock-full of line drawings of Viking Age art and artifacts, carefully selected to accompany the brief text retellings of the Norse myths by a noted scholar of the Viking Age. Based on the nature of Viking Art, I think this book would be fun to color for young children as well as older ones. The paper is fairly heavy-weight, suitable for crayon or marker, but not paints, and some markers may bleed through. The best use of this particular coloring book is not for children, however, but for artists wishing to utilize Viking Age artistic motifs in their own work -- this book provides line drawings which can easily be used as artist's cartoons for projects ranging from embroidery to woodwork to stained glass to carving and so on. Your child may enjoy this book, but get an extra copy for yourself."},{"Title":"Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Monticello","review":"I got the audio CD edition of \\"Jefferson's Secrets\\" for a recent cross-country drive. It made the journey much more enjoyable and rewarding -- even the endless landscape of Texas passed by in no time!ABOUT THE CD PRODUCTION QUALITIES:The narrator, Simon Vance, does a superlative job. His voice is very easy on the ear, and his pacing and enunciation are ideal. The only minor niggle is that he pronounces the name of Jefferson's home as \\"montisello\\" instead of \\"montichello\\". (Dictionaries endorse both pronunciations, but Jefferson's correspondence suggests that he used the Italian version.)The book lends itself to aural consumption very well -- I found myself listening in \\"page-turning mode\\" in some sections, and in others, I was pausing the CD frequently to take notes and reflect. It makes for very comfortable and efficient absorption.ABOUT THE CD CONTENTS:Unlike other reviewers, I don't believe that \\"Secrets\\" requires extensive familiarity with Jefferson and his politics. My rudimentary knowledge of American history (I'm an immigrant) did not hinder my comprehension or enjoyment of the book at all. On the contrary, I think \\"Secrets\\" makes an excellent Jefferson primer because it covers those aspects of the man that he deemed most important himself (according to his epitaph.)\\"Jefferson's Secrets\\" is an immensely satisfying book -- one that leaves you wishing for equally thorough and insightful works on other prominent figures. Alas, few people have made their souls as accessible as Jefferson did. Indeed, it appears that most of his words and deeds were intended with a view to his legacy. By bringing Jefferson's later writings to light, Burstein is therefore fulfilling the founder's fervent wish that his contributions and convictions be properly understood.The book has a very effective structure. The first two chapters serve as a prelude, presenting a miscellany of information about Jefferson: his decidedly physiological view of life, his activities and afflictions, his relationships with family and friends, his highly rational and scientific mindset, his voracious reading and writing habits, etc. There is also much information about Jefferson's times, including the prevailing medical and scientific knowledge, attitudes, conditions, personalities, and language usage.This groundwork places the reader squarely inside Jefferson's head, which helps a great deal in understanding his views on slavery, race, gender, sex, politics, literature, and religion. In subsequent chapters, Burstein explores each of these topics thoroughly and unflinchingly. His well-founded conclusions answered my questions in full. Having finished the book, I feel I know Jefferson as well as might a family member or a close friend. I am now better able to appreciate his virtues, and I have a clearer understanding of his shortcomings.Yes, Jefferson's legacy is clouded because he was not able to rise above his times to become the emancipator of Blacks and women. Yes, he was uncharacteristically close-minded about race and surprisingly vindictive towards his political enemies. And yes, he was fiscally irresponsible in living way beyond his means (the quintessential American!)However, the salient image that emerges from the book is that of a man who was indeed \\"a mindful practitioner of the art of living life.\\" He provided the mantra for the nascent republic, and his vision and awareness guided it during its early vulnerability. He was understated, principled, caring, curious, industrious, resourceful, optimistic, and reasonable. In a more enlightened time, I have no doubt that he would have written \\"all people are created equal\\".I am awed and inspired by all that Jefferson was able to achieve -- has there ever been a better manager of time? On the other hand, I am saddened to think that one of this country's greatest presidents would have no chance of being elected today (a non-religious widower would be a nonstarter.)\\"Secrets\\" is a positive and uplifting work. In a world of sound bites, it's a pleasure discovering research as comprehensive, even-handed, and well-written as this. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Monticello","review":"I learned some new information about Mr. Jefferson and would recommend this to customers with some reservation. The mispronouncing of Jefferson's home became livable after being irritating at first. The author fell in love with the word \\"felicity\\" but used it far too many times. Two of the disks had defects and skipped so many times I couldn't finish listening to them. I very much enjoyed the description of Mr. Jefferson's health problems snd explanation of 18th century treatments. Yes, I would recommend \\"Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Montecello\\" but with reservations."},{"Title":"Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Monticello","review":"The narrator's voice is almost as annoying as his continual mispronunciation of Monticello. As to the 'book' itself, the prologue is endless and serves only as a monument to the author's colossal ego.

Skip this one."},{"Title":"The German campaigns in the Balkans (spring, 1941) (CMH pub)","review":"Good, if brief, summary of Balkan campaign. Reviews political, logistical, and force aspects of the campaigns, but left me wanting to know more of somethings but less of others. For example, he lists a detailed order of battle for the German forces arranged against Yugoslavia, but leaves you to find out on your own what the composition of a German Tank Corps would be, when a simple table would provide lots of clarity. For the Yugoslavia campaign, the bulk of the writing involves preparations, and the combat narrative is a bare skeleton. The Greek campaign is described in somewhat more detail and leaves the reader with a better understanding. The photos might be interesting if they were not too fuzzy to interpret. The maps are almost illegible and therefore unhelpful."},{"Title":"If you can't be good (The Perennial Library mystery series)","review":"The lion's share of the narrative of this superbly crafted mystery unfolds in Washington, D.C., circa early 1970s. Deke Lucas makes his living by uncovering waste, fraud and abuse for various governmental agencies. And he's very good at what he does. So good in fact that Frank Size, a syndicated columnist of considerable reknown, lures him away from his latest governmental post to investigate a very intriguing news story.It seems that one of the U.S. Senate's rising stars, an Indiana Democrat named Robert Ames has abruptly resigned his office amid rumors of his having taken a $50,000 bribe. Since Ames and his wife are millionaires many times over, the incident makes little sense. Moreover, the ex-Senator seems to have fallen completely under the control of a sexy young woman named Connie Mizelle.As Deke Lucas attempts to get to the root of what has befallen Robert Ames, a number of deliciously interesting complications are revealed. Written with abundant wit, this fast paced, action packed story is filled with unexpected twists and delightful surprises.If You Can't be Good is a great example of Ross Thomas at his best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"If you can't be good (The Perennial Library mystery series)","review":"Though written in the early 70s, this novel is timeless in its cynical depiction of human nature. And though any Thomas novel can be counted on for vivid characterization, smooth wry witty prose, and a complicated suspense plot, this is one of his best. I have recommended Ross Thomas to fellow readers for decades, and have, admittedly, found he is something of a specialized taste. Not everyone \\"gets\\" him. However, I rank him with the best suspense auhors--Thomas Harris, Tony Hillerman, John LeCarre, John Sandford, John D. MacDonald, etc. If you haven't ever given him a whirl, consider it. I'll also add that he is a wonderfully re-readable writer."},{"Title":"If you can't be good (The Perennial Library mystery series)","review":"I bought this book to complete my set of Ross Thomas books.

THE MOVING TOYSHOP is the only one commonly found in bookstores and is (rightly) considered a classic of the genre. However, for my money, BURIED FOR PLEASURE is the best of the Fen mysteries. It's certainly the funniest, with priceless bits including one of literature's best hauntings and a most memorable pig.Gervase Fen's non-campaign for parliament isn't just insanely funny--it also includes some very intelligent insight into the political process, and reminds us that a great deal of good sense underlies a comic approach to many things. This is one of the best detective novels ever written."},{"Title":"Buried for Pleasure","review":"The title of this Gervase Fen mystery is dredged from English folklore: &quot;Buried on Monday, buried for health, /Buried on Tuesday, buried for wealth; /Buried on Wednesday, buried at leisure, /Buried on Thursday, buried for pleasure; /Buried on Friday, buried for fun, /Buried on Saturday, buried at one; /Buried on Sunday after eleven, /You get the priest and you go to heaven.&quot;A more macabre folk jingle than, say &quot;Monday's child is fair of face...&quot; but appropriate for a murder mystery that our detective-don solves while standing for Parliament in rural England.Along with the eccentric detective Gervase Fen, Professor of English Language and Literature in the University of Oxford, Edmund Crispin also features one of his eccentric animals in &quot;Buried for Pleasure.&quot; This time it is a 'non-doing' pig that falls in love with the village's pub manager.The plot also works in that most obvious of red herrings: an escaped lunatic who believes himself to be President Woodrow Wilson. His normal mode of dress is a pince nez, and he must be the only lunatic in literature who declares, as he is captured and led away, &quot;I warn you that if my Fourteen Points are not adopted, Western Europe will be at war again within a decade.&quot; Since &quot;Buried for Pleasure&quot; takes place in 1949, his prophecy was correct, although tardy.We never do find out exactly why Fen is standing for Parliament. One of the other characters challenges him to explain his motives:&quot;'Well, what on earth...I mean, why are you standing for Parliament? What put the idea into your head?'&quot;Even to himself Fen's actions were sometimes unaccountable, and he could think of no very convincing reply.&quot;'It is my wish,' he said sanctimoniously, 'to serve the community.'&quot;The girl eyed him dubiously.&quot;'Or at least,&quot; he amended, 'that is one of my motives. Besides, I felt I was getting far too restricted in my interests. Have you ever produced a definitive edition of Langland?'&quot;'Of course not,' she said crossly.&quot;'I have. I've just finished producing one. It has ...psychological effects. You begin to wonder if you're mad. And the only remedy for that is a complete change of occupation.'&quot;Read this book not so much for the mystery, but for Fen's final campaign speech when he decides that he doesn't want to get elected after all.As for the mystery, Crispin ties all of his loose ends together in a climactic automobile chase that involves the lunatic who thinks he's President Wilson, the Cockney pub manager and her non-doing pig, the murderer, a candidate for Parliament, and the rector who is plagued by a poltergeist.And the poltergeist.&quot;Buried for Pleasure&quot; is vintage Crispin."},{"Title":"Buried for Pleasure","review":"For my money, this hilarious book is the best mystery by Crispin, better even than the (also wonderful) Moving Toyshop. Literate, intriguing, and funny. The book has a mood and flow that really comes together, with never a false note.

The author has chaptersdevoted to evolution, statistical mechanics and information, molecular biology,information technology, and speculation about the future.Avery makes several key points in his book. The first is that livingorganisms, as highly ordered systems whose configurations could hardly havearisen by chance, are constantly fighting the Second Law of Thermodynamics,and get their thermodynamic information from the environment. To explainthis, Avery ties together the fields of information theory, developed byShannon, and statical mechanics and thermodynamics, developed byGibbs, Boltzmann, Maxwell, and others. While I am not sure whether hislogic is correct (according to reviewers on Amazon.com, this is debatable),I do wish he showed the derivations in more detail, rather than juststating things.Avery observes that when humans developed complex language and culture, itdemarcates a new phase in the evolution of life on Earth. Previously,information as passed down from one generation to the next in the geneticcode. Humans, however, can use language to do as well. Since humanlanguage can transmit a far greater amount and range of information thanDNA, human cultural evolution is the current great chapter in evolution,especially after the invention of writing and electronic computers. Forexample, he notes that the scientific revolution in the West was possibleonly after the inventions of paper and printing reached Europe.This observation comes with a warning, however. Genetically, we are almostidentical with our Stone Age ancestors. Avery says, \`\`Because of the slownessof genetic evolution in comparison to the rapid and constantly-acceleratingrate of cultural change, our bodies and minds are not perfectly adapted toour new way of life. They reflect more accurately the way of life of ourhunter-gatherer ancestors.'' More specifically, Avery believes that apredilection towards \`\`tribalism'' and war is a negative characteristic thatwe inherited. Given our technology, the devastating potential of war todayis far worse than ever. Thus, we in order for humans and life on Earth tosurvive in the long term, Avery states that we must strive to eliminate war.He says:\`\`... this does not mean that the elimination of the institution of war isimpossible, but it means that the task will require the full resources andfull cooperation of the world's educational systems, religions, and massmedia. It will be necessary to educate children throughout the world insuch a way that they will think of humanity as a single group -- a largefamily to which all humans belong, and to which they own their ultimateloyalty.''Finally, There is some discussion on the definition of life. What if wemove beyond carbon-based organisms? Do computers count? Avery advances aninteresting theme of life: Living beings are able to convert thethermodynamic information contained in food or in sunlight into complexand statistically unlikely configurations of matter.What makes this book enjoyable is that he includes both the history of scienceas well as mathematical derivations. Most history books leave out mathematicalrigor out of fear of turning off lay audiences, and most textbooks skip thehistory because it's seen as \`\`unimportant'' to teaching the concept at hand.I disagree: I believe that both are necessary to appreciate the development ofscience. Too often, modern students see science as a set a ideas handed downfrom above, and lose sight of the fact that science is an ongoing humanendeavor to understand the universe that is continually being updated. Bygiving the reader a glimpse into the stories of Condorcet, Darwin, Mendel,Gibbs, Shannon, and others, we see how each generation of thinkers built onthe work of previous ones."},{"Title":"Information Theory and Evolution","review":"The book is new but out of date, based on old mythologies about the relationship of information theory to biology. Communication theory is undergoing a revolution but you would not know anything about that from this book which focuses on century old analyses. The author wishes to introduce a new term 'thermodynamical information' which, combined with other terminological contradictions, leads to incorrect inferences and a 'just so story' about how life was inevitable. This may or may not be true but this book has not shed any light on it. The author states 'A flood of information-containing free energy reaches the earth's biosphere in the form of sunlight...much of it is degraded into heat, but part is converted into cybernetic information and preserved in the intricate structures which are characteristic of life.' This view is so simplistic it borders on ridiculous. Many scientists have, in estimating the probability of life purely using probablility theory (which is likely not possible but at least begs the question) estimated only highly improbable (or infinitisimal) numbers arise in light of modern cosmological estimates of the age of the universe and earth. Avery has no concern with cosmology because by equating (Gibbs free) energy with information there is obviously sufficient energy for life on earth from the sun? However why is absolute information relevant? Does not information require a recipient, which in turns begs the question how did it arise? Avery makes a widespread historical error in defining information and entropy as absolutes. This leads to many myths including 'Maxwell's Demon'. In real irreversible processes: 1. We have in thermodynamics an inequality of entropy being greater than heat dissipation, S>[Q/T]; 2. In information theory what Avery refers to (popularly) as 'Shannon entropy' that he equates with information is really 'uncertainty'. 'Shannon' information is the decrease (if any) of uncertainty of a receiver (or 'molecular machine') in going from a before state to an after state; so I = Hbefore - Hafter; where H is the standard entropy-like formula (without Boltzman's K) or -Sum[p.log2.p]. Comparing this with Boltzman's entropy S = -k.Sum[P.ln.P] and using log2(x) = ln(x)/ln(2) one gets and inequality with Clausius's thermodynamical entropy for irreversible systems of: kTln(2) &lt; -Q/I [E.g. see Dr Tom Schneider's website.] Therefore for every bit of information gained, heat is dissipated into the environment. 'Maxwell's demon' is a myth in real irreversible processes. Avery devotes an entire appendix to suggest an equality of entropy with information and suggests Boltzman established the relationship. This is poppycock! All the appendix does is re-derive the usual connection between microconical statistical and macroconical thermodynamical entropy relations, ending with the Clausius equality for reversible systems [and into the Maxwell demon myth!]. As the true relationship between information and entropy is a proportionality (inequality for real systems) Boltzman in no way proved the connection! No one can establish an equality. For instance, if you flip a coin a minimum energy is dissipated but the information gained is 1 bit whether you toss it 1 foot or 10 feet! Also if you toss a coin 1000 times you do not get 1000 bits of information as suggested by W. Dembski in his book 'No Free Lunch' , as would Avery in using the absolute definition; instead Hbefore -Hafter = 0 bits. Information is a state function difference; otherwise it equates with entropy which many then equate with disorder; i.e. a contradiction. It leads to the paradoxical statements of some scientists that a random text has more information than a meaningful one. More poppycock! Further mythologies are perpetrated in Avery's dealing with entropy. As Dr. Frank Lambert says 'Entropy is not disorder, not a measure of chaos, not a driving force. Energy's diffusion or dispersal to more microstates is the driving force in chemistry. Entropy is the measure or index of that dispersal.' Similarly he refers to 'negentropy' '...which an organism...maintains in sucking orderliness from the environment.' This is a contradiction in terms. The absolute value of entropy cannot be negative (see Boltzman's equation for S); instead what should be refered to is a decrease in entropy, i.e. dS. The riddle of life though is not simply solved by referring to the free energy from the sun. As P.W. Atkins said in his excellent book on 'The 2nd Law': 'thermodynamic systems do not tend towards states of lower energy...The Universe falls upward in entropy: that is the only law of spontaneous change. The free energy is, in fact, just a disguised form of the total entropy of the Universe...The Second Law is a global [vs local] denial of the emergence of spontaneous structure.' Therefore Avery has not drawn the link between information and entropy (others have like Shannon; see Schneider; though there does not appear to be an adequate book on the subject yet) and has not explained how life arose anywhere, whether it's by free energy (necessary but not sufficient), 'thermodynamic information' (a contradiction in terms) or 'negentropy' (a further contradiction in terms). The mystery remains both quantitatively and qualitatively.UPDATE-12/21/05-Note: The Chicago reviewer misses the point that the book is a failed attempt to connect thermodynamics with information theory which is properly explained elsewhere as I have referenced; and not by Dembski who is a creationist and was quoted negatively and not as a 'source'. Information cannot be equated with energy for reasons I gave. The reviewer has suggested that the concept of information should not have even been referred to and I agree that that would have avoided the errors in the book, but it also would have made the title wrong and his thesis irrelevant. We all agree that free energy from the sun drives life; there is nothing new in those ramblings. In addition no one knows exactly how life was created despite all of the 'hand waving' by many authors. The suggestion that life is automatic from free energy is a physics answer and only glosses over the specifics and ignores the ongoing exciting research such as synthetic biology at the Genome Science Centre at the University of British Columbia. Physics is not particulary relevant to these studies, it is the wrong specialty and can be misapplied, particularly to information theory."},{"Title":"Information Theory and Evolution","review":"PERSONAL CURIOSITYWhile I am challenged since some time by the divers views of physics and biology (and other disciplines) about the phenomenon of life I started a more intense re-reading of the 'classical' texts to this topic (like Claude E. Shannon; Warren Weaver 'The mathematical theory of communication'. 1948. Enrico Fermi 'thermodynamics'. 1937; Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger 'What is Life' (1944), 'Mind an Matter'(1958) and others). But the problem with this topic is, that since these 'old days' the development was very intense and is extending in many different fields, which makes it difficult to catch up with all these different views and findings. In this context I detected the book from Avery 'Information Theory and Evolution'.PROVIDING A FRAMEWORKWhat is amazing about the book of Avery is the depth and breadth of the cited literature and the consulted disciplines. For someone, who has read a bit within these fields there are repetitions of known positions, but nevertheless the book provides helpful summaries and overviews of the main positions and mostly together with a good historical account. Thus chapters 1-2 give you a first setting about the development and main positions of evolutionary thought until Charles Darwin and in chapter 3 you can read an outline of the the modern development which is mainly rooted in molecular biology. Chapter 5 continues with the information flow based on molecules, between cells, neural networks and animal languages leading (chapter 6) to the evolution of language and culture within human populations. This culminates in the recent development of the computers, the internet (chapter 7) and a mutual influence between information theory and biology (chapter 8) which drives the development of bio-inspired technology (neural networks, genetic algorithms, artificial life, nano-science). The short chapter 4 about statistical mechanics and information seems not to fit really in this line of thought (see below); the appendix A (entropy and information) does not improve this weakness). In the final chapter 9 Avery points out how the different velocities of change (genetically, culturally, technologically) ) induce instabilities and tensions which have to be mastered in he future if they should not cause a destruction of humanity and eventually even the whole biosphere. Although Avery can not provide a complete ethical theory in his booklet one gets at least strong hints how one should re-think questions of 'norms' guiding human societies. Appendix B about biosemiotics is extremely short, but at least it gives a 'hint' to a possible --and necessary?-- point of view which is completely different to the view of physics and molecular biology to explain the phenomenon of human culture.LIMITS AND STARTING POINTAs one can imagine does the combination of depth and broadness in several disciplines combined with a limited number of pages (200) urge an author to abbreviate all ideas remarkably, producing rough and simplified views. Thus if one expects from this book complete and 'deep' answers he will be disappointed. But if you are interested in an overview about main positions, rough historical outlines to get a first idea of the possible frame of reference for these questions from a multidisciplinary point of view with a good selection of important publications then this is a very good book to start with.NO ANSWERSAs I mentioned above appears the chapter 4 about 'statistical mechanics and information' not to fit well in this framework. Assuming only the mathematical equations the alignment of the concept of 'entropy' from statistical mechanics with 'entropy' from information theory (Shannon) this seems to be sound. But mathematical formulas 'as such' have no meaning. To support formulas with 'meaning' one has to apply some domain different from these formulas which can be used for an 'interpretation'. If one uses e.g. as a 'domain' the formal concept of a 'space of possible states' (interpretable as states of atoms or molecules in the case of mechanics and as states of signs in information theory) then a mapping can be established which induces a purely formal equivalence between the different 'entropy'-concepts although the 'real' domains are completely different. As far as the 'formal structure' of information states and states of atoms are not distinguishable this can work. In the concrete case of 'real' information as part of biological and then human communication one has to doubt whether this is so simple. Because the topic is rather complex I can give here only a few remarks.A FEW REMARKS(1) From the many unsolved questions is one basic question, why we have an allocation of energy at all. That there is 'free energy' available from the sun (and elsewhere) does no explain, that we can observe the allocation of energy at some point in the universe. We know, that matter (molecules, atoms, subatomic particles...) has specific 'properties' which are 'causing' parts of the matter to 'interact' in a 'specific' way. To state general laws about general tendencies to 'dissolve' those structures into an 'equilibrium' does not explain why we have the allocation-fact prior to this 'dissolving-tendency'. (2) To equate the statistical-mechanics entropy with the information-theoretical entropy has the problem that Shannon himself deliberately did only describe the 'signal part' of communication. This is that aspect of communication where some 'cognitive concept' will be encoded in some 'material structure' which can be sent through a 'communication channel' for transmission. The signal as such has no 'meaning'. Thus statistical properties of such a signal can be of importance for the engineers of communication channels but they have no relevance for the 'cognitive meaning'. Avery mentions Biosemiotics in an appendix but does not exploit the point of view of biosemiotics for his treatment of information theory and evolution. The 'sign' according to Peirce (and other semioticians) is a 'relation' between a 'sign vehicle' (written signs, spoken words,....) and a 'sign object' (something perceivable or even only imaginable) where the relations exists only (!) in a 'cognitive association within the sign user' (independent from the fact whether the sign user is a biological or a technical system). Thus the meaning-enabling relation is no object of the material world outside of the system and is in a certain sense independent of the concrete matter and the amount of energy to be used. (3) As Avery shows nicely 'complex' forms of life start beyond the single cell as 'multicellular' structures. This presupposes that the individual cells do 'coordinate' sufficiently. This can be realized as a 'fixed' structure' or --in the more advanced biological systems-- as a dynamic ensemble with a continuous flow of 'information' which can change existing structures and which can even change the kind of information as such. From a semiotic point of view it is possible to distinguish even on the genetic level those structures which 'function' as sign-vehicles (mRNA), those which function as 'interpreter' (those structures which convert mRNA into other structures) and those which function as 'sign-objects' (those structures which will be produced by the interpreter). While the sign-processes on the genetic level are rather 'hard-coded' (but not inflexible) appear these processes within complex systems (like a brain connected to a body) in case of symbolic languages completely independent from certain material structures. That these structures are consuming energy to be able to work explains nearly nothing of the phenomena under investigation.I am a bit puzzled about the fact that Avery does not discuss this topic more deeply although he himself gives such a nice general view of the incredible development of communication structures from the molecular level to the most complex cultural forms."},{"Title":"Information Theory and Evolution","review":"I'd prefer to just extoll the virtues of this book, but given a couple of the other reviews I feel I must defend it first. The complaints and questions about the relationship between physical entropy and Shannon entropy that other reviewers have made are ill-considered and, simply, wrong. Physicist Edwin T. Jaynes, in 1957, identified the direct and profound connection between physical entropy and Shannon entropy in his writings on MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) thermodynamics. Basically, physical entropy is a measure of how the elements of a physical system (typically molecules) visit the set of possible states of that system. Shannon entropy is a measure of how the elements of a symbolic system (with quite arbitrary symbols) visit the set of possible states of that system. And the two measures employ the same functions of these state visitations to quantify their respective metrics. So they truly are intimately, unequivocally bound up together. Avery's analysis is just the first I've seen that takes this to its logical conclusions, calculating numerical relations between bits of information and standard thermodynamic quantities. Brilliant!Furthermore, the proposition that life itself is fundamentally negentropic (consisting of and feeding upon islands of negative entropy) goes back at least to Schroedinger's highly influential text,What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"(which also inspired Crick & Watson's search for the structure of DNA). And in the realm of Shannon entropy, negative entropy *is* information. Of all the various attempts to define the nature of life, the only one that is fully general and holds up to any degree of scrutiny, without exception, is this one--islands of excess and/or stabilized information, that locally and temporarily (only) defy the second law of thermodynamics. Avery puts this view on firmer ground in this magnificent little volume. Again, brilliant!With that out of the way, I'd like to highly recommend this to anyone interested in understanding life and evolution, and how they relate to Shannon information. It is short, to the point, easy to read, and genuinely entertaining. Avery starts with some very interesting contextual background that helps us understand how Darwin reached his profoundly important point of view. He then demonstrates how physical entropy and Shannon entropy/information are intimately linked, even deriving a quantitative relationship between the two. He then discusses the profound implications this has for the evolution of life. It is exceedingly rare to find such deep insights presented so simply, clearly, and succinctly. It is well worth much more than the time it will take you to read it, and will, I suspect, leave an indelible mark on your perception of life and the world around you."},{"Title":"Information Theory and Evolution","review":"Clearly, as we see by the last two reviewer's comments, a lack of education leads to confusion. Not that the \\"thermodynamics of life\\" isn't a confusing subject, but rather there exists no full textbook on the subject. For those interested, last week, I wrote up a quick review of thermodynamic evolution:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_evolutionQuickly, let me point out a few things about the last reviewer's comments:(1) Avery's book is a magnificent piece of intellectual crystal.(2) Avery is a Nobel Prize Winner, and has degrees in BS physics (MIT), MS physics (Univ. of Chicago), PhD theoretical chemistry (Imperial College, London).(3) Avery clearly makes a connection in this book between Gibbs free energy, being the total amount of energy available to do useful work in a reacting system, and Life. Well done Avery!(4) Whenever a person does \\"work\\" it is owing to the electromagnetic fluxed through the earth system; a portion of this energy goes to \\"evolutionary\\" work [G], a portion goes to waste and friction [S].(5) It is standard protocol when writing to break up your thoughts into paragraphs (note to last reviewer).(6) Anyone who cites Dembski or Lambert as a source is a clearly missing the point.Always remember, everything you see around you on earth is made from only three things: nuclei, electrons, and photons. If, at any time, you find someone trying to confuse you with \\"fancy\\" talk of information, bits, demons, entropy, etc., remember....its all nuclei-electron-photon interactions, as denied via QED; it's that simple - photon input causes things, i.e. molecular structures, to move or evolve.Adios: Libb Thims,BS Chemical Engineering, BS Electrical Engineering, Human Thermodynamicist, AuthorPhD Biochemistry - MD Neuroscience (in progress)"},{"Title":"The Life of Michelangelo","review":"Condivi's account of the life of Michelangelo Buonarroti is a wonderful resource for fascinating stories on the artist as well as an incite into the artist himself. It is repetitious of Vasari's account of Michelangelo in the Lives of the Artists; consequently both sources complement each other well. It is important to realise that Condivi was an apprentice to Michelangelo and that he wrote this biography while Michelangelo was still alive. While the artist may have been looking over Condivi's shoulder while he wrote the text, it is still very useful - especially in placing the artist in the context of the time. The book shows the interaction between Michelangelo and his patrons - Lorenzo d' Medici, Pope Julius II, Soderini - and countless other fascinating people. After reading Michelangelo's letters, this should be one of the first sources cited to get a feel for the artist as, not only an artist, but a person."},{"Title":"The Life of Michelangelo","review":"Biographies of Michelangelo have been written and rewritten by countless scholars up to this very day.

It is on the short side, but no other biographer was this close to the man himself. Even Giorgio Vasari, the other contemporary Michelangelo biographer, rewrote large portions of his \\"Life of Michelangelo\\" to include details from Condivi's account.

In the end, it does not contain the kind of information needed for serious research, especially if one is looking for one or two works that combine comprehensive biographical study and reproductions of Michelangelo's work.Though binding quality is high and charming, this book is very small--merely several inches by several inches--and thin. It is short on reliable information (again, other than its roots in the period) and on examples of Michelangelo's work, both in quantity and in presentation (a 4X5 inch book hardly provides the format necessary for displaying the panoramas of the Sistine Chapel and the Pieta)."},{"Title":"The Life of Michelangelo","review":"If you have an interest in the Renaissance and its great artists BUY this book.

This book is so good--That I want to keep it for myself and not share it with anyone--As if it was written just for me. \\"Lost Horizon\\" is a mainstream novel and a masterpiece making use of a succinct yet uncomplicated writing style. Recently I had a memory of Frank Capra's film version of this novel--That I first saw over 40 years ago--And I decided to watch it again. I was so impressed and moved by the picture that I decided to read the novel. The film captures the essence of the novel; although the on-screen characters were significantly changed by Capra--Presumably to pull at the heart strings more effectively. Yet despite the characters, and their relationships to each other, having been modified for the movie version of \\"Lost Horizon\\"--The film and its definitive message still end up resembling the book quite closely. This novel--That Amazon categorizes as \\"metaphysical\\"--Will melt any cynic's heart. The idea of living peacefully, serenely and stress-free may be compelling in theory to many Westerners--But their fascination would not be enough for them to give up their striving, competing, overworking and generally not enjoying life to the fullest. In Buddhism all suffering is created in the mind, and so the lamas of Shangri-La use their practice of clairvoyant meditation to keep it at bay. Yet ultimately what guides Shangri-La is the principle of moderation, where one avoids being \\"too virtuous\\" as well. Reading \\"Lost Horizon\\" I could not help but be reminded of Herman Hesse's \\"The Glass Bead Game\\"--Another masterpiece which also deals with the themes of a Utopia influenced, and intertwined with, aspects of Eastern philosophy / religion--In particular the practice of meditation. In closing--The idea of a \\"world apart\\"--Where mankind is encouraged to be the \\"highest possible version\\" of itself--Is a timeless notion that will always be seductive.Stephen C.

When they crash land on a high plateau and are almost instantly met by a caravan of porters carrying a monk, they realize that their kidnapping was not by chance or a random incident.They are taken to the mysterious Shangri La, a monastery that sits above a bustling town nestled secretly in a valley. The monastery is complete with a library, music room, and all sorts of modern comforts. The guests inquire about returning to civilization, but their hosts, the monks, are extremely vague regarding the details of how they might do so. Soon the four guest begin to suspect that something sinister is lurking in the background of this utopia.The main character, Conway, takes a liking to Shangri La, and is eventually invited to meet with the Head Lama. Conway is told the history of Shangri La, and learns the secret that has been covered since their arrival: the monks of Shangri La practice a combination of meditation and narcotics that enables them to achieve extreme longevity. Some of the monastery's monks are over two hundred years old. The novel moves toward a climax in which one of the guests tries to escape, just after Conway witnesses the Head Lama die and is asked to succeed him.This story is full of twists and turns, though for a large portion of the text nothing really happens. The author uses a very subtle tool to introduce the story, and it pays off in the epilogue, when the reader is left wondering whether or not Lost Horizon is a true story. The mix of Buddhist and Christian teaching is interesting, making the philosophic dialogues between Conway and the Head Lama intriguing.

They are crashed near a mysterious and dismal mountain somewhere in Tibet, and all seems to be lost to them, including their pilot who dies in the crash. However, they are rescued by a group of men who live in a strange valley nearby. They call their oasis Shangri-La.The middle-aged British man is named Conway; he has the best grasp of the goals of Shangri-La of any of the people in his group.

He marvels over the expensive library of treasures and begins to love a tiny Chinese girl with a fondness for music. He has the good fortune to meet the High Lama of the monastary there and to be told the secrets of Shangri-La.Conway's sentiments narrate the story, and his calm personality resonates with the reader and makes the sometimes outlandish beliefs of Shangri-La become vivid and desirable.This is a magical book with the same feeling of hope and inspiration that is present in Frank Capra's films.

Then I read it at 41 and found so much more meaning in it."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"If you're a bookworm or should I say, if you're really a book lover, then you'll thoroughly enjoy this book. This book is a masterpiece in its own right and fortunately or unfortunately the subject which the author deals with has been the centre point of many controversies(I mean the Shangri La that is).The book starts off with a few friends chatting about their experiences and about their lives after a long interval. Their conversations lead to one of their friends named Hugh Conway whom many haven't met since many years and who was thought to be dead. This is how the story begins and it continues thorugh various twists and turns and of course through the much-publicized Shangri-La.Many people I know think that this novel is just a work of fiction and revolves around the life of a tired disillutioned soldier. I know not if you're one of those people but if you're, I must say, I beg to differ. Thi s book is not just about the Shangri La. Its about the various twists and turns life has to offer and the various dilemmas every human being has to face throughout one's life. In thatrespect this novel is \\"enlightening\\" if that is the correct word for it. A must reda for everyone who wonders what meaning life has or what importance life means to him.This nopvel has made me see life from a different perspective and that's something books are supposed to do!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Yes, I am guilty of having purchased and read this wonder-filled book several times. I would no sooner give it away to a friend, than a year or so later, a 'thirst' for it would develop, and I'd have to purchase it anew for a re-read.Why?Initially, it was because I was looking for such a place (as Shangri-La) on planet earth. But after the passage of a few years, I gave up on my search, thinking that this personal wish was simply an impossible dream. Luckily, deep inside me, that wish failed to go away. My heart knew that 'if you want something badly enough, you will attract it.'The author, James Hilton, may have had knowledge about such a place (besides what was merely in his artistic imagination).Did Hilton find his Shangri-La? Apparently not, but that should not prevent others from finding it. James Hilton could have been serving as an 'instrument' through which others would be led to their own Nirvana.Shangri-La was a place where people were truly free, living under a loving benevolence, able to pursue their interests - interests that tended to become more and more noble over time. These seekers (finders) were also fortunate to live to an extraordinarily advanced age - 'living forever.' Shangri-La was a place removed from the rest of the world (and from today's world as we know it).But what about today? Does Shangri-La still exist? In France? Yes. In Italy? Yes. In Russia? Yes. In the U.K.? Yes. South of the Border? Yes. In Canada and Australia? Yes. In the U.S.? Yes. Everywhere? Yes. Then how many Shangri-Las are there? There is only One Shangri-La.Is Shangri-La Buddhist? Christian? Islamic? Jewish? Zen-ish? Sufi-ish? Yes. As in James Hilton's book, residents of Shangri-La have many backgrounds and come from several nations.Can anyone find this exalted place? Not 'anyone', but 'someone' can. Perhaps one in a million may find it - yes, even today. If You seek it, don't abandon your quest. Keep seeking and you will be attracted to it . . . and you will live forever - truly.\\"Lost Horizon\\" (the original 1933 novel by James Hilton) is a 'must-read.'James Kowalick"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I read this book as part of a utopian literature unit in my AP English class. From a political standpoint, this book sparks questions about a utopian society, then answers them with simple, intelligent examples.

The unofficial leader of the four is Conway, a British embassy relations-sort of man. Rather than being outraged, Conway is content in the serene and spiritual surroundings.*** None of the female characters ever develop beyond a paragraph or two, and the scope of the plot only involves arriving at and possibly leaving Shangri-La.*** The prologue and epilogue to the story, however, are very well done and extend the mystery of Shangri-La. Does this place truly exist? Are people able to prolong their lives in spiritual and intellectual enlightenment? Was Conway just spaced out on herbal drugs or perhaps suckered by cult fanatics?*** The book has no final answers. Its main goal is to detach people from the modern sense of time and the often unhappy pursuits we impose on ourselves and each other.

Perhaps it's because of my own expectations and the multitude of 4 & 5 star ratings here or the british reference writing or the somewhat choppy style; perhaps it's that the morals it teaches have been exhaustedly dissected with parallel novels at the time and since this book was written. I suppose it's all of the above. The story is good, the ending is good, even the sparse development of the characters is good, albeit I was not able to wrap myself around anyone's humanity except partially the main character's.It's Marxist \\"ends justifies the means\\" message is striking but never dealt with; a huge moral hole. But that's also the reality of the Marxist road map. This cultural utopia denies man's drive to do better with his position and his material betterment. An inner drive in all of us that should never be ignored or quelled. The parallel lesson that Shangri-la is not so much a place as a growth within oneself makes for some good thought provoking cud. The addictive draw of a utopian society is a political demon we face everyday. But hopefully, eventually, we experience our own confrontations that draw us back to the reality of our lives with a lesson to try to do better.Anyway, it's good.

The only quibble I have is that the American character, Barnard, talks like a British version of an American, and so is unconvincing to this Idahoan.

It has all the ambiance of that era, and as one Amazon reviewer said, it is the perfect book to curl up with on a slow day."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This 1939 story is a classic and created the legend of Shangri-La. But in the years since, the book has grown a bit outdated and upon second reading it's not quite the five-star novella that one recalls.I loved this book when young and hadn't read it in at least 25 years--when I recently picked it up again I was surprised by many things I hadn't noticed before. The author has not just created an ideal world where time slows down, but has also created a place where there is no right or wrong, Christianity (and Catholicism) are changed to the point where they become meaningless, and war is always just beyond the horizon. There are also references to everything being done in moderation in this perfect world, including vices such as doing drugs and having sex with strangers. It isn't quite the spiritually uplifting message that some claim it is.All these years later the message of the book now seems odd--it paints an almost perfect world where everyone gets along by allowing some people to get away with doing what is now considered wrong. It says that the way to live longer is to give up all your passions and become passionless. That seems the opposite of conclusions from studies about people who age successfully today.Having seen the 1970s movie more recently than I had last read the book, I was surprised how different the film story was. In some ways I like some of the movie's changes better. In comparison, the book doesn't flow as well (using an opening and closing narration), but that was Hilton's style to intentionally make the narrative rather choppy and even understated. He did it in Goodbye Mr. Chips and it happens again here.Today his writing style seems dated and it takes awhile to get fully into this book. He is still a great author who raised fascinating issues in this book, especially as they apply to what was happening just before World War II. If you give it time the last half speeds by to a very intriguing conclusion."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"My interest in reading Lost Horizon came from having seen the Frank Capra film several times. I was aware that the produces of the film had tried to remain as close to the book as possible but I found the differences between the book and the film to be refreshing.Lost Horizon is a riveting book that is difficult to put down. One might classify the book as part adventure, part philosophy in the blending of the exotic location and Christian and Buddhist beliefs. It is needless to say that the book is well written; the chapter I found of highest interest is Robert Conway's conversation with the High Lama. The writing of that chapter was so very natural and the discussion of such interest it was like being an observer of the scene, and was a chapter I did not want to break.The characters of the four kidnapped people, Mallinson, Miss Brinklow, Barnard and Conway are subtly drawn and their different reactions to Shangri-La are interesting. Miss Brinklow wants to create a Christian mission, Barnard is eluding the law and happy to have found a safe haven and Mallinson cannot be reconciled with the peaceful paradise of the lamasery; but it is Conway, of course, who has center stage. The character of Conway, a world-weary man who discovers that Shangri-La as a place of destiny, must reflect much from the personality of James Hilton. Conway is very complex; a person who has wisdom beyond his years but is not, as he confesses, a hero and is partly a coward. Indeed, Conway's firm decision to remain at Shangri-La is successfully changed by Mallinson. The conversation between the High Lama and Conway expresses many ideas that applied to Hilton's time and also to the present day. The description by the High Lama of the \\"coming storm\\" struck me as appropriate for today. In Hilton's time there was the threat of war on a vast scale as Japan had its eye on occupying large parts of China and the rise of Fascism. Today, it is world terrorism and leaders that want to take us into war without having a clue to the consequences.In short, this is a marvelous tale that is fantastic to read; a book that one can re-read with great pleasure."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"LOST HORIZON was written just as the shadows of the conflict that was to become World War II were beginning to darken the world. Not for nothing is the \\"narrator's\\" note to the reader dated 1933; that was the year of Hitler's ascension to power. The story begins in Berlin. It's evident that James Hilton wrote LOST HORIZON as an elegy to a world that had vanished forever at Ypres and the Somme. His protagonist, Conway, is a survivor of the European slaughter of 1914-1918, who has been rendered dispassionate by his experience in war, much like Somerset Maugham's Larry Darrell inThe Razor's Edge, in many respects a similar work.No doubt Hilton recognized that whatever shards were left of the Century of Human Progress were going to be ground to dust motes in the coming cataclysm. LOST HORIZON is Hilton's prayer that something of worth survives the coming Dark Age. Since LOST HORIZON was written, violence has been the coin of the human realm, and our technology has outpaced our thought and enslaved us. Time has accelerated beyond our ability to tolerate it. Many human beings have suffered and are suffering from their perceived inability to slow everyday life to a manageable speed. Domestic Violence, street violence, bullying, substance abuse, rudeness, anger, and many other social and personal problems have been the result. The pacing of LOST HORIZON is, by comparison, as languid as a river of honey. Anyone who comes here expecting an Action/Adventure yarn is going to be bitterly disappointed. However, for those of us, like Conway, who are preservationists, a visit to the Valley of the Blue Moon is a delight.There are a few flaws in Hilton's tale, mostly surrounding his less than thorough grasp of both Chinese culture and Tibetan culture, and the differences between them. He hardly addresses Buddhism. Though typical for their era, they occasionally cause Hilton to fall into the patronizing tone of the imperialist era. His Orientals are all stereotypically inscrutable. His main protagonists (even the Lamas) are Westerners. There's a decidedly European feel to Shangri-La, and there's actually very little of the \\"East\\" in LOST HORIZON. Even the philosophy of \\"moderation,\\" attractive as it is, is an imperfect interpretation of the Buddhist Middle Way. At the same time, these \\"flaws\\" help to make this story more accessible to its intended European-based audience, most of whom (reasonably or unreasonably) probably can't find Tibet on a map nowadays.Conway's story begins in Afghanistan. He is a British Consul serving in that country, along with his young assistant, Mallinson. Tribal violence has broken out, and the two emissaries are being forced to flee back to British India, in the company of two chance companions, Miss Brinklow, a Missionary, and a Mr. Barnard, from America.They are not long aloft when they realize that their flight has been hijacked by a pilot whose apparent design is to fly them across the Kunlun Shan Range and into Tibet. The plane crash lands, causing the pilot's death. Weather conditions are hideous; a fierce blizzard has caused a whiteout along with subzero temperatures and stocks of food and water are nonexistent. Each one of the four survivors addresses what seems to be imminent death differently. Conway is unperturbed and accepting. Barnard evidences a dry humor. Miss Brinklow reaches for her Bible. Mallinson is full of plans to trek back to India in the teeth of the storm.Rescue comes on the first clear day in the form of a line of porters headed by a man in a sedan chair, a Mr. Chang, who invites the four to the remote lamasery of Shangri-La in order to rest and recuperate. Although Mallinson agrees to visit Shangri-La merely to collect supplies and hire porters so that they can set out for India the next day, he is overruled by Conway, Barnard and Brinklow, each of whom recognizes the need to marshal themselves.The lamasery is in a virtually impregnable valley called Blue Moon, and it is a surprise, being equipped with all forms of modern conveniences like hot water plumbing and steam heat. Chang, who has become a kind of Social Director for the four, explains that Shangri-La is a monastery whose belief system centers around the idea of moderation. Thus, modern conveniences are melded appropriately with traditional practices. Beyond that, Chang does not put himself out to answer questions.Each of the four settles down to wait, with varying degrees of patience. Miss Brinklow convinces herself that she must save the \\"heathens\\" living in the Valley from themselves; min her eyes, \\"moderation\\" is sin and their obvious happiness is inexplicable and most unacceptable. Barnard, for his part, admits that he is a Bernie Madoff-type character on the lam from the authorities after contributing mightily to the Great Depression. However, he reasons that his discoveries of precious metals in the Valley will redeem him in the eyes of the world.Conway, for his part, falls in love with Shangri-La. He is quickly introduced to the High Lama, who reveals himself to be a former Capuchin Priest, Father Perrault, who was born in 1689. Perrault explains to Conway, in a long centerpiece to the book, that he first came to Shangri-La by chance. As with Miss Brinklow, he was seized with conversionary fervor, but as time has passed, he has come to see Shangri-La as a refuge and repository for world culture, a place that will be overlooked in the coming World War, which, he prophesies, will be infinitely more destructive than Conway's war, and will end in an unprecedented conflagration that will devour everything. His own incredible longevity he attributes to the air of the Valley, which seems to confer great vitality. Here, he assures Conway, a man will have time to explore even the deepest mysteries of the most seemingly improbable knowledge. Several of the monks he introduces to Conway are studying obscure subjects and dedicating their lives to minutae. One man is Chopin's student, perfecting his teacher's unfinished musical pieces.Mallinson merely wants to leave. He mocks Conway's belief in the High Lama. He hates everything about Shangri-La, and is shrill in his denunciations of the \\"Chinks\\" and old men who \\"wait like crouching spiders\\" in the place, working toward some unknowable, undoubtedly horrible, end. \\"I wish I had a plane,\\" he tells Conway angrily. \\"I'd bomb this place into bits.\\" All he wants to do, in his youth, is return to the British cantonments for tea dances and flivver races. Quite unexpectedly his is the voice of reason to whom Conway listens, and they depart Shangri-La as the story ends.There is so much here. Conway, dispassionate, nevertheless falls under the spell of the mysterious Valley of the Blue Moon, while the seemingly more credulous and superficial but passionate Mallinson reflects the thinking of a modern skeptic. Where Conway has always doubted the outside world and yet accepts the magic of Shangri-La, Mallinson believes wholeheartedly in the modern world and sees no magic in the lamasery. And although Conway accompanies Mallinson out, as the narrator finishes his tale, it is obvious that Conway is attempting to return to Shangri-La.Whether Mallinson or Conway is the hero all depends on the reader's outlook. Shangri-La promises freedom, but is the old Lama telling the truth? Are we called upon to act? Are we called upon to reflect? Is reflection action, and action reflection? Given conditions in the modern world, is a retreat to a genteel, timeless place an act of surrender or an act of bravery? When and where are we prisoners in our own lives? Or are we always free?"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"James Hilton's Lost Horizon, first published in 1933, is the enchanting, though cerebral, short novel that gave birth to the utopia of Shangri-La, a paradise set in a Christian-Buddhist monastery and largely self-sufficient village in the isolated high mountains of Tibet. Told as a captivating story within a story, the drama revolves around a cluster of enticing mysteries: Why are protagonist Hugh Conway and the other foreigners being flown by a seemingly mad pilot high above the remote Kuen-Lun mountains of China? Is Conway's story of his two-month stay in Shangri-La believable?; Does this almost timeless utopia, where people live in equanimity and age ever so slowly, actually exist?; Does Conway find his way back to Shangri-La to take charge following the death of the 250-year-old High Lama?The basic storyline, including Conway's love for a youthful Tibetan girl he meets in Shangri-La, is provocative enough to have served more than once as material for an entertaining Hollywood movie, but, in my opinion, the greater value of the work lies in the author's articulation of an emotionally appealing and intellectually intriguing life-philosophy. Conway is a British consul whose mild personality and muted career ambition lead to his assignments in far-away places outside the mainstream of power and politics. As such, he is the perfect newcomer to Shangri-La, where people are moderately hard-working and honest, where different ethical systems and religions are condoned as being \\"moderately true,\\" and, above all, where the lamas who run Shangri-La \\"are only moderately certain\\" of their own beliefs! After entering Shangri-La, often more by chance than choice, lamas-in-training find that their youthful desires gradually recede, to be replaced by a deeper wisdom. Over many decades of living in Shangri-La, significant events from their past lives come into sharper focus to serve as reference points for refined scholarly pursuits and purposeful contemplation about the future.As voiced through the High Lama's prognostication of a storm that \\"will rage till every flower of culture is trampled, and all human beings are leveled in a vast chaos,\\" Hilton warned in the 1930s, the decade leading up to World War II and the development of nuclear weapons, about the destructive path our conflict-prone society was on. Along with his warning, however, Hilton optimistically professes faith in \\"a new world stirring in the ruins,\\" with Shangri-La \\"preserved as by miracle for a new Renaissance.\\" Assuming this forecast to be moderately true, let's hope that Conway really has returned to Shangri-La, even though the rest of us may never get there!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What do you get when you mix a Brit with a Texas Oilman, a London Society female missionary and an Oxfordian highbrow who specializes in whining and negative thinking. Place them in the 1930s, shake well in a stolen aircraft, fly them to an unknown part of the world somewhere in the Himalayan/Tibetian and run them out of fuel.What you get is a bloody good adventure that is written a bit like a Kipling tale. The story begins in India and takes you to Shangri-La, located in the valley of the \`Blue Moon', a place of moderate perfection. For in Shangri-La the cardinal rule is &quot;moderation&quot;- the key to extended life. In this microcosm of moderate perfection you will find a world where aging is retarded significantly and life exists to appreciate the aesthetic.Though the book was published in 1931, the &quot;First Paperback Ever Published,&quot; it has an ageless \`Celestine Prophecy' style. Of course it was not the first \`Spiritual Adventure' story written but it was the first to incorporate first world technology (aviation) with spiritual wisdom. Not a romping, gut tingling, adventure tale, it does drag at times, but the ending has a nice twist and there are some adages that bring the read to a pensive pause. &quot;People make mistakes in life bybelieving too much, but they have a damned dull time if they believe too little.&quot; Recommended"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Although Hilton wrote a number of well-received novels, such as Goodbye, Mr. Chips, his bittersweet classic about a mysterious Eden high in the Himalayas is probably the work for which he is best remembered.The story still has the power to captivate, and its appeal led director Frank Capra to make the classic movie about the book. The film was an interesting departure from Capra's normally upbeat tales of American life. Perhaps in a way, it isn't so different from his \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"It Happened One Night\\" in that it shows Capra's belief that people are fundamentally good and that even the not so good ones, if given the chance (such as in landing in a paradise like Shangri-La), will reform and choose to lead better lives.In that sense, in \\"Lost Horizon\\" Capra gives us a parable not only of Paradise Lost and Regained (as when the Ronald Colman character is tricked into leaving but ultimately returns), but a vision of how people would act if they could indeed create or find the perfect society.When the panicked and exhausted group of travellers, who have narrowly escaped death twice, first in their escape from the inflamed Baskur and then in the plane crash, arrive in the city, their only concern is to escape and get back to \\"civilization.\\" But slowly, even the most sceptical and cynical of them (except for Colman's brother), eventually come to appreciate their newly found Eden, and we see how they themselves begin to change and are ultimately transformed now that they've left the harrowing environments of the imperfect, unjust, dangerous, and ultimately savage and cruel societies of the outside world behind.Thomas Mitchell, the shrewd businessman, who may have defrauded people of millions of dollars of his company's stock, at first only sees an opportunity to make a killing selling Shangri-La's gold to the outside world. Soon he's completely forgotten about his opportunistic business schemes and can only think about his project of building modern plumbing and bringing other modern conveniences to the people of Shangri-La.Edward Everett Horton, the older, aloof archaeologist, and the young and bitter tubercular woman, are at first suspicious and convinced they've been shanghaied and brought to Shangri-La for sinister reasons. But under the healing and rejuvenating effects of Shangri-La's life-extending ambience, Horton stops aging and the young woman's terminal illness is healed. Now, both mentally and physically invigorated (as well as being very different people from when they first arrived), they realize they've truly found Paradise and no longer want to leave.For Colman, the energetic Foreign Secretary, who has spent his entire career roaming the Far East, Shangri-La is like deja-vu itself, and he realizes he's been searching for it his entire life. Unlike the others, he needs no convincing. The only misfit is Colman's younger brother, who is never able to accept the place, and finally decides to leave.Lost Horizon is a fascinating cinematic vision of Paradise Found, and I wonder, how many of us would choose to leave our present lives to dwell there?I would."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This timeless and visionary novel, while inflicted with some British chauvinism that was common at the time, deserves to be called a classic. Here we have the story of four Westerners who in the 1930s are kidnapped by plane and crash-landed in an uncharted Tibetan valley. They are welcomed into a life of ease and luxury at a suspicious lamasery, Shangri-La, where the monks speak English and enjoy Western books and modern technologies. It turns out that the four abductees were recruited to add to the population of the local village and can never leave, while the lead character Conway is ordained to become the new High Lama. It turns out that this apparent Utopia may not be so fulfilling after all, and that is the key message of the novel. Hilton gives us the struggles of a man who has been damaged by the horrors of war and the modern rat race, and just wants to find a place to get away from it all. But even a place as peaceful as Shangri-La is not so wonderful under the surface. Maybe Utopia is truly impossible to find in our world, both geographically and spiritually.This novel does have a few problems in characterizations and politics. Other than Conway the characters are shallow and one-sided. The one female among the Westerners, Miss Brinklow, is very narrow and nearly invisible, while the non-Westerners are mostly anonymous. Most importantly, the book comes close to sinking under what could either be called a lack of political correctness or immense British snobbery from Hilton's writing tradition. The High Lama is a European and actually states that \\"Europeans of the Nordic and Latin races\\" are the best candidates for enlightenment, while the Tibetans and Chinese in the story are presented as servants or bureaucrats. This is a condescending and unfortunate slight to Buddhism and the traditions of Tibet. Luckily, higher philosophical insights make this novel much bigger than the sum of its parts.

I have read it over and over and each time I feel like I am reading for the first time. Mr. Hilton wrote in such a way, that you feel that you are right there and you can't put the book down until you finish it. I too would like to know Mr. Hilton's life story; although I had wondered if his book &quot;Time and Time Again&quot; was somewhat of a biography. I find it amazing that a book written over sixty years ago can still have such appeal."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The first time I read Lost Horizon, was in the summer of my sophomore high school year, for a reading requirement. I didn't think I would enjoy any of the other books on the list: The Red Badge of Courage, The Old Man And The Sea, A Tale Of Two Cities. That was literature, and I learned that literature meant alot of beautiful passages, finely crafted human emotions but all terribly and painfully boring. Lost Horizon was going to be another preachy epic, about the human condition.I was wrong.Turned out I consumed the novel in two afternoons with my 16-year old adolescent mind. I was lost in a world, where a woman stayed beautiful for ninety years, a land protected as secret from society, an eden.Bangkok is attacked and four passangers find themselves on a plane, being evacuated from the burning city. Barnar - a mysterious american with oil fields in north, Miss Brinklow - a dellusioned missionary who thinks she can convert anyone to christianity, Mallinson a british youth and Conway the adored hero of the novel.They find themselves abducted into paradise, where no one grows old, where wars can't find their way over high peaks, where the vanity of the world stops, and art masterpieces and books are hid away from a 'dying world'.The only way back to the rest of the world is to wait for porters that come into Shangri-La and trade goods. The problem is the porters have no regule schedule, they may show up next month or next year. Mallinson the youth, misses his girlfriend left back in london and his family. He's anxious to get back and watches the other comrades daze into a fatefull sleep, earning to stay in Sri-Lanking, the perfect paradise.Conway is 38. He's tired after the war, with no real purpose in life. He thinks about settling down and Sri-Lanka is the perfect place.Barnar has other reasons to stay. A bit sinister, but who can blame him to leave paradise? It's his perfect escape from his crimes and the punishment that awaits him on the outside.Miss Brinklow views the settlement as a perfect mission ground where she can convert the 'non-believers' to christianity.The day of escape comes and Mallinson finds he's the only one trying to leave.I've read the Lost Horizon this week. Four years later and I've never grown out of it. It's still just as good, literature mixed with thriller, page turner, and rivaling modern bestsellers.Enjoy your summer.

As much as he seems to want to live and let live, he is simply applying Western imperialistic thought in a Eastern setting... so really as much as he wants to escape imperialism, he takes over this imperialistic ruled society--- remember he sucedes a Belgian priest. Aside from this, the whole story is about avoiding conflict at almost any cost--- personally, without this conflict how does one know she is alive? Alas, I found the character of Hugh passionless on the whole and felt sorry for nothing drove him really.... except, and here's the irony, his determination and passion at the end is finally seen when he trecks back on a quest to find that Shrangri-la he left behind.

I am still moved by the subtle use of music to convey information, and as distressed as ever by the tensions between Eastern and Western thought. The ending was heartbreaking for a 12 year old girl...the suggestion that you really can not have it all, that decisions need to be made and sometimes compromises. In fact, I still find that heartbreaking.For a similarly intriguing adventure, try Islandia by Austing Tappen Wright.And, as an alternate take on Shangri-la, try the Arthur C.

The story opens as four Westerners flee from Baskul to avoid a oncoming war. Soon they find themselves highjacked and deposited by the valley of the blue moon also known as Shangri la. The story line then follows the lead character (Conway) and the supporting characters as they struggle to understand the valley, their place in the world and ultimately they must decide to either stay in the valley or return the outside world. Obviously written for the pre-WWII generation Hilton brings to the front the philosophical ideas of peace and warnings of \\"man's upcoming struggle that will eventually destroy civilization\\".The story line is dated and one can, at times, question it's political correctness but it's a good, quick read for anyone interested in religion and spiritual matters. I saw the movie years ago and liked it. After reading the book I would have to say that I like the book more."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"How convenient that Shangri-la has so much gold that it can afford bringing in extravagant outside goods like the bathtubs from Ohio. Apart from that obvious weakness in the plot, though, this is still a pleasant book, and the reason Hilton gives us for Shangri-la's existence -- a refuge for civilization during the next war -- is a haunting one considering the book's being written so close to World War II, and then doubly haunting considering its eventual nullification by the atom bomb (whose effects could reach Shangri-la and destroy it along with the rest of the world). The novel is somewhat long on talk and short on action, and all but the main character are too one-dimensional (hence I must downgrade to a &quot;6&quot;), but you're still better off reading it than not. Certainly beats the heck out of &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; and its like, both in content and delivery."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A very diverse group of four people is attempting to leave war torn Afghanistan in 1933 when their plane is suddenly hijacked and taken to a remote Himalayan monastery . The carefully hidden monastery is an incredible Shangra-la, but some of them are unwilling to accept paradise, and a plot to escape is quickly collaborated. Escaping and trying to survive in an unknown land is a great adventure story by itself, and Milton's choice of characters shows a great understanding and disappointment for human kind as a whole. But some of the characters rise above this abyss and demonstrate a great optimism, and a chance for a tattered war torn world to survive. This book is an all time classic, and shows that the state of the world hasn't really changed in 75 years. The story of the hijacked plane is carefully hidden from the mainstream press, and the friends of the hostages are left to wonder what has happened to their friends.Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood! His other tiny book Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America. A very myopic view!Rebuttal to Moonwynd: This book is described as an ADVENTURE story by eminent scholar Mr. Sam Van Schaik in his book: Tibet, A History!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I read this book with no idea of how good or bad it would be.

I don't know if this book was consciously re-written or whether it was the automatic result of the software, but changing the spellings so as to, for example, use the American \\"z\\" instead of Hilton's English \\"s\\" in words like \\"realise\\", for example, is unacceptable.Likewise, Hilton would never write \\"figgered it all out\\" or \\"gas up the planes\\".If I buy any more books from Amazon I will expect to have the book that was written by the author, not some obscure sub-editor or computer programme."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Within the past couple of weeks I re-watched the film \\"Lost Horizon\\" (the only real version starring Ronald Colman), and reread the book by James Hilton. I first read the book when I was a teen, so I remembered little about it. But, I have watched the film countless times, it being one of my favorites. And, as I completed the book this time, I discovered that experiencing both media at the same time that I had changed my view about books being turned into movies. By most generous comment about Hilton's book is to give him credit for something we may overlook. When my friends and I talk about reading books by Grishom or Baldacci (for example), we sometimes have trouble remembering one book from the other after time has passed. It's not that they're not wonderful books, but the authors today tend to write in one specific genre for most of their careers. But, like Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\", which you don't mistake for any other Dickens work, and which is unique in fiction, \\"Lost Horizon\\" is a book of Hilton's which you don't mistake for \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\" or \\"Random Harvest\\"; or for that matter, its unique story isn't confused with any other author's work. Shangri La holds a unique status in fiction, and it belongs to Hilton for all time.And then you have the film version from Frank Capra in 1937. And here is where my thoughts have changed regarding to translating books into movies. We all know that sometimes it is done well, and sometimes it is a massacre. But I have begun to look at it as evolution in story telling. In my view, Capra changes, but actually improves upon Hilton's story telling. For example, in the Hilton book you get the impression that Conway is a COMPETENT, but MIDDLING person in the British diplomatic corps. So why would the head lama be so enthusiastic about him that he would kidnap an airplane full of people to bring him to Shangri La? Capra painted Conway as the marvel of the British diplomatic corps and explained that the head lama had read books by him and saw a likeness in thinking. That makes more sense in explaining why the kidnapping. Similarly, the book provides no love interest for Conway, while the film does...which gives Conway even more purpose in fighting the odds to return to Shangri La.That's why this is one of those situations in story telling where I suggest you read the book and watch the film...in that order. Both are true gems."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Hilton's Lost Horizon is often credited with being the origin of the Shangri-La myth, and indeed it is a compelling story. Written in the 1930s, the book is both a product of the turmoil and chaos created by the First World War and subsequent worldwide depression and anticipatory of the conflagration to come. Nestled in-between in both time and place is Shangri-La - an oasis of calm and \\"moderation\\" in a world of excess and fanaticism.Four people, the world weary Conway, his deputy Mallinson, a 1930s American Bernie Madoff named Barnard, and a missionary named Miss Brinklow, are kidnapped and flown high into the Himalayas. When their plane crashes they find themselves drawn into a secluded valley utopia where they find things aren't always what they seem.Hilton does a wonderful job describing the beauty of Tibet, and has a way of inspiring, through Conway's own recounting of his adventures, a sense of wanderlust. There were times when reading this that I found myself actually holding onto images of white-capped mountains and green florid valleys with incredible vividness and a growing desire to just be out of doors (this book would make excellent camping reading). There were moments of Western Eurocentrism, as to be expected of a 1930s novel that mainly centers on a British consul's adventures in areas of their far reaching empire, and occasionally the dismissive tone of the narrator toward native Tibetan society and culture were annoying. But, again, one has to remember the context of its construction, and at that, these attitudes become part of the story itself in it's theme of East vs. West. Many of the characters represent the dichotomies of those two cultures and Hilton consciously blends them to produce a utopian world in the valley in-between those two worlds. Shangri-La has running water and heated plumbing, combined with lonely solitude and contemplation reminiscent of a Buddhist monastery. It combines a feudal agricultural economy and authoritative political system, while simultaneously allowing for the absolute freedom of individuals living in the valley.Throughout, one gets a sense of a sad desire to avoid what Hilton can see on the Horizon: the Second World War - this is especially so once the lamas reveal what the purpose of Shangri-La actually is. Aside from all the social and cultural commentary the book provides, Lost Horizon is just a really fun mystery that reminds one of the old travel novels of the 19th and early 20th century, when there were still places to be explored and customs that seemed odd. It definitely was the perfect follow-up for Moloka'i and if anything has stoked my desire to read more good historical fiction.("},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Book was exactly like description! James Hilton is one of my all time favorite authors. Will purchase from this seller again. Great customer service!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"\\"Lost Horizon\\" is widely considered to be one of (if not the) seminal science-fiction works. It speaks to the universal human desire to find utopia and live long enough to enjoy it. This is one of the rare books that I was semi-reading, reading a dozen or so pages a month, and became so involved when I reached the plot twist I immediately had to finish it.While I love the book, especially the massive twist in the middle, the ending leaves me wanting. Without giving away too much, while I like the open-ended quality, I found the plausibility of one of the main characters finding their ideal world and, with hardly a second thought, abandoning it almost on impulse rather remote. This left a sour taste in my mouth of what was otherwise an amazing book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This novel was beautiful, almost more like a long poem than a novel because of its unhurried pace and evenness of plot. I enjoyed the part of the book when the four spent their time at Shangri-La the best....it was a very relaxing, yet mind-opening read. I only wish that Mr. Hilton had portrayed Conway's \\"new position\\" at the end of the novel, rather than having him exit in the manner he did.I don't want to spoil any of the outcome, but the ending was a bit brisk....I wanted to know more about the second chapter for Conway. Overall, though, an absolute must-read for any hard-core literature fan. It is easily devoured in one sitting...think of it as a 'deep tissue massage' for the mind - the depth and intricacy of the concepts hit you immediately, but the relaxation and peacefulness linger for a while."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Wars do strange things to those who fight them. The trenches of the First World War have left Conway, James Hilton's most memorable hero, feeling himself old long before his time. When he and three others being evacuated from the British consulate at Baskul find themselves kidnapped - flown to a Tibetan monastery, instead of to safety as they expected - he accepts the situation with an ease that infuriates his hero-worshipping young colleague, Mallinson. Conway takes easily to Shangri-La's life of isolated serenity. When he learns why he and his companions were brought to that remote and secret valley, he's not angry. Instead, he feels so oddly at home that only for love's sake will he leave....I first read \\"Lost Horizon\\" in Grade 8, and remembered it fondly enough to pick up a copy when it recently crossed my path again. I read everything else by James Hilton that I could find during the years between. Definitely, this book is a fine author's master work. Clear and beautiful prose, haunting themes, and - at the end - a twist that once you've read it seems inevitable. Like Shangri-La, this story is timeless."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I first read Lost Horizon when I was twelve years old. It was my favorite book as a child. Years later I re-read it, a little apprehensive that I would find it dated and contrived. It is neither. Lost Horizon is, quite simply, a triumph of the story-teller's art. A simple tale of idealistic faith in the human spirit, James Hilton's famous novel is crafted in unadorned, crystalline prose. It is, by turns, moving, mysterious, surprising and, ultimately, profoundly inspiring. Lost Horizon may not satisfy those too sophisticated to allow themselves to give in to its sentimental simplicity. But I highly recommend it to readers willing to suspend disbelief and to surrender to the wonder of a transporting fairy tale as they take a magical and unforgettable journey to the Valley of the Blue Moon. I am fifty-four years old now and Lost Horizon is still my favorite book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is the type of book which can change a person's life, or, at least give the reader some feeling of hope that things can be better and that, somewhere, there is a place where life is a continual joy and the people living there await the day when they can share the joy of life with a lost and dying world. In a way, the book is quite prophetic--the High Llama's dream of a world of continual war is a mirror of what would occur only a few years ahead. (And think about our own--a continual war against terror, lost jobs, and and a dying culture filled with violence and meaningless sex, and lies.) As one reads this novel, at least for me, I found myself wanting to try and find or, if possible, create a place that could be for me and my friends and family a Shangri-La.

I had never forgotten it in all the years that have intervened.I am not exactly sure how things like this seem to happen, but recently I was struck with the idea of re-reading some of my \\"great books\\" from high school and early in my (now becoming long) life. Searching for this James Hilton masterpiece I discovered that it is celebrating it's 80th Birthday shortly, and also it's 50th anniversary with me! So, in honor of that \\"double\\" date, I promptly decided to immediately obtain another copy and re-read it. In my search here, I discovered this particular edition and decided upon it. It is reproduced from an original copy of the book, and also I note, in limited quantities of 250 copies at a printing.It is lovely to look at and to hold if you are like me, a hopeless old romantic! Reproduction of the original cover, and printed on ecru paper to have the look of an original, etc. The pages are, really, like looking at/reading an original edition. Beautifully produced and handsomely bound. Having been in the printing and publishing industry for my entire career, I truly appreciate efforts put in to reproduce grand old books, etc., for the pleasure of people today. It bespeaks the importance of certain items/pieces that this attention is placed thus to provide them for us in what today is pretty much a \\"throw-away-world\\" and gives us something more substantial to hold onto, or in our hands, as we read or re-read these works of importance to us.If you have never read this great book, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you do. It truly would be a shame should you not ever have had the pleasure of experiencing the words and message laid before one here in this book. If you have read it, you already know that which I speak of. However, have you ever tossed the idea about of a re-visit to Shangri-La as Conrad so desperately did? As I said above, I am a hopeless old romantic, so it is perhaps natural that I would be just as deeply pleased, moved, and \\"wish for\\" a lovely time and place such as Chang's Blue Mountains and the valley between...the valley that holds/held so very much.I would urge you to read, or re-read, this truly magic, magisterial, work by James Hilton.

I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed reading it. The thing that is harder to nail down is why I loved this book. It has some of the typical elements I enjoy when reading a novel - engaging characters, a meaningful plot and an ending that leaves you with quite a bit to chew on. But I have read dozens if not hundreds of novels that fit that description and none of them seem to fit on the same plane as this book. I think the thing that struck me the most was how this book captured the sense that there is something wrong with this world, it does not function as it was intended to. The wars, the poverty, the pain, the suffering, all of them part of the everyday world that surrounds us (unless you live in a bubble and simply choose to ignore them), yet it always feels like there has to be a better way. This is expressed so clearly in the driving force behind establishing the monastery of Shangri-La, to preserve the great works of man, and man itself even, from man and the path of destruction he seems to be on. That way when the wars have finally wiped out all we have ever done (and maybe mankind along with it) there will be a preserve, untouched and intact, to begin anew. Ah the thought of beginning anew, without the flaws, without the problems. What person has not wished for that, yearned for it even? I think that is why this novel touched my soul. It so beautifully expressed how man longs for Heaven, though few would label it as such. The common longing is expressed here and Hilton's answer seems to be that of man's salvation brought about by man which is fascinating to compare and ultimately contrast this against my own views of who will bring salvation to man, ChristI loved this book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I think the first thing that struck me was how timeless this story is, the search for a personal utopia, the subtle morality, the ideal of moderation.

I was completely captivated by the mysteries of Shangri-la. Our hero Conway's adventure was an awe-inspiring tale of a monastery hidden deep in a Tibetan mountain range, where the lamas lead extraordinary existences. Theirs are privileged lives steeped in wisdom and secrecy. Their isolation and longevity allows them a unique position in the world and very few outsiders are privy to their secrets. Hilton's use of the high lama's telepathy is certainly prophetic, considering the book was written prior to World War II.Lost Horizon was a great adventure story as well as a picture of an ideal society. Hilton's dream on utopia was brilliantly written and enchanting."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I first read LOST HORIZON many years ago, after I'd seen the film (which, frankly, rather ruins the tale for me, but not enough to destroy the pleasure in reading it). When on a trip to China, staying in the Xian Shangri-La Hotel and having run out of my own books, I picked up their copy (a very nice little hard-cover available for sale at the Horizon Club).It was a joy to be transported back in time... when the British Empire was slowly collapsing and world-weary consul, Conrad, is escaping a revolution with 3 others (an American, a missionary and a junior diplomat) when their plane is mysteriously hi-jacked. They find themselves crash-landing with a soon-deceased pilot somewhere in the Himalayas and are rescued by a party of Tibetans carrying an aged Chinese man. He leads them to Shangri-La--a lammasery beneath a high moutain, above a particularly lush, cultivated valley.Shangri-La has become a sort of archetype for hidden/lost utopian societies. The echoes of this book are discernible in many latter works. But here is the original (or one of the originals, since Shangri-La itself is naturally based on previous ideas). Hilton's work is spare, but still magical, depicting a time of turmoil, just before the death and destruction of the Second World War. Conrad, the hero who is not a hero, has lived through WWI and it has both taken something from him... and given him something--something that seems to culminate in his finding peace and wisdom and himself at Shangri-La.

I then decided I had to read it. I read the book with crib notes with me, so I wouldn't miss any symbolism, but you don't need the crib notes to understand the book. Get the book and read it, jump into the experience; Shangri-la is not far away."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This story is about a young man named Conway. Through past experiences and actions became a legend. He and three others have been kidnapped and brought to Buddhist monastery in the Tibetan Plateau. They are at first unwilling to stay at the valley of the blue moon, but they have no choice. Throughout the story Conway learns the history of the valley and it's high lama. The high lama has left Conway with an imperative choice. He bestowed upon Conway the future of Shangri-La, and Conway must choose between loyalty to the high lama or loyalty to his companion Mallison.This story is what originally began my interest in the oriental cultures, and also my interest in classic literature. It was entertaining to read because of the style in which it was writ. The tradition shown by the lamas, the moderation shown by them began the learning of these cultures that I have taken upon myself. Also how the high lama's explanation of Shangri-La was not vague nor was it in depth. The respect shown to the high lama by the people has also contributed to the code of behavior I now follow. I enjoyed this book because it was entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I saw the film at a young age. Never forgot it then Oops I wanted to read the book, books are always different than the movie."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This easy-to-read classic is a gem! I finished it in 1 sitting &amp; couldn't wait to find out what would happen to the travelers. Loved every word of it &amp; would recommend this to anyone who loves exotic places."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This is an excellent novel by James Hilton.There is something sepcial about the way he writes and the way he describes his characters. His unique way of writing leaves you suspended and awed. At the conclusion you do not know what to believe. I think everyone should read it, it's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect upon first reading Lost Horizon. I thought that since it invovled a group of people stranded in some uncharted land, that it wouldn't be anything unique.However, I was pleasantly surprised. As the story unfolds, the passengers of the plane discover that their pilot is in fact not the one they had originally hired. As a result, they end up at some strange destination far from where they had planned.As the weeks pass, however, the main character secretly learns from one of the head monks that it is very unlikely a transport will actually come to the area anytime soon. Eventually the rest of the group learns of this, but only one of them really finds it bothersome. The rest have found the new land very comfortable and heaven-like. The character who wishes to leave for home in America actually falls in love with a young native woman who lives at the monastary (she appears to the be the only female in the area). In the end, they both manage to return to America, and the rest of the group remain, in love with their new home.Although Lost Horizon is not the same genre I am usually interested in, I must say that it was a very pleasing read. James Hilton describes the landscape beautifully as if you were actually there. He causes the reader to take a step back from the fast pace of contemporary life as he brings to life an environment of true serenity and happiness.I recommend Lost Horizon to those that appreciate intelligent writing as this novel is bursting with it. It should be required reading for all English and philosophy classes."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I am a chinese reader, I hope to know the life story, the booklist of Jemas.

He had been interested enough in the story to prepare a manuscript. Conway, Mallinson, and Barnard were in an airplane headed for Peshawar, but going in the wrong direction. They had left Baskul, Persia. In their company was a missionary, Miss Brinklow. Miss Brinklow used to belong to the LMS, London Missionary Society, but she disagreed about infant baptism. The plane landed. The pilot was unconscious and died that evening. Everyone but Conway was affected by the altitude and it was cold. Part of Conway, (his record at school had been brilliant), was always an onlooker.A robed figure emerged from the lamasery of Shangri-La. The name of the mountain was Karakul, twenty eight thousand feet high. Conway surmised they were in Tibet. He knew very little Tibetan. Chair-bearers transported the members of the party to shelter. The atmosphere of the lamasery was Chinese rather than specifically Tibetan. (Conway was to find out later that the religion practiced was a mixture of Buddhism and Christianity.) There were about fifty lamas present and others who had not completed their studies, including the guide, Chang. Some of the lamas were neither Chinese not Tibetan.Mallinson, only twenty four years old, wants the party's return journey to be arranged right away. Conway senses that their arrival had been expected by the inhabitants. The puzzle of their arrival at Shangri-La begins to fascinate Conway. It is deemed by the guide that it is unlikely anyone from the outside world would be visiting Shangri-La to carry supplies to the community sooner than two months hence. Miss Brinklow and the American, Barnard, do not consider staying at Shangri-La for two months a hardship. Conway is used to service in exotic places, but the situation for Mallinson is difficult.The lamasery has collections of books and art of China and Tibet. It is discovered that Barnard is traveling on a forged passport and is wanted by the authorities. Chang advises Conway excitedly that the High Lama has agreed to see Conway which is contrary to usual practice and is obviously a great honor. It seems that for thirty eight years there was a Christian mission in Lhasa.Conway learns the members of their party are supposed to stay forever. The place is known as the valley of the Blue Moon. The lamas are ageless. In the end Conway sees the High Lama on a number of occasions and learns he has been designated the successor. Barnard, having worked as a mining engineer, ascertains that the place is a gold mine. Mallinson and Conway are determined to leave and, thus, Conway becomes the subject of the traveler's tale compiled by Rutherford."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"There wasn't much of a plot in this book.

It starts out with four men talking about different things when they come to the conclusion that they all know Hugh Conway, who was kidnapped along with three others. Their plane crashes in the mountains, and they are rescued and taken to a place called Shangri-La. Here they experience a lot of peace because Shangri-La is away from the ongoing war. Many things happen, and Conway along with one of the others decides to leave.

Adapted here in film, it is a wonderful vehicle for beautiful images of Jane Wyatt, and Ronald Colman. Filmed against an early version of architectural and landscape modernism, it also has the earmark grand processionals with torch lighting seen only in movies by De Mille and the remarkable conclusion of Disney's Fantasia. The setting of Shangri-La, not in the all too familiar computer reconstruction of today, but in the grand style of bygone stage sets, reminds us of early influences of modernist architecture. The Cranbrook Academy styles of early architects and designers, the graphic lines of Mies van der Rohe, and the ornamentalism of Edward Durrell Stone, combined with interior design including arts of ancient Eastern, Asian cultures make for graphically beautiful mise en scene of the inaccessible and remote dream of Shangri-La.An ideal society rich in inner spiritual growth rather than dogmatic religion and government, it is self-sustaining, save only for supplies from the outside. Smitten with the atmosphere of luxurious idealism where all have a share of beauty, destitute survivors of a plane crash in the mountains of Tibet come to it's mysterious tiny entrance in one of the most wildly remote parts of the world only to find out who they really are. The revelations in this tiny pocket of beauty reminds of all the escapism with which we might all be longing for today amidst a world of ever increasing danger and barbaric greed. The conclusion is, of course, a perfect one which procures the 'hero' his place in life, as the chief Dali Lama.A 'must have' for any Hilton fan, dreamer of his own Shangri-La, or escapist from the current unstylish visions of today's Hollywood hard edged filmography. Don't look for any brutality, in-your-face sexuality, gore, vulgar language, inuendo; you will find only adventure, some action in the brutal arrival and departure scenes all done in Capra style that would become mature years later. It is heavy in matters of style filmed with pomp and circumstance, relieved by characters who have at last found their way in life. It's simply a gorgeous Classic Black and White.Ray W. ClarkePalm Beach & ClevelandLost Horizon"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Anyone with any interest in Buddhism will be fascinated by this book.

It makes you wonder... if life is like that of the characters...it's a real cool book!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Having read some of the reviews on the book, and just myself having finished reading it, it seems people fall into one of two camps: either you get it or you don't. It is the story of a man in the early twentieth century looking for more to life than what he has. Oh, he's got the good pay, the prestige, the job, yet he is unfulfilled. he is not happy. He has a \\"full\\" life, but it a meaningless life to him. He doesn't feel like he's actually accomplished anything. So, he and three others are captured and taken to unknown territories. Mallinson is, I think, kind of our everyman character and to a slight degree Conway's conscience. He is also the one who cannot seem to find peace in Shangri-la, a place of idyllic peace and beauty. He needs the loudness of \\"modern life\\", whereas Conway seems to have found what he is looking for, ie, the simple life and a purpose for life. His life didn't seem to make sense before arriving, but it now seems to make perfect sense. Where Mallinson sees purgatory or hell, Conway sees heaven. So, in the end, why does he leave? I think he felt a certain responsibility to Mallinson. I think he figures if he can get Mallinson home safely he can go back. I do like the vague ending. You don't know for sure Conway got back. You don't know if the lamas had a \\"Plan B\\" to account for maybe Conway leaving. I think he made it back; of course I am a bit of a sucker for a happy ending. There is a definite eastern philosophy slant, which I am all right with, as I am into the subject. Maybe that's part of the reason I like it.One can have their own opinion as to how the story is told, but the story itself is a good one. It is relatively quick reading as well. If you need explosions three times a page, or lots of action, this isn't for you. Not that it's actionless, it just isn't necessarily typical \\"action/adventure.\\" It was a thoroughly enjoyable read for me though."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"There is nothing to be quick about except buying this book, reading it, selling the car, selling the house, selling the kids, and going to look for Shangri-la.

Not until I go back there."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. There is, between its pages, a world of solace and hope depicted as delicately and expertly as a haiku. The only unfortunate thing about it is that we cannot literally travel to Hilton's Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is a very introspective book. Metaphors abound perhaps, but what I'm inclined to take from the book each time I read it are the questions asked. Questions of purpose and what it all means. It's very thought provoking without being tendentious.Stylistically, Hilton is economical, but very capably sets a mood that permeates the entire narrative whether in describing the landscape or the more subtle aspects of the different characters. For me, the mood is one of relaxed contemplation.In another context, it's a wonderful travel book. It takes the reader to a faraway place and implicitly invites him to make choices and contemplate weighty issues in this most unlikely of settings.Lost Horizon is not a literary masterpiece, but it's a good story and very clever in its presentation."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A wonderful, suspenseful, beautiful book -- not afraid to be idealistic AND clear-eyed.

It is a mysterious and spiritual tale that will keep you reading until the end. However, I was disappointed that in the prologue, the basic ending was revealed.

On another level, it is highly thought provoking."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The story of a group of people who survive an airplane crash in Tibet and find shelter at a mysterious monastery is extremely well known, but unlike most novels, Lost Horizon is less about its characters and their siutation--interesting though those elements may be--than it is about their thoughts and ideas. Written as it was on eve of World War II, these thoughts and ideas center upon developing a way of life that preserves, rather than destroys, that which is finest in both humanity and the world in general.The novel is elegantly and simply written and possesses tremendous atmosphere. Although enjoyable as a purely &quot;fun&quot; read, it is also thought provoking, and the thoughts it provokes linger long after the book is laid aside. I can not imagine any one not being moved by the book, both emotionally and intellectually, regardless of their background or interests. If such a person exists, I do not think I would care to meet them.Although James Hilton wrote a number of worthy novels, Lost Horizon is the novel for which he is best remembered, a great popular success when first published and a genuine masterpiece of 20th Century literature."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When I was a teenager, I went to see the movie Lost Horizon seven times. During my 74 years, I read the book many times. After I retired, I made four trips to that part of the world, and spent many months each time searching for that wonderful Shangri-La dream. If you have never read Hilton's classic, and you are a person with an optimistic spiritual outlook, then The Lost Horizon is a must for you. If you read it and want to believe it, then you should visit Burma and the temples of the ancient city of Pagon, and then spend time in the three kingdoms of the Himalayas: Nepal, Ladakh and Bhutan, in that order. You will be moved to tell others, or write about your spiritual experience. I was so moved. May your days be filled with the magic of life. Sirrom"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What struck me most about this book is how non-dated it was for having been written in 1933. First of all, the story starts in Afghanistan during an airlift to evacuate foreign nationals during an anti-western revolution. Next, the main characters are essentially skyjacked to an unknown destination against their will for unknown purposes. As for the characters, they seem very familiar and contemporary also: a world-weary and burned-out government bureaucrat, a gung-ho and impatient young military officer, a business man that has stolen over 100 million dollars from investors through stock fraud, and a fundamentalist Christian missionary that believes in one \\"true\\" religion and holds all others in contempt. There is also the conviction among several of these characters that globally \\"the whole game's going to pieces.\\"However, there is also something hauntingly timeless about this story. It occurs to me that the hidden civilization of Shangri-La is based on the mythical kingdom of Shambhala, where immortal masters live that look after the evolution and welfare of mankind. The great mountain of Karacul that looms over the valley also seems symbolic of Mt. Meru- the axis of the cosmos- and where the gods are reputed to dwell. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the people that find Shangri-La are the world weary- and the journey comes close to killing them. That would seem to be a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. For this is what the lucky and the worthy find in Shangri-La, all the time in the world, or rather out of the world, for contemplation, preservation of all the worthy attainments of the human race, and the pursuit of wisdom. Sounds pretty close to heaven to me....An interesting side note is the fact that _Lost Horizon_ was the first paperback title ever published by Pocket Books in 1939. This particular edition bears the same classic cover art as the original."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When I read this book, I was transformed! I could actually breath the fresh, cold, Himalayan air that Conway and his entourage and the people of Shangri-La breathed. The language the novel is written in is beautiful and picturesque.When Conway and his companions flee the warring land they come from, (in a way) they find themselves hijacked, whisked away to paradise: Shangri-La, a place where the air is clean and the living is natural and spiritual and, &quot;moderate.&quot; Where people live naturally long lives, hundreds of years, in peace, in love, at one with nature. Hilton's book wisely illustrates that some can never be happy in paradise, they must go on and on searching, but too incredulous to ever actually find anything. In Shangri-La the people, the good, natural people await the destruction of the &quot;outside world,&quot; which will surely occur at it's own hand sooner or later as long as people rule themselves with war, lack of moderation, hatred, and a lack of regard for the spiritual nature of humanity. Then the people of Shangri-La will spread the paradise to the far reaches of earth. No doubt, James Hilton has read not only the Bible, but many other spiritual books, because I find myself thinking of Buddism, Judaism, Christianity (as opposed to Christendom), Hinduism, and other Eastern religions and forms of spirituality and well as Western religion and forms of spirituality. What an inspiring view.The &quot;outside&quot; world will eventually destroy itself if humanity continues on the road of &quot;unintelligent leadership,&quot; war, hatred, discrimination, excess, selfishness, lack of moderation, lack of respect and care for nature, lack of conservation, lack of respect for self, and lack of respect and care for other human beings and all our fellow animals. The question is: Will there be a &quot;Shangri-La&quot; there to save us? Do we really want to take that chance?"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is the perfect book for a slow day.

My reading is mostly non fiction but occasionally I like to catch up on a classic I should have read years ago. This is such a book. The story is about four individuals' unplanned trip to the mysterious Shangri-La, located in an isolated location in Tibet. Shangri-La is a place where people live stress free and in moderation. This novel, written in 1933, is highly readible and moves quickly. This wistful tale poses many questions such as &quot;is it better to live stress free with time on our hands or to live in the modern world with it's material opportunities?&quot; Another question is &quot;do we believe things based on trust and hope or solely based upon the credible evidence?&quot; A third question might be, &quot;is moderation in a happy, stress free situation better than a world where we feel great passions but also endure periods of unhappiness?&quot; This wonderful tale is a great antidote to the stress of the modern world."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When we were kids, our grandparents used to take us to Radio City Music Hall for the movie and Christmas Pageant every year. The year I was 12, the movie was a remake of Lost Horizon--my most graphic memory from that night is my horror when the woman suddenly aged after leaving Shangri-La. As it turns out, that version of the movie is pretty dreadful, while Frank Capra's 1937 original is widely considered to be a classic. At any rate, I liked the film enough to read the book and also Hilton's other classic, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I loved them both. Recently, our library got a restored edition of the Capra film and we enjoyed it thoroughly. So I went back &amp; reread the books.I assume most folks know at least the rough outlines of the stories. In Lost Horizon, Hugh Conway, a British diplomat, is skyjacked and he &amp; his traveling companions end up in the Himalayas. Eventually they are lead to the hidden Valley of the Blue Moon and the city of Shangri-La, where folks do not age and the powers that be are collecting all of the world's knowledge and greatest artworks, so that it will be safe from the turbulent political storms of the outside world. Eventually, the high lama reveals to the diplomat that he has been chosen to take over leadership of Shangri-La and after an abortive attempt to leave (at the insistence of one of his fellow travelers), Conway returns to assume his destined place in Shangri-La.Good-bye, Mr. Chips, on the other hand, is about an eccentric but lovable British schoolmaster, Arthur Chipping (Mr. Chips). Seemingly destined to be a bachelor for life, he meets and marries a young woman who loosens him up quite a bit, before dying in childbirth. Chips is left alone, except that is for the succeeding generations of boys who pass through Brookfield School. After decades at the school, he retires, telling the assembled alumni, &quot;I have thousands of faces in my mind. ... I remember you as you are. That's the point. In my mind you never grow old at all&quot;, only to be called back during WWI, at which point he becomes acting headmaster. One of his duties is to read the list of the school's war dead; for everyone else they are just names, but for Chips, each name has a face attached. After the War he reretires, after 42 years teaching Roman History and Latin at Brookfield.On the surface, these two stories couldn't be more different, but reading them now I realize how similar they actually are. Shangri-La is an oasis of civilzation in a world that was after all between two World Wars. It is a place where the great achievements of our culture will be preserved, even if war consumes the rest of the World, which for much of this Century seemed like a possibility. Mr. Chips, meanwhile, is the living embodiment of institutional memory. The classes of boys, the teachers and headmasters, even the subjects and teaching methods, come and go, but Chips has remained throughout. He &quot;still had those ideas of dignity and generosity that a frantic world was forgetting.&quot; He embodies the pre-War world and its values. In his book Mr. Bligh's Bad Language, Greg Dening says that: &quot;Institutions require memory. A memory creates precedent and order.&quot; In the very midst of an epoch that was witnessing an unfettered attack on all of the West's institutions and values, Hilton created Shangri-La and Mr. Chips; both represent the conservative ideal--providing a bridge of memory to all that is beautiful and good and decent in our past, lest, in our zeal to create a perfect world, we forget the qualities and accomplishments which bequeathed us the pretty good world in which we live.These books are unabashedly sentimental and I'm sure some would even find them mawkish. But I love them and I appreciate the subtley non-political way in which they make the most important of political points: even as we move forward we must always preserve those things and ideas of value in our past.Mr. Chips GRADE: A+Lost Horizon GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is possibly the best book that I have read in the past year. Published in 1933, it remains relevent and provocative to this day.The Lost Horizon, much like Catch-22, is part of an elite group of books whose name or central characters have become a permanent part of the English vocabulary. In this book, this was done with Shangri-La, the land high in the mountains of Tibet where a group of worldly men and women stumble upon a valley of mystery and matchless beauty. A quick search on dictionary.com reveals that it means1. An imaginary remote paradise on earth; utopia.2. A distant and secluded hideaway, usually of great beauty and peacefulness.While the term Shangri-La is famous, the book is not nearly as wide-known or wide-read in recent years. Countless books by countless authors depicting utopia have been published, but only a couple has grabbed the attention of and lingered in the imagination of the public long after its initial publish. So what is special about Shangri-La, the valley of the Blue Moon? Read to find out.I could not put this book down. I had an mid-term exam the next day, but I stayed up to read the book past midnight. The basic plot of the book can be found by a simple glimpse of the editorial write-up on this site. The actions are fast-paced, the characters intriguing in their peculiarities. Yet this book has a philosophical edge that distinguishes it from a mere thriller. The true center of the book is ideas and thoughts rather than actions. Much thinking is done by the characters, trapped in the monastery of Shangri-La by the mountains and the snow. When Mallinson, the hot-blooded young captain who is desperate to get out of Shangri-La and return to Britain, snaps 'Well, if you happen to like prison,' to Barnard who was observing the beauty of the landscape, Barnard remarks that 'My goodness, if you think of all the folks in the world who'd give all they've got to be out of the racket and in a place like this, only they can't get out! Are we in the prison or are they?'In Shangri-La, the appreciation of beauty and the pursuit of wisdom is valued above all else. Rejecting the virtues of hard work and ambition, they adopted a philosophy of moderation in all things, 'avoiding excess of all kinds - even excess of virtue itself.' The author, Hilton, was not merely creating entertainment (although this he does) in this book. He was concerned about the future of England and all mannkind. Written after the aftermass of the destruction of the WW1, and the whole of western world being driven to a state of pessimism and despair by the worldwide economic condition, Hilton was concerned with another dark cloud that gathered on the horizon, namely the first signs of WW2. The lamesery of Shangri-La was imagined to be a living, breathing time capsule designed to salvage a gentle, civilized way of life from the destruction Hilton sensed had been unleashed by the Great War. Above all Hilton hated wars, which had the potential to 'destroy the fragile beauty and learning, accumulated over centuries of humanity, in the matter of a second.' With the invention of the atomic bomb after his time, this could now literaly come true. Out of the barbarism of the war rose Shangri-La, even if only in the imagination. In an age where the Western and the non-Western world alike engage in meaningless wars and acts of terror, this book is more relevant than ever in this century than ever before.Buy this book and read this book. The 7 bucks or so that you pay for it is more than worth the price of admission into Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"In the depths of the worldwide economic depression as the war drumbeats began in Germany, James Hilton wrote a quirky, imaginative book about the potential to escape the harsh reality. In so doing, he caused each reader since then to wonder what the right balance of tranquility and challenge really is. Like the best books about possible utopias, Lost Horizon leaves much to the reader's imagination. Undoubtedly, you will conjure up solutions to the riddles left open by the author that will be especially pleasing to you.Although the book is clearly set in the 30's with a British perspective, many of the themes struck me as universal. As the book opens, there's an intriguing prologue that sets just the right tone for the story. You are to read a manuscript about the experiences of one Hugh &quot;Glory&quot; Conway, H.M. consul. The manuscript opens with airplane hijacking that seemed all too realistic. Quickly, the hijacking turns into a surprising adventure as the passengers unexpectedly arrive in a little known part of Tibet and are escorted to Shangri-La, a lamasery sitting atop a hidden valley of peace and tranquility. While there, they await an opportunity to arrange passage with the bearers who are bringing a shipment that is expected in 60 days. Conway, however, learns the secrets of Shangri-La and finds himself faced with an extraordinary set of choices.To me, Shangri-La is a metaphor for the mental tranquility that many spiritual practices can bring. For anyone who has enjoyed these practices, you will know that it can be tempting to withdraw totally into them. To do so can be delicious, especially for the frazzled soul. At the same time, we are made of flesh, blood and boil with emotions that seek their venting through action. How can the two instincts be reconciled? You are left to come to your own conclusions, and that's one of the great beauties of this fine book.The book has several weaknesses that will bother most readers. Except for Conway, the character development is minimal. The book is too conveniently filled with people in Tibet who speak perfect English. Morality is held a little bit too much in suspense for the book to be as spiritual as it had the potential to be. There's a heavy overlay of British Empire perspective that will seem remote to current readers as well.The ideal reader for this book is someone who enjoyed Butler's Erewhon or H.G. Wells's The Time Machine.I was left thinking that we each need our own personal Shangri-La today more than ever. May you find a way to carry it with you!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Since Heinrich Harrer's &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (based on author's true story) and &quot;Return to Tibet&quot;, I had caught myself in a reading spree on everything related to Tibet, whether fiction or non-fiction. Tehn I came across James Hilton's &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. I had to admit that the book caught my attention with an engaging plot that four people brought against their will to mysterious Shangri-La, set in the hidden mountains of the Blue Moon, a place where nobody ages. The mysterious and suspending plot is what makes this Hawthornden Prize-winning novel catchy and was made into motion pictures several times.Despite the splendidly written text, the storyline itself was not developed very extensively. Most of the text describes the story of Hugh Conway, who was trapped by the fascination of eternal life. The sudden and abrupt ending of the novel was somehow disappointing to me."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"I am not a very religious person but this book was different that any other book I have read on religion. Other religion books are pushy in a way that they tell you that you HAVE to believe in God and you HAVE to go to church. This book was nothing like that. It tells about love and compassion. I truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought it would be a dry book on religion.What a nice surprise to discover that Samuel M. Shoemaker manages to incorporate every day events and everyday human beings (with all their flaws) and argues that it is through the human spirit and soul - love and compassion that we find what through fellowship is.I loved the way Shoemaker does not shove down your throat the concept that the only way to be \\"whole\\" is to throw yourself at God and beg for forgiveness for being a human being.Shoemaker has a wonderful way with a phrase and I actually found myself reading and re-reading certain passages as I thought they were actually beautiful.I also liked the concept of jotting down your own thoughts and beautiful passages.This was an extremely pleasant surprise for me."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"\\"Orange marmalade, my friends is a good deal easier to make than Christians.\\"Beyond the interesting message in this book the reader must appreciate the lovely turning of phrases. The formal yet still approachable voice of the author.Rev. Shoemaker presents his insight on church, spirituality and society in a manner that will have the reader reading and re-reading passages just to mull them over one more time. I enjoyed this book because it kept making me pause and follow tangents of though within my thinking. I also liked the blank pages for readers to scribble notes and thoughts. I know that I will be picking this book up again to delve deeper into both the authors thinking and my own."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"A true fellowship is one that consists of changed individuals working as a whole through a generalized guidance shared by all. Such is a truth put in the forefront of \\"The Conversion of the Church\\", which in no uncertain terms brings the magnifying glass of self examination to each and every person. Whether you are a dedicated Church member, a pastor, a priest, or a stray member of the \\"flock\\", Rev. Shoemaker suggests that the only way to bring about change is to start from within. Once our own sources of questions, doubt, and general ill-feelings are dealt with through sharing with another \\"kind soul\\", we are able to effectively assist others in their times of need. It is this very sharing of a common burden that makes the human experience more real to each of us and allows us to form bonds that are open, honest, and whole-hearted.For a look at how one might make a change in your own community, whether they be secular or not, take a look at the ideas raised in this publication and you may see a an easier way to create the society you dream to see."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"Rev. Samuel M. Shoemaker is the pastor of the Calvary which is a church located in New York. Shoemaker has touched a lot of people lives including peers in the same profession. Shoemaker counsels his congregation members and he's ask a lot of questions about life. This book is like a manual to some of the question that people have about life. This a very interesting book because Shoemaker gives his take on society, the Church, and the people."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"Christian faith is all about fellowship. You fellowship with God which will make you fellowship with others in a friendly way. Fellowship really changes everything. Author beautifully showed why fellowship is so important in our lives and how it can strengthen our relationship with God. It is really to see lot of examples in which author made a good point about fellowship. No one get ever tired of knowing these facts, so much in it in this little book."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"As a child, I was raised by parents who were definitely preachers of the ways of \\"fellowship\\" and how important it is in religious communities. This book follows the kind of lines that my parents tried to teach my brothers and me. It focuses on bringing Christ's values to religions of today and how much they could benefit by understanding how important strong fellowship is. I was very appreciative of the note pages. That is always an interesting concept and as a person that, again taught by my parents, writes down ideas as I read, this was very cool. I liked this book and I believe others interested in learning and understanding the benefits of fellowship."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"In his book \\"The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship\\" by Rev. Samuel M. Shoemaker, the author takes a deep look at the way Christian churches need to change in order to serve the people as they were intended to do. He believes they need to become more Christ like by focusing more on fellowship and the needs of the congregation. Reading this book, I took advantage of the pages that are included for journaling about what I read and found myself thinking about the church I attend and my feelings about it."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"Rev. Samuel M. Shoemaker's book \\"The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship\\" was very interesting to read. In the book, the author tells how he feels the church should be more like Christ - more forgiving, judge people less and be more open to meeting its parishioners. The book stresses the point that church is not just a building but a feeling of fellowship of people. A wonderful book that will make you think about your own church and the fellowship (or lack of fellowship) that exists as you reexamine your own feelings about religion."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"\\"The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship\\" by Rev. Samuel M. Shoemaker makes you stop and think about how you feel about your own religious beliefs and your thoughts about fellowship. In the book Reverend Shoemaker puts thoughts, ideas and the fundamental principles of religion out there for you to think about. He explains how the Church should be less judgmental and more compassionate, that it should be more \\"Christlike\\". Throughout the book are pages for you to write down your thoughts and feelings as you are reading. If you are interested in religion and spirituality, this is a book you will enjoy."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"So many times I have heard people saying I go to a certain big church and something. But, church is not a building, it is a fellowship of saints of God. There is church. The author really shown us what a real fellowship and how the church as group of believers need to be converted to understand this. How as a believer we fellowship with everyone and serve the main purpose of serving God not ministers or pastors in the church. The author peeled off the veil between believers and church."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"There is nothing new under the sun. The core things that we struggle with today have been struggled with since the creation of man. Sure, it may get repackaged under new names (postmodernism is really the new existentialism), but it is the same thing.And I believe this book is proof of that. What Shoemaker outlines (again thanks to Palmieri) is human nature. The Conversion of the Church should be just as useful to people today as it was when it was originally published."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"This book covers the sins of the church to the new church. This book is written for Christians to understand the structure of fellowship. The author provides a path for Christians to succeed in reaching God's plan. It also informs the reader of religious practices that you did not know that was going on in the church. Samuel M. Shoemaker is the author of this book and he did a great job at presenting readers with a spiritual read. I would like to thank Carl Palmieri for giving us a second chance to use these words of wisdom in our own lives to take fellowship more seriously."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"This book was not what I was expecting, but in a good way. It is very interesting book which gave me a new perspective on important aspects concerning the church. As a person who struggles with their faith I thought this was a great book which didn't make me feel lesser because my faith was not strong, instead it inspired me. I have also been ignorant of different religions, dominations, and churches and this book really opened my eyes. I have found that I do want a new way for churches...my personal way would be for church to serve coffee on couches and it would keep me more interested. However I have found this book very informative and it leaves me wanting more information."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"After reading a few positive and not so positive reviews for this book I decided to give it a shot. As a person who has fallen completely away from the church in the last 5 years I was sceptical at first, but it proved to be a rather good read. I have always had questions for the church and this book made me feel that mmy questions were just and I shouldn't feel bad for having them. I have read a few of tuchy's books before and knew there would be room for my own note taking, but this time I really took advantage of that feature. I think it will be interesting to read again in a year and see my notes from the first time I read it. Good book, I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"This book will give you a sharp kick if you are working in an inactive or ineffective church and challenges some of our accepted church people practices. It is hard to read and a lot of information in a small space however it is worth studying. If you are interested in making changes or if you need a wake up call to change, this is the manual to get you started."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"\\"Cat That Walks Alone\\" is one of the interesting phrases in this book about church and a new way of thinking about how to get people back into the fold. The author gives his thoughts and ideas about what the \\"New Church\\" should be after talking to ministers, priests, clergyman and others.I believe his feelings are that ministers and other clergymen have to use humor and enthusiasm in order to keep people interested in going to church. They also have to tell their own life experiences to let the congregation know they are human and have learned from their mistakes. Ministers need to take time to listen to people and talk to them instead of only preaching. It is not enough to ask someone to attend church with you but it is necessary to open yourself up to others and listen to other people's feelings and problems in order to form a fellowship with them.You will learn about instinct, conscience and grace. All a way to get closer to God. There is also love and absolute love as well as salvation of sole. This is a very interesting book and very informative. It is quite a learning tool. I am not usually interested in this kind of book but I have happy I read this one."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"I was a little hesitant to read this book as I didn't want to read a book trying to convert me to join a specific Church because I love theChurch I go to and I know it is the right place for me. I found that the viewpoints in this book were productive for anyone of any church. I quote from, \\"It is simply the Church at work in the lives of individuals\\" If the Church members aren't out doing what is talked about on Sunday or what can be found in the Bible, etc. than the Church leaders aren't getting through to the members and/or the members aren't working hard enough to actually act on what they are learning.This book got me thinking about how my Church does things. I do not agree with paid ministry, which is the case with most churches. TheChurch I attend has a lay ministry. I do agree when Ev. Shoemaker states that \\"a listening-prayer is much more important than an asking-prayer.\\" I also fully agree that a meeting with personal testimony sharedpublically is important. My Church has a Testimony Meeting once a month and those are often the most powerful meetings for me and other members. I agree that it does help to share our faith and how we came to gainit, and also how the experiences we have been having in our lives helpstrengthen our faith. It was exciting to see some of my same beliefs talked about. Shoemaker also emphasizes the importance of following the promptings of the Holy Spirit. This is a well-written book."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"\`The Conversion of the Church' was a complete surprise for me to read. I am not a religious person and tend to shy away from religious books, due to the fact that they all have dry religious preaching's. This is not the case with this book, instead of preaching to you it offers ideals about the fellowship of man and church.One of my favorite parts of this book is the fact the author has included blank pages for the reader to write down their own notes. I thought that this was wonderful and unique way to interpret what the author has to say and how it feels to you. Having these blank pages makes it a great way to share and start conversations with friends, or even a book club to discuss main ideas.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a religious book that does not preach to you, but also teaches you about the fellowship of man and his church. You will be just as surprised as I was."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"If you were expecting a dry book about religious theology when you picked up this book, you'd be very surprised. The author, Sam Shoemaker, does present some concepts of theology, but I felt very uplifted after reading this book. The book shows religion in a positive light. It helped me revisit my religious ideas and take a fresh look at my church and my fellow Christians. Faith is a personal matter and it takes a lot of components to form it. I liked how the author examined many of these components. For me, I believe fellowship with other Christians is crucial to my faith and I liked how Shoemaker emphasized this too. We also need others to help strengthen our walk with Christ, but we also must focus on ourselves. I like how he defines and reconciles these 2 ideas. He also talks about the church and how its main purpose is changing lives. I love that! It often seems the church is a small city focusing on budgets and finances more than people. You will enjoy reading the authors take on this topic. This is a great book and you will reexamine many of your thoughts on the church and religion after reading through it."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"\\"The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship\\" by Samuel M. Shoemaker is a book that makes you stop and rethink the concept of religion and fellowship. The idea of transforming parish houses and churches into quiet places of serenity focusing truly on people and fellowship, is an idea I would love to see come to fruition. Reverend Shoemaker puts forth fundamental issues, ideas and principals giving the Church the responsibility to be more Christlike, showing more dedication to the fellowship of man. \\"The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship\\" also calls for the Church to be less judgmental and show more compassion and love to all. With blank pages interspersed throughout the book, giving readers the opportunity to jot down their own thoughts, reactions and favorite passages.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a spiritual book that will make you stop and rethink basic issues."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"What a wonderful goal of serenity the Rev. Shoemaker has. His quest is to convert churches and parishes-houses from a bustling house of activity, which is using up energy for some time past, into the quiet peace of unhurried people who have time enough for soles. When I worked at the local hospital there were moments when I wished the Reverend's quest had already been successful. These were the times when someone was dieing and requested to see their church official. But when we called the parish to tell them of the need, we were told that they would not be able to send anyone because they were to busy doing other things. At those times I often wondered what could be more important for an ambassador of Christ, than to ease the fears of those that are ready to go home and meet their maker.The author feels that if Christianity is going to grow to greater heights, it is going to have have to follow a set of principals. One of which is to act more like Christ and go out and meet the people. The last chapter of this book definitely turns it into a five star read."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"Having recently become a member of a church I can see how one can get caught up in all of the tasks of balancing budgets, caring for the actual facilities and running programs. It does tend to take our focus from God's message of caring for one another, edifying each other. I enjoyed that The Conversion of the Church stayed away from divisive doctrines and instead concentrated on the universal truths of our Savior's commands for the fellowship of His church on earth and what His purpose is for it. I will definitely be raising many of this book's fundamental issues at my next church board meeting."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"Time Talent Treasure. Those are the three words that I have heard my entire life about what we give to our church and fellow man through our love for Christ because of what He has done for us. Many Christians and churches have found themselves giving and doing the least and getting caught up in the earthly day-to-day priorities. \\"The Conversion of the Church\\" reminded me that the Christian Church is not buildings, committees, and meetings, but true fellowship of real people. This fellowship's primary focus should be on God and our fellow man. I enjoyed reading this book and feel renewed in my faith and my commitment to others."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"As a Christian and life-long church member, this book resonated deeply with me. I would consider it a must-read for anyone looking for a historical perspective on the Church and how it should function to impact the lives of people it comes in contact with.Although the title, The Conversion of the Church, had me flashing back to Christian theology and doctrinal statements of belief that were ingrained in me during my childhood (and later my college education), I was pleasantly surprised to find this book approachable. Beyond the author's direct style, the meat of this book leaves a lot to chew on. Describing the modern church as \\"timid, ineffective, and over-organized\\", the Reverend calls on clergymen and church members to return to heart of Christianity: God's relational grace. In doing so, he reasons, the Church will once again live in touch with people and function as a \\"fellowship\\", not a stuffy, overbearing, judgmental club.It's odd how an older book such as this is so in tune to the new movement in American churches; Christianity is about a relationship, not a religion. Would that we all would read and take the message in this book to heart!"},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"Shoemaker grabbed my attention with is book \\"The Conversion of the Church.\\" Don't turn away if you are afraid this book may be trying to influence you in a specific direction. That is not what the book is about. This book made me realize a lot about religion that I didn't know but it also was more of a guide that allowed me to think more specifically about my church and my faith. It was very interesting. It isn't a quick read but instead one that you will read in parts and then reflect upon what you read. I love that there is room to jot down thoughts so you can go back with a fresh mind and reread if you want. A church is so important but I think too many people put an emphasis on the 'religion\\" of the church and not the people. Fellowship is important to the success of a church and I felt this author understood that. It is an informative, reflective book that will have you really understanding your feelings about your church and relgion."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"In the opening I like Rev. Sam Shoemaker's definition of fellowship: \\"the core and genius of real fellowship as I see it, is the power to live and work with people upon the basis of absolute love and honesty\\". Anytime someone talks about an AA group, the 12 step, or even building trust and relationships, it all comes back to believing in you and in God. Your faith is what will get you through the hard, fast, good, bad, and ugly times in life. We all face them it is how we decide to deal with them is what makes the difference for us. Does it hurt someone to make that commitment once a week for an hour? Probably not, but is it as easy as someone makes it sound? No. What you will find tin this book is inspiration. You will realize that you are not alone and that you are able to relate to someone no matter what the situation is or was and how you were able to handle it is most likely the same way they are and that is through faith. This book is thought provoking and I believe all religious books should be. Pick this one up and see what new thoughts come your way today."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"So, whose church do you think is better? Do you have a place to worship that makes you feel welcome and comfortable? If you have a place that you can go and pray and worship without being asked how much you make or what you are committed to pay each week then hold on to it tightly. Everyone knows that the churches need money to run and that you make by giving but it should be the whole goal of why you are there in the first place. You want to be able to reflect on where you have been and how far you have come to know where you are going in your future. To do this you must find yourself. As Sam Shoemaker mentions in the book titled \\"The Conversion of the Church\\" there are three centers of gravity. The three centers of gravity are God, us and other people. In order to help yourself you must find God. Then you must find your group so you can find yourself. So make a commitment to meet weekly at an appointed time and place. See if starting the meeting by singing and praying helps you spiritually and once it does you will be interested in what others have to say. I enjoyed this book and I think you will too."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"The Conversion of the Church is a very thought provoking and motivational book that will make you think about the state of the place where you worship. This book offers insight into what a place of worship should be and makes you see what they have become in the present. The Conversion of the Church has really made me think about my spirituality and what it encompasses. I think that everyone who is looking for some guidance and insight should definitely read this book. It is a very well written book by a man who knows what he is talking about and the way that he explains his thoughts help you understand the points that he is trying to get across."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure what to expect, but the further that I got into it I began to enjoy it. This book makes the reader think about what kind church they attend and the ways that the church has changed or not changed through the years. This book made me consider if I was truly behind the beliefs and the way that they are presented to the people in attendance. I must say that this book has made me reconsider some of the ways I believe a church should reach out to the parishioners. If you are looking for a book that will make you think about where you worship this is definitely the book for you. It is a very good book and I think you will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"This book provides sound usable advice to pastors and church leaders. Although it is at times difficult to read, it is worth the effort. The author discusses the failings of present day churches and provides realistic advice on how to revive the leadership and the congregation. He carefully goes through objections and obstacles to the advice he offers. This advice is highlighted with specific stories of instances where his suggestions have and are working. This is a must read for religious leaders seeking to light a fire in their ministry."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Shoemaker's \\"The Conversion of the Church.\\" About the middle of the book, he begins explaining that there are three levels of life on which men live: the level of instinct, conscience, and grace, or in layman's terms, as he says, \\"I want, I ought, and I am guided.\\" He says that most people live in the \\"I want\\" stage most of their lives, occasionally seeing the light and trying to do what they ought to do. What we should strive for, though, is the final \\"grace\\" level, where we are guided by God to do what is best for others. This book really made me think about my own life and helped me gain some insight into how I can be a better person."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"This was a little hard of a read for me at first, as I am not a very religious person. Once I realized that it wasn't about being preached to, and just about him telling his personal feelings, I truly enjoyed it. It gives a good reminder that even if you go do church regularly and \\"do your part\\" for the church, you may not be letting yourself take full advantage for what God can do for you. It really did give me a new perspective of church as a whole."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"This isn\\"t typically a book that I would read,but it really had my attention.It spoke to me in a way that I felt like I wasn\\"t being pressured or preached to.Helping me to better understand church and religion.Teaching me a few new things that I wasn\\"t aware of.Opening my eyes to a few more.Making very valuable points.It really makes you think and I like that.There\\"s even your own personal spaces on the book to express your feelings and thoughts in writing.Making this book even that more personal and special.This was a very interesting read that I found to be helpful and very educational."},{"Title":"The conversion of the church,","review":"There was a lot in The Conversion of the Church that I had never thought over in the past, or even been concerned with. I am concerned now, and I cannot help but wonder about all the other people out there that share my faith and what they would think about some of the topics that are discussed in this book.Even though there were some disheartening parts to this book and what was discussed, I felt like I came away from it with a little more certainty about my faith and how I was trying to lead my own life. I think this is a really great book for anyone who is studying Christianity, their faith, questioning their faith or helping others learn more about theirs.Just reading it kind of gives you the will to really understand what it is about your faith that drives you. Interesting."},{"Title":"I Do! (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Caitlin, Book 5)","review":"I do, is the fifth and last book in the Caitlin series. It is mainly about Caitlin getting ready for her wedding. Josh proposed to her at the beginning of the book. He proposed to her in a very special way. All through the book she is fighting her wedding battles. She has to try to go through with her mom and Josh's mom telling her different things she needs to do. Josh's mom likes to spend lots of money and Caitlin's mom is the complete opposite. Caitlin just wants to have a simple wedding. Jenny was a very big help since she has transferred to Caitlin's school. They are now rooming together. Beanie got accepted to a design school in New York City and is helping Caitlin out with the designs for the bride's dress and the bridesmaid dresses. Caitlin is also trying to figure out where they should go on their honeymoon. Caitlin and Josh are having their wedding at a big church and the reception at a place they went together in high school. Is Caitlin going to get everything worked out or get completely stressed?I would recommend this book to any girl that can read the reading level. I would also recommend this book to people that like the books, P.S Longer Letter Later and Snail Mail No More because they are very similar.This book was a very good book. I like everything about it and I don't think that I disliked any part of it."},{"Title":"I Do! (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Caitlin, Book 5)","review":"This is a good wrap-up to the Caitlin series, but compared to the other books it felt like that extra spark was missing. Either that or it suffered from how long ago I read the first book.It was fun to see wedding planning from her point of view once she accepts Josh's proposal. Other issues are raised (mostly anorexia and pre-marital sex), though not as deeply as readers of the series may expect. I feel like I should have more positive to say, but by book five it's become pretty standard.On the downside, their relationship is sweet, but I felt disconnected from it. The former books mentioned but didn't really delve into their e-mails, and this book didn't seize the opportunity to show why they were so perfect for each other. I recognize it's hard to do that in the diary format and certainly wasn't looking for a full-blown romance novel, but it felt stilted. Some issues seemed resolved too easily, and I didn't see as much growth in Caitlin as I expected. She remains the girl who comes off as preachy and too perfect. I appreciate the attempt to show what it's like to be \\"the good girl\\" in today's society, but Caitlin really ended up turning into a Christian stereotype. I also felt like I should have read some of the Chloe books in between, but am looking forward to doing so now.Overall, I did like the book. The mushy side of me loved what romance was there and it's certain to be enjoyable for those who invested in the first four."},{"Title":"I Do!

(Diary of a Teenage Girl: Caitlin, Book 5)","review":"Throughout the series I had been waiting anxiously for this one and enjoyed it much more than I had even hoped. In the past ones Caitlin had been very...I don't know, annoying. While I appreciated her faith and views on life, I didn't like how sometimes she came off as too preachy. In this one she starts to loosen up a bit and it was very fun to read! Would totally recommend this book and others by this author!"},{"Title":"I Do!

It is the fifth book in the series of Diary of A Teenaged Girl. Caitlin is a senior in college and was at a wedding for two of her good friend. After a while at the reception, Caitlin and her best friend Beanie were leaving when Josh Miller stopped them. Josh and Caitlin have a history together, and Caitlin has always liked him since high school. Josh asked Caitlin if she was busy that night, and she said no. Josh was driving somewhere that he told Caitlin was special, but Caitlin didn't know about it. He drove to the park and hopped out to open Caitlin's door. They walked through the park until they came to a clearing by the lake. There, Caitlin saw a table lit with candles. They sat down and were served by some high school-aged guys from their church. Then josh went down on one knee, and popped a question.I really liked this book because it explains what is happening really well, and makes it so you understand what is going on. I also like this book because every time you start the next book in the series, it explains like some of the things that happened in the book before that so you know what is going on at the beginning. I don't really have any dislikes about the book because I thought it was pretty exciting and interesting throughout the whole thing.I don't think people who like adventure books would like this. I also don't think guys would want to read this book because it is more of a girl book."},{"Title":"I Do!

Gabe was willing to be a father to Ashley's unborn child, all he needed was land for cattle. The feud between the Brants and the Ryders was a bit unclear but I loved the legend of the white stallion that went well with the subtitle of Stallion Pass.True love finds those that capture the white stallion.

Is it the fast paced action, the gripping sense of mystery, the well developed characters, the dank surroundings of Lankhmar which envelope both heroes and reader? Certainly the greatest feature of this book is its mooring in the world of Nehwon, a fantastic realm dominated by sword and spell, where law is only as strong as ones own ability to uphold it. It is this place that Leiber's rogues Fafhrd, a massive barbarian, and Gray Mouser, a lithe burglar, must negociate their way through the darkness and cruelty of their world. Nehwon seems to us a place of suffocating oppression where suffering and death rule the day, a place of misery that steals the joy of living. It is also home to Fahfrd and Mouser who have long ago survived their baptism by fire. Pain is a reality, but as both men show in Leiber's introductory book &quot;Swords and Deviltry,&quot; they manage to overcome their suffering in the only way they can--through the brutal strength to persevere, take action, and stand fast in the face of danger. They don't become slaves to Nehwon, but seek to tame it and use it to their advantage. From here, the two swordsmen silently take on the world in a number of adventures which are modivated from lust of wealth to cheating death at his own game. Each short story carries with it a new adventure, fresh and original, which keeps the reader securely in place, and the mind in a whirl of activity. Not to mention, they also steal an entire house in one story, and you can't go wrong with that."},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"Poor Fritz Leiber. He has never truly received the credit he deserves for fostering the fantasy genre. Along with the old Conan stories and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, this is amongst the most influential works of fantasy fiction.Fascinating worldbuilding, intrigue and exciting characters abound in these tales, all told with Leiber's exceptional artistic skills. Not only are the plots and personalities compelling, but Leiber has a magical rhythm to his storytelling and descriptions. This is one of the few stories that is on my &quot;reread&quot; list.Pick this up and you'll love the stories--and when you look at the copyright date of these tales, you'll come to appreciate just how much Leiber has affected the fantasy authors that have come since."},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"It's a shame that in order to find non-formulaic fantasy, you mostly have to do your searching at the very beginnings of the genre. Fritz Leiber doesn't need a three book deal to tell a great story, and in fact being a master storyteller seems to have been nothing more than a trivial feat to his ever pranking genius.Disguised as pulp fiction, here is an intricately simple Sistine Chapel of fantasy fiction, each chapter an enjoyable stand-alone tale and yet a statement of literary symbolistic skill and an intrinsic part of the larger book and plot as a whole, all at the same time!What's more, you'll see the two reoccuring heroes Fafhrd and/or the Grey Mouser undergo character change and development in every single tale; no matter how he uses them, Leiber never fails at making these two personalities grow and flourish. The authors characterization is more amusing and perhaps even keener than that of the others in the triumvorate of fantasy of which he is a part (Tolkien, Howard, and Leiber), and is even reminescent of Brian Jaques and perhaps even Charles Dickens.Token run-on sentences are an aquired taste, but much appreciated when you get to know them, and Leiber famously switches styles like a mad maniac; the result is a rolicking journey describing its moods and settings with grammatical choices as well as poetic and sleezy descriptions. Here you will find the influence of modernism on fantasy, while finding the source of inspiration for what we have come to know as sword and sorcery.Imagine a young and reckless Conan as a sort of medieval rock star who's hanging out with a sorceror thief played by Johnny Depp in an episode of the Twilight Zone that's set in Tomothy Leary's 1960s Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and you'll be getting a glimpse as to what awaits you in the world of Nehwon."},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"Fritz coined the term \\"Sword and Sorcery\\" He is one of the great grand masters of heroic fiction and his stories deliver with brass and style. He has creative genius combined with an appreciation fo pacing and the exotic. If onyl hollwood in 2004 could learn from him..... alas.This author is not a copycat like Terry Brooks, and comes as close as any to Robert E Howard, but tends to throw in a bit more social interaction.The series are gems, get them all today.Fafhrd is a northerner an ice barabrian while the grey mouser is a urban---fast as a cat and a bit or a magic user.They take on animated dungeons and sorcerers galore, find and lose love----and generally take you along for a grand old origional time.No rehashing of tolkien[in a crayy way ] like Terry GoodkindNo barfish unrealisticness like Thieves World were politics can trump bigtime magic users on a given day.Not goofy like MYTH series[although myth series can be entertaining]Just good appealing sword n sorcery adventure.GOOd Show Fritz-----The fact that he does not get more press is a crime-----I don't get it-----he needs to havce far more fan apprecaition sites.Azimov can't hold his jock."},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"The second in the Fafrhd and the Grey mouser series.

But to be honest I don't really think fantasy works in a short story format. Horror and sci-fi yes, but not fantasy. Most of these stories seemed rushed. Fantasy, at least to me, requires a little bit of color and backstory."},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"This is, in my opinion, the best of Leiber's tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and by that rationale, some of the finest swords and sorcery around. This particular collection contains several of Leiber's earliest and most vibrant tales, including 'Jewels in the Forest', 'The Bleak Shore', 'The Howling Tower', 'The Sunken Land' and 'Thieves' House' as well as excellent later works such as 'Claws from the Night' and 'Bazaar of the Bizarre'. Unlike some of the other books in the Swords series, there's really not a weak tale here; 'The Circle Curse' and 'The Price of Pain Ease' are probably the weakest in the collection, being somewhat sketchy, but even those don't fall too far off the mark and are naturally written in Leiber's consummately beautiful prose. In addition, the sheer variety of tales here are sure to provide something to suit all tastes."},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"the first book I read as a kid. the stories are full of adventure!I can't believe there are no other fritz lieber reviews...sad"},{"Title":"Swords Against Death","review":"Read them as a kid, just as good now.

He attempts to \\"to speak for life and growth, amid all the mess of destruction and disintegration.\\" Modern times have witnessed the triumph of nihilism and the advent of a new sort of barbarism and secularism. Excellence no longer means anything, and mediocrity is promoted. Vulgarity, profanity, obscenity, and promiscuity are worshipped (as evidenced by Woodstock II, to which Panichas devotes an essay). Current literary and social criticism does not help the situation, denying standards and enshrining the dethronement of the spirit. Panichas suggests that restoration, if it is at all possible, will result from a return to criticism in the vein of T.S. Eliot or Russell Kirk--true men of letters who fought the good fight, who battled for the \\"permanent things.\\" He also adduces a string of writers who understood this need for moral and spiritual value--Joseph Conrad, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Czeslaw Milosz, and Simone Weil, among others. Panichas himself must surely rank among those fighting the good fight, and his book, without a doubt, should be the starting point for anyone interested in repairing our culture."},{"Title":"Measuring the Impact of Your Web Site","review":"Not only does this book expose the key metrics, but it also provides a methodology for gathering and analyzing the metrics.Chapter 1, Planning and Measurement Essentials, is uniformly excellent and lays the groundwork for what follows. I also liked Chapter 3, Measurement strategies and Sources, because the information has much wider application than web site analysis. The overall methodology steps you through gathering raw measures, consolidating them, developing assumptions and approximations, then performing impact measurements.This book will not only give you insights into the business and what is important, but will also give you a methodology that can be employed for technical analysis within the IT domain. For example, these business techniques are also the basis for measuring IT effectiveness, service level attainment and other performance areas. Of course the metrics for IT are going to be different than the business metrics given in the book.If you're in marketing or competitive intelligence you'll find this book to be an asset for the ideas and methods. I personally learned many subtle facts and techniques about measurement and highly recommend this book to anyone who is tasked with impact analysis, regardless of whether it is for web site effectiveness or other technical or business areas."},{"Title":"Measuring the Impact of Your Web Site","review":"I spent two very pleasant evenings and a reasonable morning reading this 300 page book.As a consultant who is about to do just that: measure the impact of an intranet web site for a large international company I was of course very interested (and critical) of what the authors have to say.The book breaks down into three parts:Part I: Measurement Strategy and PlanningPart II: Measurements and ConsolidationPart III: Analysis and ActionI found part I to be a very useful overview and framework for developing a measurement strategy.In particular, the many sets of questions that the authors list are a great help in exposing elements of a strategy.Parts II and III were (for me at least) less informative in that they were more based on common sense and many of the statements made there were all too easy too derive from part I. This is not as bad as it seems however for Part I covers almost half of the book and this part alone provides more than enough value to cover the cost of the book. In any case they were interesting enough that I read through the entire book (which says a lot).While the book is a good start it is by no means the be all and end all (and considering the rapid flux of the field I don't think the authors ever had this pretention). In particular, my interest lies in the impact of intranets and this issue is covered almost as an afterthought in the very last chapter which is a pity considering that probably over 80% of all web development currently takes place on intranets.An indepth discussion on impact measures related to knowledge management and sharing, workgroup collaboration and culture transformation would all be highly useful additions in a possible second edition. From the costing point of view, cost lowering metrics of websites such as self-maintainance and self-regulation as well as extensive support for self-publication (i.e. without intervention of &quot;traditonal&quot; webmasters might be a useful addition.Nevertheless currently this book is a must read for anyone in the field involved with website justification."},{"Title":"Come and go","review":"A Confederate Civil War Vet hooked up with his English cousin and went off to Europe to drown his sorrows, succeeding to such an extent that he got himself, cousin and pet monkey shot by invading Prussians. So starts Brief Candles, in which they continue to figure when their ectoplasm is gelled by the presence of modern day ('50s) descendants. In Come and Go, the pair and their pet are brought back again by the peril of another descendant. They are as charming and delightful as ever. Don't expect convoluted plot or subtle characterization. Do expect comedy, gentility and the lively Aunt Angela. If you haven't read Brief Candles, drop everything and do that now. Then come back and read this.

I highly recomment all three books, as well as their Far Traveller. However, you'll never look at ghost stories in the same way again."},{"Title":"Come and go","review":"I read all three of the Latimer books fifty years ago, and have been cudgeling my brains ever since trying to remember Manning Coles' name! It's something of a relief to see the books again, although they are rather lightweight comedies of manners more than ghost stories. A fast reader can get through Brief Candles in an evening and count him or herself entertained. Manning Coles is not J. K. Rowling, nor even C. S. Lewis, but considering that what is on ABC's evening fare these days is essentially unscripted Japanese D-list retreads, an evening or two with one of these books should feel calm, collected and devoid of postmodern nincompoopery. Anyone familiar with Thorne Smith or the Topper movies from a generation or two ago will be right at home."},{"Title":"Come and go","review":"This book, and the other two Manning Coles ghost stories, were favorites in my family as long as I can remember.

For sheer fun, it's hard to beat these, and some of the scenes are priceless. Have fun!"},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"This book is one of my top ten favorites. I bought my first copy in 1972 for my father who passed away a year later. I have re-read this book many times with increased pleasure each time. It not only has Charles Russell's drawings and paintings, it has some of the best short stories I have ever read. I've lived in the West pretty much all my life and the characters he portrays ring so true that you know he knew them. He not only knew them, he was able to capture their essence in a few words. I usually don't laugh out loud at what I'm reading, but many of these stories are just plain &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny. Anyone who enjoys Cowboy Poetry needs to have this in their library. It's not poetry per se, but gives you the same Western flavor in its writing. Most of the stories can be read in 5 minutes or less. I give it a solid 10 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"This is a classic work of Western nonfiction by a Montana artist whose drawings and paintings helped create the iconography of the early cowboy of the open range. Also a storyteller, Russell wrote this collection of yarns and memories before his death, commemorating frontier life in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. It was published in 1927, with an introduction by Will Rogers in the form of a cowboy eulogy. The original edition featured more than 50 of Russell's illustrations, some of them in color.Unlike the fairly rollicking account of Teddy Blue Abbott, his cowboy contemporary, Russell's book is a more melancholy view of what he remembers as the good old days. His stories are told in an ironic vernacular by an old-timer cowboy named Rawhide Rawlins. Many concern the adventures of cowboys; many also feature Native Americans, in the early years of the agencies (reservations), portrayed with some complexity of feelings, ranging from fear and distrust to respect. Some are outrageously tall tales. Some are spirited character sketches, capturing something of life on the rough, raw land before settlement and homesteading, the motorcar, and civilization - before the plow broke the prairie sod where buffalo and then cattle and cowboys ranged freely.One of the finest pieces of Western writing occurs in the last chapter, &quot;Longrope's Last Guard,&quot; which describes in vivid detail the experience of riding herd on a pitch dark night as the stillness is shattered by an electrical storm that stampedes the cattle and takes the life of one of the men. The burial of the dead cowboy on the open prairie and the subsequent disappearance of his grave is symbolic of the passing of the brief frontier era Russell's words and pictures embrace.I recommend this book for its capturing of the historical cowboy as remembered by a man who was there and lived among them. As a companion volume, I also recommend Teddy Blue Abbott's &quot;We Pointed Them North,&quot; a well-detailed and more light-hearted recollection of the same time and place."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Will Rogers said Charlie Russell wasn't &quot;just another&quot; cowboy artist, he wasn't &quot;just another&quot; anything. Though remembered mostly for his paintings, this book proves that Charlie Russell was a keen observer of human nature. This is a sentimental look back at a world that disappeared in Russell's lifetime. The stories will leave you nostalgic for a time you never knew."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Nothing compares to the facts, and no one who has not lived this could write it as C.M. Russell did. This old cowpuncher commands the written word and infuses the reader with his perfection -- the imagery of clear storytelling and spirit of those long-gone times. This he does quite as well as he wields the brush to canvas. I read it at a sitting, and will do it again as there are some facts in here about horses, people and buffalo that I did not know before. Another way of thinking and presenting a story about the actual facts is handed down in Trails Plowed Uder (1927) from former times . . . by this gifted sentimentalist."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"You would generously call this Amazon editon an oversight, otherwise it's a shameless fleecing because for the same price The University of Nebraska press edition, current, for the same price has the many sketches from the original.The Doubleday hardcover editions had five, double-paged color iillustrations, five half-tone illustrations and forty three sketches, This Amazon edition has none, which for a Charles M. Russell book is inexcusable."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Most people realize Charles Russell was a wonderfully gifted, world renowned artist who chronicled Western life with a myriad of sketches and paintings that grace the finest art museums in the world today. His work is meticulous with an attention to detail second to none. What few of us realized is that as good an artist as he was, he was an equally gifted author.Published a few months before his death, Trails Plowed Under is a compendium of 43 short stories. He often complained of being \\"deaf and dum\\" with a pen but these writings, or yarns as he called them, certainly prove otherwise. In them he covers various aspects of everyday cowboy life from animals and stampedes to the colorful characters that peopled the American West as he knew it. Having cowboyed all his life he knew his subject well and he leaves behind a prism through which we today can catch a glimpse of the past as it was.This book will tug on your emotions. You will laugh, reflect, think and admire Russell's skill with words. Some of these stories are undoubtedly true while others are designed to definitely pull your leg.There is not a rotten apple in the barrel."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Charles Russell left us a wonderful gift in these stories. He managed to capture a first-person account of the Old West. I read this book many years ago, and recently re-read portions. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good American western writing.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Charles Russell's stories are second to none and fun for all ages. His art is also a big part of the experience. Tragically the ebook version does not contain any of Russell's great images. Poorly done, Kindle folks. However the literature is great."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"If you know who Charlie Russell is, you probably don't need to read this to know that this book is one of the most fascinating sources of first-hand information about America's Old Wild West. It's not a history book, and it's not about people you would have heard of. This is a collection of stories Charlie has either told or heard from others and retold. Accompanied by about 5 color plates and several drawings, it is worth the price for the artwork alone. Try to get one with the dustcover intact. Top it off with a foreword by Will Rogers, and you have one of the best books ever published on the subject. The language is in the vernacular of old Montana, and the stories are told as if he was standing in front of a campfire talking to friends -- something Russell did a lot of, and something for which his friends, like Rogers, missed him greatly when he passed.Russell was one of the great painters of the old West, and many of his works fetched record-breaking prices during his lifetime. Now they hang in museums all over the world, especially the Russell Museum in Great Falls and the Amon Carter in Fort Worth. Published in 1927 and originally sold for $5.95, it's a shame this book hasn't been reprinted for modern audiences. But the original old books, if they were cared for, look like they just popped out of the printer's press. The paper has aged well, and the binding is perfect. You can read this book easily without wrestling with the pages.Though the stories are usually short, you find them wedged into cowboy movies -- almost every cowboy movie ever made contains at least something from these pages. Here you sense the animosity between the white Americans who pushed the frontier ever-westward, and the Indians who resisted being forced out of their native hunting grounds, villages, and homes. But Russell never stoops to criticism of either race. He tells it like it was, and lets you put together the pieces. He admired Native Americans as the amazing people they were and still are, and portrayed them honestly and sympathetically. At the same time, they could be scary in battle, and in some of his tales the Indians (and the Cowboys, too) will raise the hair on the back of your neck.If you are a fan of the old West, this book is absolutely essential reading. One thing to watch out for: be sure to ask the seller to check and make sure the plates are intact. People used to buy this book, cut out the color plates, frame them, and hang them on the wall. It was a very cheap way to acquire 5 Charlie Russell paintings. Specify to the seller that you want the color plates intact, and that you will return the book if they are missing or damaged.Shooshie"},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Wonderful, expressive book of tales and happenings in the life of Western artist Charles M. Russell of Montana. Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Bonsoir Lune / Goodnight Moon (French Edition)","review":"This book is a near-literal translation of the original \\"Good Night Moon,\\" including copies of the original pictures. Because my 18-month-old loves the original English version, and because I'm trying to teach him French, I ordered \\"Bonsoir Lune\\" so that he could associate the French words with the pictures and story that he already knows in English. For that purpose, it works fine.I was, however, disappointed with the color and quality of the pictures in this version. First, the colors do not match the original very well; for instance, the red shades from the original look hot pink in the French version. This is not purely an aesthetic complaint: it can be confusing to your child when you're reading about a \\"ballon rouge\\" - a red balloon - that's actually pink. Moreover, the pictures in the French version appear to be nothing more than color photocopies of the originals. They're far less clear and sharp than the originals, particularly toward the end when the room scene gets darker and darker.In addition, much of the poetry and rhythm of the English version is lost in the French. The rhyming couplets in the English (such as \\"Goodnight bears, goodnight chairs\\") are translated faithfully, but as a result they don't have the same rhyme or rhythm (\\"Bonsoir oursons, bonsoir les chaises\\"). Translators often have to decide whether to translate as literally as possible or to translate more freely in order to retain the overall sound and impression, and in this case the translators went with the former route. So, if your primary interest is in using the French version as a companion piece to the English version in order to teach your little one French, then the literalness of the translation is a good thing. However, if you're expecting the translation to capture the same soothing rhyme patterns as the original, you'll be disappointed. (I found only one exception to the literalness of the translation - the final phrase \\"Goodnight stars, goodnight air, goodnight noises everywhere\\" is translated as \\"Bonsoir les etoiles, bonsoir l'air, bonsoir les bruits de la terre\\" - which isn't quite literal but does preserve a bit of the poetry).Finally, I should point out that this version is *completely* in French - no English \\"subtitles\\" or French pronunciation guides - so it's probably best for those who know French fairly well or who know the English version by heart."},{"Title":"Bonsoir Lune / Goodnight Moon (French Edition)","review":"The French translation for this book is not well done. I do not recommend it for anyone who is trying to teach their child proper French. The entire premise is that it's a bedtime book, and \\"Goodnight moon\\" implies saying goodnight as one goes to bed. \\"Bonsoir lune\\" implies more of a \\"good evening\\", as if one were being greeted in a restaurant for dinner. \\"Bonne nuit\\" would be a much more appropriate translation. This is just an example of several contextual as well as technical translating errors throughout the book."},{"Title":"Bonsoir Lune / Goodnight Moon (French Edition)","review":"This is the French version of the popular \\"Goodnight Moon.\\" Iwas looking all over for some simple French storybooks to read to my baby (now 12 months) and was delighted to find this book we are already familiar with. I haven't used my French much since college, but I would like for my baby to learn the language at a young age. I have purchased other French children's books on-line but found they were for older children (those who won't be flipping the pages every 5 words) and required a French dictionary nearby for my limited vocabulary. Since I have pretty much memorized the English-version \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and so has he, this is a good one for us to start out with."},{"Title":"Bonsoir Lune / Goodnight Moon (French Edition)","review":"We got this bok because we are trying to teach our 5 yr old some basic French. This book is great for naming objects and the repetitive nature of the ryhmes make it easy for the child to learn.

These are books your child already know by heart and are a great way to introduce a second language to your young child."},{"Title":"Bonsoir Lune / Goodnight Moon (French Edition)","review":"The translation is literal - good for anglophone kids looking to learn a few nouns in French, but doesn't stand on its own as a kids' book for francophone kids. It doesn't have the rhythm of the English version and it doesn't rhyme.Also, I disagree with their choice of \\"Bonsoir\\" instead of \\"Bonne Nuit.\\" In my opinion \\"Good Night Moon\\" means good night more in the sense of \\"sleep well\\" (bonne nuit) than \\"good evening\\" (bonsoir)."},{"Title":"Bonsoir Lune / Goodnight Moon (French Edition)","review":"I didn't notice that this book was a paperback and was expecting a board book similiar to the English version sold in stores.

Item was shipped in flat paper (vacuum-sealed?) and the product almost ripped when I tore it open because there was no labeling saying the best way to open and as mentioned above, it was so thin you couldn't tell where it was in the packaging and tearing just the end did not un-seal the entire package. If I'd used scissors I would have most definitely have cut through the book. The packaging used less materials than if shipped in a box but the inside of the paper was an adhesive/plastic-lined so it wasn't even recyclable. I would have appreciated some sort of labeling on this type of packaging to point out where to cut/tear open and perhaps separately vacuum-sealed in a light plastic so at least the paper was recyclable.The paperback book was incredibly small and flimsy.

The characters are great! I loved Jennifer and Pam!Frances writes like an angel and has the only answer to weight loss and saninty within her pages.If you want to know how to &quot;DO IT!&quot; buy the book!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel is believer in the addiction model of overeating and the 12th step method of coping with it. This means that she is absolutely powerless over food and until she admitted it, really devoted most of her life to sneaking vast amounts of food. So she became and remained very fat, then, she at middleaged, she started attending Overeaters Anonymous and following their system of dealing with it: for the rest of her life eating nothing but exactly weighed and measured portions of mainly vegetables and fruit, phoning a sponsor every morning to pre-repoert exactly what her day's eating shall include. By doing so she has gotten down to, at her best (with many relapses up the other way) to 168 lbs. But from her side, it's super thin, gorgeous, haute couture-wearing, worthy of being-scoped-out-by-Eric-Clapton-SUPER THIN!! She's SO beautiful, as she reports so many people telling her! She has no thighs AT ALL!! Which is interesting, because to me, 168 lbs is shoot-myself FAT. Size 16. One definitely has thighs at 168. One is singularly unworthy of being scoped out by a rock legend. One does not fit in Dolce and Gabbana, unless it's special sizing for wealthy NYC matrons. If Kuffel loses another 45 lbs AND quits smoking, I'll grant her the self-aggrandizing of this book. But that just goes to show you, that to a thin person, 168 lb would be horrible, but to a 313 person it's Paris Hilton thin. It's all in your perspective. France's writing is not good enough to warrant this book's hype, but combined with a very respectable, hard-won weight loss, I'm sure it's a good start in launching her self esteem towards one day actually being thin and fit. Good start, honey!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read this book in 2 days - could not put it down. Although I agree with the critiques that the Los Angeles reader posted (some character threads were unfinished - what DID happen to Dennis?), mostly, I was riveted. I also thought that her writing style was sometimes a little self-consciously &quot;stylized&quot;, and didn't flow naturally. I also would have liked to know more about exactly how she lost the weight, and more about her &quot;working the Steps&quot; re: her overeating (she never once mentioned the name &quot;Overeaters Anonymous&quot;, she just referred to 12 Step). She only discussed that whole process once, when she mentioned a 4th Step inventory. But these are minor quibbles, overall.Ms. Kuffel tells her story with wit and heartbreaking honesty. I am not obese, but I am currently trying to lose about 20 lbs. via Weight Watchers, and I related to much of what she said. I was fascinated by her descriptions of what life FEELS like as an obese person, and liked her use of &quot;the planet of fat&quot; and &quot;the planet of girls&quot; to describe the difference. She had NEVER been thin in her life, and so had no frame of reference to go on once she lost the weight. It was a totally alien and new feeling to be thin, and she describes this phenomenon beautifully.The stuff about her romantic breakup got a little maudlin, however. If you've ever read &quot;Jemima J&quot; by Jane Green, this book often reads like a nonfiction version of that book - kind of soap opera-like.However, anyone who's ever struggle to lose any amount of weight will find this compelling reading."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read this book in two days, staying up late because I couldn't put it down. Before I purchased the book on amazon, I read many reviews. In my opinion, more of Kuffel's problems stemmed from her beliefs about obesity and fat than her actual fat. She has many preconcieved, limiting options about what a fat person is/can do. She also clearly used food to deal with her feelings, which not all fat people do.She worked hard to be healthier, and had to overcome many internal demons to do so. In the beginning, she was very critical of fat people, but as she progressed in her journey, she seemed to soften.I am glad that I purchased this book, and I do think it can be of value to others. I don't subscribe to the OA model, which Kuffel describes. However, the idea that food and emotions are/can be linked is a useful construct. Her writing is honest, sometimes painfully so. You may or may not like Kuffel, but I do think reading her book is worth your time."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances, as written, isn't always likable. Who is, all the time? Brilliant and courageous, undaunted by the muckiest part of life, I like how she keeps shouldering on without sugarcoating how sucky it can get, 'even when' excess lbs are gone. Well written if sometimes wrenching.However, I finished reading and kept thinking she should have put this book in the drawer for a while and lived some more and had a bit more to say, the ending wasn't...satisfying. Frances (you feel you know her well by the end) seemed on the verge of some interesting breakthroughs and insights. As it is, I found the ending abrupt and would rather there were a 4.5 rating than the 5 I left.Vivid and harrowing depiction of 9/11...her love for both New York and Missoula area show in some of the strongest passages. Ohers are loving, unflinching family encounters. It will be interesting to see what she writes next."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"In the past two years I have lost over 100 pounds, and I was absolutely glued to every page of this book. She very acurately depicts the emotions involved with seeing your body change (so that you don't recognize it anymore) and the way people look at you differently. This is an amazing and awe-inspiring book to get or keep you motivated because you can see the way to handle the emotional aspect of losing half your weight.Many of the other reviews that I've read wanted more meat about HOW she lost the weight, but I was relieved not to hear about that too much. There are tons of books out there about HOW to lose weight physically. This book deals with the emotions involved, and I loved every word of it."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel's book Passing for Thin is an honest evaluation and narration of one woman's experience in transition. Having lost 188 lbs, after a lifetime of obesity, she finds herself an awkward visitor in the land of normal. What Kuffel does so well in this book is personalize the experience of addiction. Several reviewers of this book have found her selfish, but what addict isn't? In fact, addiction of any sort can be the supreme expression of self involvement. I think it would be more fair to realize that Kuffel has exposed herself and her savage little heart and revealed that she, like many of us, are not always thinking kindly, about ourselves or others. I loved that this book WAS Kuffel's confession box. In the end, the realization of one's own frailties, the evaluation and compassion for our own judgements is what allows that fierce demanding child inside to be sated and quieted. That acknowledgement is what finally allows us each to have room for compassion and care for others. Kuffel is obviously on her way to resolving her anger and judgements and I for one can't wait for a sequel."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I just finished reading Passing for Thin and am filled with emotion because I've been there. Having lost 142# in the Rooms myself, I feel Kuffel brilliantly shared from the depths what a lifetime of obesity does to a person. Losing the weight, while the primary focus, is only the beginning of recovery. (We come for vanity and stay for sanity) Her anger showed, her self-loathing showed, her imperfections showed, her vanity showed, and her insensitivity to others was nothing more than her own misdirected insecurity. Those core issues are not resolved on the scale, and recovery is a life-long process. I don't really care if her literary style is polished; I read this diary of feeling, emotion, success, failure, fear, hatred, love and longing for what it was meant to be--a glimpse into her journey. I'm sure she's not proud of all she shared, but she didn't sugarcoat her feelings, and I applaud her for that.My guess is this book will have a rather slim (no pun intended) audience. It takes one to know one and truly appreciate what Kuffel has done, and in this age of quick fixes, pills and magic formulas, surgeries, and \\"tomorrows,\\" most people don't really want face all the issues this book addresses."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Although I congratulate Ms. Kuffel on her success in leaving the Planet of Fat, I was turned off by the tones of self-pity and self-loathing that permeate this book. Ms. Kuffel spends a great deal of time judging herself - and others - according to body weight and other superficial attributes. Her descriptions of &quot;the Stepfords&quot; (women who followed the same eating plan Ms. Kuffel used), different &quot;types&quot; of fat women, and &quot;laws about men&quot; are simplistic and somewhat mean-spirited. I wish that the author had deepened her analysis more and questioned the premises that seem to have informed her desire to lose weight and her response to accomplishing that goal."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I read it in two days. Ms. Kuffel is so honest about her body and mindset before, during and after the weight loss that she has offended other readers whose reviews appear here. Ms. Kuffel is no Richard Simmons, thank God. How refreshing to hear from an intelligent, thoughtful person that losing all the weight not isn't an automatic ticket to lifelong bliss, rather an entry into a new life that has its own set of challenges. The weight loss industry has enough smiley-faced spokespeople. I was delighted to hear a rawer, more honest voice.I am not obese but have two sisters and two close friends with lifetime obesity issues (thus I remain anonymous). Frances' &quot;wearing out&quot; friends who can't take her depression, entropy that keeps her in a rotten job for 12 years, apartment in a state of complete disarray, as well as the litany of day to day humiliations - all of these things are pages from lives I know well. In fact, one of my sisters became gorgeously thin for the first time after college and promptly gained it back when the thin world overwhelmed her with similar challenges to Frances'.Anyone in Frances' position could write a book about stories of humiliation while fat, a grueling weight loss regimen, and subsequent rise to svelte glory. But thousands of these books have already been written, the authors then catapulting themselves into money making empires of weight loss wisdom. What makes Frances' book special is precisely some of the things that have put off other reviewers (sorry folks, but the prose is a little more uppity than People Magazine). Frances dares to dislike other fat women. She, a New Yorker who eye-witnessed the Trade Center attacks, is thinking about a date on September 12. Jarring, but then I realized that she hadn't dated her whole life - it reminded me of one of my sisters, finally dating for the first time in decades, throwing aside all else for the sake of a crush. It's not pretty but it is very true.A final comment I had was with her father, who she certainly loves a great deal. I am sorry he was not more sympathetic. Since so many of us look to marry our fathers, I hope that this doesn't attract her to a similarly emotionally stingy man."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book was a very good read. However, I thought the author was a bit too flowery in most of the writing. Although I realize this is a &quot;memoir&quot;, I would have appreciated a more straight forward tone. At times, I felt as though I was reading part memoir/part poetry and it took away from the core of the story.Also, I realize that OA has anonymity traditions (which I respect), but where are Frances' views, comments, struggles with the 12 steps????? I believe that the look at her spiritual aspect re: OA was sorely lacking. A few casual comments were dropped, but when you read this book you get more of a feeling that OA is about the weight than the Steps.I did, however, greatly appreciated the author's very candid look at herself and her life."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel explains how she, personally, experienced obesity, the determination to change her life, and the process of making that change.She does not set herself out as a model for all to duplicate. Certainly, I would have liked to see her resolve more of her psychological issues before the book ended. But there is no quick fix for long-term low self-esteem, anger, and poor emotional management, so changing one's life is a long, difficult process. Kuffel simply tells her own story up to the point she has reached in that process. It is not necessary for Kuffel to complete or perfect her psychological journey in order for us to learn from her -- we see what she has accomplished, and why, and we ponder where she needs to go from here."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I remember enjoying this book. I admired Kuffel's writing and her honesty. Loved the story about her relapse at her parents' home when she was binging on cereal!So I thought I'd look over the reviews for fun. Well, now I see that some reviewers don't like her because they think she's snobbish--that she started disliking fat people after she got thin and, heaven forbid, she uses big words. I know that I didn't need a dictionary to read her book, but now I'm dying to go back and look at it again and see just what the reviewers are talking about. Maybe I'll add to this review later on and let you know if I thought that the words were insurmountable.I saved the book, something I don't always do, because I thought that it was very worthwhile. Maybe I'll find that the years have changed me and that I don't enjoy her writing as much as I did the first time. Now I'm going to be honest and say that when I googled her several months ago to see how she was doing that my feelings were mixed. When I saw that she had gained back some of the weight, I felt a bit disappointed for her and yet I felt vindicated??? As someone who has struggled with the more typical 20-30 pounds over the years it's kind of hard sometimes to think about people who lose weight, get to their ideal weight, and then stay there--practicing perfect self-control for the rest of their lives! So I won't say that I was joyful but I felt like saying \\"Join the club.\\" There are so many issues in life that just don't always go away forever as we might like them to do.Update: I've been skimming over the book again and reading my favorite parts. There seem to be more difficult words towards the beginning of the book. Some of them do seem unnecessary. But the author admits that big words are a way for her to feel confident. I didn't take note of the page but at one point she is writing about a person she was meeting with (before she lost the weight). She mentioned that \\"using her big words\\" would be one way of having mastery of the situation. Don't we all have things that make us feel better about ourselves--designer clothing, sculpted figures, advanced education, gourmet cooking...most of us want/need something to brag about unless we're saints. There are opposing viewpoints as to whether a large vocabulary can make writing more precise or just more obscure.The first time I read her book I read quickly for content and didn't give much thought to her wordy prose. I think that she is a skilled writer because she really paints an excellent picture. One of my favorite parts is the dinner for the monsignor where she has to help serve the food and is sneaking bits and pieces into her mouth as she works. Hilarious when she actually grabs the meat before the dog gets it! I could feel everything she was feeling--isolation, resentment (especially when her big brothers visit the kitchen), and the lust for her drug of choice--the food. I was amazed by her ingenious methods for hiding it (gives new meaning to having something up one's sleeve!).Aside from her vocabulary, I took note of the two criticisms that have been mentioned--her nonchalant attitude when bringing up Hiroshima and 9-11. Hiroshima should have been left out completely--it shouldn't have been used in her line about her memorable kiss. I understand her reason for mentioning 9-11. She says that she scurried past the horrendous sights and sounds, noting that she wouldn't have survived had she still been obese. However, she probably shouldn't have brought it up at all if she wasn't going to express any empathy for the victims. It seems that so many authors feel that they must comment on where they were on 9-11.I still say that it's a good book with much to offer on the subject of obesity and how it can be such an isolating experience. Just her experience with her friends when she couldn't ride the roller coaster made us feel her disappointment and humiliation. I'm sorry that my emotions were mixed when I heard about her weight gain. I swear that if I ever hear that she loses the weight again and keeps it off that I will rejoice with her because I know that she isn't happy as a fat person. Oh, regarding her negative feelings about fat people once she'd lost the weight, perhaps she will be more compassionate if she loses the weight again. I know myself from the experience of losing and gaining over and over again that somehow when I'm thin I get that superior feeling. We all have secret feelings occasionally that aren't admirable. I have read many autobiographies and many people won't admit anything the least big negative about themselves. And then there are others who want to confess their crazy ways of thinking. Many of them end up being bashed for it. I rather like honesty. Knowing that others have the same irrational feelings as I do helps me to feel better. Who knows maybe we'll be reading a book of hers one day where she'll be thin again but a friend to all those who need her help."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this writer's emergence from her armor and her victory (I am now advised, temporary) over compulsive eating. A lively voice, an embrace of life, and yet at times I was surprised at how little mention was made of what must have been daily tedium and struggle, although with an amazing payoff in the end. It is good that Kuffel does not treat us to endless self analysis, yet a little here and there might have helped. What impact the adoption? What impact the (apparently mean and bullying) older brother?Saddened to learn this was not to be a long engagement with remaining at the same weight. I have a lot of compassion for people with compulsive eating issues. Unlike booze, smokes, and sex, which you can live without, the body is not going to put up with not eating for too very long. When a huge layer of emotion (and Kuffel correctly noted the sedative effects of certain foods) gets mixed in with an actual (not perceived or learned, even if neurologically reinforced) need, it is uphill.Hats off to her for the work she has done. I remain curious concerning why she thanked Big Pharma in her credits. Also curious as to what her stomach issue really was and what final result with Phen Fen. Just sayin.'"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"What a story!!! It seems all the successful weight loss stories of late are because of serious surgery.....not this gal. Frances Kuffel manages to write not only about obesity, but religion, adoption, siblings, parents, friends, nature, books.....you name it...and all in an entertaing way. I read a lot....really, a lot and this is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Having fought the weight battle most of my life I recognized myself every step of the way. I thought it was fitting that Dr. Pamela Peeke gave a backcover blurb....she of Fight Fat Over Forty. Overeating can be addiction and, as Frances says in her book, one that is very obvious. I was just stunned at her insight, toughness, and humanity. Buy it, now."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel begins her book, &quot;Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self&quot; with descriptions of food she has known and love. She describes her absolute passion for food. The heel of a leftover roast, cracker crumbs, cocktail fruit. She licks and slurps her way through the first few chapters in the book.So its stunning to find that she is able conquer her addiction and lose half of her body weight. Frances joins a 12 step program and commits. This book reveals her journey to weight loss. How she thinks, what she feels in graphic detail. How she wears shorts under her dress because her thighs rub together. How her loose skin can be pulled up and shifted around.The book is not a weight loss book. It gives only a brief glimpse of her weight loss program (3 meals a day no snacks, no sugar, no flour). Yet at the same time its very inspiring.Though I have just a few pounds to lose, as I read the book I realized that if someone had to live by such strict rules to lose weight I sure couldn't complain about giving up desert now and then.The book is beautifully written. Frances is a gifted author. It totally captures her feelings and the way she struggles with her weight. One of the best books I have read in years!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Kuffel is above all a writer, and many times during my reading of this book I stopped and paused over an unusual or perfect turn of phrase, at least as often as I was stopped with discomfiting recognition of her descriptions of life as a fat person. This is not an easy book, or an inspirational rah-rah about How I Lost My Weight, and You Can, Too! It's not a diet book, but the author's alienation and ambivalence will resonate with many people who are or have been obese in a world of normal-sized people.It's not so much the story of how she lost the weight, but of her emotional journey from &quot;Planet Fat&quot;, where she could watch life but was not allowed to participate, to &quot;Planet Girl,&quot; where she arrived at the ripe age of forty-something, with no inoculations and unable to speak the language. This is a funny book sometimes, and often a sad one, but it ends on a note of ambiguous hope. I liked this author's voice, and hope to hear more of it."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I enjoyed this book. As I continue on my weight loss journey, I read and re-read the book when I plateau. I appreciated Frances Kuffel's honesty about how obesity had left its marks on her body and that even with the weight loss she will never be body-beautiful. Especially moving was her honesty about how losing weight didn't solve all her problems as so many of we heavyweights believe deep down."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"...both physically and emotionally.Yes, the author is hard to like at times, but at least it is honest, rather than asugar-coated version of her personality. Personally, I found her to be a bit harsh at times, but I have never been overweight, so I can't judge her too much.The recollections of her childhood and the period before she started her diet were the most interesting and poignant to me. I think a little something was lost towards the end of the book."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Seriously, this is one of the most boring books I've ever read. The author doesn't provide any details about her weight loss journey. That's kind of important because that's the main reason I picked up this book(probably why other people decided to read it too)! Ms. Kuffel's story was not inspiring, humorous or interesting. She's a snob, cold hearted, beyond conceded. Funny thing is, she's ugly; inside and out. I really dislike this woman. She mentions a few times how she hates fat people, um, excuse me? The majority of people who are going to read your book are fat or have been fat! So rude. Also, what's with the overuse of big words? This began to irritate me within the first few chapters. Who does she think she is? What a waste of time. THE WORST BOOK EVER!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I went to get this book after reading a review of it on Salon.com. Unfortunately, I had to ask for help since it was buried in Health & Fitness rather than Biography or Memoir. Once found, however, I discovered Kuffel's account to be both thoughtful and thought provoking.From reading the reviews on this site, I gather that readers were looking for more specific instructions on how to lose weight, but I interpreted Kuffel's message as inspirational rather than instructive--particularly since addiction transcends many categories (food, alcohol, sex, etc).One reader was offended by Kuffel's choice to sponsor somebody she found \\"pretty\\" rather than \\"drab\\"--but I also saw this differently. I thought she simply chose somebody she felt had potential because she saw some of herself in her.One last thing: Kuffel says she would have been prepared for heartbreak had she experienced it for the first time at 16 rather than 43. However, despite having experienced it in both my teens and twenties, I've found it knocks me on my bum each time!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book caught my eye while I was browsing in my local library. Having had a weight problem all my life, and just recently been in a position to say I was possibly winning said battle, it was really as if she'd written it just for me. I had lost over one hundred pounds, but was having trouble adjusting to the 'new' me. \\"Passing for Thin\\" helped me personally with my journey, and was, in addition well written and a pleasure to read.I would suggest it to anybody who needed to either support a loved one in a battle with weight, or someone who was fighting the battle themselves."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"All the previous reviews that point out Ms. Kuffel's self-absorbtion seem accurate. But this is how it seemed to me: she was being brutally honest.This candor is what appealed to me. It's really the selling point of OA: being able to be yourself without being judged about it. She had to adjust to being a different person after being obese her entire life and it would take a period of self-absorbtion to orient.Her story inspired me and made me admire her for baring all. We all have our \\"dark sides\\" and I, for one, am tired of always hiding my eating disorder around people who don't have eating disorders and don't understand. It's great to be frank at the meetings. That's the feeling I got from Frances K. in her book--it was brutally honest."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I am very interested in this topic because, although I have never been as obese as the author, I have had a weight problem (25-50 lbs overweight) for much of my life and like the author's it has some emotional roots. I applaud the author's honesty and relate to much of what she is saying, but like many of the other reviewers I found a lot of gaps in the story and thought it was not well-written. I would be willing to ascribe the lack of written clarity to the fact that the topic is so highly personal, some aspects of it might be difficult to express, but I found it interesting that the author is developing a website offering her services as a \\"writing coach\\" when it would appear she has only published one book of average writing on a highly personal topic.I can relate to many of the author's struggles and feelings but I wish she had written more about her day-to-day weight loss experience, published details of the diet, support organizations, and so forth so that readers who felt inspired would have more \\"takeaways\\". Also, Ms. Kuffel needs to come more to grips with the fact that her feelings about fat people appear to be profoundly negative. She even acknowledges that there are fat women who are sensual, comfortable in their own bodies and have lovers, but at the same time she seems to dislike them even though they are reasonably happy with themselves. It is fine to lose weight because you think that is a good choice for you or because you have gained so much that it is adversely affecting your health and your life, but at the same time you need to accept that others might choose to live their lives differently. And, it is not a given that just because a woman is overweight, she is automatically out of touch with the feminine side of herself, or that getting in touch with her \\"girl-ness\\" is a big priority for everybody on a weight loss journey."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Most obese women think, \\"If I lost weight, I would be happy.\\" Frances Kuffel's book shows that it's just not that simple.Prejudice against fat is so deep and so far-reaching that it marginalizes the obese. It cripples emotional and social development. In this book, Frances Kuffel tells the truth about what it's like to be obese from childhood. She tells the truth about losing 170 pounds (did you hear me? she lost 170 pounds) at age 41. She found that her old clothes didn't fit (good) but neither did her old personality (surprise). When she reached size 10, Kuffel had to dismantle her identity and build another. She turned inward to discover why.Like many obese women, Kuffel had internalized society's disapproval. She didn't like herself or other obese women.Have you ever noticed another woman giving you the once-over in the street, and glowed because you knew she was jealous? Kuffel experienced that for the first time in her life at the age of 41. For that matter, she became visible for the first time at the age of 41. This is serious culture shock.Kuffel calls it different planets. The Planet of Girl, for example, is where she learned, at 41, what other women learned when they were girls - nails, eyebrows, hair, the whole Barbie trip. Obese girls don't learn these things. They're irrelevant. Equally irrelevant are the things that girls learn about boys - how to date, how to kiss. This, too, she had to learn.For the obese, successful weight loss means total rehab. It could begin with what Kuffel would say to the obese: \\"It's not your fault.\\" This book could be a first step for individuals and for society as a whole. It is well-written, the characters are vivid, and it makes a good read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I purchased this book shortly after it was published. I read a review of the book in the magazine \\"O\\" and could not wait to read it. I ordered it immediately and did not lay it down till I was finished...two days later (I did have to work!). If you have ever been overweight, and I have and am, there are few things that she says that you cannot relate to in some form. As I read it, I found that while the content of the story belongs to Frances and her journey, the context was mine. She told parts of my story and, I imagine, parts of others' struggles with weight/body image /anger issues.Frances did a brave thing in telling \\"our\\" story. It also took insight and a level of vulnerability that few of us are willing to share with our best friend, much less the world. When you peel away the hype from people like Dr. Phil and the mountains of \\"how-to\\" books on weight loss/fitness that line the shelves of bookstores, you find way down deep, in the dark corners of our minds and hearts, a level of pain and frailty that few of us are even aware of, much less have the skill or sensitivity to speak about in a real way. This is what Frances Koffel does in Passing for Thin.This book is not about the \\"how-to\\" of what she did. It is about the experience, the journey she walked. If you are dealing with your weight at the level of \\"do\\" then this is not the book for you. But when you get ready to look at the issues of body image, fear, anger and the tangled web of emotions that are underneath the issues of obesity, then you will be ready to hear what Frances says. This is a book about being. She writes sensitively, caringly and graciously. It is gracious that she would allow us access into the intimate world of her thoughts, to know the struggle and success of her experience of shifting her mind and her life along with her decreased body size. It is a rare gift to be able to write with such honesty and clarity.I have read it twice. I have given it to a few of my friends who, too, struggle as I do with body image issues. It is an emotional read, and a significant gift. It is not like anything else you will find on the topic. It is honest, real and relevant.Thank you, Frances.Helen Gordon Raleigh, NC"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I've read several books about eating disorders and other compulsions. Although I have never read any others about severe obesity, this one intested me because it was about an obese woman rather than an anorexic. At first glance, the writing seemed good and the author seemed honest. I don't question the author's brutal honesty. And she is certainly articulate, if a bit wordy. But I don't like HER. The more I read, the less I liked her. It was interesting to know the downside of severe obesity, both physically and mentally. But the woman (who calls herself \\"a girl\\" despite being in her forties)is totally preoccupied with herself throughout. She wallows in her misery as a fat person. She admits to not liking other fat people. She doesn't try very hard to help anyone else and agrees to sponsor someone else only at the insistence of her sponsor and OA friends. She worships physical beauty and fashion to an unhealthy degree. She expects far too much from dating and the world of men in general. She's emotionally delayed (probably due to the years of addiction)when it comes to social interactions including the give and take of friendship and romantic relationships.I wondered about what brought her to that state of severe obesity. She glosses over the reasons and I'm guessing that it had something to do with being adopted and with childhood experiences. However, her adoptive parents sounded really nice and her childhood seemed comfortable and relatively happy. Of course, she seems to blame God and religion for much of her life.Well, she's sort of thin now or at least within normal range. She'll continue to struggle with the man/woman relationship thing, like everyone else in the world. I hope that she stops calling men \\"boys\\" by the time she hits 50. I also hope that she continues therapy and keeps the weight off.I really did not get the ending where she \\"finds herself.\\" I reread those last pages and did not understand about her and food versus her and life. It seemed like an excuse for not remaining abstinent. I was hoping that Katie, the sponsor, would drop her.Perhaps Montana is where she should be.Debra Dycaico, San Diego, California"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book was an enjoyable read. I agree with other reviewers that there were some sections in which Frances comes off as narcissistic and unkind...but I didn't feel they detracted from the story or made her hard to like. I think anyone who has lost such a huge amount of weight would understandably be narcissistic...perhaps for the first time in her life, she had reason to be! The book made me laugh, and made me think about how much harder life is for obese people...I loved how surprised she was that she could buy underwear at Rite Aid after a lifetime of buying from Lane Bryant. A great summer read!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I could relate to Frances because I have spent many years obese. I realize many people didn't like this book. I wonder if I like it so much because I've recently lost 70 pounds.I am now a different person on the outside...but inside, it's still me. People treat me differently though, just like they did Frances. It does mess with your mind. Let's face it, in our society, fat=lazy and/or bad. Our world is filled with hate towards fat people.Frances underwent huge changes--physically, emotionally. Her story helped me and it opened my eyes. I appreciated her honesty, which at times was immature, but to be expected. She was going through life changes one normally has happen to them in their teens and twenties. I appreciated her courage and I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Note to readers: this is not a how-to! Don't expect a lesson in how to lose 170 pounds.What Frances Kuffel does here is document a lifetime of emotions (and emotional damage) that accompany HER weight (and weight loss). I've struggled with my weight since my early teens (although not to the same extreme as she) and there's a lot of truth in this book. The compulsiveness, the anger, the disappointment, her flip responses when she is excluded from things because of her obesity. I think the prose reads fine: maybe what's more unpalatable to some readers is her me-me-meism. But put it in context: she obviously has more going on in her life than a weight problem (meds for depression, family issues - note the very abrupt reference to her oldest brother's death, ongoing health concerns) and she reads as someone who is emotionally immature and still finding her way. One reviewer complains she isn't always kind to other obese people. Unfortunately, that is sometimes a normal side effect of weight loss. Go on any weight loss message board and you will find people just like her. We want to grab and shake anyone we see who has a weight problem and is eating Ding-Dongs, Fritos and a Coke for lunch.Ms. Kuffel could have chosen to tell a very slick, Disneyfied story about losing an incredible amount of weight (anyone who's never dieted has no IDEA what kind of discipline she had to have to pull that off) but she chose to tell the truth, warts and all. There's a sweetness and humanity here as well as a heaping helping of ugliness. I see a lot of what she says as internal dialogue, so I doubt she was as unpleasant a person as some other reviewers have suggested. True, there are some weird moments (her miscarriage/breakup metaphor and brief reference to 9/11) but the flaws in this book only add to the too-human picture of Francie.If you go in without expectations and do some in-between-the-lines reading, there's a lot here, especially for people who have struggled and continue to struggle with their weight. If you've been there, this book makes some sense. If you haven't, it probably won't touch you."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This unflinchingly honest memoir has left an indelible footprint on my soul. Unlike some other reviewers, I really liked Frances. I enjoy reading her blogs and I so appreciate her for taking the time to write them. So often, I become intrigued about a person I read about, and think, \\"I wonder what ever happened to her...\\" With Frances, I get to know.Frances seems like a friend, one of those people that make me muse, \\"I wish I lived closer to Brooklyn, I'd like to grab a cup of coffee with her and let our dogs play in the park.\\" I wonder if the people who said unflattering things about Frances would ever have the courage to not only face their own demons, but open their closet of shame to the world and let everyone get a good gander at their personal beasties? Because of this book, I went back to a 12 step program I had written off long ago. At the time, I was not ready to do the fearless and searching moral inventory necessary. Frances' honesty inspired me and gave me the courage to try again. Who knows, after a lifetime of morbid obesity, she may have had a part in saving my life. Already 50 pounds are gone (where does it go? where??) and I am abstinent and on the road to sanity. Thank you, Frances."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Like many other reviewers, I thought this book would be a how-I-lost-the-weight memoir. It isn't. Frances Kuffel examines instead her attitudes toward herself and others as she loses the weight, and how those attitudes shift, but don't really change, after she loses the weight. She realizes that the one thing she thought would make her happy -- being thin -- is really only the start. The whole self needs to be examined for true happiness to reside there. I think that at the writing of the book, Ms. Kuffel was part way there -- realizing, for instance, that she has to love herself as well as others -- but she clearly still has a way to go.As other reviewers have observed, Ms. Kuffel is not the most sympathetic character. She looks down on others, but it's just a function of how she's looked down on herself all her life. She's vain, but you try to be humble when you're a Size 10 for the first time in your life! She doesn't know how to be with people, but it's partly because she'd been hiding behind her weight. I think she'll get there, but what we read about in her memoir is a work in progress, with all the faults of a sad character. I think Frances Kuffel was very brave to write such an unsparing memoir, and I hope it helps her as she continues her path to self-awareness."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"An eye-opening memoir by a woman who lived almost her whole life being morbidly obese. Somewhere in the first quarter of the book, she joins a 12-step program for overeaters and begins to shed what will ultimately total up to half her weight.It's not just the story of weight loss, it's a rebirth, or a first birth at the age of 40-something. If you think about it, going from being over three hundred pounds most of your adult life to 168 pounds is a drastic change, not only in size, but perceptions. Everything was different for her. Things became possible that she didn't think ever WOULD be, like walking 12 blocks, working out, crossing her legs. It's the little things that surprised me most about this book. If you're looking for a talk-show makeover type-story, pass this one by, because you'll be disappointed. But if you read it for what it is- the metamorphosis of an obese woman into the healthy her and all the quirks, foibles and mysteries she encounters in her smaller size, you'll find a gem. Kuffel writes with a very gentle tone, a bit self-concious, as though she's testing the literary waters. I hope to see more from her in the future."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read the sequel to this book first, not realizing there were two books, so I knew what happened before I read it. I actually loved this book. I thought the author was scrupulously honest with her feelings. Her description of her eating binges as a child show that she was very much a food addict from as far back as she can remember. The only thing she doesn't really address is why all of a sudden she was able to stay on a diet, after failing for so many years. That was a little unclear to me. Anyone who has been morbidly obese and then gets thin would naturally be excited about clothes and about being able to do new things. I thought her descriptions were all part of the process she went through. However, as soon as I read the kind of diet she was on, I knew she would never keep it off. Nobody can sustain such rigid eating habits forever, so she was bound to gain some of it back. I've been thin and I've been obese and I've been in-between, and the one thing I've learned is that fad diets don't work. If Frances manages to get back on track and re-lose her weight, she needs to re-think her diet. What I also find interesting is that Frances never seems happy. She was miserable being fat, but she seems miserable thin. It seemed to me that when she lost her weight, it took away her big purpose in life. Lots of emotions going on and until she figures them out, she's never going to get thin and stay there. I was frustrated about the hanging skin, too. Instead of her being happy at getting into a size 10, she's complaining about the skin. There are surgeries that take care of that, if she's so upset about it! I don't know, books 1 and 2 show a woman who really doesn't like herself very much."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book was great. Whether you are heavy, thin, loosing weight or already there you can relate. I laughed and cried and saw so much of myself in this story. I am in the middle of losing weight and found it so motivating and true to life."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I love this book. Every time I get discouraged when I'm trying to lose weight, I pull this book back out and it really helps me."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I originally found out about this book on a community that discusses the topic of obesity. I decided to purchase it to read the psychological impact that extreme weightloss has on the self. I have to admit, I'm about 20-40 pages away from finishing the book at the moment; but I have formulated a strong opinion already.1. My first qualm is that she does not focus on how she lost the weight. She does not even describe the difficulty physically and mentally about her weightloss. She just states that it was extreme dieting (cutting out sugar) and then fastforwards to how she felt subsequently after. My question is, how is this book supposed to be \\"inspiring\\" as it claims to be on the back if she does not even talk about her struggles in detail to achieve her weight. I can understand that it's not a book on how to diet, and that the emphasis is on how she felt about herself after, but I just feel that she could have spent more time talking about it than she did.2. It's honestly not well written at all, which suprises me because she supposedly has a Bachelor's and Master's Degree, both programs which involve clear, concise, and intensive writing. Her thoughts are not clearly organized, they jump from one to the other in a rapid fashion.3. Once again, the lack of detail in this memoir. The fact she mentions her older brother that was mean to her died, but does not explain. The fact that she does not explain the reactions that other people gave her in her diet group when she did gain 25 pounds again. She does not even explain her issues with dating or her history of dating in a clear fashion. Instead she focuses on insignificant details too much.4. She just clearly has issues, and since I'm not finished yet I'm not sure if she actually resolves them or not. I don't understand why she had to make it so hard on herself when she clearly had a great support system. If I was 330 lbs, and then I lost half of my bodyweight in a healthy fashion like she did, then I would feel pretty damn good about it. I mean, she attends therapy but it clearly does not help her. This doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the review of the book, but it just irks me and limited my enjoyment of the book.I was just expecting so much more from this book. I wanted to be wowed, I wanted to feel her agony in a much broader scale than presented. I understand the fact she's not a a novelist or whatever, but this book has dissapointed me to a great extent and since I'm so opinionated I really hope she does not have her email address listed anywhere on the internet because I will feel the need to ask more questions."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"While many things about this book are good, it seems to go wrong when, basically, Frances loses weight. I'm struggling with my weight and was startled to find how much I could find myself empathizing with much of Frances' problems when she was overweight. One of the things that bothered and disturbed me the most, however, was when she lost her weight and essentially thrived and wallowed in a personality of shallowness and triteness. For someone who was overweight I was incredibly unnerved by her own lack of empathy of others who were overweight, and further more by the level of importance she allows herself to put on appearance and looking 'beautiful'. I think it's great she lost the weight: But Frances Kuffle is, on the inside, very far from a beautiful person. I loved the first half of this book and found myself increasingly disappointed by it as I read on, which it inself was a disappointment as well."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read this novel in 2 days. Kuffel, at age 42, weighed 313 pounds. After joining a 12-step program, she lost 188 pounds.Kuffel begins by explaining what her life was like at 300+ pounds. I recognized so many of my own thoughts and feelings in what she said.As other reviewers have noted, once Kuffel joins the program, she seems to lose her weight over a few pages. There's barely anything of the struggle to get started and stay on her program. She seems to move right into being thin and adjusting to her new life. That's the only disappointment here for me. I would have liked to hear more about what she did, how she felt while she lost weight, etc.Despite it's shortcomings, I would recommend this to anyone. She has a wonderful sense of humor, and is a great storyteller."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book could have used a patient and nurturing editor. There were some sections which were vividly written (Frances' days on \\"Planet Fat\\") and other parts (the \\"work\\" of OA) which seemed to be hastily written. And, to discuss the weight loss rather than the book, I would speculate that one reason Frances has difficulty maintaining a healthier weight is that she may have something of an addiction to her prior identity as a \\"Fat Girl.\\"All this aside, I read this book as more than just one woman's journey from Planet Fat to the land of the average bodied. What I looked at was how someone was able to change their identity...or at least, work on changing their identity. In the author's case, she found the support to do so in the community of OA, in carefully and consciously restructuring her environment (the weighing and measuring of food, the daily calls). She then found that when she achieved her goal, there was still more work to be done...learning how to dress, relate, handle social rejection, to assimilate herself in middle age to the average sized world with its own issues and problems."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel has written a book about the travails of her monumental weight loss in a manner and style that makes it appealing to ANYONE. As someone who has never had weight issues, I was riveted by Frances' story. It is a human story. It is a funny story. It has all the bumps and boils and wrong turns of real life. This is not a Hollywood story starring Gwyneth in a &quot;fat suit.&quot;. This is something Sofia Coppola would be lucky to get her hands on.In summary, Passing for Thin is a straight-shooting, funny, sometimes heartbreaking memoir that will be enjoyed by anyone who can handle wry, self-deprecating, honest, unapologetic prose that often approaches poetry.I enjoyed every word. I can't wait to see what she comes out with next. She is a talent that has yet to truly reap the rewards of her honest-to-goodness gift."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I had preordered this book after reading an excerpt in &quot;O&quot; (which for some reason, I am loathe to admit!) This is such an important book for so many reasons. It is an extremely well written, enjoyable journey into one woman's lifelong struggle with weight and her journey past the weight into a &quot;normal&quot; life. I appreciated her honesty regarding the struggles after weight loss as much as her honesty during weight loss. I'd recommend this not only to people who are embarking on, or who have completed, their weight loss journey... but to the friends, parents, physicians, and coworkers of fat people.Showing myself to be the lifelong dieter that I am... am I the only one who scoured the pages looking for &quot;the magic bullet&quot;? LOL. I have an idea to the diet having been to OA a few times in the past... but I know that it takes a lot more than a diet to overcome food addiction.Buy this book! It's one of those wonderfully well written books that are such a treat to read, yet end all to soon."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I have read several weight loss stories and this book was THE WORST! Most readers buy weight loss stories/books for encouragement and motivation..this book does neither. Ms. Kuffel starts the book in diary form telling of her feelings during her prior fat and boring life. Then she finds a support group (no detail), and voila, she's 168 lbs. She did not even cover ONE DAY on her diet...what foods she ate, her menu, her thoughts or tactics to keep her from straying, etc.. She did not divulge anything!! All she said was to \\"abstain from sugar & flour\\". To be honest, I was quite pee'd off. This book left me empty-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you'd like a couple great weight loss (motivational) books, I recommend \\"The Incredible Shrinking Critic\\" by Jami Bernard or \\"The Weight Loss Diaries\\" by Courtney Rubin. They are honest, funny and offer motivational insight."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book was incredible -- not necessarily politically correct, but a real, unvarnished, we-all-have-warts look at one woman's story.I am, however, stunned by some of the reviews of this book that are not, in fact, reviews, but are instead vicious, hateful attacks against Frances Kuffel. The depth to which these particular reviewers sink in their attacks might cause one to question their motivation; serious consideration of their own weight-related issues and prejudices may be warranted.I urge anyone contemplating the purchase of this book to do so; if you find the subject interesting, I don't think you can find a better work than this.Congratulations, Frances -- on every front."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I am so sorry I spent my money on this book! While Frances can be commended for her strength to lose the weight, she should have spent all the time and effort changing herself on the inside instead. She repeatedly treats others horribly; she's only interested in people for what they can do for her. The only time she helps someone else is when she feels obligated because she &quot;owes them&quot;. The author seems to think that since she had a hard time for so much of her life, she now deserves whatever she wants whether it means walking all over someone else. Does she not understand that everyone's life is hard in some way? That thin people have problems too?I was disgusted when I read her take on 9/11. She talked about dodging people falling from the World Trade Center the way most people ask to pass the salt. She expressed no sympathy for the victims and their families...she was too busy talking about the Gap and her lunch date. It would have been better for her not to bring up 9/11 at all.I finally threw this book down and vowed not to read another word of her drivel, when she proceeded to compare being dumped by her first boyfriend to having a miscarriage or the death of an infant. Is this women high? Are you kidding me? I know first loves hurt, but to compare it to the loss of a child is unbelievable. It is one of the coldest, most insensitive things I have ever heard.The only thing that made me feel good about this book was throwing it in the trash."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I too could not put this book down, and read it in 3 short evenings. What was genuine was the checkered voyage of self-discovery she encountered as she went from 300+ to 150-. Her storytelling was engaging and I truly felt like I was in the bat cave with her at times.What was off-putting in the novel was her unabashed meanness towards herself, her family and others. When her dates would compliment her and say she was nice, I, as a reader, didn't agree. One would have hoped having walked in &quot;fatty&quot; shoes herself, that she would be more sympathetic towards others struggling to accomplish what she had. Instead, I found her judgements of those starting their journey appalling.Frances may be beautiful and thin on the outside, but there's something still quite ugly on the inside. I give her credit for being brutally honest about her feelings, but I hope in retrospect, it helped her heal and find compassion for others."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"As a person on the path to weight loss, &quot;Passing For Thin&quot; piqued my interest because it told the story of the journey within. This is not a diet book.Kuffel's story begins when she realizes that she is a food addict. She joins O.A. and loses over 150 lbs. She is no longer the Fat Girl, who is insulated by her fat, who is treated differently, who could coast through life insulated from pain. She reveals that she is a beautiful woman with great legs, desirable to men and striking to women. And it scares the heck out of her. She struggles with this new role and is unsure of who she is and how to live. Her journey is facsinating, revealing and at times down-right frightening.Kuffel is a wonderful writer with a gift of storytelling.I recommend this book to those on the weight loss journey because it shows there is more to it besides a thin body. You won't be &quot;instantly&quot; happy. You have to work hard on different fronts: body, mind and spirit. And Kuffel shows it can be done."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel had been fat for as long as she can remember. Food was the ultimate comfort for anything that went wrong in her life - especially for the way her own weight had limited her. Then one day she has an eiphany &realizes; that she essentially shares her problem with her alcoholic friend - she is adicted to food, and in order to take control of her life she would have to resolve her addiction.She joins a group she doesn't mention by name but seems to be overeaters annonymous or a similar group, and voila - a few pages later she is thinnish at 168 lbs. & wearing size 10 designer clothes. But even though she is chronologically in her early forties - in some ways she is as naive and unexperienced as a teenager, since she had not experienced many aspects of a typical woman's life, such as relationships or shopping for clothes.In some ways, Kuffel's brutal honesty is disturbing. She obviously puts a lot of emphasis on her post diet looks, clothes, and how pretty she is - which doesn't portray her as a sympathetic person. But these thoughts are understandable with Kuffel's background - doesn't she deserve to enjoy her relative good looks after spending most of her life as obese & an outcast?What I had a hard time understanding was the the disdain Kuffel shows toward other overweight people, especially after being one herself for so long (and also gaining some of the weight back). It's as though only pretty people matter, and anyone who dares to accept their body when it's not as thin as possible is simply crazy."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"After reading about this book in the O magazine, I devoured it (hmmm...interesting choice of verb), reading it in a bookstore over a week. Months later when it came out in softcover, I bought my own copy.Frances obviously still struggles with her disease, and yes, I would like to know more about the abusive older brother, and sometimes I get frustrated at the occasional pettiness and that interesting dichotomy of narcissism and desperation. But I greatly identify with it, and her description of the sensual allure of food to deal with her psychological pain is chillingly close to my own. Like her, I have lost half my body weight while a member of a 12 step program. Like her, I continue to struggle with my mental anguish and pain that continually threatens to suck me back into my obsession/addiction. I applaud her bravery in showing herself to us with flaws, not airbrushed out like most diet/lifestyle polemics dominating the bookshelves."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"On the whole, I found this book helpful because it pointed out things to me that I hadn't seen framed that way before. Ms. Kuffel's writing style really bugged me in the first third of the book...it seemed like she was working overtime to impress us with her vocabulary...but once I got pulled into her story, this element of her writing no longer jumped out at me.As much as I appreciated how difficult it had to be to be so honest and forthright about telling her story, the book had a rather schizophrenic and inconsistent property to it. Some things are explored in tremendous detail and some are glossed over entirely. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, but I am still appreciative of the issues that she DID explore.While I could not relate to the aspects of the book that dealt with Frances' binge eating issues, I could definitely relate to having a weight problem much of one's life and the way people discount you when you're fat. Her concept of how people pigeon-hole you as \\"the fat one\\" and then don't know how to relate when you're no longer fat was really an eye-opener.I'm glad I read the book, but I wish it had been more consistent and left less things unsaid."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I was a little taken aback at some of the reviews of this book. What I liked about it is the insight it gave me into the world of someone very overweight--how distorted her world was, and the difficulty she had, after losing the weight, of really understanding and believing that she was an attractive, desireable woman. I've never had a weight problem and so the book opened my eyes to a new reality.Isn't that what a good book is supposed to do? Surely there is more than enough written already about how to lose weight. That would not have kept my interest; this book I read in an afternoon."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This is a beautifully written book about a life, and not just a memoir about weight loss. I related to this book on many levels and managed to read it in one day. Though I wish there was even more detail, I was grateful for what I did read. Any woman (and many men) will relate to the personal details of this life and the triumph over a personal demon. Kuffel is very revealing about her life and what she struggled to overcome."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Francis Kuffel has written a beautiful, fascinating memoir of self-discovery focusing on her journey through life as a fat girl and then a fat woman, then the transformation into a slender woman.Particularly wrenching are her memories of her childhood spent poaching as much food as possible from the household larder without being disovered and her interactions with an older brother's cruelty. Her observation that one may have fed (no pun intended) the other is keen, especially since she observes that it's unclear which did the feeding.Kuffel's writing is occasionally forced into a false sounding stylization. Other than this minor criticism, the book is easy to recommend to anyone interested in a tale of personal transformation, both physical and emotional."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I had seen an article about Ms.Kuffel's book in a magazine and looked forward to it. Unfortunately it was a great disappointment. Most people who read books of this genre are looking for inspiration in their own struggles with weight. The day to day ups and downs and pictures of the newly tranformed formerly obese person are typically provided. Ms. Kuffel, so full of herself and her newfound \\"beauty\\" (and she is only ordinary) provides only one picture of herself post weight loss. Had I not seen the magazine article which did show her while still overweight, frankly, I would have thought this story to be fiction. Instead of finding inspiration in the struggles of her weight loss we are treated to endless pages of whining about her youth and, worse yet, page after page of her insipid romatic tribulations. While I hold books to be almost sacred and donate those I no longer have need of, I placed Ms. Kuffel's in a tidy black trash bag. No one should have to endure more of her narcicistic drivel."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This is a great book. Frances Kuffel bares her soul and hits the nail on the head describing the sadness and shame of obesity. She also reveals her charm and uniqueness that reminds us of the value of each soul. She did it - she lost the weight and has kept it off. It doesn't change the journey of the lessons of life, but it makes it much easier to move and breath, and be acceptable to society. Parts of this book made me laugh, and parts made me cry. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffler's first book \\"Passing for Thin\\" is much more than a \\"memoir.\\" It's a funny, absorbing, intelligent personal journey of a witty woman through her weight loss. I am not interested in dieting and am of a different age group from Ms. Kuffel, so I didn't expect to find enlightenment in this book. But her observations of others' reactions to her weight loss (\\"As I circled in on thin, I was changing the status quo\\") are--surprising. I never thought I classified people into \\"pretty\\" and \\"fat\\" and \\"dorky\\" and \\"smart,\\" but come to think of it, I do, and I'm trying to stop. There's something for everyone in \\"Passing for Thin.\\""},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I bought \\"Passing for Thin\\" after reading an excerpt from it in Oprah Winfrey's magazine. In a society when any woman's worth is based on what she looks like and how much she weighs, Frances' brutal honesty about herself, her relationship with food, and the fact that there was no fairytale happy ending (even after losing 177 pounds,) guaranteed a book I couldn't put down till I finished it.I realize that there are other reviewers here who have mentioned their disappointment that there was no food plan outlined in the book, and that there was little description of the year-long weight loss. Any reader wanting to travel the same path will get themselves to a local OA meeting. I'm sure the food plan is available there, as is support.I am grateful to the woman Frances mentions in the acknowledgements who encouraged her to write her book. She will help more people with her story -- warts and all -- than she will ever know."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Yes, this was a fast short read. I too read it in two days. I loved it and I cried through half of it. It was incredibly honest and brave. I plan on keeping it on my shelf forever and rereading it for inspiration. I plan on getting my friends to read it. I know other reviewers have commented on her mean-spiritedness towards other people who have weight issues, but that is a reflection of her own self-hatred and fear. I understand that only too well. I think the language she uses is very specific to her personality and the fact that she is a literary agent. It gives insight to her life and shows how being smart was what she hid behind all her life, her sinecure. I understand that as well. Losing weight is scary. Writing about your life is scary. Change is scary. I applaud her and her book especially because she has put herself out there to the critical masses who play a specific role in food addiction."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I bought this after reading the excerpt in &quot;O&quot;. I put the Davinci Code on the sideline as I found this book more interesting. Frances Kuffel is a gifted writer, telling many sides of weight loss and about being a member &quot;on the Planet of Fat&quot;. I was startled to see myself in these pages from time to time. My only dissapointment was that she never gives the diet plan that she followed. Perhaps that is to veer away from a self help genre or maybe to inspire us to seek out a meeting to get it for ourselves. What ever her reason for ommiting it, I still so enjoyed this book and her story. I simply could not put it down."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I'm glad she finally found some degree of self-fulfillment, but there are better ways to learn to like yourself than losing 150 pounds. My concern is that this book perpetuates the myth that thin=happiness and fat people are emotionally disturbed in some way. Definitely there are a lot of people who have emotional issues that affect their eating habits, but often the cure is to work on the emotional issues instead of another diet. If your happiness is contingent on your weight, it's likely that you'll never really be satisfied. If this book does anything good, it is in showing that that losing weight will not make your problems go away."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book reads like a long letter from a dear friend, full of wit and occasional asides. Its not a diet book, never set itslef up as such, but rather a diary of a personal journey of discovery of oneself. The courage it takes to keep on going, to see the incremental results, to keep focused, and then open yourself up to the world is monumental. However, the journey didn't stop with the final few pounds, yet it merely took on a whole new set of rules - the rules of dating and of men are priceless. This book is an enjoyable read for all, as everyone can relate to dealing with their own personal goblins.Well done - I await the sequel...................."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel does a wonderful job explaining her past, present, and future in her book.

She doesn't hold back, and her writing style is unique and is filled with humor!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Frances Kuffel might be telling my story in a lot of ways. It is refershing to read an account of self discovery that is so real and visceral. No sugar coated, saccarine sweet platitudes here. Those of us who go to the &quot;Rooms&quot; for recovery from compulsive overeating know the joys and terrors of figuring out who we really are and how to be, at long last, functioning adults. Ms Kuffel tells it like it is in an interesting and entertaining fashion. She also has a gift for the descriptive that made me recall clearly shopping in the Missoula Mercantile with my grandmother when I was a kid!! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Very frank.Great insight into her personal journey of weight loss and finding love and acceptance. Great read!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"As the obesity epidemic grows, and overweight individuals are saturated with the latest diet and weight loss schemes, Frances Kuffel shows that massive weight loss is indeed possible without resorting to gastric bypass surgery. Her adherence to a 12-step program enabled her to lose over 170 lbs. and change her relationship to food. What stood out most for me was her search to find out what it means to be \\"a girl\\" having felt like an asexual, amorphous individual for most of her life. By studying what women wear, do and say, especially around the opposite sex, she seeks to educate herself on everything that she missed by being morbidly obese for most of her life. Hers is a heart-warming, inspirational journey that anyone who has been or still is overweight will identify with."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book hits home to anyone that has an eating/weight problem. Her struggle with weight/weight loss/keeping weight off will hit home with many readers. After living years with an imagine of yourself - do you ever think of yourself any other way? I think she explores that issue. This book is NOT about the method used to lose weight but ONE persons journey in finding herself. In some ways it was like reading someone's journal.To Francis Kuffel: Great first book - congrats on hitting that goal too."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read an excerpt of Frances Kuffel's story in \\"Oprah\\" and immediately bought the book. Kuffel's wry and witty writing style resulted in a balance between self-pity and selp-realization that I found profoundly touching and devastatingly honest. I found myself laughing with tears in my eyes more than once. Her journey sure struck familiar chords with me. I never had to lose 180 pounds but I did lose 50 lbs. and keep it off with Weight Watchers. I really appreciated this unflinching confrontation with the reality of living with a food addiction. Although some may disagree, on one level it doesn't matter if one is 20 lbs. overweight or 200 lbs. overweight, the daily struggle is the same. I have gained some new understandings of what drives me to eat. Thanks to Frances Kuffel for telling us her story. I'd love to be her friend."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"It's a rare book that can hold my attention all night long, but this one did. I *wanted* to know what happened next, what did she do, what did they say. And the writing is sooooooo good! Frances Kuffel knows how to put words together.

Then there was thin Frances. Everyone talks about the meanness but what about the pretentiousness! She's so snobby about who she will and won't date! And she does become obssessed with what she looks like, but maybe that's just a side effect of the rapid weight loss (hopefully). Yeah, the date on September 12 2001 was a bit much. I didn't know my name on 9/12 and she's juggling a full social calendar. She must have lost some caring cells in addition to the fat cells on the diet. And she could have been more feminine if she wanted to when she was fat. She seemed to me like a woman blaming all her problems on her weight when really the problems were within her self confidence--and being thin did not solve them. They created a new problem...having such a fragile self image that you try to pump it up by putting others down. And I did not have to hear about the 15 pounds of hanging skin on her body. Yuk!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Transplanted Montanan to NYC Literary Agent, self- described \\"Pillsbury Dough Girl,\\" Frances Kuffel had 3 dreams: to be thin, to write and publish a book, and to get married and live happily ever after. Well, as Meatloaf sings: \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad.\\"This book diaries Fran's journey from The Planet of Fat to The Planet of Girls. Extremely heavy her entire life, she has to learn a whole new set of Rules, Couture, and Ways of Being on the New Planet.

I would recommend it for parents of children who have fallen into our obese society of &quot;Fat Americans&quot;, but I would be appalled if they felt it was good literature...Frances should be proud of her accomplishments, but should hone her skills at writing. Communication is not her forte. I saw her on the Today Show and bought the book because of curiosity on eating disorders in general - I am a recovered anorexic.

Fox news comes to mind!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I thought I was going to like both this memoir and its author, but I came away feeling ambivalent about both. (I read about Frances Kuffel in a magazine, and got the impression that her book would be well worth reading, but I did not find that to be the case.)What put me off the most about Passing for Thin was that, despite having once been fat herself, Kuffel seems devoid of empathy for those who are still fat. She refers to a woman in her OA program as a \\"fatty\\" and to her lover's obese son as \\"Dudley Dursley\\". (Harry Potter's cousin.) This might be an apt comparison in that Dudley Dursley is indeed obese, but he is also mean, petty and spoiled rotten, so it seems more than a little unkind of Kuffel to mention this particular fictional character when writing about her lover's son.Having lost half her weight, Kuffel now seems as contemptuous of the obese as the people who used to give her \\"appalled second glances\\" when she herself was obese.I was also put off by Kuffel's relentless narcissism. It's very peculiar that she would choose Janeane Garofalo as a role model, because as far as I can tell, these women have very little in common. Garofalo has been quoted as saying (about a time in her life when she lost a lot of weight in the hope that it would help her land more parts) she hates the vanity that goes with being thin. Kuffel, on the other hand, seems to embrace this kind of vanity, going on and on about various aspects of her appearance. (I watch What Not to Wear and buy fashion magazines from time to time, so the fact that even I was bored by the endless descriptions of Kuffel's various outfits is saying a lot.) It also doesn't seem to occur to Kuffel that, having been supported and encouraged by various OA members for quite some time, she ought to start thinking about supporting other members in return. It is only after her sponsor gently suggests that she should \\"pay attention to something besides what you look like\\" and recommends that she volunteers to sponsor someone, that she even considers doing so. And the woman Kuffel ends up sponsoring is chosen because she is \\"prettier\\" than all the other OA members in need of a sponsor. Where is it written that if you are the proud owner of a pretty face, you are by definition a fascinating creature and deserving of all the help you can get, whereas if you look like what Kuffel calls a \\"Drab\\", then you must surely be drab on the inside as well and not really worth helping? (Or at least, you can't expect someone who is \\"pretty\\" to help you.)I am also mystified as to why the book description compares Passing for Thin to Lucy Grealy's Autobiography of a Face. I read Autobiography of a Face several years ago, and it was, as I recall, a far better memoir than Passing for Thin. For starters, Grealy is nowhere near as self-absorbed as Kuffel, and her writing also flows better. Kuffel's writing style is not as consistent. Sometimes it is ornate to the point of becoming stilted, while other parts of her book read more like the kind of simplistic article you might find in a magazine like Cosmopolitan than like a memoir. (One example is the Planet of Fat/Planet of Girls metaphor, which becomes more tiresome with each passing chapter.) I really don't like book descriptions that try to attract potential readers by comparing the book in question to an already published and greatly acclaimed book. (It's like those annoying movie ads that say: \\"If you liked that movie, you'll love this movie!\\" By allowing whoever wrote the book description to compare Passing for Thin to Autobiography of a Face, Kuffel is in effect saying: \\"Hey, MY book is that great, too!\\")While I found Passing for Thin disappointing, I do admire Frances Kuffel for managing to lose weight without the aid of gastric bypass surgery, and despite having been obese for most of her life, and I find it touching and heartening that she was brave enough to put herself out there in terms of dating and romance, despite her insecurity and lack of experience."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that sometimes I didn't like Frances. Sometimes she is whiny and self-pitying. Sometimes I wanted to grab her and say \\"get over it, girl!\\" But I applaud her for such a raw, open accounting of herself and her journey. Weight loss is hard. Adjusting to the results of weight loss is harder.I know, because I am in the middle of that journey myself. In the last 18 months I have lost 125 lbs, on my way to losing 175. To those who commented that it seemed like the book was written by two different women (Fat Frances and Thin Frances), I can say that weight loss *can* turn you into a different person inside as well. The way I relate to the world is completely different. My role, as I see it, and as others see it, is completely different. At age 33, that's going to cause some tension and some problems. I see tension and changes in some of my relationships. I'm trying to keep an eye on them and nurture them through the changes. So far I haven't lost any of them, but I could see it happening.To those who said Frances became more selfish... it's true. I definitely find myself being more selfish. Why? Because I spent most of my childhood and early adulthood desperately trying to make people like me and \\"overcome\\" the fact that I was fat. Now it's time to do some things just for me, and just because I want to do them. Doesn't mean I'm becoming mean-spirited or self-involved, I'm just beginning to really love and value myself and recognize that sometimes I have to put myself first.Her story was so compelling to me that it has inspired me to write my own. Might take a while (particularly since the story is not finished yet) but I think this aspect of weight loss desperately needs more attention. As others have said, the \\"how\\" of weight loss has been adequately covered, the \\"what\\" of weight loss hasn't. When I talk to friends and acquaintances about my experience, they're mildly curious about how I eat, but what causes them to really sit up and listen is when I talk about how it has changed (and continues to change) my life. I will probably talk about my struggles with discipline, and sticking to my eating plan amidst personal challenges, and how I was able to successfully make a change in my behaviors this time.As for the vanity thing, you know what? I didn't think she was impossibly vain. I completely related to her... for someone who has never been able to shop in a \\"normal\\" store, the idea that I could wear Dolce and Gabbana is a total thrill to me too (not that I can afford it!). Someone who has been able to wear all kinds of clothes all of their life can't possibly understand the thrill of being able to pull a wide variety of styles on and have them 1) fit and 2) flatter. If that's vain, so be it. Yes, I'm more obsessed with my body as a thin(ner) person now than I ever was as an obese person. I'm harder on it now. But I also appreciate it more now. I appreciate it for what it can *do* even more than how it *looks*. I got that out of Kuffel's book, too, more than I got \\"vanity.\\" I imagine eventually I'll get over it and clothes will just be clothes again, but right now, they represent freedom!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read Frances Kuffel's &quot;Passing for Thin&quot; with mixed emotions. As a person who has (and continues to) struggle with weight, body issues and weight loss, I could readily identify with many of the topics Kuffel writes about.For instance, she writes about needing to wear shorts underneath a denim dress to prevent chafing of her inner thighs in the summer...and of being refused entry to an amusement park ride - and the condescending remarks of pity offered by one woman afterwards as a sort of consolence...and of being hot and feeling in poor health all the time...so much of this a large reader can understand intimately.I also think she does a very good job of showing, early in the book, how family dynamics affect her weight gain...her family (and one brother, in particular), come across as very insensitive to her during her childhood.Yes, Frances Kuffel has spent much time on &quot;Planet Fat&quot; (her own descriptive phrase for what it's like living as a very fat person in this world) and she knows alot about the terrain, the rules and so forth.She also does a fine job showing how difficult it is to make the transition from &quot;Planet Fat&quot; to a normal life in a &quot;normal&quot; body after her loss of about 150 pounds. (Not just in terms of the physical weight loss...but how, mentally, emotionall and spiritually she had to adapt to a new way of living and being in the world after her huge weight loss).Despite all this, I did have some problems with the book. Kuffel's assessment of fat women (she devises her own system of grouping various &quot;types&quot; of fat women under such headings as the &quot;Drab&quot;, the &quot;Perfectionist&quot;, the &quot;Orphan&quot; and so on) leaves much to be desired in terms of actual respect (and insight, I felt) of women who live in a large body. Yes, I'm sure many women are just as Kuffel describes in her &quot;types&quot;...but surely there are also lots of fat women living lives of happiness too? Or is this too hard to imagine (much less give credence to) in the fat-phobic world we are All living in?I don't mind when Kuffel details the elements of her own self-loathing, but when she extends this to All fat people, women in particular, I feel uncomfortable.She was able to lose a huge amount of weight in a 12-step program (and more power to her) but such programs are not for everyone. I got a distinct feeling from her book that people who do not (or can not) lose weight in this way are somehow &quot;in denial&quot; about their weight problems (and addictions to food).Reading this book, I got the impression that my only option, in terms of living a normal, sane life with food would be to do as Kuffel did: join a heavily spiritual program and do their &quot;diet&quot; (weighing and measuring of certain foods on a very restricted food plan), otherwise I'd be forever on &quot;Planet Fat&quot; too. (Kuffel refers to the &quot;barbituate&quot; effect of certain kinds of food and explains that she could never eat such food again if she were to maintain her newly thin body).It is all well and good that Kuffel can do this. Many people either can not or do not want to. This does not mean we are &quot;in denial&quot; about our problems...or that we must forever hate ourselves as her book seems to suggest.I applaud her strength of will (and higher power) that brought her to this state and I'm glad she's written her story. It is, in many ways, very inspiring.I do feel she's left alot out, though. For instance, a more thorough, in-deph understanding of her self-loathing (aside from it mainly stemming from fat = bad) would have given her book a deeper perspective, I think.Reading this book, I find that Kuffel (both when she was fat and now that she is thin) does little to question many entrenched attitudes towards fat people.Maybe this book does not need to do that. For myself, it would have made her book much more insightful if she had done so."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I picked this book because I wanted to read about someone else who has struggled with compulsive overeating and who has recovered/is recovering from it with some success.I really did appreciate the descriptions the author, Frances Kuffel, gave of her life as a compulsive overeater - her thoughts, her feelings, her food associations, the secretive nature of this problem, the amount of time, energy and money taken up by food - eating it and thinking about it. I could identify with so much of her experience.But...There was as much about the book that I disliked as I liked. Frances Kuffel is a writer by trade and she seems to have written this memoir with an audience similar to herself in mind - that is, for other writers and people in the \\"literary circle\\". In my opinion, her use of \\"big words\\" detracted from the message of her story. Despite the fact that I have a graduate-level education, I found that on most pages of this book, there were either words or references that I did not understand. I came across so many words that I have never heard of that I lost count. I wasn't far into the book when I lost the desire to look them up as well. I ended up doing my best to approximate the meaning of unknown words using context clues, then moved on. In addition to so many \\"big money\\" words, there were countless references to classic literature (which I will admit, I did not \\"get\\"). There were also many \\"relates\\" to plays, Broadway productions, classic movie stars and gay icons (Barbara Streisand, etc.).So...all that was annoying enough, but...Toward the end of the book (p. 228 out of 257 total), Ms. Kuffel drew a comparison between the end of a 3-month relationship and the loss of a child:\\"I'd been disappointed in love when I was fat, but it was the grief of miscarriage, a deformed possibility of mostly unadmitted love that couldn't survive gestation. This was a funeral for an infant. It had a name and a personality and a future. And it was dead.\\"I found this so offensive, it's hard for me to put into words how I felt when I read it. My jaw dropped. It was one of those, \\"Oh, no she didn't!\\" moments. I could hardly believe it. I mean, where on earth does she get off comparing the end of a three month relationship - even if she did fall in love - to the death of an infant???? I get that she was making a point, trying to explain the pain she felt over the loss of her first love relationship. But comparing it to the death of an infant??? Even comparing it to a miscarriage would have been outrageous in my opinion. I read that passage over several times and shook my head, marveling over the fact that Ms. Kuffel had the nerve to even think those words, let alone write them out for the world to read. And on top of that, her words presumably had the approval of an editor and a publisher as well. I don't get it.Imagine my surprise when just 12 pages later, I found another stunningly inappropriate comparison regarding that same failed relationship:\\"City Hall. The fountain where the Boy from Connecticut and I had kissed such a long kiss that I could probably find our shadows seared into the concrete like the immolated citizens of Hiroshima.\\"OMG. I don't even know what to say to that.I think it's a shame that this memoir contains such glaring drawbacks because Frances Kuffel's story is such a touching one. She conveyed her struggle with compulsive overeating and obesity and the challenges of recovery that face her every with such honesty. I saw myself in so many of the things she did and recognized my own feelings in so many of the feelings she described. It is a comfort to know that there are other people in this world who interact with food in many of the same ways that I do, and that at least some of those people have found a way to manage their addiction."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I know what it is to be like Frances, both ways. I also know that you don't have to shed brain cells with your fat cells. She writes well. Her observations on how fat women are treated and her &quot;fat story&quot; ring painfully true. I freely commend the incredible work she did in weight loss, (all the more impressive since she clearly has multiple addictions to address). These elements simply don't balance, for me, the fact that I am appalled at the person she has revealed by the end of the book. She is only too ready to tell us--endlessly and jocularly--how beautiful she is, an opinion I'm afraid I cannot share. She boasts endlessly of this and her intellect--despite a lackluster career record and occasional startling lapses in her writing--to an extent that can only suggest a virulent self-hatred, and which severed my support of her early in the book. This is never more appallingly clear than when she refers disdainfully to other fat people as &quot;fatties,&quot; in particular describing a zealous new O.A. member as &quot;a fatty smug in her chub.&quot; A good deal of text is devoted to her quest for A Man (hardly unique), how many men &quot;look&quot; at her and shopping-- &quot;my crowning achievement in being able to wear Dolce &amp; Gabbana.&quot; Her narcissism is never clearer than in the statement, &quot;I'm a snob. I don't really like fat people much. I want a pretty sponsee, someone I can be proud of,&quot; who had &quot;what I wanted to encourage&quot; rather than a unique self for her to help reveal. For me, she ranks with Carnie Wilson in defining herself by, and embracing, those very values--shallow, cruel, competitive and contemptuous--that have made life in a fat body so painful for her, and for all overweight women. She's the quintessential &quot;upwardly mobile&quot; climber from a second-class status who has kicked the faces below her on the ladder and slammed the door behind her. Her chronicle records such a pattern of increasing recidivism with every &quot;binge,&quot; that I think her story is far from over, but I can't wish her luck."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews I've read regarding this book. It seemed to me that these reviewers disliked the idea that the author really hated being fat and was unable to fully accept herself at that weight. To me, this seems perfectly reasonable. It's WHY she wanted to lose this weight and WHY she finally DID lose this weight. It's why ALL dieting people lose the weight. They dislike fat. Aesthetically, many people find obesity unattractive. Although one may not like this fact of life, it IS indeed a fact of life. Furthermore, for some, obesity epitomizes the idea of indulgence and a lack of caring of themselves.I found this memoir to be particularly touching. Frances is brutally honest when she recalls how she used to sneak food, and lots of it, as a child. She recalls the pain she felt being fat, how she knew she was considered and judged-- fairly or not.What I found most interesting of all is how Frances had to learn behaviors that most women take for granted. As preteens and teens, we learn to flirt, to make ourselves attractive to the opposite sex, to talk to others, to dress, to put on makeup, etc. We learn how to attract attention from others, to meet potential dates, mates, etc. All this is natural for most of us.For Frances, however, none of this was a natural progression. As an obese adolescent who never felt attractive, she never learned how to flirt because she never felt as if she was attractive enough to meet others. One of the negative reviewers stated derisively that Frances referred to herself as a girl. I didn't make that distinction when I read the book, but it's only fitting. She missed a normal girlhood-- the makeup, the hair, the sleepovers with girls where you giggle about boys and sex. All of this was foreign to Frances. And, she was never treated as a cute little girl or \\"an attractive woman\\" growing up. So, when she was all of a sudden thrust into the world of being considered attractive, of having people respond to her as if she was an attractive woman, she had to learn all of the behaviors that most of us just learned from living.I have a family member who is the author's former size. I can see, in her, many of the qualities the author shares with us about being obese. It's really not her weight alone that makes her different from other women I know, it's what that weight caused her to miss out on as a child an adolescent and how it shaped her outlook as an adult.I completely recommend this book to anyone. Whether weight has been an issue in one's life or not, this author's journey is inspiring and true."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I was excited to read Kuffel's book, as I've been overweight since twelve years of age. I'm now 23 and have been steadily losing pounds for over a month now. While I appreciate Kuffel's attempt to provide a memoir of food addiction and regaining a healthy body, it seems as though too much of the &quot;hard work&quot; was just glossed over. In several early chapters the reader is treated to a play-by-play look at Kuffel's food addiction as a young child, but no mention is made of how her weight affected her teenage life or how she struggled with food during her 20s and 30s. I was equally surprised to read about her sudden decision to &quot;abstain from flour and sugar&quot; after only going to one or two weight management meetings.What I find most disturbing (and disheartening) is the way in which Kuffel makes losing weight look so easy. It is not an easy thing, by any means. In fact, it's a struggle for the majority of those who attempt it. Only several paragraphs are devoted to Kuffel's mid-stage weight loss and for a self-described &quot;food addict&quot; no mention is made of her battles to control her cravings. While I realize that not all people who lose weight do it in the same way, I found it disappointing that the book leapt from her weight of 338 pounds to 176 rather fast. What happened during that period would have probably been the most profound part of the book; however, it was left out. And as any substantially overweight person knows, the first thirty or forty pounds are often the toughest to lose. Kuffel's decision to gloss over that stage provides readers with the sentiment that the weight came off quite easily and she never battled food addiction or cravings again. To many, that is not the reality.I was also somewhat saddened that Kuffel constantly referred to herself as being on &quot;planet fat&quot; before her weight loss and then on &quot;planet girl&quot; after she lost weight. Are fat females not of the human race? It's as though she is implying that she wasn't a real person until she lost weight. Sadly, it seemed to me that she placed too much emphasis on morphing from &quot;fat&quot; to &quot;human.&quot;I was disappointed and expected more."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I read this book last summer when I was on vacation in Cape Cod. It takes a decent book to keep you glued to your beach chair instead of enjoying the ocean, but I was hooked. Then I got home from vacation and Googled \\"France Kuffel\\" only to discover that Frances was fat again. What a disappointment. It sort of negated all her efforts and my time. From what I can tell about her life today, she is walking dogs and obsessing about things, which leads me to conclude that the real root of her problems are mental and the fat is just a symptom. Nonetheless, her willingness to reveal all the personal details of her life is commendable, as many of them are very easy to relate to for those of us carrying extra pounds."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I love stories about facing your dreams, living with your demons, and finding your true self. I wanted Frances to &quot;win&quot;, to accept herself, to let go of her pain. I kept reading late into the night to get to the &quot;happily ever after&quot; part -- but alas, this was a memoir, not fiction. Her courage and commitment are real.Some of the writing, however, was awkward: &quot;My first date was an old work buddy Chris's fault&quot; for exampple, could have easily been changed to &quot;My first date was the fault of my old work buddy, Chris.&quot;Also, she jumps around quite a bit chronologically. I would have preferred a more straight-forward account of things.Most frustrating was the lack of information about the author's struggle (or lack of? we never find out) with actually sticking to her food plan. What challenges did she face right off the bat? How could she have gone overnight from food obsessed to measuring and weighing every mouthful? And for over 500 days straight?Aside from that, the author did let us in on extremely person details, especially in the dating arena.If you're looking for the specific &quot;how-tos&quot; in getting a handle on your eating and emotions, this book is not it. However, if you like inspiring memoirs, you'll be satisfied with Passing for Thin."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Many accounts of losing weight, particularly those in mass-market magazines, read as fairy tales. You know the ones: \\"I was miserable at 300 pounds; I lost 150 pounds; and now I live happily ever after.\\" Great, but not realistic.\\"Passing for Thin\\" is not a Cinderella story. It is an honest account of a woman who was fat almost all her life (reaching a top weight of 338 pounds) and lost nearly 200 pounds. At the end, Kuffel's life is not perfect. She is still living in her \\"Bat Cave\\" and is not married to any handsome prince. Her life is, however, immeasurably better. Not only can Kuffel buy more attractive clothes, but she can date (apparently for the first time ever) and otherwise participate more fully in life. Other reviewers have criticized the author's focus on her looks and her clothes, but I think Kuffel was just trying to convey the wonder that she felt every day after being very, very heavy for 40 years.Frances Kuffel is not perfect. She has been marinated in, and has apparently adopted, prejudices against the overweight. She relies too heavily, in my opinion, on her OA sponsors to tell her what to eat. But there are incredible insights in the book. Kuffel describes what it is like to be as heavy as she was and get through a day (or, worse yet, go on an airplane) and provides interesting insights into the \\"categories\\" of fat people that she comes across. Like others, I would have cut a little of the \\"look how pretty I am\\" parts of the book, but the accurate, honest and unique insights make it worthwhile."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This is not a \\"how-to\\" weight loss book so much as it is a \\"what now?\\" book. Anyone who is working on losing a large amount of weight should read it so they can be prepared for how they will feel, and how other people will feel, about the loss."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"My intention with writing this review is to address what I think is her shallow recovery. However, after reading these other reviews it's clear that there are other issues with this book.The first is her self-absorption, which is mentioned by other reviewers. In her defense the book is about her weight loss and how she experienced it. She seems so non-judgmental of the process in a way she was likely never unable to experience while she was overweight. It is what it is.But the real issue I see with the book is her lack of substantive emotional progress. She didn't seem to deal with any issues that caused her to use food addictively in the first place. As evidence of this we see her merely transfer addictions from food to smoking. This is common in addiction recovery and I'm disappointed her sponsor didn't point that out to her.Overall, it's well written. My main concern is the type of recovery she uses to lose the weight, but if you're reading it for pleasure rather an seeing information on addiction it's an interesting read."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This was just okay for me. Nothing earth shattering, there was a rather downtrodden, negativity throughout that I picked up on a lot with this book, I suppose a reality that lost weight does not change a life. I was rather disappointed in the graze by of the actual weight loss, something I was looking for- the step by step experiences of the loss.I was looking for something to motivate me and keep me going, this definitely was not it. Definitely not a motivating thing in it, actually. A good read, but only if you are looking for a basic story of weight loss."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I first heard about Passing for Thin when a customer requested it at my bookstore. Mildly curious about anyone who has lost that much weight, I ordered a copy for her and waited for a supply to arrive in my store. Literally the minute the box was unpacked, I dove for a copy. Over the following weekend I devoured the book. (No pun intended.) I couldn&#8217;t believe how much my background was like Ms. Kuffel&#8217;s. It was like I was reading about my own childhood. That parallel made me realize that maybe I can find the success she did.Yes, I agree with the other reviews that I was interested to learn more about the steps involved and beyond that, even the basis for her eating plan. That isn&#8217;t what the book was about, though. It did not leave me with a feeling that something was left out. Rather, it inspired me to go in search of answers to my questions.After reading the book, I was more than happy to suggest it to customers thumbing through the diet books. I always tell them how inspiring it was for me. I can&#8217;t tell you how many of those customers have come back and thanked me for suggesting the book. Frances did such a wonderful job of describing how it feels to be on the wrong side of the window.No, I don&#8217;t know Frances Kuffel personally. I have, however, made the acquaintance of a good number of people who either knew her growing up or her family members. Everyone is so proud of you Frances! Missoula solutes you!"},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I thought this book was fascinating. I'm glad that Frances concentrated on what it's like to live after the weight loss. Losing weight is not the hard part -- every really fat person has done it more than once and can recite four or five comprehensive weight loss plans from memory. I've got about 300 pounds on my 5'4&quot; frame right now, but I've lost and gained more than that over the years. I am a weight loss expert.The really hard part is keeping the weight off -- dealing with what its like to see yourself differently and be seen differently by everyone around you. Sometimes, literally, not recognizing yourself in the mirror or waking up and laying there trying to remember what you look like without looking in the mirror. Having everybody you know feel like they can comment on and openly appraise your changing body. Having people who were never nice to you, mysteriously like you all of a sudden. Having some of your old friends behave badly toward you and just suspecting why. Finding that both your clothes and your psyche no longer fit your body and not being sure how to replace them. Now, that's hard. That's where I, and so many others, fail.If I were to meet Frances Kuffel, I would thank her for writing such an honest book and for helping me imagine what making the transition would really be like. Thank you for sharing the raw truth of your experience, your strength, your faults, and your feelings. Thank you for admiting that both you, and life after weight loss, are not perfect. It made your tale so much more believable. May the blessings of a Higher Power (I vote for God, but willingly accept your preference for Prozac) be upon you."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"A great memoir. An amazing personal accomplishment and literary achievement. A must read for women who struggle with obesity. If a forty-two year-old woman can lose almost 200 pounds without pills or surgery it gives hope to us all who struggle.Just a couple quibbles: the family background is fascinating, especially the fact that the author is adopted... but her malevolent older brother, who is introduced early on, is given short shrift. What happened to him (much later in the book his death is dismissed in a sentence or two)? Were her brothers adopted as well? Same for her alcoholic friend Dennis... I wonder what happened to him. Also, the actual process of losing 188 pounds went awfully fast... seemed like it happened over two paragraphs. Would have liked to hear more about the year or so she was steadily shrinking. She goes from fat to thin in one page. Some judicious editing would have helped...but overall this is a great book. Could not put it down. Congratuations Frances, you are a wonderful inspiration for fat girls and writers alike."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I liked this book. From someone who?s struggled with being overweight for years and years, Kuffel?s story of living in some sort of fat-induced oblivion had relevance for me.It is paralyzing to be so obsessed with food ? whether it be the next meal or the having plentiful snacks on hand as a substitute for having a satisfying outside life.She details going through years hidden inside herself, hidden behind the layers of fat that made her surpass the 300-pound mark. She writes about her habits as a child, sneaking and hoarding foods to eat, hiding them under the bed, cleaning the dishes by eating the leftovers off everyone?s plates, and so on.She writes of humiliating and sad things ? being denied a chance to ride at Coney Island because of her girth, watching her friends date and pair up, making herself immune to people?s tendencies to ignore her uncomfortably as if she weren?t there or the way they stare in shock.Then one day she wakes up and goes to a meeting for overeaters, and she gets sucked in. It strikes a chord with her, and she gets a sponsor. Soon she is measuring and monitoring what she eats ? now mostly veggies ? no more cookies, ice cream, and the like. And the weight falls off. She ends up losing more than half her weight.That?s maybe the first third to half of the bookShe goes into some detail on that, but much of the book is this new woman she becomes, after she loses half herself. She describes her family?s reaction to her (mostly modest pleasure, but no real support at first), her relationships with other women in her support group, illnesses, falling off the wagon, and troubles with dating and heartache.After 40-some years hidden in fat, she emerges a newer, thinner woman, and is starting life anew. Dating, shopping, being a ?Girl.? Kuffel has a knack for writing and observation, and the book is a fast and interesting read.I felt for her struggles and it should be familiar territory for anyone who has struggled to lose weight, especially a lot of weight. It may offer insights for thinner people who don?t understand what it?s like to be overweight.Some people have commented on how she tends to show very little sympathy for other people who are overweight (but that?s common for people who have lost a lot of weight ? they get that attitude ? ?Come on now! Cut calories and move more! You can do it! Show some discipline!?). It?s nothing new, and perhaps it?s a form of guilt or self-resentment that they didn?t do it earlier.But it?s a good story of how one woman took control and took back her life. She lost the first 40 years to obesity, and maybe alienated herself from a lot of things ? full enjoyment of her youth, dating, having children ? but it shows that it?s never too late to try, and overall it?s a strong message of hope, to never give up.I hope she sticks with her success, and I hope she grows to love herself more and more as she goes on, as in the book, it?s clear she?s still learning how to accept herself. It's a powerful message to take control of your life and not get consumed by what you're consuming."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"This book was not as inspiring as I had thought or hoped it would be but I came to realize that Frances Kuffel didn't write this book for me to be inspired - she wrote it to try to make people understand what it is like to live day to day with a weight issue. It gave me an understanding of the obstacles obese people deal with every day and the heartache they suffer by the cruelty of others.Ms. Kuffel lost all her weight but was still tormented by the food issue, had her ups and downs and learned to live with them. There is so much to deal with when you have such a huge weight loss and is seemed that Ms. Kuffel had to help many people learn to accept her as a new person while she was still trying to get used to the new Frances herself. She had every right to be vain, she had gone through life avoiding mirrors and now she was able to look in them and try to get used to the person looking back.I admire and commend Ms. Kuffel for putting her soul out there for all to see and for sharing her personal struggle with the many of us who also share it."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"Kuffel's self proclaimed goals are to be thin, love someone who loves her back, and publish a book with her name on it. This book is the story of her accomplishment of the first two goals (the book itself is obviously the third). Kuffel is not writing about the physical mechanics of becoming thin; she is interested in discussing the emotional and spiritual journey that she took during and after her weight loss. Her food and weight problems are so extreme that I don't think her system would be necessary or helpful for most dieters anyway.That said, I really enjoyed her descriptions of the various stages of her weight loss. The problems were actually more interesting than the triumphs. It is easy to predict that someone would be ecstatic to wear a size 18 for the first time in her life; incontinence due to thigh shrinkage is a problem that I would never have imagined.All in all, an enjoyable read about someone who overcame adversity in the pursuit of her goals."},{"Title":"Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self","review":"I thought the book was an excellent example of the challenges that anyone can face when taking the step to look at one's self in the mirror. Many of the feelings the author expressed, I related to in that weight loss is not a destination, it is part of exploration of self. I could not put the book down and is an inspiration for me in my journey towards self realization. Eventhough my specific journey to lose weight is not as dramatic as hers, I find myself asking the same questions, doing the exact same things, and having very similiar experiences with relationships.It is a must read for those that have attempted many times to lose weight.

Captain Paris, and her co pilot, and best friend was attempting to get some other soldiers back to the presidential compound within the next hour. Her black hawk crashed in the jungle. She had to watch as her best friend dies in front of her. Captain Paris lost everyone on her helicopter that day besides Captain Rick Bishop. With her injuries she has to depend on rick to help her. Later on it was determined the accident was her fault, and she was stripped her wings. She and rick takes a trip back to the crash site for answers. They find that the helicopter was sabotaged. Rick, and Eve shared some steamy kisses in the jungle on both trips. Rick stops himself from letting the passion they feel burn out of control. He stops himself partly because of the military code of justice, and partly because of the guilt he feels for his sergeant's death. He also has some past demons to deal with.

Each story is very cleverly written and Mr. Garrett has a fantastic grasp of composition and effect in the short horror genre. Obvious influences from Poe, Lovecraft, Bierce, Blackwood, Benson, James, and Wellman shine through these tales; yet, Mr. Garrett's unique voice is refreshing in a style of writing that is largely dead. Many of these stories should be considered instant classics right along the names I mentioned earlier. Mr. Garrett is well read in this genre and his command of the style proves that. I perused his Listmania recommendations and own many of the books he lists there. He knows his stuff! I also enjoyed reading his blog on his Lulu site because of his interesting insights into writing and the genre.

Nobody agrees with anyone on anything, and this ranges from subjects that are the domain of the martial arts scholar, like jing energy and fighting, to the most mundane, like how to spell the names of the arts!! So, let's say you are faced with the task of writing an introductory text to a subject that is certainly among the most controversial of all of the Eastern arts (even to the point of violent (!) disagreement as to whether this is a martial art or not). What are you going to do?? I think that the authors of this book have done a good job of this. There is a lot of info in this book about a very complicated subject. None of it is in a great deal of depth, but that is not the function of this book. The idea is to show readers the vibrancy of the world of Tai Chi Chuan, the wealth of possibility, and the sheer joy of practicing the art. This has to be done without scaring anyone off! The authors worked hard to pull this off, and they did so. Other introductory books are so dry and stuffy as to be unreadable - don't the authors have any fun at all??? The authors of this book do. They enjoy what they do, and they hope you do too.Can you learn Tai Chi from this book? The authors don't think so and ask you to find an instructor. Can you learn a great deal about the world of Tai Chi from this book? Yes - none of it is in great depth but once again, if you are curious to learn more, then for heaven's sake go further than a Dummies book.I gave it four stars because there are some things I don't understand and don't agree with (see the beginning of this review!), but overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and appreciate the effort involved."},{"Title":"T'ai Chi For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I have started tai chi recently, coming from harder arts.

Widmaier explains the basics of physiology in a practical context so that it is fairly easy to understand. This is one of the better non-fiction reads you will find, as it truly is interesting. I feel that this is a great tool for any biology student or anyone who is just curious about the way things work in an animal's body.While explaining how things work in the human body and how they could be better, plentiful examples are provided to both amuse and teach the reader. The book addresses everything from how we become obese to the relative rates of metabolism in different species to the circulatory system and stress induced hormones. Widmaier even provides notes to elaborate on things he addresses in his book and provided some bibliographical information on important scientists and their contributions to physiology without making me fall asleep or daydream, which is no small feat.After reading this book I can appreciate the work of physiologists, especially after reading the epilogue. I also learned many facts about the animal kingdom that would really make me seem smart in school and help clarify different concepts. From this book I learned that small animals such as shrews need to eat more than their body weight everyday because they have such a high metabolism, and that our ancestors developed a defense mechanism against starvation so that when they ate less their metabolism slowed, meaning that dieting can cause us to loose weight more slowly. I also read that fish cough to remove the gung that collects in their gills as it flows through the gills to provide them with oxygen. This book also showed that humans have far inferior senses that many animals because of our forebrain which is currently only found in humans and gives us the smarts to evade predators and get food among other things.Overall, this book is perfect for someone who is looking for an interesting and intellectual read. Having some kind of background in biology is helpful when reading this book but it is readable by anyone from a middle school student upwards."},{"Title":"Why Geese Don't Get Obese (And We Do): How Evolution's Strategies for Survival Affect Our Everyday Lives","review":"This freshly written book about comparative physiology is at its best when describing how some of the basic mechanisms of life - such as circulation, homeostasis and metabolism - work, in distinctly lay terms. Much of it will be familiar territory for anyone who took serious interest in their college biology and chemistry classes, but the organization is fine. Another bright point about \\"Why Geese\\" is the clarity and good humor it brings to the subject of evolution.

Despair is their leit motif.Emotionally scarred, the characters in these tales are fragmented by substance abuse, by obdurate personal demons or both. Nonetheless, such unengaging personalities become compelling when presented by a pair of Pulitzer Prize nominees writing at top form. The child of a schizophrenic mother and unknown father, Robert Stone spent three years in an orphanage. Later, as a New Orleans census taker, he walked that city's back streets. With Bear And His Daughter, seven intense tales penned between 1969 and today, he depicts communal deadends and the dissolute souls trapped therein.Begin with &quot;Miserere.&quot; A widowed librarian's bitterness becomes a mission to have aborted fetuses receive the church's blessing. Another vignette explores the effects of childhood violence: &quot;The worst of it, Mackay says, was the absence of mercy. Once the punishment began, no amount of crying or pleading would stay the prefect's hand. Each blow followed upon the last, inexorably like the will of God. It was the will of God.&quot;The title story sears as it traces the downward spiral of a visit by an alcoholic poet to his drug addicted emotionally deprived daughter. The author's chilling denouement rivals Euripidean tragedies.Robert Stone's writing is edgy, scalpel keen. He probes, cuts, laying back the protective coverings of our human condition. He well knows life's underside."},{"Title":"Bear & His Daughter","review":"The themes will be familiar to those who've read Mr. Stone's novels. Alcohol &amp; drug abuse, characters haunted by the past. His characters are on the verge of losing it, and often do. Mr. Stone knows how to build intensity, and his style and structure propel the reader toward the climax, climax being a more apt term than conslusion. Not for the faint of heart or those looking to be uplifted, but a look at life that is real indeed."},{"Title":"Bear & His Daughter","review":"Stone's short stories don't have much in the way of plot, but they each leave the reader with an unforgettable insight into the way Stone feels the world works. My favorite tale is \\"Aquarius Obscured,\\" in which a woman gets high and takes her dog to the aquarium, where the woman has a conversation with a fascist dolphin. Each story here deserves careful reading, and readers who comply will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bear & His Daughter","review":"This isn't the most uplifting collection of stories; in fact, it's a bit depressing. Each story seems to remark on the fragility and transience of human life. From the first story, Miserere, centered around aborted fetuses and religion, to the last, Bear &amp; His Daughter, about the renuinion of alcoholic father and daughter, readers will perhaps not see a flicker of optimism in each of Robert Stone's stories. Despite the dark themes in Stone's stories, reader's will notice the beauty of Stone's narratives. He is a master crafter, and his words flow with beautiful consistency and intellect. His sentences were a treat for me to read. All the stories are particulary strong, my favorite being the title story, Bear &amp; His Daughter."},{"Title":"Bear & His Daughter","review":"This collection of Robert Stone stories is a deeply felt, often beautiful arrangement of fictions dealing with the great themes of Conrad, Hemingway, but also without the obligatory machismo. \\"Helping,\\" in particular, is an extraordinary story--masterfully crafted and with a beautiful command of negative space. Stone's preoccupations are with the possibility of heroism in the modern world, the nature and contradictions of piety and faith, the tragedy of addiction, as well as American hubris and stupidity. \\"Under the Pitons\\" is a particularly engaging story that doesn't shy away from the conventions of the sea-adventure--Stone employs his tropes strategically and with obvious skill. \\"Bear and his Daughter\\" takes you to the fullest depths of tragedy--its precision of feeling lies in the kind of command of character rarely seen in American short fiction today. An outstanding collection."},{"Title":"Bear & His Daughter","review":"Of these seven stories, only &quot;Under the Pitons,&quot; about love among drug-runners, pulls off the grand, sweeping melodrama that most of the rest just nod toward, and only &quot;Miserere,&quot; about a woman who rescues aborted fetuses for burial, feels like a true short story. The other works seem like abandoned novels. They are filled with characters that are hopelessly self-indulgent (the alcoholic in &quot;Helping,&quot; the drug-addicted daughter in the title story) and tediouslyself-important (the incestuous poet in the title story, the drugged-out poet in \\"Porque No Tiene, Porque Le Falta\\"), with plots that lead to violent, cop-out endings. The writing often seems disengaged, and even bored. On the whole, a surprising disappointment."},{"Title":"Miss Howard and the Emperor : The Story of Napoleon III and his Mistress","review":"Excerpt from the inside flap of dust jacket:Miss Howard aka Miss Harryett - Countess of Beauregard.

Terms in such..The last straw for me was when I screwed up burger helper. I thought \\"simmer\\" on the instructions ment high heat. Then 2nd attempt forgot to \\"drain the meat\\" which didnt make for very good Fettuchini Alfredo helper :(This book talks in low level terms.. Explaining Simmer among others. Before I bought this book, i recieved a cookbook for Xmas.. Which was no use to me because I didnt even understand half the instructions. So I was screwing up burger helpers and didnt even know how to make good scrambled eggs.. *sigh*NOW!! I make probably some of the best breakfast you ever had. My scrambled eggs are nice, soft fluffy just right.. I mix in Chorizo and heat up some tortillas for some Migas.. OH THATS NOT ALL! I have impressed my mother greatly with hommade stew.. Started off with the recipe in this book (Which is very good BTW).. Then migrated from the stove to a slow cooker(crock pot) and now MY MOTHER asks for me to bring her some of my stew(which is sorta developed into a custome recipe of mine). Pot Roasts.. Tacos...Grilling fish.. ect ect...My kitchen never had the right tools in it to cook with. This books gives you a nice basic economical listing of things that you must have to cook. VERY GOOD INFO.. Also the listings of spices to have on hand, herbs and other stuff. Also even explains how to properly use knives and what knife to use for what! Again but $ wise its reasonable.. it doesnt ask you to go out and spend 300.00 on junk you will hardly use. Its very common sense...And then safety. Book goes over proper cooking times and temp for various meats and cautions on cooking chicken. It also gives you a very nice chart on how long various foods, leftovers, meats can be stored in Fridge and stay edible. THIS WAS VERY HELPFUL!Again.. Great book for person who is cooking clueless and needs it.. Like me ;-)"},{"Title":"Cooking Basics for Dummies (For Dummies (Cooking))","review":"My idea of the &quot;For Dummies&quot; books is that they are supposedto be for the beginner and not intimidate anyone. As an aboveaverage cook who is regularly asked for a recommendation on where a newcomer to the kitchen should start, I had hoped that this could be my answer. Unfortunately, there is a fatal flaw that make me hesitate and certainly give a disclaimer with any recommendation I might provide.My biggest reservation has to do with the chapter on equipment. While I will certainly not disagree that I can cook slightly better with better equipment, I also know that you can be a perfectly good cook with 50 cent knives and $5 saucepans. This chapter should have been an appendix - &quot;When you're ready to buy the best tools&quot; instead of such an early chapter. At most the chapter should have contained a discussion about what each item is used for, and stopped there. As it stands, it succeeded mainly in putting off the less experienced cooks I showed it to.This is a shame, since much of the rest of the book is useful, funny and informative. I have since recommended it to one person with the caveat that they should ignore that chapter until they could afford not to. But most people just starting out can't afford what's in there. (Heck, I'm well beyond starting out and can't afford much of it. Then again, I regularly produce gourmet meals on a $20 set of knives and a $50 set of pans. So can anyone.)In the end, the author broke what I consider to be the cardinal rule of the &quot;For Dummies&quot; books - MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE. In the end, a $50 knive and a $100 pan are just not accessible and also, not NECESSARY to be a good cook. Learning the skills of cooking can be done on almost ANY equipment (the tops have to seal and the knives have to cut - that's about it). This book made it seem necessary to drop a $1000 or so before you could start boiling water and that's not just inaccessible but intimidating, too."},{"Title":"Cooking Basics for Dummies (For Dummies (Cooking))","review":"This book was given to my wife as a wedding gift from a friend of ours.

From the salad to the dessert each item was beautifully presented and lovingly prepared.My only problem with this book was in regards to the equipment needed. As Catering Director at Shepherd College I don't even use many of these items on a full time basis.

There is even a figure missing from chapter 5 that is supposed to show a key ingredient for Braise Endive (what the heck is endive?)

Moreover, as has been pointed out earlier, &quot;Cooking for Dummies&quot; seems to say that one must have or obtain a kitchen far beyond the reach of most new cooks. If that's overly intimidating, it's made up for later, as the book gives simple steps that are all but foolproof. If the beginner cannot afford the costly equipment recommended, the beginner should make do with what can be obtained. However, cooking is like any other craft--the better the equipment, the better the results.But the recipes and techniques are the highlight and soul of the book. Written with humor, insight, and a firm remembering of the intended audience (e.g. &quot;dummies in the kitchen&quot;), &quot;Cooking for Dummies&quot; is sure to please. The recipes are complete and easy to follow; the techniques are explained so that even a klutz like myself won't lose his fingers while chopping herbs or hard vegetables; and the results are uniformly satisfying.&quot;Cooking for Dummies&quot; is great reading, easy to use, and will be a favorite for many new cooks learning to use the kitchen for more than storage of beer and chips."},{"Title":"Cooking Basics for Dummies (For Dummies (Cooking))","review":"This book should have been organized such that a beginner can read through the book in linear chapter order.

However, a few pages later, a recipe is presented that uses tools not mentioned previously. It presents recipes using techniques not explained until many chapters later -- the forward references (if any) refer only to the chapter thus forcing the reader to peruse that whole future chapter to find the technique referenced.

It is not friendly to someone who actually wants to learn how to cook.The writing, even though it was badly organized, was good. The problem was the book's editor.

For the simple recipe to make scrambled eggs most cookbooks have gourmet recipes. When I looked in Cooking for Dummies I found out how to make scrambled eggs without the pretty stuff.

It explains basic kitchen terminology and methods in very basic terms....even a child could understand them. If you have much kitchen experience at all, you probably won't learn a whole lot from this book, but it does serve me well as a reference book. For example, if I can't remember exactly how long or how hot to bake a potato, I turn to Cooking for Dummies.

As each new concept is introduced it is thoroughly explained and then used in a recipe.The recipes range from the very basic (rice, mashed potatoes) to the more advanced (risotto, roast leg of lamb with vegetables).

I think the book could make many teens feel less \\"misunderstood,\\" and realize that their feelings are normal, and that there are many effective ways they can deal with the ups and downs.However, at the end of each section, there is a segment called \\"What if it still doesn't work?\\" (As in, what if I've tried all of these things to no avail?) This is where we have the problem... there are several of these segment endings that suggest the teen do things such as stay in their room most of the time and focus on planning for when they're old enough to move out, or to get the help of others to arrange for changes in custody, etc.While I agree that there are certainly situations in which such measures would be appropriate (such as changing custody due to physical or mental abuse), we do not think it's appropriate to suggest teens take such steps over things like siblings borrowing their things without asking, arguing with their step parent, etc.Overall, it was a good book for us adults to get a closer view of how the kids may feel, but we are still undecided as to whether or not to give it to the kids to read because we feel these few \\"segment endings\\" are inappropriate. It's a shame, because the majority of the book is fantastic. Fortunately, our kids are not having any huge problems, so if we decide not to pass it on it will still be okay.

What I liked most about this book was that it dealt with topics other books for kids haven't touched, including crushes on stepsiblings. One of my favorite parts of the book was the &quot;fill in the name&quot; letter stepchildren can give to a stepparent when kids feel they're being pushed into having a relationship with the new parent.

My fiance (her mother) and I decided to read through it to make sure it was appropriate for her and we were pretty disappointed with some of the advice this book offers.We know this book was written some time ago but, regardless, I'm not sure how I feel about telling a teenager that it's ok to hide in their room and begin making plans to move out if they're unhappy with their situation. Sometimes, yes, things can be dangerous but this isn't referring to times like that.It was also very upsetting to see the book referring to a child's biological parents as &#34;real&#34; parents. What does that make us step-parents? We went as far as to white-out every time the word &#34;real&#34; appeared before &#34;parent&#34; and wrote in &#34;bio&#34;. It completely defeats the purpose to refer to one set of parents as &#34;real&#34;. This book was written at a time when step-parents were seen as &#34;real&#34; parents so in context I guess the verbiage makes sense but not anymore.Nonetheless, we decided not to give our daughter the book.

He is misquoted as having said physical-chemical forces which has given rise to a false belief he was seeking non-material substance. I am sure Bergson would say that the changing of a single word through vital actions has given rise to a unique ripple of time that will never come again. For how can finite elements give rise to uniqueness of time unless we observe the change, the evolution of matter. A book on biodynamics that even today holds some challenging questions."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"I first came across Ibsen's monumental work when reading 'Tropic of Capricorn' by Henry Miller. Despite my complete lack of evolutionary and biological knowledge, I found Ibsen's eschatology mind blowing. Several times I was forced to leave the book for days in order to fully contemplate the philosophical ramifications of his insights. From this great stride forward into the fringes of human understanding Ibsen states: 'A conduct that is truly our own, on the contrary, is that of a will which does not try to counterfeit intellect, and which, remaining itself - that is to say, evolving - ripens gradually into acts which the intellect will be able to resolve indefinitely into intelligible elements without ever reaching its goal. The free act is incommensurable with the idea, and its &quot;rationality&quot; must be defined by this very incommensurability, which admits the discovery of much intelligibility within it as we will. Such is the character of our own evolution; and such also, without doubt, that of the evolution of life.&quot; No one, despite their educational backgrounds or lack thereof, should feel intimidated by the possibility of transcending one's very own intellect."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"Bergson's thesis is that Darwinian and Lamarkian evolution are only half the story and that there is a creative urge inherent in life that defines the direction of evolution. It is distinguished from Creationism in that his system does not posit and eschaton or final perfect form, nor an external agent (God).It has some similarity with biologist Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic fields. In his theory, there is an energy field (as yet undetected by modern physics) that controls the shape of organic molecules, i.e., one protein is shaped one way and the same collection of atoms gets shaped another way under the same pH and temperature.Aldous Huxley mentions Bergson's theory of consciousness several times in his writings. Bergson thinks that consciousness pervades everything, and that intellect serves as a filter that presents only what is comprehensible to mental categories. This has several implications. One is the possibility for a monistic metaphysic. The other is that it leaves open the possibility of perceiving an alternate reality (what excited Huxley).Chapter 3 is about his metaphysics, which are not very clearly expressed. There appear to be avenues unexplored by him. What are the consequences of matter being infused with consciousness? Magic? Why is it that intellect and geometrical thinking is what produces objects in perception? What is the mechanism.What does have value is his theory that chaos is not the absence of repeatability, but is a stochastic process that can be understood as an aggregate of individual \\"wills.\\" This is used to support his vital theory of evolution. That each organism \\"wills\\" its variation in seemingly random fashion, but at a higher order, it produces the regularity of genera.Chapter 4 is a critique of various philosophic systems after establishing his \\"cinematographic\\" theory of perception. His basic point is that matter is in continual flux, yet we are only able to perceive it as a sequence of discrete states, hence the illusion of permanence."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"Henri Bergson's seminal \`\`Creative Evolution'' starts off with the flowing movement so prevalent in his philosophy of the organism, one idea flows into the next in a smooth undivided motion. Not only does Bergson explain his work with analogies and examples supported by the biology of the time, thereby distancing himself from the purely intellectual pursuit of most philosohpy, trapped in the world of the mind, but he demonstrates his thought in the very way of exposition he uses throughout the book. One feels his thought is produced like a Mozart symphony, all at once with no corrections needed. This aptly demonstrates the idea of duration and time he proposes in this book. His influence is profound in thinkers such as David Bohm and Alfred North Whitehead which so to speak \`\`run with it'' in the parlance of baseball. This is a book worth reading twice for its rich display of creativity and also to reread sections not followed the first time. One does feel however that at times the flow is interrupted by disturbances in his mode of thinking leading to disjointed reading. Nonetheless, not only does he open a whole new way of thought free of dualism and the old patterns of mechanism, but he also expalins the reason for mechanistic thought itself."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"This book must be read slowly and deliberately -- do so and it will give you an insight into the brilliance of one of the most revolutionary and extraordinarily perceptive philosopher scientists of the 20th Century, IMO.Bergson changed the way scientists see the world by introducing his conception of an \\"original impetus\\", which began simply (if \\"intelligently\\") and evolved matter into living, increasingly complex lifeforms and concurrently evolved an increasingly complex consciousness within it -- as an \\"imperceptable thread\\" (my wording) ultimately called the elan vital.In my case, after reading carefully and filling the book's margins with notes, Professor Bergson seems to be proving (showing) that all science up until his time (circa 1930's) was concerned with objects as they were at a particular moments, whereas in fact these objects were and are in a state of continual \\"being\\" (duration), making their actuality or essence unknowable.He chronologically takes us through the writings of Plato and Aristotle (the natural trend of the intellect)-- Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz (becoming in modern science) -- and even through the Criticism of Kant and the evolutionism of Spencer. Bergson thoroughly critques each philosophy and shows us why they are not dealing the world as it really is.Through this he weaves his own philosophical system based on Creation and Evolution by (quote):\\". . . showing us in the intellect a local effect of evolution, a flame, perhaps accidental, which lights up the coming and going of living beings in the narrow passage open to their action: an lo! . . . (making) of this lantern glimmering in a tunnel a Sun which can illuminate the world.\\"Boldly (Kantian and Spencerian science) proceeds with the powers of conceptual thought alone, to the ideal reconstruction of things, even of life. . . . But the essence of things escapes us, and will escape us always; WE MOVE AMONG RELATIONS; THE ABSOLUTE IS NOT IN OUR PROVINCE; WE ARE BROUGHT TO STAND BEFORE THE UNKNOWABLE.\\" . . . BUT AN INTELLECT BENT UPON THE ACT TO BE PERFOMED AND THE REACTION TO FOLLOW . . . WOULD DIG TO THE VERY ROOT OF NATURE AND MIND.\\"In simpler words, the observation of any object changes reality for that object. It is only real as a moving \\"being\\", animated by an original impetus and kept real by an \\"elan vital\\" which cannot be known because \\"being\\" cannot be defined. What we call \\"real things\\" are illusions which beomce \\"real\\" to us only when we stop their duration. Heidegger spends thousands of pages unsuccessfully trying to define \\"being\\", which ultimately he can only label as \\"dasein\\". What we observe as the real world is matter and consciousness evolving concurrently from simple to complex as they move through space and time.This means that the original impetus, the spark, the first flame, began neither in space nor time. Later quantum physics would support Bergson's insight, considering that an electron (as one example) cannot be seen without turning it into something else, or ever stranger, disappearing into what can only be other universes parallel to our own.IMO, this means a creative force must exist that animates matter and consciousness; and that could only have originated in that Singularity outside time and space which I in my particular need call the thought of \\"God\\". You can call \\"it\\" what you will: the Tao, Bhudda, Nature, et al.In my possession is a 1932 edition of \\"Creative Evolution\\" which had lingered on a library shelf over eighty years but had been checked out only three times after 1970. Sometimes I wonder where are my fellow philosophers and why I seem in my pained isolation to be the last of the 20th Century philosophers of mind. But that is because I am a crazed crackpot in the collective mind of those who measure men by their wealth. My contemporaries are in the universities, religious orders and lecture tours, where they belong. Yet even I am animated by the elan vital. Even I am part of the \\"God\\" finally perceived by Henri Bergson.\\"Creative Evolution\\" was a sensation when it first appeared in 1932, the work of an already distinguished Professor Bergson of the College de France. It gave the world at last a new and scientific conception of the God long intuited by prophets, priests, poets, writers and grizzled, scarred, aging gray bearded philosophers like myself, dumb beasts of intellectual burdens, who desperately need a new physics to help us embrace an unknowable God created out of a Singularity and connecting our minds and bodies to what the Apostle Paul called Love.Richard Lee Fulgham, Bel Air, 2009"},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"Despite Lord Russell's criticism that &quot;intuition works best in bats, bees, and Bergson,&quot; in this work Bergson not only finishes the uprooting of the Western and Platonic disembodied intellect (a deconstruction taken only so far by Kant), he presents us with the spectacle of unbridled life creatively shaping, not only its world, but itself in accord with its own telos: the need for eyesight creating the eye, so to speak. Difficult in places but a treasure, although one could wish he gave more credit to Nietzsche's obviously great impact on him. Jungians would do well to peruse Bergson too."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"I wanted to reread Henri Bergson's \\"Creative Evolution\\" after reading William James. Although best known for his development of pragmatism, James had a highly speculative side late in his career, and he praised Bergson highly in his book, \\"A Pluralistic Universe.\\" Although they have serious differences, both Bergson and James share an emphasis on a stream of consciousness view of the mind, and on the importance of freedom, chance, and indeterminacy.Bergson wrote \\"Creative Evolution\\" in 1907. At James' urging it was translated into English in 1911 in the still standard translation of Arthur Mitchell. James died before he could write the introduction he contemplated to the book. The book is one of the relatively rare works of philosophy that received a large and enthusiastic popular reception. Bergson became internationally famous and highly sought out as a lecturer for some years following its publication. In 1927, Bergson received the Nobel Prize for literature, a rarity for a writer whose only publications were in philosophy. By the 1940's, however, the book had become little noticed by professional philosophers and lay readers alike. Of late, there have been scholarly efforts to look again at Bergson.In one sense the early popularity of \\"Creative Evolution\\" is puzzling as sections of the book are notoriously difficult and obscure. The book left me cold when I first read it some years ago, but a second reading, after reading James, helped me understand where the book was going. Besides the lengthy technical discussions of matters ranging from biology to mathematics to the history of philosophy, Bergson was a master of allusion and analogy and of beautifully clear writing which pressed home his conclusions where his argumentation was dense and foggy. The writing is brilliant and poetic but makes use of loose metaphors and obscure thinking which lessens its value.Part of the difficulty I and many modern readers have with the book lies in its approach to the nature of philosophy and its relationship to science. As the title indicates, \\"Creative Evolution\\" is in part about Darwinism and evolutionary theory. Bergson wants to show that there is more to human life and to human evolution that can be accounted for by what he terms mechanism. In the process of developing his position, Bergson spends a great deal of space with Darwinian theory and, in places, with his objections to it. Most of his objections, especially with further developments in biology, appear not well taken and outside the scope of how philosophy should be developing its questions and making its arguments. If philosophy is concerned with meaning and with reflections on science rather than with the substance of science, Bergson in many places steps over the line. Much of the book appears to be based on a willy-nilly combination of philosophical reflection with scientific issues which lessens its appeal and which contributed to the eclipse of the book after its early popular reception.There remains much of interest in \\"Creative Evolution\\" to the extent that the book can be read as a reflection on the findings of science and on the possible limitations of science rather than as a critique of scientific findings. Bergson tries to find a way between a scientific philosophy of mechanism on the one hand and a teleological philosophy based upon ends and final causes on the other hand. Bergson develops a philosophy based upon duration and change -- the felt experience of the passage of time, which Bergson argues eloquently, cannot be explained either mechanistically or teleologically. Bergson argues that human endeavor and conduct cannot be fully explained by the methods of the natural sciences or, indeed, by any science as indeterminacy and freedom are at their core. He finds biological development for human beings was in the direction of freedom and intelligence. Intelligence, he argues, is basically pragmatic and related to physical, geometrical objects but does not exhaust human creativity. Bergson finds the source of creativity and change in time through a mysterious intuitive ability that tends to be covered over by practical intelligence. Here again, many modern readers, lay and philosophical, will demur to intuitionism. Bergson sees life as in its essential spiritual part as consisting in constant change and development in a direction that cannot be predicted in advance. In fact, every individual's development is unique.Here is a lengthy paragraph from near the middle of Bergson's book that captures something of his thought, his writing, and his concept of philosophy as both individual and communal. Other passages could be cited as well. Bergson writes (pp 209-210)\\"Human intelligence, as we represent it, is not at all what Plato taught in the allegory of the cave. Its function is not to look at passing shadows nor yet to turn itself round and contemplate the glaring sun. It has something else to do. Harnessed, like yoked oxen, to a heavy task, we feel the play of our muscles and joints, the weight of the plow and the resistance of the soil. To act and to know that we are acting, to come into touch with reality and even to live it, but only in the measure in which it concerns the work that is being accomplished and the furrow that is being plowed, such is the function of human intelligence. Yet a beneficent fluid bathes us, whence we draw the very force to labor and to live. From this ocean of life, in which we are immersed, we are continually drawing something, and we feel that our being, or at least the intellect that guides it, has been formed therein by a kind of local concentration. Philosophy can only be an attempt to dissolve again into the Whole. Intelligence, reabsorbed into its principle, may thus live back again its own genesis. But the enterprise cannot be achieved in one stroke: it is necessarily collective and progressive. It consists in an interchange of impressions which, correcting and adding to each other, will end by expanding the humanity in us and making us even transcend it.\\"In its approach, \\"Creative Evolution\\" is outside the mainstream of philosophy in the United States and in Europe and is something of a throw-back to German romanticism. The philosophical issues it raises, however, remain much alive. This is a frustrating, difficult book to read with valuable thought and insight intertwined with some unfathomable writing. It was a quirk that \\"Creative Evolution\\" became for a brief time a popular book. Readers who want to struggle with a difficult and in part outmoded work, may still find the effort worthwhile.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"Bergson (page 44) writes of foresight: \\"We must therefore have managed to extract resemblance from nature, which enable us to anticipate the future. Thus we must, consciously or unconsciously, have made use of the law of causality. Moreover, the more sharply the idea of efficient causality is defined in our mind, the more it takes the form of a mechanical causality. And this scheme, in its turn, is the more mathematical according as it expresses a more rigorous necessity.\\" This necessity could be the workings of a mechanical clock, with its gears and cogs, fully determined from the offering of our deductive thought that awakens.Then Bergson writes about the formation of generalities, that imply the workings of a plan: \\"... this natural mathematics is only the rigid unconscious skeleton beneath our conscious supple habit of linking the same causes to the same effects; and the usual object of this habit is to guide actions inspired by intentions, or, what comes to the same, to direct movements combined with a view to reproducing a pattern. We are born artisans as we are born geometricians, and indeed we are geometricians only because we are artisans.\\" This is a hindsight that differs from the aforementioned deductive foresight, but returns again to time in the form of a now inductive drum beat that becomes instinctive.Bergson (page 45) writes about the synthesis of these two tendencies: \\"Whether nature be conceived as an immense machine regulated by mathematical laws, or as the realization of a plan, these two ways of regarding it are only the consummation of two tendencies of mind which are complementary to each other, and which have their origin in the same vital necessities.\\" I may conclude that Bergson\`s vitalism recognizes the synthesis of deduction and induction, and as such it is consistent with the Trinitarian philosophy described in my book.Spirit, and the mystery implied by vitalism, is reduced to the deep mystery of time and its two windows. Bergson's vitalism appears to us as a great differentiation and fragmentation, followed by a division of labor. But the support given to our eyes to which appearance is given is a sentience capable of the most subtle awareness coming as hindsight, and this quality may go unnoticed in mere appearance that sees only differentiation.Bergson (page 112) writes about how plants and animals diverged, one giving themselves over to chlorophyl and sun-light interaction, and the other locomotion: \\"... the vegetable manufactures organic substances directly with mineral substances; as a rule, this aptitude enables it to dispense with movement and so with feeling. Animals, which are obliged to go in search of their food, have evolved in the direction of locomotor activity, and consequently of a consciousness more and more distinct, more and more ample.\\"Bergson (page 116) writes: \\"The harmony of the two kingdoms, the complementary characters they display, might then be due to the fact that they develop two tendencies which at first were fused in one. ... While the animal evolved, not without accidents along the way, toward a freer and freer expenditure of discontinuous energy, the plant perfected rather its system of accumulation without moving.\\"Bergson (page 140) writes: \\"instinct perfected is a faculty of using and even of constructing organized instruments [life-like]; intelligence perfect is the faculty of making and using unorganized instruments [machine-like].\\" Bergson tells us that insects perfected instincts, and humans perfected intelligence, representing two divergent pathways. Bergson (page 143) writes: \\"Here again, then, the greatest success was achieved on the side of the greatest risk [the path to intelligence]. Instinct and intelligence therefore represent two divergent solutions, equally fitting, of one and the same problem.\\"Bergson (page 149) writes: \\"Intelligence, in so far as it is innate, is knowledge of a form; instinct implies the knowledge of a matter.\\" Bergson (page 150) writes: \\"The two tendencies, at first implied in each other, had to separate in order to grow. They both went to seek their fortune in the world, and turned out to be instinct and intelligence. Such, then, are two divergent modes of knowledge by which intelligence and instinct must be defined, from the standpoint of knowledge rather than that of action. But knowledge and action are here only two aspects of one and the same faculty.\\" Bergson (page 151) writes: \\"There are things that intelligence alone is able to seek, but which by itself, it will never find. These things instincts alone could find; but it will never seek them.\\"Bergson (page 167-168) tells us of the unlikelihood of science ever understanding instinct completely: \\"The reason is that instinct and intelligence are two divergent developments of one and the same principle, which in the one case remains within itself, in the other steps out of itself and becomes absorbed in the utilization of inert matter.\\"However, what came as instinct in animals, comes as intuition in human experience. Thus intuition may give us some of what intelligence misses. Bergson (page 177) writes: \\"... intuition may bring to the intellect to recognize that life does not quite go into the category of the many nor yet into that of the one; that neither mechanical causality nor finality can give a sufficient interpretation of the vital process.\\" Nevertheless, the doorway points to the middle-term that holds our deductions to our induction, in my view. But can we enter?Bergson (pager 197) writes: \\"And for having tried to avoid the seeming vicious circle which consists in using the intellect to transcend the intellect, we find ourselves turning in a real circle, that which consists in laboriously rediscovering by metaphysics a unity that we began by positing a priori, a unity that we admitted blindly and unconsciously by the very act of abandoning the whole of experience to science and the whole of reality to the pure understanding.\\"Bergson (page 267) writes: \\"Consciousness in man, is pre-eminently intellect. It might have been, it ought, so it seems, to have been also intuition. Intuition and intellect represent two opposite directions of the work of consciousness: intuition goes in the very direction of life, intellect goes in the inverse direction, and thus finds itself naturally in accordance with the movement of matter. A complete and perfect humanity would be that in which these two forms of conscious activity would attain their full development.\\"Is humanity doomed to its intellect, unable to find the intuition we need? I think there is some room for optimism in the development of an intuitionist logic! We looked an inductive thinking already, and how it opposes deductive thought. Induction is as an instinct that follows the happy-go-lucky habits of life, and it is an already recognized human faculty of reason. It is induction that has a close associations with intuition, particularly when we discover a deduction that contradicts our blind expectations given to us by induction. Wayward induction is found married to its faulty deduction, and what holds the two together is a naked emotionality that may fall for the circular thinking that Bergson\`s warns us about."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"Why when Henri Bergson went to lecture to NY in 1913, his presence was celebrated like that of a famous actor? Why such a philosopher created the first traffic jam of the brand-new automotive age?

The whole framework is intended to refute the Kantian system, and illustrate the shortcomings of the empirical and rationalist traditions that brought about the Kantian system.Anyone who intends to read this book should know that Bergson wrote it at a time when Darwinism was \\"on its deathbed\\"; that is, right before Darwinism would turn the corner, moving toward, what would be, Julian Huxley's \\"New Synthesis.\\" Therefore, Bergson's work should not be viewed as a typical, modern assault on Darwinism, as Bergson's intention was to deal with scientific observables without the luxury of seeing how a process of natural selection could preserve and enhance structure. In such a historically unique state, Bergson developed a number of ideas about why evolution would have to be creative. Though I do not have any specialization in the field of biology, its philosophy, or its history, Bergson's ideas strike me as holding weight; and I would be very interested in hearing how knowledgeable philosopher of biology or biologist might respond to such points Bergson makes, like the peculiar reciprocity of function exhibited by photosynthesis in plant cells and respiration in animal cells. I hope this gives a taste of just how scientific and philosophical (and certainly not religious) Bergson's approach is in this work. I found it fascinating, and it led me to studying more of Darwin's work.Overall, I number this work among the most creative works I have ever read. In fact, as I was reading it, I immediately saw many, many philosophical idea that must have been influential to Heidegger, Deleuze, and Meillassoux. Furthermore, from the standpoint of Kant, I think Creative Evolution presented a few perspectives on Kant that I had not previously considered. All in all, I think this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Creative Evolution (The Modern library of the World's Best Books)","review":"Excellent copy and shipped fast.

His question: Is this the best way to determine the facts?An insightful, important work, whatever one thinks of his argument.

Simic's tone is flippant and unmistakably poetic; he can take the most ordinary situation and make a slick, subtle metaphysical comment about it (\\"On the Sagging Porch\\" is one of the best examples of this, as he takes a local president of the SPCA in a few beautiful stanzas makes Judas out of him). In fact he seems to have a better grasp of what the oft used and abused word \\"surreal\\" means then a lot of the original surrealists themselves; these poems are not word games or pretty images, but both employed into substantive, moving poetry that sticks to the mind. I think this collection as much as \\"The World Doesn't End\\" deserved the Pulitzer Prize. Anyone who loves challenging, consciousness altering poetry will become a devotee of Simic."},{"Title":"Walking the Black Cat","review":"Charles Simic, Walking the Black Cat (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1996)Pulitzer Prizewinning author Charles Simic is to dada what Clayton Eshleman is to surrealism; he's pretty much the sole light keeping it alive in the world of poetry in the present day. Simic, a hardcore imagist, is wonderfully precise in his use of concrete detail, which he then pulls completely out of the realm of reality by juxtaposing things which have no business being next to one another. Walking the Black Cat, a finalist for the National Book Award, is often considered one of Simic's finest works, and justly. There is much here to be enjoyed, mulled over, surprised at, and delighted with, and very little that dips below the level of brilliant.

Besides the familiar, readers will find here much interesting material they may not have seen before - for example: extracts from Shang Divination Records, Bronze Inscriptions, wonderful Buddhist stories, and so on.As for the translations, Mair tells us that almost all of them were done by &quot;professional sinologists teaching in American universities.&quot; These lightly annotated academic translations range in quality from the excellent work of scholars of the caliber of Burton Watson and Leon Hurvitz, through to the rather pedestrian efforts of the less inspired, in fairly equal balance. The selections are preceded by an interesting and informative 10-page Preface by the Editor, and a double-page Map of the Provinces of China.The book is rounded out with a table of the Principal Chinese Dynasties and Periods, and a Wade-Giles to Pinyin conversion table. Since this information is readily available elsewhere, neither of these tables are really necessary, though Mair is to be commended on his decision to employ a modified Wade-Giles system of transcription throughout the anthology, in preference to the &quot;extremely repulsive&quot; (Needham) Pinyin so beloved by most modern sinologists.Since Mair felt that they would be &quot;useless and out of place,&quot; no Chinese characters (sinographs) have been given for any of the Chinese names, book titles, etc. A far more serious omission is the complete absence from this book of an Index. We are given neither an Index of Names, nor an Index of Titles - not even a General Index in which they could been bundled together. We have not even been given a List of Contributors (there are over one hundred) except on the back of the dust-jacket where we learn that among the non-academic translators are luminaries such as Pound, Snyder, and Rexroth. This makes the book extremely difficult to use.Locating specific items involves repeated and tiresome searches through the 14-page 258-item Table of Contents. For example, Mair tells us in his Preface that because of its great popularity he has included some selections from Lin Yutang's translation of 'Six Chapters of a Floating Life.' But it will take you some time to find out where they are. And if, as I am, you happen to be interested in a specific translator such as Lin Yutang, since the translators' names are not shown in the Table of Contents, you will have to leaf through all 1300 pages to find their contributions. It will also take you a lot of searching to determine, for example, whether or not Lu Chi's 'Wen fu' (Essay on Literature) has been included in the book. So far as I can see, it hasn't - but I could be wrong. And if it hasn't been included, I wonder why?The book is stitched and well-printed in a readable font on excellent paper. Anyone who is looking for a comprehensive anthology of traditional Chinese Literature understood in its broadest sense, and in scholarly and exact (though not always inspired) translations with informative notes, will find much that is of very real interest and value in this book. I've enjoyed reading many of the selections, and have benefited from their brief and interesting notes.And Professor Mair is certainly to be more than commended on his decision to employ the older and elegant - though imperfect - Wade-Giles system of transcription, rather than the trendy and ugly - and just as imperfect - modern Pinyin system. But I do wish the book had included at least a General Index!"},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature","review":"The Columbia Anthology provides a fascinating glimpse into the work of traditional Chinese masters and novices alike for those of us who are armchair Sinophiles. The book is broken into genres which satisfies the academic and offers enough raw material to be somewhat overwhelming, hence the difficulty that arises in most anthologies. However, it is impressive in both scope and simple, poignant beauty with revealing insights into the Chinese world of court gentry and peasants toiling in the fields. Somewhat akin to the Norton Series of Western literature, the Columbia Anthology is not a venture to be transversed lightly. But in toil comes the sweeter stuff of dreams and traditional Chinese literature is the world of heavy eyelids drifting into mystical worlds both human and otherwordly. This book is highly recommended but not if you have an appointment to keep shortly after straining your arm dragging this beheamoth from the front porch. Tread lightly into this wonderful world but, dear reader, please tred."},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature","review":"Organized by genre rather than chronologically and with no index, complaints were made about the difficulty finding particular selections.Since i wasn't familiar with the literature, I wasn't searching much.

(Including \\"Tao of Network Security Monitoring\\" by Bejtlich.) But this \\"Real Digital Forensics\\" book breaks new ground. Not in the theoretical modelling of an attack or countermeasures against it. Instead, there are several indepth case studies, that key off data given in the book's DVD. And the latter is a DVD, not a CD. The authors needed the multigigabyte capacity to store the provided data. Even then, these are compressed. This should give you some feeling of the book's emphasis.The authors address a serious lack in this field. How does someone [you] gain experience analysing a real attack? Without already being employed at a company experiencing such an event? In response, the authors made several scenarios that, they claim, reflect what actual attackers would likely have done.This is an experimental book. There is no overarching elegant theory. You are meant to roll up your sleeves and tackle each case. En route, the book shows how, as a defender, you can use several open source packages to dissect the attack, as well as impose countermeasures. Which is another nice feature. Those packages are free. It makes your forensics education very cheap, in terms of explicit capital outlay.Which is not to say that the book ignores commercial forensic tools. But the authors have a clear preference for open source, with which you might well concur."},{"Title":"Real Digital Forensics: Computer Security and Incident Response","review":"There is a real lack of well written books in this category, and this one stands out because it is comprehensive, yet easy to digest and carefully laid out, including case studies to understand data capture and analysis techniques.The progression of the chapters mirror an investigative process; there is discussion of how to properly handle digital evidence, how to make a duplicate of the source data, and how to make sense of what you have collected. There are many real-world type case studies in the beginning of the book that could easily read off the front of any newspaper, and the captured evidence is on the included DVD for you to search to find the \\"smoking gun\\". Very well done.The book takes the unusual role of discussing not only the more popular commercial tools like EnCase or Forensic Tool Kit, but also all the open source tools available for free, which is a real plus if you don't have the deep pockets required for the retail products. The book also does an excellent job of explaining the advantages and shortcomings of all the products discussed, something not often seen in technical books. Along with the open source discussion are source web sites for downloading the tools. The accompanying DVD is packed with stuff to get you started. The book is filled with well illustrated screen shots to help you orient yourself when trying the programs yourself.Be forewarned, this book assumes a pretty reasonable amount of technical knowledge and while it addresses the commercial products available on the Win32 platform, a lot of tools and utilities referenced are written for Linux.

Chief among Heidenreich's accomplishments was that of imaging thin metal samples at a time when mostly biological materials or lift-off replicas were the most common samples imaged using TEM. In addition to explaining the essential points of diffraction theory (including dynamical diffraction theory) and imaging theory appropriate to the TEM, much of historical interest is addressed by the author. Actually, the book itself seems like the musings of a bygone era frozen in time.I had heard from my Bell Labs adviser that it was Heidenreich's work that first introduced Mike Whelan of Peter Hirsch's famous Cambridge UK research group, in a visit to Bell Labs, to TEM of thin metal specimens. In this book the author addresses his contribution to the imaging of thin metal specimens, providing an TEM image of 2 micron Al grains in Fig.III-6 on p.76 that was published in 1949. Heidenreich explicitly states that he was unable to make out dislocations at the Al grain boundaries, a failure that he ascribes to the low 50 kV accelerating voltage of the RCA-EMU used to record this image. Heidenreich believed that it was the removing of this limitation by the 100 kV Siemens Elmiskop-I that made it possible for the first images of dislocations to be recorded mid 1950's by Mike Whelan and others.This book has beautiful illustrations that remind me of the days when skilled draftsmen were employed for this purpose. The most glaring deficiency of this book is that each TEM image is not marked with a diffraction vector. In this way it is not as useful as Hirsch et al.'s truly classicElectron Microscopy of Thin Crystals.Heidenreich dedicates his book to Nobel Laureate Clinton J. Davidson, who, together with Germer, discovered electron diffraction at Bell Labs in the mid 1920's. Heidenreich traces his lineage to fellow Bell Labs employee Davidson. My adviser at Bell Labs traced his lineage back to Heidenreich. I, in turn, am happy to place myself within this same Bell Labs tradition!I was also interested to learn that Heidenreich had worked with Lorenzo Sturkey, though that was at Dow Chemical in Midland Michigan in the mid 1940's. Sturkey is another important figure in the history of TEM, as it was he who developed the scattering matrix approach to dynamical electron diffraction (a technique explained in sufficient detail in Marc de Graef'sIntroduction to Conventional Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cambridge Solid State Science))."},{"Title":"Twenty quick soups,","review":"i love soup and sandwich for lunch i have used a couple receipess from this and they turded out great"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I'm sorry to see that this book has been so poorly received by other reviewers. It is not a family book like Little Women or the Rose Duo, but this is a Louisa May Alcott classic that should not be ignored. If nothing else, the interaction between social classes in America, represented by the mothers of Jack and Jill is endlessly fascinating. Also, this book could appeal to both genders. Both boys and girls will be entranced with the train and mechanical images, and it's unusual to read a child's book and have such fresh descriptions...something perhaps owing to the newness of trains at the time. The three girls, Jill, Molly and Merry, and their plans for self-improvement can be seen in almost every young adult book marketed towards girls. What's refreshing about this one is that they're self-improvement is not for the benefit of their peers or to &quot;get a boy&quot;, but rather, Louisa May Alcott has them develop for their own personal growth. In an age when self-help books are on the best seller list, this book shows how it was done before it was a science. In addition, it's novel for it's intrerest in health fads and regiments, new school ideas, and the imporance of an American youth culture. Give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"While Jack and Jill might not rate as one of the best Alcott novels, it is not worth dismissing out of hand for that reason. As usual, she crafted a thought provoking and enlightened book that teaches as it entertains and comforts.Jack and Jill are fast childhood friends who find their lives interrupted by a terrible sledding accident which leaves both of them invalids. As they recover and heal, they and their friends learn important lessons about responsibility, giving and friendship. Jack and Jill should be an immensely satisfying read for pre-teenagers. The sure Alcott hand with character keeps even the most obvious moral lessons from feeling overly preachy.While the book is ideally suited for younger readers, grown ups will be interested in the larger issues raised here. Alcott firmly asserts the need for individual growth, gender equality, and personal responsbility. Historical discussions about temperance and higher education for women should additionally make this book a good read for history fans."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"This charming, old-fashioned children's story begins by mirroring the nursery rhyme. Two friends, Jack and Jill, go up a hill to go sledding. They come tumbling down, and Jack breaks his leg while Jill injures her back more seriously. The book tells the tale of their recuperation and also of their and their friends' journey into young adulthood. The book is slightly moralistic, in the way that Little Women is; the young people earnestly want to become &quot;good&quot; and to help their friends become &quot;good&quot;. Although this style is not in fashion now, it still makes for a sweet, hope-filled story. Very enjoyable. Also recommended: An Old-Fashioned Girl by Louisa May Alcott."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I've long been a fan of the lesser Louisa May Alcott books and now my daughter has discovered them too. I was pleased to find Jack and Jill available in this handy paperback by an on-demand publisher. My seventh-grade daughter pounced on the book first, in great excitement. It was a bit deflating that there was no book-specific cover art or back cover material--it is a standard, rather ugly cover and the back text advertises the publisher itself. But I guess there's no arguing with that part. Far worse, my daughter found a minefield of typos in the first few pages, which proved very distracting. Then she found that about 1 1/2 pages from 3-4 were repeated verbatim on pages 5-6. She showed me both problems and she was absolutely right: the printing process had gone completely haywire. There was no reason to expect these issues were confined to the first few pages, and we had lost faith in the whole edition. Regretfully, we have sent the book back."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"This book is an interesting improvement on the clasic nursery rhyme.With its twist of humor and sadness, Jack and Jill emphasises the value of friendship and the comfort that simple creativity can give.In spite of all these good qualities, I would rate this book as far from Alcott's best. It is too predictable and rather disapointing. Although less &quot;preachy&quot; than many of Alcott's books, the sermons are more direct and lack the pleasing maturity that gives such works as Little Women, An Old Fashoned Girl, and Eight Cousins their originality.All considered it is still a sweet, cuddle-up-by-the-fire book.

The story of the two friends never rises above the mediocre.The characters are so roughly sketched in that they certainly do not live in the book though the reader may be able to find similar characters in Alcott's other works. Rates high on my list only for the good, old fashioned values it tries to express but would probably be rejected by todays readers as being too preachy, a fault that does not plague Alcott's better efforts. On the whole a must only if you are a staunch fan."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"Louisa May Alcott writes such uplifting, encouraging, pure stories.Relaxing and a joy to read. No unnessecary drama or gratuitious anything.Will increase childrens and adults vocabulary."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I loved this book when I was girl! And as a parent, I loved reading it to my own kids. The children in the novel have exciting adventures and develop real and honestly portrayed friendships. They face hardships, difficult choices, and loss, and we watch them grow and mature with the help of loving parents and mentors.As a girl I was entranced by the descriptions of this long-ago world: taffy pulls, \\"theatrical\\" evenings organized by young people, \\"going Maying,\\" . . . And what an eye-opener to find out what a \\"Temperance Club\\" was! But the best thing about JACK AND JILL is the friendships, so lovingly and completely depicted.This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"A five star story.Jack and Jill has been one of my unsung favorites for many years. A stand alone story not one of a series. It is a good quick read with many of the time period's nuances. I am an Alcott lover and my favorites are not the Little Women series, but her other caricatures of young women. Eight Cousins, Rose in Bloom, An Old Fashioned Girl and Jack and Jill are all ones I re-read often. Simple tales of growing up many years ago. They are not the farm/wilderness tales of Laura Ingalls, but the precursors to the American Girl type books and in my opinion, much better.A one star edition.My complaint is that this particular edition is billed as a High Quality paperback edition. My original copy was my mothers many years ago and I was looking for a paperback to use as my re-read copy. This edition is in a horrid courier font with no formatting and the paragraphs are split by a return. To get to know and maybe love this story as much as I do...find a real book copy of it not this pretender that would put even those faithful to the story off.

But I read it off the Gutenberg project and loved it so much I bought it off Amazon. It's so sweet. Storyline similar to What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge, girl is stubborn, injures herself (well and jack), may be paralysed, after a bit of preaching, she decides to be good and she eventually heals but is better for the lesson. Sounds boring, but the characters are interesting and sweet. And they're believable.

While Jack and Jill recuperate from their injuries sustained \\"coasting\\" on the \\"lulla,\\" they mature and change, as do their friends, whose small projects to make their life better result in, if not in unimportant monetary wealth or fame, happier times to last them the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"Alcott has the amazing knack of entertaining while educating at the same time and you don't know you've been given a good moral to digest until its too late.

Beard","review":"When I was in graduate school Charles Beard was one of the figures that everyone loved to trash, but no one had ever read. Professors and their nodding students constantly pointed at Beard as an example of \\"determinism\\" or \\"reductionism\\" - someone who used a method of analysis that they politically did not agree with. Unfortunately, the current trend in academic history is to scorn any theoretical analysis at all and instead embrace the fad of \\"post-modernism.\\" In historical writing this means trying to get the subjects to speak for themselves and not to interject your voice or to pass any judgement or impose a grand theory over events - there is no absolute truth so how can you claim to have a true opinion they argue.Charles Beard helped to found the American Historical Review and wrote The Economic Interpreation to the Constitution - which has put all books since in its shadow. The books that followed this first classic became widely read best sellers. Beard wrote a grand narrative history of the United States from its founding to the 1930's - something very few historians of today would even attempt.Beard's work has been misunderstood and mischaracterized by people since the 1950's. Barrow's excellent book does a good job of identifying the real sources of Beard's framework and brings Beard's real thoughts back to life. I know of no other book that does this as well as Barrow's.Scholars of today will profit from this book, because it will help them rediscover a method of analysis that is a useful tool to understanding not only the past, but today.Beard's primary source of inspiration for his \\"economic interpretation\\" was James Madison's Federalist X. The economic intepretation is simple and logical, and can be summed up as follows:Economic relations - > class structure -> social actors -> events -> economic relationsEconomic relations - form the class structure of society - the social actors grow up inside of this structure - their actions and thoughts create the politics and state of society and also its culture and ideology - which in turn effect and can alter the economic relationsHardly a reductionist theory - but one that takes on an organic life of its own. I believe this is an excellent theoretical view of social life and goes further than \\"post-modern\\" type theories which only focus on culture and ideology and are truly reductionist models, because they go no further than where they start.If you are interested in serious history - history that goes beyond simply recounting events and biographies - you need a intellectual and theoretical underpinning that can be used as an interprative framework to understand what is behind the events that happen. This book will help you understand the thoughts of one man who did just that and was the most famous American historian of the first half of the 20th century. Hard to imagine a historian being truly famous, but he was. He was bigger than Stephen Ambrose during his time and was probably the most influential historian in American history. Only people close were Frederick Jackson Turner, Alfred Mayhan, or Henry Adams - and they were from the century before him.This is a good book. Clear and concise."},{"Title":"The Chinese Looking Glass.","review":"I've been reading and rereading this book for thirty-five years. China from a personal yet objective point of view (British journalist married into an old Chinese family), this is quite simply the best introduction to the subject I know anything about. It is beautifully written, interesting and exciting from beginning to end, and certainly one of the most memorable books on China you will ever read. If you are only going to read one book on Chinese culture and civilization, this is the book to read. But, believe me, you will not want to stop with &quot;The Chinese Looking Glass.&quot; Read Bloodsworth's book and you will be hooked on the subject for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Chinese Looking Glass.","review":"This is an excellent book for the person wanting to understand Chinese culture from an internal point of view. It helps explain why China's expirement with democracy didn't work and the country's attitude towards western culture. Although some of the information is outdated, it uses several thousand years of history to back up the author's assumption about Chinese attitudes and mores, including such controversial subjects as the Vietnam War and Japanese culture's debt to China. It covers such varied subjects as food, religion (or the lack of), clothing and technology and above all Chinese ideas about these subjects and the world around them."},{"Title":"The Chinese Looking Glass.","review":"how often we look into the mirror and only see warts and pimples beside gray hair and wrinkles and then react with disbelief and cynicism when somebody tells you how good you look. when stubborness was praised as perseverance ,when detachment was cooed as honest realism , when abstemiousness was admired as self-restraint maybe we do need to be so re-affirmed through a looking glass."},{"Title":"Trouble Becomes Her","review":"Life looks good to Sally Harrington as she now works for DBS News in Manhattan even though she is the key witness at Los Angels' high viz \\"The Mafia Boss Murder\\" trial. Sally's boss Alexandra Waring takes her off everything and assigns her to investigate her old mob pals, Presario-Arlenetta, so the show can produce a special. Choosing between mobsters whom she previously alienated and who almost killed her and advancement in the TV news world, Sally selects her career over safety.Perhaps if she knew what would happen when she agreed to hit New Jersey instead of Atlanta, Sally would have begged off the report. Soon a corpse is found in her trunk and someone tries to kill her. Fighting off males like her former boyfriend and her dazed intern just complicates life, but Sally continues to do what she believes is right even with in your face threats telling her to back off this case.The latest Sally Harrington romantic suspense thriller (see EXPOSE and THE LAST LOVER) is an entertaining tale that readers will fully enjoy because of the lead character. Sally's narration livens up a powerful story line. The support cast, which includes those at the TV, shows, the mob, and those people in her personal life (especially her dog) enable the audience to understand Sally while also propelling the yarn forward. TROUBLE BECOMES HER is a strong entry in a top series that should make Laura Van Wormer a household name for those fans who cherish a keen story starring a intelligent heroine.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Trouble Becomes Her","review":"Sally Harrington enjoys her job at DBS News in New York even if it does involve working weird hours, covering for a boss who is keeping her cancer treatments a secret, and frequent travel. When she's asked to work on a special on a Mafia murder case, Sally has qualms, however. She is expected to be called as a witness in the case. Still, as he boss explains, who better to present the news.When the police find a murdered body in the trunk of Sally's rental car, the story escalates from simple news to escalating danger. Sally's life is repeatedly threatened, yet she has no clue why anyone would be trying to kill her, nor how she manages to escape. Unfortunately, at this exact moment, Sally's love life explodes. Suddenly she finds herself with a student-intern with a crush, two men who want to reestablish former relationships, and a beautiful movie star who wouldn't mind broadening Sally's love horizons.Author Laura Van Wormer's writing is spunky and Sally comes across as a character--certain to provide some smiles to the reader. I found it disconcerting, however, that Sally worries more about where her relationships are going than about repeated attempts to murder her. In a mystery novel like this, I would have thought that Sally would have exerted more efforts toward either protecting herself or finding the truth about what is actually happening. In fact, other people provide her with this information without Sally having to take time out of her busy schedule.TROUBLE BECOMES HER is an enjoyable read that just misses clicking into high gear."},{"Title":"Trouble Becomes Her","review":"I almost hate to pick up a Laura Van Wormer book, because I know that nothing that I have to do will get done until I have finished the book.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Trouble Becomes Her","review":"Well, this is my second Laura Van Wormer read and I have not been disappointed. There is a funny heroine who has some deifinite issues with men, a lesbian work-a-holic boss, and murder. How can you lose? Instead of the usual who-dunnit the plot involves the mob. Really, it is quite good.

Von Wormer's style has matured since her first books (although she still uses &quot;and so&quot; on occasion - aargh!) and she still keeps me on the edge. This one is action and romance packed, that's for sure. However, I think Sally Harrington has run her course. Her priorities are not that well-defined and what I did see, I wasn't crazy about. Time to introduce a new powerful female lead and retire Sally to the newsroom."},{"Title":"And They Call It Help: The Psychiatric Policing of America's Children","review":"As a creative and depressed young adult struggling to understand myself and the world around me, I was sucked into the psychiatric complex and spent three years in and out of for-profit psychiatric hospitals, on and off heavy psychiatric drugs. The experience crushed my faith in myself and snipped threads of hope that linked me to the future.After my insurance ceased to pay for treatment, the treatment was ceased as well, and I was able to shakily resume the process of growing up. Reading _And They Call It Help_ gave me a socio-political and outside narrative background for why &quot;psychiatric policing&quot; occurs and why its natural effects in patients are a sense of disempowerment and helplessness.Put simply, this book changed my life. It helped me move on after my own run-in with the mind police. If parents considering in-patient psychiatric treatment for their children and others who work with children and young adults could read this book, trauma caused by common psychiatric abuse and manipulation could be minimized and alternatives to expensive and spirit-killing treatments would be better explored and practiced."},{"Title":"And They Call It Help: The Psychiatric Policing of America's Children","review":"This author takes on an interesting subject - the ethical dimensions of involuntary mental health treatment for children and adolescents - and totally mangles it.Her writing is given to hyperbole (including overuse of forceful italics) and is peppered with inflammatory terms (like describing a time out room as a \\"gulag\\"). In addition, the constant snarky asides to the reader are not only irritating and distracting, but also undermine the seriousness of the points she is trying to make.The author brings up some good questions about things like: the validity of psychiatric diagnoses; the validity of biomedical theories of emotional disorders; the effects of psychiatric labelling on children's behavior; and the ethical issues of locking kids up against their will for psychiatric treatment. However, the first two of these have been fairly well covered in a variety of works more in-depth than this one. The last topic seemed to be explored only briefly, through discussions of abuse in the psychiatric system, and stories of kids who were not mentally ill and were wrongfully hospitalized. Both of these things are serious problems, but they don't represent the core ethics issues of involuntary treatment.My biggest complaint is that she offers no constructive suggestions for improving, reforming, or changing the system in any way. Although she has a bone to pick with every form of mental health treatment out there (from medications to behavioral therapy), she doesn't have any idea of what else COULD be done to work with the kids she describes. She has clearly never spent any length of time with kids who have severe emotional problems. When she relates a couple of stories of kids' violent behaviors and then expresses her shock that they were (gasp!) taken to a time out room, one has to wonder how exactly SHE proposes to handle the situation.All in all, I'm hoping that someone comes along with a less hysterical, more measured consideration of this topic."},{"Title":"And They Call It Help: The Psychiatric Policing of America's Children","review":"The Child Called It is a wounderful book to read.When I started to read it, it took me only three days to read it.

One section, the questions, is divided topically into the major subcategories of physics; questions are numbered by category and then sequentially, such as 5.8, 5.9, 5.10... The answers to the questions are found in a separate section, using the numbers.

About a month ago, I suggested they do something about it. I may have even written to Walker. At last, the description is up to date. However, a week ago I just decided to buy the book and write a mini-review. I'm just going to say a few words though.It's a much larger format width/height wise. The answers are placed after the question and they are generally much longer responses than the first edition, which I thought were a bit too brief. These are completely new topics. The references are gone, but I do believe they are on his web site--in spades. There's quite a bit of supplemental info there. To find it his site just Google to \\"Jearl Walker\\" flying circus.I suspect another difference in the book is the questions seem to have gotten further away from common basic physics. For example, in his first book he poses the question why does the cardboard stay in place when you turn over a glass of water with a cardboard over its mouth? Of course, there are many deeper questions in edition one. Nevertheless, his questions are interesting in the second edition. He's punctuated the book with some fun \\"short stories\\" like fire-walking. The book strikes me something like the approach of Mad about Physics, which also pulls examples from (a) physics journal in the manner of Walker's first edition. I don't quite see the \\"conceptual\\" tone as in Paul Hewitt's book Conceptual Physics, or in Epstein's Thinking Physics.

But aside from that,I really liked this book. I think it was great that Anna got to keep Acorn. I would be so upset if someone took away my pony! Plus,Acorn is lively and sweet,so I think he and Anna are a perfect match! Acorn reminds me of my pony Lucky. They are both kind,courageous,feisty,and have a mind of their own! I hope you enjoy this great book!"},{"Title":"A Pony for Keeps (Pony Pals #2)","review":"I really liked this one!! It was werid to find out that Tommy owned Acorn!! I liked the part when she did her homework with Acorn. It was well written and more interesting than the 1st one. Anna was a good charecter and it had more plot twists. The drawings were good and it had a lot more exciting parts. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes ponies."},{"Title":"A Pony for Keeps (Pony Pals #2)","review":"Anna fears that Acorn, her pony, will be taken away from her because she has been getting bad grades.

And why do you measure them in hands? Everyone's hand is a different size! This book is really weird.

Anyway, I am twelve and I might be a little old to be reviewing a pony pal book, (I still secretly kinda like them) but the fact that the most recent reviewer obviously has no idea what they are talking about (in my opinion) is kind of bothering me. First of all, why don't people get the fact that ponies and horses are different because ponies are generally smaller than horses, but just because they are ponies, it doesn't mean that they are automatically small. (Read my previous review.) Second of all, just because someone is ten years old, it doesn't mean that they still can't fit on a pony. I take riding lessons and I am twelve years old. And to this day, I have never ridden a true horse. Just ponies. And I am not a puny person. I am above average in height and about average in weight so I'm no slimjim. Ponies are 14.2 hands or under and that is bigger than you think it is. Thirdly, Acorn shouldn't get his way all the time. It could be dangerous! I really hope that whoever wrote the previous review didn't truly believe that. I ride a difficult PONY during lessons and if I let him get his way all the time, I would have gotten hurt and so would other riders or their ponies and horses. Don't get me wrong, I would never, under any circumstances hurt a horse or pony. I sometimes hesitate to use a crop even when my instructors tell me it's alright.

The reviewer obviously knows little or nothing at all about horses. First of all, if Anna had let Acorn do what he wants, then he could have put both Anna and himself in danger. I mean, think about it. Remember when Acorn started charging up Snow White's back? If Snow White wasn't such a well behaved pony, then she probably would have kicked Acorn. This could have resulted in Acorn getting sore and Anna getting bucked off. Second of all, horses are not measured in hands literally. Each \\"hand\\" is equal to four inches. So if a horse is 16 hands, then he would be 64 inches tall at the withers. Thirdly, there is a difference between horses and ponies. A horse under 14.2 hands is considered a pony. Lastly, I don't mean to be a nitpicker, but you do not \\"leap\\" a pony or horse over a jump. You jump! I mean come on. Leaping a pony. That is funny.But this book was another good installment in the Pony Pal series.Just as a last note, that review was a \\"poor excuse\\" of a review."},{"Title":"A Pony for Keeps (Pony Pals #2)","review":"I think Anna is a really smart girl.

My cousin and I live on farms with ponies (and horses...there is a difference!) and, just like Anna, we know that the pony must be kept under control. Otherwise it's no fun! I just want to ask something. My cousin has two Shetland ponies who are really small-and full grown! We're both nine years old and I'm starting to out-grow Mona, my welsh pony.

Certain markings, like long phrase slurs and use of the word legato, are very un-Mozartean: they are clearly the work of the editor. Other edits, like appogiaturas written as regular notation, and certain post-trill ornaments, may also cause concern among Mozart purists.Despite these alterations, this edition -- like all other Dover piano books -- is excellent for playing. Once you open out the pages and press them into place, they won't drift back. The notation is printed clearly; the only sonata with readability issues is the 9th in D major. The inclusion of two &quot;new&quot; Sonatas (which did not appear in older editions) is an interesting surprise, but not necessarily a good or bad one.If you really can't stand to see Wolfgang's work altered by editors, then avoid this book and buy an Urtext edition instead. If, on the other hand, you simply want to play some melodious, intermediate piano music, then go ahead and buy this book -- it's the cheapest one out there. However, you would be well advised to check out an urtext version just to see where the editing changes are."},{"Title":"Complete Sonatas and Fantasies for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"This is a nice, reasonably priced edition of Mozart's sonatas. It also includes his Fantasies also. My biggest problem is that there are no fingerings present. Yes, the lack of excessive fingerings can sometimes be good, but there are absolutely none given in this edition. There are also some editorial changes, none of which are glaringly severe, but slightly annoying.Mozarts sonatas are a must for any classical pianist and a great teaching tool for the intermediate pianist wishing to advance to more challenging works. The Dover edition is fine, but you might want to examine other editions before settling on this one."},{"Title":"Complete Sonatas and Fantasies for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"The editing in this edition is not perfect; but in some cases there is some useful written-out appogiaturas (the ornaments that are usually indicated by symbols in the music.) If you are not familiar with how an inverted mordant should be played or the conventions of trills, the editing will do you until you listen to enough Mozart recordings of the great pianists and learn the Baroque and Classical conventions of ornamentation.This is one of those books that you could take with you and the piano to a desert island and have enough music to learn and enjoy for years."},{"Title":"Complete Sonatas and Fantasies for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"Dover versions sometimes can be really good. For example, for a lot of Dover's Chopin works, they use the Paderewski edition, the one most pianists use. But sometimes, as is the case here and with their Beethoven sonatas, one finds that Dover is not the best choice for the pianist. While Dover scores are sometimes a godsend because they're cheap and therefore, a steady diet of Dover can easily and quickly expand your music library, sometimes you may just want to shell out the extra cash for a better edition.Such is the case with their Mozart Sonatas and Fantasies. By far, the best edition out there is Henle, with Edition Peters a close second. Now, you won't find changes necessarily in actual notes; few publishers tamper with that anymore. But if you want to see Mozart's original notation--everything from his trills to every single staccato--that is, if you want an Urtext, get something else other than this Dover edition. And if you want fingerings--good fingerings--check out Henle.Still, if you don't have the cash for Henle or EP, and they can be extremely expensive, then Dover's is acceptible. But it's not an Urtext, and not always a good representation of what Mozart wrote. This doesn't bother everyone, and if it doesn't bother you, go for it."},{"Title":"Complete Sonatas and Fantasies for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"The type setting is way too small for this to very useful for sight reading.

Dan Shive is an incredibly talented artist and writer, with carefully constructed comics, detailed and in depth plots, and a wonderful sense of humor. Dan is especially talented in creating real life concerns and situations and fully developed characters in a world where science class experiments come to life and people regularly switch gender or species.The comic translates well to book form- the complex stories and on-going jokes seem to work better when the comics are side-by-side. Anyone who loves El Goonish Shive would be happy to have this book on their shelves, and anyone who is new to Dan Shive's world will soon be proud to call themselves a bunny."},{"Title":"Read Or The Owl Will Eat You (El Goonish Shive)","review":"I have been reading the web comic for a long time and its good to have something you like so much on the internet, in paperback form. It translates well into a book and I'd recormend it to a teenager with a vivid imagination, that is because you'll need it :)My only problem is that the book is monochrome, and the shading is a little off, but the resolution is good and the text is clear, all in all, well worth ten US DollarsI will be one of the first to buy volume 2"},{"Title":"Read Or The Owl Will Eat You (El Goonish Shive)","review":"El Goonish Shive (EGS) is a tough comic to classify. It has aliens, government conspiracies, mad scientists and parallel dimensions, but it isn't exactly Sci-Fi. It has martial artists with a taste for drama and special \\"trademark moves\\" that can do the impossible, but it isn't a kung-fu action series. It has even shapeshifters, magic users, and faerie-like immortals, but it isn't really Fantasy, either ... at least not in any traditional sense.At its heart, EGS is the story of a group of teenagers caught up in the middle of a bizarre set of circumstances. These characters face all the normal trials of growing up -- overbearing school officials, relationship troubles, unrequited love, struggles with sexual identity -- as well as some very abnormal ones, like self-proclaimed demigods and evil twins bent on world domination. Along the way they grow and change, both in themselves and in their relationships with each other.The bulk of this book reprints comics from the first eight months of EGS. By Dan's own admission, his artistic skills were pretty crude when he started, and while he improved markedly even over this brief interval, none of these reprinted comics match the clean, attractive style of EGS today (which can be seen in the short bonus story at the end of the book). Dan's strong talents for plot, humor and characterization, however, are clearly in evidence even at this early stage, and the events of this book built an important foundation for following the later stories.At $9.95 for more than 200 comics, this book is a bargain -- it's well worth the price for the portability and convenience of having the comics in book format. Dedicated \\"bunnies\\" (Dan's name for EGS fans) will also appreciate the 4-page bonus story, as well as Dan's commentary on some of the early comics.I recommend EGS to anyone who enjoys character-driven stories with a touch of the fantastic. Whether you're a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, chop-socky action or teenage drama, you'll find something to love in the pages of El Goonish Shive."},{"Title":"Read Or The Owl Will Eat You (El Goonish Shive)","review":"I have been reading EGS since 2003, it is absolutely my favorite webcomic, and with a few exceptions, the only one I have read since then, and the only one I can't help but check even when too busy to be into a bunch of webcomics.

By the end of this volume the art is...better, and by the end of the second it is much better. (Though you must suffer through the horror of the thick lined phase). After that (which by the way there has yet to be a volume 3, dammit), the art only goes uphill, until we hit where we are today, and Dan has become an amazing cartoonist, and realist in terms of body mechanics, and spacial consistancy as well! READ READ READ OR THE OWL WILL EAT YOU!As far as the books go, they are pretty much fantastic. Only gripe is that comics that were originally in color are now monochrome, though a he points out, Dan worked his butt off to make adjustments for better viewing pleasure (though Sarah's blonde hair looks light gray in formerly colored comics in contrast to being left white in comics never colored) Also, the binding isn't great, so take care of your books. My second volume has some very loose pages, but the first is kind of better.Now, PLEASE DAN!!! RELEASE MORE VOLUMES!!! AND SCREW WOWIO, I WANT THE REAL THING, EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE IN BLACK AND WHITE.

El Goonish Shive is an admirable blending of humor, over-the-top action, and even a fair amount of drama, all driven by a cast of characters one can truly become attached to. Though many of them start off as common comedic stereotypes (the brainy, bespeckled nerd, the macho girl, the cat... squirrel girl), each of the main characters undergoes considerable character growth and background expansion. The Sister arc, begun in this volume, and the later Painted Black are especially signficant in this develop, and are among the best portions of the series.El Goonish Shive may not be perfect, but it is well worth purchasing, and further reading online."},{"Title":"Covenant: The History of a Biblical Idea (Seminars in the history of ideas)","review":"I'm hoping my own re-thinking some important and favorite books might help reactivate my main theology blog and reactivate my life some, too. This time it's Covenant: The History of a Biblical Idea by Delbert R. Hillers, the book one of my seminary professors insisted we'd need to understand because otherwise we wouldn't *get* our seminary education. I didn't reread the book (yet), but glancing through it as a critter casually noms on browse made me realize it could be fun and even enlightening to read again in detail.Particularly in the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, sometimes referred to as \\"Old Covenant Scriptures,\\" throughout scripture we hear about the God who covenants, the God of covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, David... the God who covenants with each one of us in baptism. On a side note, the seminary I attended most properly would be referred to as \\"ecumenical,\\" and it's also one of the historic United Church of Christ seminaries. Some antecedents of today's UCC opined that God never had dealt with, interacted with humanity in any way other than by covenanting!Author Delbert Hillers observed that [page 87] \\"Outside the Bible, it is in treaties that we find ... a mixture of history and commands, and the present shape of the Pentateuch ultimately reflects the combination of narrative and obligation in the treaty.\\" In school we read examples of suzerainty treaties, purportedly the model for many of the biblical texts.Early on the author cautions, \\"A ... difficulty with 'covenant' is that it is not necessarily one idea.\\" [page 6] However (listen up, peeps!), on page 29 he lists the most characteristic six parts of a typical treaty: 1. preamble; 2. historical prologue; 3. stipulations; 4. provisions for deposit and public reading of the text; 5. list of divine witness to the treaty (a stone of witness often stands in just fine for the divine); 6. blessing and curses that frequently simply mirror each other.from page 80: \\"Democratization of religious responsibility meant that covenant traditions were keep alive in the individual family. This is a feature so characteristic of modern Jewish life, and of Christianity as well, that it takes an effort to recall that in the ancient East much of religion was a matter of the state: the gods were the gods of the city, and specialists, the priests, saw to the 'care and feeding of the gods' and preserved the liturgy and mythology of the temple.\\" Also, as we need constantly to be aware, in these texts and during that time there was no concept of secular in the rationalized dualistic sacred/secular dichotomy sense post-enlightenment Western people understand and almost comfortably exist within.Central to our understanding as Christians, [page 152] is the author's citing \\"Deuteronomy's brand of love... [as]...the mother lode of much other influential biblical teaching about love for God.\\" \\"Therefore, 'To love Yahweh' is linked inseparably with 'to serve Him.'\\" Page 154-155: \\"...the covenant of obedience binding Israel, and the covenant of promise binding Yahweh, were originally two separate things, not at all easy to reconcile with one another. In Deuteronomy, however, they are combined in classic fashion, so that even if the tension is not resolved, some of the essential features of both are preserved.\\" Briefly, the Abrahamic covenant becomes combined with the Sinai covenant: [Hear, O Israel,] Yahweh desired you and chose you because Yahweh loved you and because of lovingkindness for you, Yahweh redeemed you from Egyptian bondage.I enjoyed looking through this book and would love to facilitate a maybe weekly month-or-so-long adult study class on it and related biblical covenant texts. However, although you can copies on Amazon, they are expensive!"},{"Title":"A Mother's Touch: The Difference a Mom Makes","review":"When you read this book, it's like you get to peek in through a keyhole and see real moms full of courage with real kids who depend on her in everyday events: secure ones, hard ones, messy ones, silly ones. You even get to hear what the mom is thinking.... and come away stronger, more full of courage yourself. The pictures are stunning, unposed, full of life.As a mom-to-be, I got this book as a gift to my mom to say thanks for all she's done for me. I read through the book before giving it to her and found myself crying and laughing, but becoming stronger with each turned page.One of my favorite pictures is a black and white one on page 22. It's one of a little boy, touching his mom's nose as they play in a sandbox. Above it is this thought from a mom in Philadelphia: &quot;God miraculously sends the right child to the right mother. Nick and I like to count through all his cousins and friends and marvel that they all ended up with just the reight mothers..and how glad he is to have ended up with me!&quot;"},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"I read this book and Antonia Fraser's biography back to back, and was struck by the eerie similarities between the two--both had great affection for their subject, while recognizing her obvious flaws and foibles. Apparently, Antonia did not read Belloc's earlier work, she simply has a similar sensibility (no surprise, both being Catholic). Antonia is a great writer, and her treatment, being the more up-to-date (such as deciphering exactly why Louis XVI could not &quot;do the deed&quot;) deserves the nod. But Belloc is always entertaining and worth reading. Here, his judgments do stand up to the test of time; and he clearly had fun writing this rollicking biography. An overlooked gem."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"Belloc's erudite, opinionated and symphonically dramatic biography of the ancien regime's last, maligned queen feels like the work of a lifetime, yet it is only one of many dozens of books the author wrote during his very long and productive career. A social critic and Catholic apologist attuned to the notion of civilization in decline, Belloc is a wonderful temperamental fit with his heroine and her milieu. As you would expect, Belloc is at drawn sabers with the frivolous sophistication of the Enlightenment philosophes, and finds in the royal couple unlikely, indeed rather unintentional martyrs for what he usually calls \\"the Faith\\". His sense of the pair's underlying humanity only helps him, however, to place their acts of indecisiveness and overreach in a more alarmingly dramatic light. With every chapter one feels the underlying beat of Destiny's drum, marching us inexorably forward in the Queen's footsteps to the guillotine. Each apparent reprieve of fate, each seeming change of fortune only serves to tighten the coils even more. Belloc also has a great appreciation for the splendors of the time-- exonerating the Queen of most of the foolish exaggerations of her expenses that found such perilous belief in the minds of her subjects, he can still evoke the splendors of a ball, the rituals of the Court, the relief of an extravagance indulged, with terrific and memorable economy. That does not contradict, however, the luxurious Late Romantic template of his prose. Though Belloc, like his great friend Chesterton, is the sort of single-minded religionist who many persons, even of faith, might regard suspiciously as a \\"crank\\", his \\"Marie Antoinette\\" is, as historical writing, scrupulously scientific in its approach to evidence, though it is overlaid with a prominent, indeed firmly explicit, metaphysical agenda. For me, Belloc's assertiveness is one of his charms, and while I must firmly decline to believe some of his broad contentions, I am very happy that he has woven them into his work. There is hardly a page of \\"Marie Antoinette\\" without a substantive claim about broader humanity-- about education, economics, military affairs and their impact on events, public opinion, the theatre, the arts, the art of living, and of course on religion and philosophy-- and these are extraordinarily ponderable and noteworthy. Belloc finds in Marie Antoinette a tragic heroine for the 18th Century-- an era which, as he notes at the very beginning, was quite at odds with the very notion of tragedy-- and thus implies that Fate can choose to write us out a tragedy whether we will have it or no. In limning the life and downfall of this glittering princess, Belloc finds an Everywoman who yet remains, surprisingly, a Queen to the end."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"Hilaire Belloc tells the tragic tale of the storied Queen of France with style and a proper sense of wonder. Most particularly fascinating about Belloc's narrative is his detailed and clear description of the famous, or rather famous, affair of the diamond necklace. Here we see the true villians of the plot as the scheming La Motte and the nefarious Cagliostro, the dupe as the foolish Cardinal Rohan, and the quite uninvolved, but nonetheless tarnished target of the fraud, Queen Marie Antoinette. Belloc illustrates here quite clearly that the propaganda surrouning this rather absurd, and yet critical episode, emanated from Masonic London, the great enemy of thrones and order.In his preface, Belloc records his philosphy of writing history, which explains volumes about his unique style and his peerless position as a popular historian. Here, he writes thusly,\\"But undigested detail is of the very essence of academic or university history, as it is still conceived, because such an accumulation give the uninstructed reader an impression of prodigous learning in the writer. Now, in my conception of the way history should be written, not the writer but the reader comes first; it is the instruction, and even the pleasure, of the reader which should be the aim of historical writing, not the reputation of the writer for prodigious reading.\\"How remarkable! Writing in the early twentieth century, Belloc then correctly discerned a trend which has become ever so much more profound over the years. As a history undergraduate at a great American university in the third quarter of the last century, I could certainly attest that university historical writing was then so encumbered with meaningless detail and devoid of literary value as to drive the most motivated of students to other disciplines. We needed then, and still need more so now, historians in the great tradition of Hilaire Belloc.Read this excellent book. And be both enriched, hugely entertained, and well informed by the experience."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"This product was in great condition when I received it. Also, I received it in a shorter time then I expected."},{"Title":"Comedy (The New Critical Idiom)","review":"First of all, I should mention that I have a very specific reason for loving this book: I teach a course in Comparative Literature called Comic Spirit at a public university in CA, and after trying many of the available critical/theoretical/philosophical texts on the subject of comedy and humor, I've found this to be the best by far.Stott's essays blend interesting discussions of the work of major philosophers/theorists on comedy/humor (Bergson, Freud, Erasmus, etc.) with close readings of major comedic texts.I have two light critiques:1.) the book lacks truly global perspective, and focuses largely on Anglo-Euro-American traditions. This reflects my interests and goals in teaching, so this is not a shortcoming so much as my personal desire to see a broader perspective (of course, it can be said that the book is limited in length and therefore scope).2.) the film/media examples are limited to \\"classics\\" (think: Charlie Chaplin, Monty Python, Mel Brooks, Billy Wilder, Woody Allen, etc.), which are fantastic and give the book a feeling of authority, a mature distance from the baggy monstrosity and wild diversity of contemporary comedy film. That said, if you're looking for something to connect to contemporary film/media studies (and hence pique student interest by engaging their predispositions, if you're teaching), you would need to fill in some gaps.That said, after much trial-and-error, this is the book I return to for accessible writing style, broad coverage of what is becoming the critical canon of comedy thinkers, and clear exploration of challenging theories.Highly recommended too for writers of comedy who want to leverage a way of thinking about various approaches to comedy creation without all the lame rhetoric and packaging of \\"how to write comedy\\" guides."},{"Title":"Comedy (The New Critical Idiom)","review":"It's really hard to find decent critical books on comedy as they're either too specific or subscribe to just one theory. This one, however, is wide-ranging, up-to-date and smart and full of examples from tv and movies. It's got historical background, explains a ton of stuff and uses modern theories really well."},{"Title":"Arco Words for Smart Test-Takers (Arco Academic Test Preparation)","review":"I went overboard in purchasing GRE study guides.

It is the best overview I've found that clearly and concisely explains the various approaches scholars use to study Isaiah. Barton discusses the composition of the book, the historical and political background of Isaiah's time, and the moral and theological themes emphasized by the prophet.

It is not a devotional or theological introduction, but it is accessible to both students and general readers interested in the critical Bible scholarship on Isaiah."},{"Title":"The ABCs of Brazilian Percussion","review":"The visual examples for each instrument on the DVD are marvelous.

I guarantee you that if you were to spend a fortune for Pimsleur and Berlitz courses and learned to speak all the material presented those courses, you couldn't begin to say or understand one fourth of what is taught in this fabulous course. This is the beauty of the Language Dynamics method. It takes a fund of the most common high frequency words and uses them as a foundation for fluency, sort of like a template that you can manipulate yourself over and over in thousand different ways as you increase your fluency. If you're serious about learning to speak Italian, then don't waste your money on other courses. Invest wisely (and inexpensively) in a Language Dynamics Speed Italian course and get the fast results that this excellent course will provide for you."},{"Title":"Speed Italian (4 One-Hour CDs)","review":"This is an outstanding product. I just started listening to CD 3 today, and already I'm putting together sentences on my own based on previous material on the first two CDs. Before finding this kit, I tried Berlitz (with singing) and Eyewitness' 15-minute Italian. Both of those programs fall far short of the teaching technique used in Speed Italian. This program is actually working! Also the quality of the recording is excellent. I can clearly hear every syllable the native speaker pronounces (which isn't true of all CD programs), and they leave plenty of pause time for the listener to repeat the phrase or sentence. I listen to this all the time in my car now. I can't wait to go to Italy so I can carry on a conversation!"},{"Title":"Speed Italian (4 One-Hour CDs)","review":"I purchased this set to learn a bit of Italian for my honeymoon to Italy. What I really wanted was something that would quickly teach me some key survival phrases--and if that's what you're looking for this set isn't it. These cds will teach you basic italian language from a beginning level, similar to what you would have if you took an Intro to Italian 101 class. I purchased this 2 months before leaving, and in 2 months I learned quite a bit of Italian, and it was helpful in Italy. If you have, say, one week to learn some key phrases I don't recommend purchasing this particular cd set. However, if you have some time to learn & practice like I did, then this is perfect. It's also very convenient in that you can learn while you drive--though stressful driving or high traffic areas make it too distracting. In my town, \\"heavy traffic\\" is 10 - 12 cars on the road and so for me it was easy to pay attention to the cd while driving. I give this 4 stars because it really worked well for me in the 2 months I used it, but it doesn't come with a book or manual & some words are a little difficult to hear the pronounciation of. For example, the woman on the cd says what sounds like 'voy-yo' (I want) & what she's actually saying is 'volio'. I only knew this because I happened to have a book. But even if you don't have a book to double check spelling/pronounciation your Italian will still be about 90-95% accurate.

The books is rather another of the &quot;sisters meet Vatican II' style written from the point of few of a Catholic-educated, nonpracticing Catholic.The focus of the book is on what it means to be called; initially the author works from the premise that &quot;called&quot; means primarily called to religious life. At the conclusion, her primary insight is that ones &quot;call&quot; may be to a particular aspect of secular life.She traces her slowing change view of nuns and call primarily through sisters she knew as a child or young adult - most of whom left the order. By not including some of those who joined the order after the substantial changes (for example, one who serves as a hospital chaplain), she fails to explore what a &quot;call to religious life&quot; means today. This results in an understanding of call that is primarily individualistic in a church that is fundamentally communal. The author is also sloppy in her Catholic terminology, sloppy in a way that reveals that her research assumed as a base the Church from which she was estranged rather than the Church of today. An example: she refers to the nun serving the King County Jail as &quot;saying Mass&quot; a role reserved for ordained priests rather than the more accurate &quot;presiding at a Eucharistic service&quot;.What the book truly is a memoir-exploration of a non-practicing Catholic sifting through her childhood with adult eyes, using the nuns who taught her in school as a catalyst for this exploration. In this exploration, we learn the stories of several young nuns who entered and left the order. We learn the stories of some who stayed, who redefined what it meant to be a nun (Dominican sister to be more precise). Those who stayed are presented rightly as remarkable people facing the world squarely in the face - assisting in jail, in urban social services, in hospitals, in rural Hispanic populations ...The writing is such that you get a sense of who each person is in a very short section which leaves you wanting more or leaves you chuckling about the description if you know the individual described in person or through books. For example, she briefly mentions Fr. Joseph as becoming charimatic - Fr. Joseph has written and self published a delightful biography.I recommend the book as a delight insight into a particular side of Catholic childhood and female religious orders. I am concerned that some readers may mistake the book for a more universal statement."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"I find it hard to believe that the author was ever \\"almost\\" a nun. This rambling memoir gives no insight into the vocation, and is blantantly wrong on a serious matter of theology, e.g. The Immaculate Conception. This church dogma refers to Mary being born with without original--immaculate at HER conception. It does NOT mean \\"she was not defiled in the process\\" of conceiving Jesus! This is a basic tenet of the Roman Catholic church, and one that jumps out at a reader with a background of religious education."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"I enjoyed this combination memoir and history of an order of nuns. I am a Protestant with a keen interest in what makes religions tick, and this book did not disappoint. I now know why my Catholic-school friends used to tell me that I would go to Hell because I was not Catholic - they were taught this in school. Ms. Whitney provides what seems to be a relatively complete history of the Rosary Heights Dominican order, illustrated with histories of the lives of different sisters in the order. Her own childhood as a Catholic school student provides a good backdrop for this history. She is a lapsed Catholic, and although she portrays her own history lovingly, one does not get the sense that after this year she embraces Catholicism. There is a bit of &quot;New Agey&quot; spirituality in here. Ms. Whitney does an excellent job of portraying the &quot;calling&quot; of the nuns as something mysterious that is reserved for a chosen few, but then she goes on to equate this &quot;calling&quot; with a selected vocation. This doesn't ring true - I don't think people are called to be nuns in the same sense that a person may attend college to become an accountant. This criticism aside, this is a good book and I think that I have a better appreciation for the way Catholicism works now."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"The overall sense I received from this work is that Catherine Whitney is more interested in speaking of herself (without so much as answering the question of why she suddenly shifted from would-be religious Sister to unbelieving radical feminist).

She exposed her own misgivings and feelings very clearly and chronicled (nicely) her own spiritual quest."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"If you are expecting this book to tell what motivates sisters, what they do, and how they have adapted in the post Vatican II world I would suggest you read Poverty Chastity &amp; Change by Carole Garibaldi Rogers instead.

Vignettes of the Sisters are used to show the changes in the lives of the nuns after the Vatican 11 Council which called for renewal in all areas of the nuns lives. Despite being part fiction and part non-fiction, the author manages to capture the authentic spirit of the nuns today. Even after 2 reads, I am beginning to read the book again. There are so many pearls of description, vignettes of personalities, and witticisms that are not caught on a first read."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"This book is a mishmash, and is poorly named, particularly the subtitle (maybe the publisher chose it?). It's interesting and heartfelt, and obviously the author cares a great deal for the subject.

That's the Virgin Birth.The word \\"discalced\\" does not mean anything \\"literally\\" about poverty. It means \\"shoeless.\\"The correct name of the high school in Seattle is not \\"Blanchette\\" but \\"Blanchet.\\"She has no bibliography and cites no sources for her information.Interesting and heart-felt, but not a work of scholarship, which is a pity."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"Catherine Whitney's The Calling was one of the biggest surprises I've had in a long time. If you read the acknowledgments, you discover that the author is a strong and reasoned critic of many of the restrictive and antique policies of the Church. Once in the body of the work, an astonishing transformation occurs, as Whitney sweeps us with her to another time and another place so completey that you begin leaning over in your chair to make room for your guardian angel. I could smell the chalk dust in the parochial school room of her past. And the book is funny as well as insightful. I became so absorbed the first time I read it I could hardly put it down. It's no crime thriller, but what a fun read!"},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"I particularly enjoyed reading the sections that looked back at how and why women joined the Order.

I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"The book rambles a lot. The subject inside has nothing to do with the title. I was pulled in by false advertizing on that alone. I felt like I was invited to an old country estate and left outside to look in the windows. The interesting vignettes are far and few between, and the reader never really gets to know the characters well. I don't know the author, presumably who is the center point of the book. There are better books that discuss the decline in religious life, or chronicle individuals who have lived out their vocations.Perhaps \\"The Calling\\" will be a better read for someone else."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"The reviewer below notes that the subtitle is a bit misleading and I agree. I was expecting the story of one woman's time spent in cloistered seclusion. The story that unfolded, however, was far more intriguing.

The title itself was also misleading as I thought the book would be about an individual who spent a year living with a community of nuns. Instead this was a frustrating combination of fiction, memory and (doctored?) interviews.Despite all that, I would have to admit: I'm glad I read the book.

Apart from factual errors about the history of the community she is writing about (who in the world edited this?), &quot;The Calling&quot; is less about &quot;a year in the life of an order of nuns&quot; than a self-absorbed, shallow &quot;journey&quot; toward....? Who knows? In any event, the account focuses more on the author than the sisters (not nuns)--most of whom are only superficially drawn, and many of whom get lost or forgotten in the course of the narrative. And the author's own &quot;journey&quot; is certainly not toward faith or anything deep but, it appears, toward some sort of ungrounded self-affirmation. As one who has spent a lot of time in convents and knows hundreds (thousands?) of sisters, this book leaves at best a limited, and at worst a misguidedly stereotyped, image of religious life in both the past and the present. If this is all you ever read about sisters, do not assume that you now &quot;know&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; anything--except, perhaps, about the author!

Little cries about a &quot;different&quot; sort of book - just go where it leads you, etc., can't defend jumping around from anecdote to anecdote and then measuring EVERYTHING by herself and her shutdown life. All that glory and all she can do is go over and over how she was &quot;rejected.&quot; I really enjoyed the stories of the nuns, though. Staying or leaving, they gave us glimpses of women of depth and wonder. I've never been a Roman Catholic but I'm a Christian.

It is not, as its subtitle implies, an ethographic description of life behind convent walls. It is, instead, a telling of the personal and spiritual journeys taken by a cross-section of women. Most of these women were at some point &quot;Called&quot; and spent at least part of their lives in the convent at Rosary Heights. But others, including the author, are more loosely connected to the religious life. The fascination of this book, and it is fascinating, lies in the diversity of the women themselves and in the author's ability to set their thoughts and actions firmly in the cultural milieu in which they take place.The author presents each woman's story with great respect and affection, and as you read, you too will come to appreciate those who have heard and responded to &quot;The Call.&quot; Many books of this genre leave us feeling that to succeed in the religious life one must be or become meek, subservient and narrow. They led us to believe that the convent is not a place for the stong, the independent and the courageous. This book provides a broader perspective. Perhaps many a true feminist finds her freedom and nutures her strength within the convent walls."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"When Whitney went to the Pacific Northwest to interview the Dominican sisters who had shaped her childhood, she met far more than old teachers in a community that was struggling to find its place in the modern world. She confronted her own loss of faith and began a personal quest for spiritual identity. The Calling is a penetrating analysis of the Dominican sisters who had been a significant part of the author's life from grade school through high school. It's also a journey inward. All this said, The Calling is not a ponderous, self-absorbed examination of conscience. With honesty, humor, and an obvious affection for the nuns, the author opens the doors to a modern religious community, and lets us inside. Through the personalities she remembers, she moves from past to present with ease, and with a style that reads like chapters in a novel. It's a great experience."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"I got this book because as a post-Vatican II Catholic, I wanted to know what type of life nuns had. I never went to Catholic school and my parish really never had any nuns present. To date, I still don't know! This title is very misleading. The author did not chronicle a year in the life; she took anecdotes from various nuns of their personal experience with their vocation. Also, one should be warned that the author is a lapsed Catholic with some bitter feelings toward the male hierarchy of the Catholic church that she has not resolved. Most of the anecdotes in this book are by women who left their orders because they were dissatisfied. Overall, the book was well-written and kept me very interested, but I believe the title is completely misleading and will cause more people to buy the book than normally would have, myself included."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns","review":"I found this book to be extremely readable and engaging but also frustrating and not quite believable.

Catherine Whitney's book brought back many memories of that time. I appreciated the way she dealt with even the negative parts in a non-judgmental way.

There were times I laughed aloud, remembering my own Catholic school days. Many times books of this type resort to veiled &quot;nun bashing&quot;. We tend to focus on Sister Matilda, the drill sergeant, who rapped our knuckles with the ruler! Ms Whitney, however, portrays these Nuns as real, human women who are continually growing and rededicating themselves. Though their numbers are fewer at this time, they are reaching out to others in more diverse ways. Many of the women who left the Convent seem to still have a bond with the Nuns. This speaks well for Religious life! The author's own spiritual journey, woven throughout the story, was thought provoking and touching.

The material seems to genuinely engage the writer and her collaborating editors. They know that so-called inside stories about nuns make hot copy . One does not get a sense of serious archival research into the history of nuns; rather one catches echoes of snippets from journalistic sources. Better read Kathleen Norris' &quot;Dakota&quot; or Patricia Hampl's &quot;Virgin Time&quot; for realism with depth into what occurs in monasteries and convents. Instead of the pages in this book on prison minstry, take a look at Helen Prejean's &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; or even see the film. This is a poor book by &quot;non-fiction&quot; standards and merely exploits stories perpetuating images of nuns as romantic, immature, ignorant, and gullible. It is trash."},{"Title":"Blackbird","review":"This is a book that forces you to look beyond the surface at your real self, thoughts, prejudices and preconceptions. It confronts and challenges your assumptions as in the essays about homophobia or black on black crime. It also reminds us that in many ways, African Americans, have surrendered our power and our history that could solve some of our current day dilemmas, when all we need to do is embrace our history and use it as a stepping stone to a more positive future. It's timely and universal and what happens is Louisville is true for America everywhere. It's not only a good read all at once, but like a favorite dish, it can be savored and enjoyed again and again."},{"Title":"Boyhood Daze: An Incomplete Guide to Raising Boys","review":"I am the mother of a red headed 5 year old boy.

Boyhood Daze is very funny, amazingly practical (in a wierd sort of way!) and a great encouragement. Dave has a way of communicating the agony and ecstacy of parenting in a delightful way. He has a tremendous gift for humor... he's hysterical! Boyhood Daze points the way to what's really important... a relationship with God is the most meaningful thing you can have in raising kids! We haven't heard the last of this guy, Dave Meurer. I look forward to reading his next book!"},{"Title":"Boyhood Daze: An Incomplete Guide to Raising Boys","review":"I read a prereleased copy of this text and found it to be very funny. Meurer has the ability to take everyday events in the lives of parents and children and help us take them a little less seriously.

This book was a wonderful insight into the mind of the male and definitely helped me understand (as the only female in a house with four males) some of the intricacies of the male psyche.Dave Meurer is a wonderful author and the intermittant mentions of God and christianity were nice and didn't come close to the stuffy, cram-it-down-your-throat level that some authors seem to take.I highly recommend this book, if only for the enjoyment of reading the story about Dave when he was a child and the fireworks. Hilariously funny."},{"Title":"Boyhood Daze: An Incomplete Guide to Raising Boys","review":"Dave Meurer has a way with peering into the thinking of boys in general. He can take an everyday happening and turn it into a hilarious encounter. His reflections about life in general are on solid ground, something that is sadly lacking in many of today's advice-givers. You cannot read his book and go away without thinking about how so many of life's situations must seem extremely funny in God's eyes. I hope that Meurer continues to use his insight and uncanny ability to see humor in life with boys."},{"Title":"Boyhood Daze: An Incomplete Guide to Raising Boys","review":"I received a pre-pub. copy of the first Chapter... &quot;The Ballistic Diaper.&quot; I can't wait to get the rest of the book.

To my delight, it was everything I had inticipated, and more. This passionate account of Lewis and Clark's expedition, is impossible to put down. Wyman's character development is exceptional. This historic crew came alive for me as I followed their labor-intensive adventures from Missouri to the Pacific Ocean. Throughout the book, the emotional account of their tragedies and triumphs literally kept me awake and turning pages, long after my bedtime. I am anxious for Wyman to complete another book. Judging by her first two novels, I'm a fan hooked for life!"},{"Title":"Shining Mountains, Western Sea: The Epic Adventures of Two Unforgettable Members of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery","review":"This novel tells the story of the expedition of Lewis and Clark across early 1800s America, but not from the usual perspective. It doesn't use the point of view of Lewis or Clark, but those of John Colter and George Shannon, two Privates on the expedition.Colter is an experienced mountain man and hunter, and Shannon is an inexperienced graduate of West Point, who tries, unsuccessfully, to get promoted to Lieutenant. The two Privates have an on and off relationship, ranging from tolerating each other to, figuratively, wanting to kill each other. They also have reasons for wanting to be away for a long time.The expedition is one day after another of very hard work, rowing or pulling their boat upriver, hauling supplies down the side of a waterfall, or walking for days without seeing another person. Shannon's paralyzing fear of deep water is no help. Colter seriously considers abandoning the expedition, and joining a much more lucrative one, but his conscience gets in the way (he made an oath to the expedition). Also holding him back is another member of the expedition, Sergeant Ordway, who seems to have made it his personal mission to make Colter's life a living hell.Some of the Native American tribes encountered along the way, who Colter would rather avoid at all costs, are decent and reasonable, while others are simply bloodthirsty thieves. Among the former are the Mandans, near whom the expedition makes camp for the winter. It seems to be almost a point of honor among the Mandans for their women to be intimate with the \\"paleskins\\" (the men of the expedition are happy to oblige). Against his better judgement, Colter meets, and falls very hard for, a recently widowed woman named Fragrant Grass.Every waking moment of Colter's life, after the expedition continues on its way, is filled with thoughts of Fragrant Grass. Several chances to desert present themselves, but Colter's conscience again gets in the way, along with Sergeant Ordway. They reach the Pacific Coast, spend a miserable winter there, and Colter gets back to Fragrant Grass, only to discover that she is no longer \\"available.\\"This is a fine piece of writing. The author does a good job with the characters, and with showing a famous bit of American history from an uncommon perspective. My only criticism about this book is that the length could have been reduced by at least a few pages. I understand what the author was trying to do, and this is the sort of story that takes a long time to tell, but, personally, this book did not have to be 671 pages long. Don't let that get in the way of reading a really interesting story."},{"Title":"Accounting For Dummies","review":"Accounting for Dummies is an excellent book for dummies to understand accounting practices, not necessarily perform accounting yourself.

Scheflin and Edward M. Opton, Jr., published in 1978, is a fascinating account of the technologies of mind manipulation that are being used to subvert man's freedom and reduce him to a slave of his manipulators. Although somewhat dated, this book nevertheless remains very important for those who wish to understand the technological advances which have made possible mind manipulation and mind control on a massive scale. The book looks at cases of mind control including \\"brainwashing\\" and psychiatric coercion, emphasizing especially the role of individuals in the government who have sought to control the masses through these methods. The book also shows the use of mind manipulation among individuals deemed \\"efficiency experts\\", for police surveillance, and in the prison system. The book is neatly divided into chapters with titles such as the following:Assaulting the Mind: The Rise of Mind Manipulation - provides an overview of the rise of mind manipulation, emphasizing its beginnings among \\"efficiency experts\\", including remarks on the Moscow Show Trials, and the CIA's role in mind control experimentation.Laundering the Mind: Brainwashing - begins by examining the brainwashing phenomenon within communist countries, including the supposed brainwashing of Korean POWs, the brainwashing of Cardinal Mindszenty, and the emphasis on both Soviet and Chinese brainwashing. Also, this chapter includes a discussion of Charles Manson (arguing that his control over his followers was not actual brainwashing), the rise of religious cults (showing the role of cult deprogrammers and the conflict between freedom of religion and \\"freedom of thought\\"), and Patty Hearst (arguing that she was not actually brainwashed). In particular, there is evidence to suggest that Charles Manson was influenced heavily by such cultlike systems as Scientology and Dale Carnegie's courses, as well as science fiction writer Robert Heinlein. The authors conclude that the concept of brainwashing may itself be a form of mind manipulation.Tampering with the Mind (I): The CIA - emphasizes the role of the CIA in unethical experiments on mind control, under such programs as Project BLUEBIRD and MK-ULTRA. The authors provide evidence to show that the CIA experimented heavily on various mind control techniques, particularly emphasizing the use of LSD and marijuana to induce mental states in individuals supposedly facilitating mind control. The authors show some of the harm that arose from these programs including the death of Frank Olson, who was given LSD without his knowledge which may have led to his suicide, and the horrendously unethical drug experiments of George Hunter White, a narcotics officer who experimented with drugs, giving them to unsuspecting individuals through surreptitious methods.Tampering with the Mind (II): The Army - the authors fully discuss the role of the U.S. Army in mind manipulation especially unethical experimentation with LSD. The authors note the role of the CIA in many of these projects and show the harm they caused including torture of individuals and permanent mental problems for those concerned.Ruling the Mind: The Marriage of Politics and Science - the authors show how mind manipulation arose from a philosophy which viewed man as a machine, emphasizing the worldview of behaviorism beginning with such individuals as the Russian scientist Pavlov. The authors also discuss the development of the CIA and the role of the CIA in politics. Indeed, the CIA may have attempted to develop mind manipulation technology so as to effectively compete with the Soviets who were believed to already have this technology. This led to a whole host of unethical experimentats.Amputating the Mind: Lobotomy - the authors discuss the use of psychosurgery as a supposed answer to mental disorder. The authors show how the lobotomy procedure became commonplace and easy to perform on many patients at a time. The authors also show the danger of this procedure and its resulting in permanent brain damage.Pruning the Mind: The New Psychosurgery - the authors discuss the role of psychosurgeries within psychology including especially stereotaxic procedures. The authors show the harm that these surgeries have caused, including permanent brain damage, as well as their potential use as a form of mind manipulation and political control.Rewiring the Mind: Electrical Stimulation of the Brain - the authors discuss the stimoreceiver, an invention of Dr. Jose Delgado, who allegedly used this technology to directly control moods through remote control and stopped a bull from charging with a remote control device implanted in its brain.Blowing the Mind: Electroconvulsive Shock - the authors discuss the harm and brain damage that may result from ECT therapy, and the use of this therapy as a panacea for all mental ills.Castrating the Mind: Sex Control - the authors discuss the use of castration as a means of control, including both actual castration, brain castration, and chemical castration. The authors discuss the unethical nature of this treatment.Robotizing the Mind: The Quest for the Manchurian Candidate - the authors discuss the CIA's alleged attempt to create the perfect mind control assassin. Based on the novel _The Manchurian Candidate_ of Richard Condon, the authors show how the CIA was involved in projects aimed to create a perfect mind controlled robot. The authors discuss the case of Candy Jones, who allegedly was mind manipulated by the CIA. The authors also discuss the supposed role of the CIA in such political assassins as Sirhan Sirhan. In addition, the authors discuss the role of hypnosis and the attempt to create multiple personalities in individuals using hypnotic techniques. While the authors conclude that in theory such creation is not possible, they note that it may still have been tried by the CIA and resulted in much harm.Asserting the Mind: Repudiating the Mind Manipulators - the authors note the use of propaganda and electronic surveillance as a means to control. The authors repudiate the mind manipulators and argue that it is necessary to assert oneself in order to fully overcome their control and make self-governance a real possibility."},{"Title":"The Mind Manipulators: A Non-fiction Account","review":"While the book is not dealing with current issues of behavior modification, there are enough cases presented and enough sources cited to prove behavior modification is a reality. Every aspect is covered in a thorough manner from covert mind control to subtle overt society changes to Chemical Biological Warfare.I really enjoyed the sections dealing with deliberate government intervention in modifying the countries outlook on the cold war. It not only showed that the cold war was fabricated, but that it was invented for malicious reasons.A fascinating piece of work, well documented and well written. I wish there were more like it for current issues of a more covert nature.Milton Bernheisel"},{"Title":"The Great Black Dragon Fire A Chinese Inferno","review":"Twenty-five years ago, a gigantic fire destroyed the larch forests either side of the Black Dragon River (usually known in English as the Amur) in Siberia and Manchuria. In later years, big fires in Southeast Asia got plenty of attention, with reports aided by easy-to-obtain satellite pictures.Just 25 years ago, the world was much different. More than 90% of the Black Dragon fire was in the USSR, and despite glasnost, next to nothing was reported about it, and no reporters got in. China, though, provided a lot of coverage to its people, and later one western reporter with a lot of experience in China, Harrison Salisbury, was given wide opportunities to visit the fire region and talk to the people who lived there.Salisbury grew up in Minnesota logging country and found that the story affected him emotionally more than any other he had covered. Also, that frontier logging towns in China and Minnesota are more alike than they are different.He cited outside silviculturalists as rating the fire as \\"an act of violence akin to nuclear war.\\" That is way over the top; for one thing, only a few hundred people died. But despite his emotional involvement, Salisbury kept his reporter's hat on straight and produced not just a story about the fire, but a critique of the Chinese reporting of it.For a country with no experience in news reporting, they did a pretty fair job of it, although not without some failings.There are a number of lessons here. One is the difference between the Russian and the Chinese approaches. The Russians made no effort to fight the fire, on the theory that they wouldn't need to harvest that area for a hundred years, and by then the valuable lumber trees would be back.Maybe. The North American experience has been different. A much smaller fire in Minnesota (only a million acres) 90 years ago has not seen the forest come back; the area, said Salisbury, is still scrub and weeds.The Chinese were worried that the first succession species, aspen, would not be naturally succeeded by valuable larch.In 1990, the Chinese government was making plans to assist the recovery of commercially valuable trees. Salisbury was pessimistic about their chances.Had he been able to foretell the turn of China toward market-oriented policies, he probably would have been even more pessimistic.Whether actual replanting and silviculture would have worked remains a question. What happened, though, was that for-profit scamsters torpedoed the replantings.In the past year, a bearish analyst based in Canada, going by the name Muddy Waters, exposed the fact that millions of acres supposedly replanted in both northeast and southwest China (the only parts of the country with significant natural forests) were not planted at all.Among the suckers caught in this plot were John Paulson, the famous bear who made a billion off the collapse of the American mortgage lending business.It is unclear exactly what was going on, but just this last week, the so-called reforestation venture filed for bankruptcy, so it doesn't look good."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This is indeed a quite interesting book, the best story for me is The Butterfly That Stamped.On the other hand, I was surprised by the author's great patience in writing How the Alphabet Was Made."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"The kids will have a hard time reading the old English style this book was written in, though the quality of the work makes it worth buying and reading to your children, with translation into modern English, or course!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Boris Karloff - the unmistakable voice - narrates these charming tales with the right amount of energy and dreaminess to take the hearer to the land of pure imagination and suspension of reality, if only for a few minutes.The stories are charming and funny, and Karloff's voice characterizations are sublime. He takes funny to giggles and laughter. This is a performance for children of all ages.The stories ar masterfully drawn with an art that defies description (by me anyway). Kipling's *Jungle Book* and *Kim* are so well known that they don't require my comment. He did win the Nobel Prize for Literature.I listened to these with my daughter when she was 5 - 9.

Every generation has published \\"Just So Stories\\"with different illustrations. I find Safaya Salters especially evocative of the rich colors we associate with India, though all of the stories do not take place there. These stories beg to be read aloud (even if you are only reading to yourself). Kipling's prose is like poetry. His words are rich and buttery. I promise, if you start reading this aloud in your children's presence they will be mesmerized.

I would recommend reading this book to a young child as a bedtime story."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Kipling's JUST SO STORIES certainly rank in English-speaking children's literature right along with A. A. Milne's WINNIE THE POOH and Kenneth Grahame's WIND IN THE WILLOWS. They are fun to read to children 4-8, and even MORE fun for them to read for themselves at ages 7-11 (they're marvelous vocabulary builders --&quot;the mariner of infinite resource and sagacity&quot; &lt;grin&gt;). My English-raised mother heard the stories when they were new and read them to me when I was a child, I read them to my own children, they read them to theirs, and I believe that same cycle has been repeated among millions of families since the stories appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.It is my impression that today the JUST SO STORIES do not enjoy the popularity with children (and parents) that they once had. That may be because they are occasionally &quot;politically incorrect&quot; in their depiction of historical attitudes regarding race and culture. Joel Chandler Harris's UNCLE REMUS stories and even Mark Twain's HUCKLEBERRY FINN are sometimes removed from local library shelves on the same basis. In this reviewer's view, inattention to the works of Kipling and Harris and Twain deprives English-speaking children of some appreciation of the culture and civilization in which they live today. Worse yet, it deprives them of the fun of reading FOR fun.Rudyard Kipling, referred to by one reviewer here as &quot;not a very good writer&quot; was the first English writer to win the Nobel Prize (not the Pulitzer) for literature, in 1907. He was staunchly pro-Empire in an era in which Great Britain not only ruled the waves, but a third of the globe -- the sun never set, it was said, on the British Empire, of which he sang in hundreds of poems and short stories and novels which also deserve reading today.But imperial/colonialist notes are hard to hear in the JUST SO STORIES, which Kipling wrote for the amusement of a young niece. The stories are meant for FUN, and all children deserve to have some. Get this book; read it yourself if you haven't already -- and then read it to the youngsters for whom Kipling intended it."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I recently purchased this set on cd with a gift certificate for my young daughter. The price tag may have put me off at any other time, but since I was getting it with a certificate, I went for it. I read these stories cover to cover repeatedly as a little girl and took great delight in the hilarity of the answers to such questions as \\"how did the leopard get his spots?\\" or \\"how did the camel get his hump?\\" Kipling's stories are marvelously nonsensical - which makes them fit for a child's world. However, it was not until hearing them read aloud on this very set that I realized his rhyme and use of repetitive words or phrases is very similar to our modern master of children's literature: Dr. Seuss. It would not surprise me to find that Seuss took his inspiration from the works of Kipling. This is not striking to a reader, but as you listen to his words brought to life by the human voice it is hard to miss.Geoffrey Palmer, of As Time Goes By, is one of my favorite actors. His voice and interpretation of these beautiful stories enhances the experience so much that I was laughing out loud listening to him in my car. His dry sense of humor is felt in his characterizations of the cast and the lulling of his voice lends a calming, gentle, and sophisticated quality to the text. I now can simply not imagine these stories being read by anybody else.Finally, the classical musical selection is superb and adds an intelligent whimsiness to the piece. I would highly recommend this set as a lovely gift for any child you find \\"tenacious and full of segacity\\". What a delightful alternative to the screech of today's cartoons and children's \\"pop\\" albums full of Britney Spears remakes."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Kipling&#65533;s classic volume of stories concerns the great questions of history; How the Whale got his Throat, How the Camel got his Hump, How the Alphabet was Made and many other thorny dilemmas. The language is sophisticated yet often whimsical and children love to hear the words read aloud. It is tempting to scan ahead and change things, substitute more contemporary phrases for the old but, if you can, resist the urge. Kipling was a master of the language. His writing is balanced and fluid and while it may seem dated when taken piece by piece, its sum is far greater than its parts. Read The Cat that Walked by Himself and you will never look at your own pet in quite the same way again."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Being a free Kindle edition, I was expecting that the drawings and their attached descriptions would be missing. What I was not expecting was for the little poems often found in the stories to also be missing. Things like the Sloka the Parsee sings after the Rhinoceros eats his cake, that are usually block-quoted and italicized in published versions, are not included. The stories can certainly be followed without them, but as the text that IS there specifically says a little poem or song is going to be related to the reader, the gaps are quite obvious."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I had a hard time finding the original. I read the reviews of various editions closely and learned that many \\"Just So Stories\\" are not unabridged as this one is. I highly recommend this edition. The book is large and I cannot see why anyone would want to read anything but pure Kipling. My six year-old is getting a real kick out of this book. We read a few stories per week. Reading something written 100 years ago is good for us!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Considered aloof and even irascible by reporters and adoring fans, Rudyard Kipling was admittedly a private person. Despite his reputation as a recluse during his four-year Vermont sojourn, he was genuinely fond of children. With paternal tenderness and pride he wrote this anthology of 12 unrelated tales for the amusement and enlightenment of his oldest, American-born daughter. A hint of their sacred relationship is revealed in &quot;How the First Letter was Written&quot; and &quot;How the Alphabet was Made,&quot; wherein readers savor the loving bonds between cavegirl, Taffy, and her devoted father, Tegumi.Many serious critics refuse to consider this collection of animal fables--which satirize human vices and foibles--as true literature, unworthy of adult time or mental effort to be appreciated. Nevertheless, it takes a different arsenal of literary skills to write well for children, who demand more action and clever dialogue; they expect to be hooked right away into whatever plot. It takes an agile mind plus a youthful heart to hold kids' attention over thousands of words and several pages--even with illustrations by the multi-talented author. (Seek those editions which offer the additional lure of Kipling's own pen and ink sketches.)Don't be swayed by any rhetoric you may have heard about Kipling's so-called Politics, either. His social opinions frequently are blown out of proportion or taken out of context. In any case they are irrelevant to the intent of his anthology. Other than a few socially-incorrect phrases, JUST SO STORIES proves an excellent chapter-by-chapter bedtime book, especially for parents under fire to answer the inevitable questions which explain why a particular animal looks or acts the way it does. The author has bravely tackled that problem--taking adults off the inevitable Why hook. Using his palette of unlimited vocabulary, Kipling creates his own imaginative, drole and delightful expressions. Even if as adults we find his linguistic patchwork difficult to understand at times, most children will enter the word game eagerly. JUST SO STORIES offers a cute read for all YAHOOS--those who are truly Young At Heart or Otherwise!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This book is the most valued in my family history. Now my children are asking after it to read to their children because of all of the beloved memories it brings back. The language is a delight. The way Kipling draws the reader and listener in to feel they are part of the story, it is story telling magic at its very best. I can't believe anyone who has this book in their home, once read, will ever be without it. As long as children and that child in all adults long for the gifted story teller's magic, this book is special."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Let me make it clear that I am reviewing the Signet Classics version of Just So Stories. The reason I say that is because the original versions of these stories contain material that would be offensive to most people today, but the worst of that has been removed from this edition. The other advantage of this version is that it contains Kipling's own illustrations and his captions for those illustrations. Finally, this version is also very inexpensive.These stories were told to Kipling in their original form when he was a child by his Indian nursemaids. They are drawn from many non-Western sources, and provide good contrasts with European fairy tales. In most cases, the stories are about animals or early human beings and their development into their modern form or capabilities. But they are really satires on human weaknesses, with the moral showing how overcoming a weakness will usually create a strength.Here are the stories and their morals:How the Whale Got His Throat -- If you get too greedy, you will bite off more than you can chew. By taking on less at a time, you can absorb more in total.How the Camel Got His Hump -- If you are lazy and procrastinate, you will just have to do without in the future and be less attractive in order to make up for it. Having resources for times of scarcity is always helpful.How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin -- Being too aggressive will cause you to experience retribution from those you harm. With more flexibility, you can be more agile.How the Leopard Got His Spots -- You have a better chance of success if you blend in, rather than trying to stand out individually too much.The Elephant's Child -- If you are too nosy, you can get into mischief. Having a keen nose can help you sniff out and execute more opportunities.The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo -- Be careful what you wish for, you may get it. Being boundless gives you the chance to explore more.The Beginning of the Armadillo -- Versatility is more valuable than knowing just one way to handle a situation.How the First Letter Was Written -- Miscommunication is easier to accomplish than correct communication. Double-check to be sure the message is understood.How the Alphabet Was Made -- Choose combinations of communication that are unambiguous, or you will find yourself confusing everyone. This story is a brilliant essay on how one might go about inventing written language.The Crab that Played with the Sea -- Consider the consequences of your actions before you act, or you may see the actions rebound against you.The Cat that Walked by Himself -- The benefits of helping others greatly improve one's own life.The Butterfly that Stamped -- Actions taken for the right reason have just consequences while actions taken for pride tend to boomerang against us.Each story contains a prose tale, followed by a brief poem. The illustrations are explained in the caption at the end.The style of the stories includes lots of funny repetition, especially in the names of rivers and the features of the animals being described. With each repetition, your smile will broaden until you cannot suppress a good laugh.The stories also use the term &quot;best beloved&quot; a lot. What a delightful way to refer to the child to whom you are reading these stories! That would be reason enough to introduce these stories to your children. The phrase &quot;just so&quot; is used less often, but has a nice cadence as well, like a carpenter planing down a piece of wood to fit perfectly into an item being constructed.Since these &quot;pretend&quot; stories obviously are counter to the latest scientific knowledge, you will probably want to introduce the relevant science to your child, too, at some point. Then you can ask your child why she or he thinks that Kipling made up these stories. This will give you a chance to talk about the implications for people. Be sure to give your child an opportunity to develop his or her own interpretations. Those will be much more useful and memorable than any that you could provide. Try to use questions to lead your little learner forward.See the opportunities that the proper balance provides!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This version does not contain the images or poems in the original -- one of the ones at Gutenberg does. Since some of the fun of this book is in the convoluted captions of the original drawings, I'd recommend getting that one instead."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This book is a classic meant to be read aloud. It's best when read to children as a bedtime story on a winter night. Try using different voices for the characters... children have a good time with this and so will you. And, usually, they will ask you to read the next story when you've finished. The next story, of course, is saved to be read tomorrow night."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Boris Karloff's deep, melodious voice holds you in thrall. The writing is terrific. Unlike the other review, I had no issues with the sound - it is just fine. It needs to be turned up pretty high, but once you do it works great. Completely silences my kids in the car. Love this CD."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"My mom used to read these to me before I went to bed almost every night. I love the stories! They have good morals in them too. After a while, I started to read them out loud to myself and that got me into reading other stories. I think it's a wonderful book to read to your children. Or maybe, your child could read it to you?"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"At the age of nine, I found this book in my brother's room. I started to read it, and liked it very much. The stories resemble a fairy-tale act, pieced together like stained-glass. The stories are short and simple, and offer an unclear explanation of unanswered questions that linger amidst the world today. I read it to my little sister as a bed time story, and she thought it was amusing. I would save this book for younger readers, but still very good."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I was fortunate enough to have been given a copy of this book, and the accompanying 33rpm record for my 6th birthday. It was to turn out as one of the 'Landmarks&quot; in my reference to life. Almost half a century later, I use the stories for the Grandkids, and as a reminder: He who takes the cakes That the Parsee man makes, Makes dreadful mistakes! It is not possible to recommend this book as a higher value, with the obvious exception of The Holy Bible."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"My children (Age 6 & 3) love the language in these stories. I find it rather entertaining to read to them too. There are not many pictures, which doesn't detour my kids because they love the stories, but it might be a drawback for some. The price was right and this is a well loved book in our house."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Poor Boris Karloff got in over his head on this one. As other reviewers have noted, the sound level on this CD is so low, that it's simply not possible to listen to it. We have numerous books-on-CD for the kids, and a normal listening level on the car stereo is \\"20\\". Even with this CD turned up to the maximum of \\"40\\", it's simply not possible to hear and understand what is being said, so the CD is worthless. Maybe I'll use my computer to rip the tracks off the CD and convert them to mp3 and use a sound editing program to try to increase the volume on the mp3 tracks. Or maybe I'll throw the CD in the trash.It's a problem when Amazon mixes together the reviews for a book and the reviews for the CD version of the book -- it's hard to find the CD reviews mixed in with the book reviews to see how bad the CD is."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I loved Just So Stories as a child, and the stories are - for the most part - still really wonderful. Be aware if you are buying this for someone, however, that some of the stories are less than flattering to minorities and one of the stories does use the word \\"nigger,\\" so this is definitely a book for someone who is old enough to talk to about language and what's appropriate and so on."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I thought I had written a review on this previously, but I think it had a slightly different title (complete just so stories) so I'll write one for this particular title. I was given this book years ago, when my son was 3, by a friend of mine. He told me I should read the stories first and pick out the ones that I felt would be appropriate for my son, which I did. He loved the stories, particularly \\"how the rhinoceros got his skin,\\" and I read it to him almost every night (we had been reading all Disney stories up until then). There were about 2 or 3 other stories in the book that we also read. It was wonderful and made him smile before going to sleep, always important! Yes, there are phrases, etc., in the book that are inappropriate, but Disney also has some pretty embarrassing things in their books, as well. Really. Read the things you intend to read to your children, and make decisions based on your perception of content. It's an excellent book, with some very excellent stories. My son still remembers that book, and still loves the stories. Because I sold the book when we moved, I purchased a new one for a friend just having a baby recently. As I was told years ago, I told her to read the stories first and find the ones that she liked, and felt were good for her child."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I was looking for stories for my littles and came across this. This is more of a set of stories for me. I grew up on Kipling and love to hear him aloud! It is very well done."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I had a paperback copy of this book. This is a true classic nicely presented with the author's illustrations."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"If you've never read the Just So Stories, look them up on line. Read them out loud; they're written in your voice, the voice of a story teller, not in an anonymous third person voice. There have never been better children's stories. The language is beautiful and the stories fun, engaging, and full of a sense of wonder. The printing is nice for the money, something that could likely be passed on to the next generation. For slightly older kids, take a look at Kim and Puck of Pook's Hill, both also by Kipling."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Wow this was poorly printed. No illustrations and looks like it was printed directly off the internet. Do not buy unless you are anticipating poor quality!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"There were a few stories in here that I don't remember reading when I was a kid, which was cool. I absolutely love the Just-So Stories, it doesn't matter how often I read them, I never get tired of them and always find them absolutely hysterical. THis is an excellent version EXCEPT:Unfortunately, the picture aren't included, and the picture captions in the original edition are just as hilarious as the stories. It's too bad these couldn't be included because they are just roll-on-the-floor funny.There is a table of contents for the stories, which is great, since I like skipping to my favorites without having to scroll through the other chapters."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This is a terrible edition. Looks to have been copied from a free online version. Chapters are not clearly marked and just run together. Also, no pictures. We were very unhappy with this book. It looks like this is different version of what the other reviews are based on. Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"These are fantasizing stories written at the beginning of the XX century. Both my kids love these stories just before bed. Among the origin stories, Kiipling tells us of How the Cat Walked by Himself, How the Alphabet was Made, The Beginning of Armadillos, How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin, How the Camel Got His Hump, and several others. It's a great reading!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Kipling is criticized nowadays for his imperialism and jingoistic views, but his two major children's books (this one andThe Jungle Books: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)) remain undying classics that every kid should know. His eloquent and often original language also make them delightful read-alouds. The twelve Just-So Stories were originally told to his little daughter Josephine (and in fact three of them feature \\"little girl-daughters\\" and their daddies) and are for the most part pourquoi tales in a traditional folkloric style--explanations of how the whale got \\"his tiny throat,\\" the camel his hump, the rhinoceros his wrinkly skin and terrible temper, the leopard his spots, the elephant his trunk, the kangaroo his shape; how armadillos came to be, how the tides began, how the cat became a part of humanity's world, how the first letter was written and the alphabet invented. (The last story, \\"The Butterfly That Stamped,\\" is \\"quite different from the other stories--a story about the Most Wise Sovereign...Solomon the Son of David.\\") Every kid should own some edition of these tales and have them read aloud as soon as he's old enough to understand them. They've been among my favorites since I was very young, and even now I wouldn't be without a copy."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I love this recording. I listened to it for hours when I was little and now my son can too. My lp recording was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina, so was thrilled to find it on CD. Mr. Karloff's voice is distinctivly captivating and the stories contain timeless wisdom."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"My mother enjoyed this book when she was a child, probably not long after it was first published, and she read it to me, over and over again, when I was a child. Kipling's use of language is unsurpassed anywhere, in my opinion. He taught me to love the sound of words...\\"the great grey green greasy Limpopo River all set about with fever trees...\\"-- who cannot, dearly beloved, be enchanted by that. It actually took my mother and me on a quest years ago to see that river and those fever trees. But that aside, there is no better book for teaching children to love books, reading, language, and the sound of words well placed and absolutely delicious. There is no dumbing down, and any silliness is whimsical and sophisticated. Anyone of any age who has not read this book should do so immediately."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"My kids love to listen to stories or music at bedtime and I think this is an especially good CD for developing their vocabulary and love of language. It keeps them engaged and they love it.

A great deal of the pleasure is in the reading aloud. Children love the alliterations, the completely fanciful ideas. Parents adore the superb English -- even the crazy made-up words!

You will enjoy them as much as the little ones do..."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Just So StoriesBy Rudyard KiplingThe writing in Just So Stories is just mediocre, but nothing more. The actual content is weak. Most of the book is about \\"How the....\\" For example \\"How the Whale Got His Tongue\\" or \\"Rhino got his skin\\" Which aren't very interesting. The style of writing is very old fashioned but considering the fact that the book was written a long time ago, that the writing will be different is inevitable.One of the stories is called \\"How the Camel Got His Hump.\\" Sound interesting? Well it's not. In the story \\"How the camel got his hump\\" there was a camel in the desert. There were also lots of other animals: some birds, some horses etc. The camel would never do his work and he would always reply to the other animals by saying \\"hmph\\" so the animals complained to a magic genie (where was he supposed to come from?) the camel replied \\"hmph\\" So the genie gave him a hujmp. Wow! That was such a great story don't you think? This story summarizes how terrible this book is. My advice to you is don't read it, EVER! It is a terrible book and a waste of paper. It might have been good in its time. But that time has been LONG gone. I would most definitely not suggest this book at all. I you're looking for something to waste your time on this is it, or, if you're looking for something for your 6-year old this is a great idea!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"The stories are great which is why I ordered the book. A bit disappointed in the illustrations.Perhaps my grandchildren will enjoy it more when they begin to read more chapter books, with less pictures."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This is a wonderful book for children.

Unfortunately, although the book cover depicted is the same as my 1952 edition, the various book choices listed with it, except for the used ones from booksellers for $289+, are not the the same; in fact, they appear to have far fewer illustrations, which are black and white and not by Nicolas.If the stories are most important, there are several good editions; however, if you are also looking for brightly colored, fanciful illustrations that will capture the attention of younger children, I suggest that you look carefully. I cannot not find one for my grandchildren where the stories and pictures are as well integrated as the 1952 edition.Literatelily"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"For Kipling lovers, young or old, the 'Just So Stories' are very special. They were the first stories my mother read to me, and I was a 'Kipling' fan for life. Not only is this volume the pure, unaltered, version of the Kipling tales, it has the unique and marvelous drawings by Kipling which are stories within stories and very enjoyable in and of themselves.Recently I wanted to purchased the 'Just So Stories' for a grandchild, and was stunned to learn that virtually all of the modern editions have been severely edited, modified....'modernized.' Simply put, they have been altered in many instances to make them 'politically correct.'Well, I say stuff and nonsense on the modern versions. Kipling is timeless and children can learn the nuances of his tales without being swept away by some of his arcane verbiage, or his less than (in today's world view) 'correct' language.This is a very fine volume and worth every penny it takes to secure a copy."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

I also like . . . oh, well, there are just too many to talk about. Read them for youself, and to your kids.The stories are complex and mysterious and, though I can't say much for Kipling's politics, I find them delightful. I think most children will, too.

The sound quality on the CD is poor. There is background static and it sounds as if he is too far away from the microphone and that he is speaking through a tube. You have to turn it up in order to hear clearly. This alone hurt our ears then Karloff emphasizes certain words quite loudly which really hurt our ears."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Kipling's collection of light-hearted children's stories.They have exactly the \\"come here and sit on my knee, and I'll tell you a story\\" quality that I like best in young children's story-telling, and the stories are written in such a way as to make you feel you are sitting on Kipling's other knee as he reads them to his Best Beloved. You are part of something private between a father and his daughter in these stories, but, while there are a few private jokes taken directly from their lives, these do not lessen the enjoyment of the story.An example, taken from my favorite story in the collection, \`How the Whale Got His Throat,' occurs after the whale has swallowed a sailor, and the sailor has said he will stomp around the whale's insides until the whale to take him back home to England.Quote:So the whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his tail, as hard as he could...and at last he saw the Mariner's natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed half-way up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide, and said, \\"Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and stations on the Fitchburg Road.\\"*****This obviously is something plucked from the life of Kipling and his little girl, so it was funny to them for this additional reason; the rest of us (including my daughter and I) still can be content with a whale doing something extraordinarily silly.Many, or most, of the stories are laced with characters and legends from India, the land of Kipling's birth, and, whether they were borrowed from Indian mythology or were created entirely by Kipling, these carried an interesting, exotic air, which I am beginning to believe I am supposed to find characteristic of Kipling. Only one of the stories, \`How the Alphabet Was Made,' really dragged a bit, but even that one was all right. It was followed, though, by an exceptionally sad moment, in which Kipling writes a heart-wrenching (at least to someone with two little girls of his own) lament for his beloved daughter, who, I remember, died quite young. He uses the characters Tegumai (the father) and Taffy (the daughter), who represent Kipling and his daughter, from the Alphabet story:Quote:Of all the Tribes of TegumaiWho cut that figure, none remain-On Merrow Downs the cuckoos cry-The silence and the sun remain.But as the faithful years returnAnd hearts unwounded sing againComes Taffy dancing through the fernTo lead the Surrey spring again.Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,And golden elf-locks fly above;Her eyes are bright as diamondsAnd bluer than the sky above.In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,Unfearing, free and fair she flits,And lights her little damp-wood smokeTo show her Daddy where she flits.For far-oh, very far behind,So far she cannot call to himComes Tegumai alone to findThe daughter that was all to him.*****I sat staring at that page for minutes on end on more than one occasion, I don't mind telling you.I'm sure I'm the last person on the planet to have read this, so a recommendation isn't necessary. I will only say that some of the stories, at least, still can be enjoyed by modern children (and adults), judging by my daughter's \\"can we read the whale story again...and again...and again?\\" I hope that Just So Stories aren't lost over time, and I hope parents will continue to read them to their own Best Beloveds as years go by."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Missing are The Cat that Walked Alone, The Butterfly that Stomped, How the First Letter Was Written, and Mowgli's Brothers.What's on the cd are the 7 stories: How the Whale Got His Throat, How the Camel Got His Hump, How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin, The Elephant's Child, The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo, The Beginning of the Armadillos, How the Leopard Got His Spots.I don't have the sound problems described in other reviews; the sound is indeed a bit low, but not low enough for me to complain about."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This is the definitive reading of some of the best, wittiest children's stories ever. Kipling delights in playing with language and Karloff highlights the author's literary gifts. The sound is nowhere near as bad as other reviewers have suggested. On an ordinary stereo, the volume simply needs to be turned up a couple of notches. Another thing: this is Edwardian literature, so the elephant's child is spanked - a lot. While some parents might not wish their children to be exposed to this, it is worth noting that the spanking is portrayed (with some irony)as being both ineffective and a knee-jerk response by ignorant adults to natural curiosity in children."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"My children so loved the Rikki Tikki Tavi video--based on a Kipling video--that I wanted to find other Kipling stories on tape (besides the Jungle Book).

While it's a nice, full collection of the stories, there is only one illustration per story--not at all like the picture-rich edition I had as a child.To shop online for kiddy books (my children are 5, 4 and 3), it's important for it to be vivid how picture rich the book is (or isn't)."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"The Boris Karloff readings of Kipling's stories are one of the great treasures of childhood.

This plot takes us to the steamy jungles of the Amazon rain forest in South America in the Northern part of Brazil. Also in this plot there lives a painted jaguar, a stickly-prickly hedgehog, and slow and solid tortoise. Now O best beloved (meaning you) this particular jaguar isn't very bright so he goes to his mother for advice on how to eat the hedgehog and the tortoise. Well, as any mother would, she tells him ohhh, so many times graciously waving her tail, \\"Painted Jaguar to catch the hedgehog you must dip him the water so he will uncoil and you must scoop the tortoise out of it's shell with your paw, got it?!\\" So he goes to the river to find the hedgehog and the tortoise so he can eat them. The first time they barely got away by confusing him. The hedgehog and the tortoise confuse him by messing up what his mother told him. But the second time Painted Jaguar is confused just by looking at them. You'll have to read it to believe it.As you know, in this particular story you are introduced to a hedgehog named Stickly-Prickly and a tortoise named Slow and Solid. As you might see these two unique animals are very close and have the same predators. In this story Stickly-Prickly hedgehog and Slow and Solid tortoise are being hunted by a creature named Painted Jaguar, as you know, who is not too smart and has spots. Now since Stickly-Prickly and Slow and Solid were able to fool the jaguar once they want to make him so confused that he won't know which is which just by looking at them. So day after day they teach one another how the other works, like Stickly-Prickly teaches Slow and Solid to curl up and Slow and Solid teaches Stickly-Prickly how to swim. After they have done that and are comfortable with their skills they wait for Painted Jaguar to come looking for them but they don't know that they will never be the same again. Stickly-Prickly hedgehog and Slow and Solid tortoise help this particular story because they are smart and they fool the jaguar and they surprise the reader with their cunning and hard work.This book has been really fun in the fact that there is more than one story in the book and for me more than one story meant that it was a page turner. The story that I described in this book review was easy to concentrate on because I liked it so much. Some stories in this book were just plain old boring so it was harder to read them . The thing that caught my attention was the language that the author used in the book, I thought that the language was very unique and very funny. To tell the truth I thought that there weren't very many surprises at all, the only surprises would be all the purposes of the story that was being told, like how the camel got his hump or the beginning of the Armadillos. To me they make the language in the book fun, like Oh best beloved and stickly-prickly and slow and solid. The people who might like this book would have to have a sense of humor, so if they have that then the person reading this book will have a very fun time indeed."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"A great experience for young and old!

Some might just describe them as myths. While the are easily digestible to young readers, older readers may be equally amused. From the camel getting is humps to the creation of the alphabet, the stories are entertaining.I offer a word of caution to potential buyers. In the 1974 printing, Kipling's own artwork, which apologizes for frequently, illustrates the stories. In that printing and some others, the illustrations are out of sequence with the story and become a distraction. It is not a good way to demonstrate sequence and chronology in young readers."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I cannot comment on the content of the stories because the Kindle formatting is so terrible that it is impossible to say for sure what many of the words are.This is an inexplicable and inexcusable oversight in what Amazon lists as my #1 Kindle recommendation in books for young children."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I agree with the previous review.

I thought Boris Karloff would make a great narrator, but he doesn't this time.

I thoroughly enjoyed each story, with the exception of the one about how writing was invented, which seemed a bit boring to me.Kipling had me rolling with laughter with each of the stories, and most of the time his notes on his pictures were the funniest parts (well, this picture doesn't have anything to do with the story, but it does have an armadillo in it...).This book is a true classic, and it is unfortunate that it seems to have fallen out of favor with our present culture. Perhaps this has something to do with a few racist remarks in the book, or the swastika in some of his pictures (it was a part of Kipling's official logo long before the Nazi's took it). In either case, these things need to be looked over as a product of their age, and they should not in the least dampen the fun to be had in reading this book."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I purchased this new for my classroom.

I am now passing on the joy of reading these stories to my grandchildren. With the shape the world is in today, It is beneficial for children to have a little awe and fantasy and humor. I am also rereading them and enjoying them once more. There isn't enough money to buy the joy of sharing good literature with a grandchild sitting on your lap and reading with you. I read them to the younger grandchildren, but, I claim that I need a little assistance from the older grandchildren and they do most of the reading to me. How the elephant got its trunk is my hands down favorite, but, all the stories are great. This is an excellent book to promote the joy of reading to our future leaders. I have yet to meet a child that who does not enjoy this classic. Save our future.

Some audio books you listen to a couple times, and that's it, but this is something that is fun to for them to listen to over and over.

I can, however, comment on the book itself. We loved it. Recently I reviewed a book that talked about quality books - modern and classics - for children. After reading it, I realized how many children's classics I had missed as a child. So, I vowed to go back and read some of them myself and to my children. We have loved Just So Stories. It is hilarious. There are so many subtleties in the book that it's fun for adults as well as children. Rudyard Kipling is a marvelously clever writer. I recommend reading it as a family. That's what we have done. Rudyard Kipling was not a \\"politically correct\\" writer, so you may have to explain some things to your children. Some words that were commonly used during Kipling's time aren't used today because the meanings have changed over time. An older child that is well read and is used to that type of writing should have no problem with reading this book on his own. Don't let your children go through their childhood not reading this book like I did. It's a great children's classic."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"The stories on the CD are really fun and interesting. However the CD is recorded so softly even with full volume on my laptop I am not able to hear it. When it is being played in the car the volume has to be way up.That is my only complaint with this purchase."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"What's not to like about Kipling's Just So Stories? This classic should be a must read, as the tales may just turn into myths: eg) How the Camel Got His Hump and The Crab That Played With the Sea. Best for read-alouds, the reader (parent) may ignore the lengthy superfluous identifiers of the pictures. Story illustrations are black woodcuts, to which the author makes many references to the fact that he wasn't allowed to produce the illustrations in color. This becomes a tedious lament to the modern reader, who appreciates different media. The best thing about this edition is that it's lightweight, portable, attractive, and the paper and text make it easy to read. The disadvantage is the glued binding which tends to crack. Interestingly, this edition contains an Author File, Who's Who in the Stories, Some Things to Think About, Some Things to Do, Did You Know, and a Glossary."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"I am a 30 years old man and I enjoyed the book as if I were a 5 years old kid.I am a avid reader, but I had never read Kipling until now. The Just So Stories, as well as the Jungle Books were magical books for me. I enjoyed them so much that I just can't stop telling my friends that they ought to read them.Kippling is certainly an awesome storyteller and I had a great deal of time I did not read such a magical and humorous story book like these.When it comes to tales, the only author I have liked this much was a national author (Costa Rica) named Carmel Lyra who wrote another excellent story book named \\"The Tales of Aunt Panchita\\", there she created her master character Uncle Rabbit.It is pity English is not my native language, because I simply can't find the right words to describe how much I liked Just So Stories.I just can say, please read it, you will love it."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"A great experience for young and old! You must read these to yours OR listen to the stories on audiotape (one series narrated by Boris Korloff!!)A superior time spent with loved one and experiencing the joy of classic literature!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"This is a collection of twelve stories originally published between 1897 and 1902. Kipling uses the beast fable as a jumping-off point to tell inventive stories set in exotic locales and eras, such as the traditionally themed \\"How the Leopard Got His Spots\\" and the more ingenious \\"The Cat that Walked by Himself.\\" Less interested in conveying a moral than in amusing his readers, Kipling tells his stories with a warm and endearing narrator, who frequently directly addresses the young reader as \\"Best Beloved\\" and often notes the hopelessness of understanding grown-ups. The tone of the stories is further enhanced with the inclusion of Kipling's small pen and ink drawings, wittily captioned with commentary about the inadequacy of the drawings and including utterly irrelevant, but entertaining asides. The stories possess a joy in the sound of words, with language that begs to be read out-loud. Though the vocabulary may be difficult and foreign for some readers, it will likely be overlooked and overcome as part of Kipling's fantasy world. The rhythmic language and the fantastical themes combined with length of the stories (ranging from 10-30 pages) lend themselves to bedtime reading. More than a century old, the stories have a timeless feel, though the original edition does include some outdated and potentially offensive references to race and gender, which may require some explanation by adults. Overall, these stories will appeal to young children absorbed with the \\"whys\\" of life at the same time that older children will enjoy the sly chumminess of the narrator."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"There are 12 stories of \\"origins\\" in Rudyard Kipling's 1902 JUST SO STORIES. Here is the plot of one of the more complicated yarns, \\"The Beginnings of the Armadillos.\\" Speaking to his Best Beloved young daughter Josephine, Kipling tells of \\"the High and Far-Off Times ... on the banks of the turbid Amazon.\\"Two friends lived along the same stretch of river: Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise. Nearby lived young, naive Painted Jaguar \\"and he ate everything that he could catch.\\" Mother Jaguar advised her son how to eat his two neighbors: drop Hedgehog into water and make him uncoil; scoop Tortoise out of his shell with a paw. When Painted Jaguar came upon them one beautiful night, both creatures went into their defensive postures. In the dark, Painted Jaguar could not tell which was Hedgehog and which was Tortoise. So he asked them to identify themselves, having first let slip the tecnhique that Mother Jaguar had recommended for eating them.The two friends so confused Painted Jaguar that he filled his paws with Hedgehog's quills and let Tortoise swim away to safety. Mother Jaguar then taught him how to tell the friends apart. But meanwhile Hedgehog has received swimming lessons from Tortoise. And Tortoise has learned to loosen his back plates and bend a bit. In the process the two friends have grown to look much alike. Painted Jaguar can no longer tell them apart and tells Mother Jaguar that there is a new beast in the forest. She advises: call it Armadillo till you find its real name, and leave it alone!The story ends in twenty lines of verse which I taught myself to sing around age 10 in Shreveport from listening to a 33 RPM record of \\"Kipling Songs.\\" If he ever wants to see a Jaguar or an Armadillo, the poet will have to roll down to Rio \\"These wonders to behold.\\"\\"Oh, I'd love to roll to RioSomeday before I'm old!\\"And so would I, O Best Beloved.

Another favorite passage, \\"'My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large paern leather ulter' (and by this he meant the Crocodile) 'will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson.'

Why don't we keep these types of books in a special section on racist authors, and what not to spend time reading to our children!!"},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Rudyard Kipling was not a great writer, but he was a pretty good story-teller, as this collection makes clear. His sentiments, however, are hopelessly mawkish, cloyingly middle-class and really very racist. To put in another way, Kipling was very much a man of his times and background, an Anglo-Indian, fiercly pro-Empire and anti-wog. His stories, especially those made familiar to us by Walt Disney, are quite charming and still stand up to a quick read at bedtime. It perhaps most telling of Kipling's career that he was a celebrity on an international scale, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1907, but is now best remembered for movies starring Shirley Temple and Sabu."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Since their publication a century ago in 1902, Kipling's \\"Just So Stories\\" have pleased children and adults alike. Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, Kipling was a prolific writer for both adults and children, but the \\"Just So Stories\\" continues to be regarded as one of the favorites of Kipling's work. Unlike some of his other works, his imperialist political viewpoint is not evident, but it exhibits only his superb skill at amusing children by his writings. This is a collection of a dozen short stories which display his remarkable ability to enchant the reader - especially children - with the written word, and makes for excellent \\"bedtime\\" story reading for young children. It's not hard to see why so many readers speak of it with unrestrained enthusiasm.Yet as a Christian I could not wholeheartedly share the boundless devotion of most readers, and my own enthusiasm was more restrained. Kipling is evidently familiar with the Bible and the Christian faith, because he makes frequent allusions to Biblical concepts and history, such as Noah's ark. \\"The Butterfly that Stamped\\" even features king Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as two main characters. Although both of Kipling's grandfathers were Methodist preachers, he abandoned his family heritage, stating \\"Three generations of Wesleyan ministers ... lie behind me.\\" Kipling' conscious departure from the Christian heritage is also evident in the \\"Just So Stories\\". Even in \\"The Butterfly that Stamped\\" he presents king Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as married, something not revealed in Scripture. Moreover, in many of his stories he presents an evolutionary approach to the creation of the world. \\"How the First Letter was Written\\" features a Neolithic Cave Man, and \\"The Cat that Walked by Himself\\" describes the \\"taming\\" of a wild man, wild dog, wild horse, wild cow, and wild cat. Judging charitably, it has to be admitted that many of his stories are presented as clearly absurd, nonsensical and fantastic. One could hardly maintain seriously that in stories like \\"How the Whale got his Throat\\" and \\"How the Camel got his Hump\\" Kipling is trying to present an alternate creation account. Nonetheless, Kipling does more than just present a fantastic creation account, but in the process is rather disrespectful and mocking of the real creation account, especially in \\"The Crab that Played with the Sea\\" which features an \\"Eldest Magician\\" making the world by a magic, and also \\"The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo\\" which features three gods. But perhaps Kipling's true feelings toward the Bible are most clearly evident in \\"How the Leopard got his Spots\\", where he refers to grown-ups saying \\"Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the Leopard his spots?\\" - a direct quotation from Jeremiah 13:23! - and says \\"I don't think even grown-ups would keep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard and the Ethiopian hadn't done it once - do you?\\" Here Kipling shows his true colours. No amount of charity can justify Kipling speaking of the Word of God as \\"a silly thing\\". It's unfortunate that the literary qualities of these stories are not matched by spiritual fervour. Christian parents will want to be selective in which stories they read to their children.Yet the literary qualities of these stories cannot be denied. They are probably best enjoyed when read aloud to children, and feature a charming, and warm style that is absolutely nonsensical and yet completely captivating. \\"How the Alphabet was Made\\" is perhaps one of the few exceptions - it is a creative concept, but is somewhat tedious and lacks the charm of the other stories. But nearly all the other stories are delightfully told and wonderfully enjoyable in their exaggerated nonsense. For instance, in \\"How the Whale got his Throat\\", Kipling introduces the reader to a man \\"sitting on a raft, in the middle of the sea, with nothing on but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders.\\" As in many of his stories, his use of repetition skilfully warms up a smile on your face. Throughout the story, he repeatedly and gently admonishes the reader \\"you must NOT forget the suspenders, Best Beloved\\", \\"Have you forgotten the suspenders?\\" It seems absurd, but in the end proves to make perfect sense, because it is the suspenders that the man used to tie his raft in the whale's mouth, and that's how the whale got his throat! Totally absurd, but frightfully funny!At the same time, Kipling uses his nonsensical style to convey fables about animals which satirize human values and vices. For instance, \\"How the Camel Got His Hump\\" is a satirical commentary on laziness and procrastination. This is the hallmark of Kipling's style in most of the stories, and it is this exemplary literary quality that has rightly gained this work the fame it deserves. This edition also reproduces Kipling's original pen and ink drawings, complete with his delightful commentary explaining the illustration. It's worth adding to your collection, because all readers will find something here that they can enjoy. Even those of us with restrained enthusiasm like me, can not help speak of the \\"Just So Stories\\" with much enthusiasm! They are more than Just So-So."},{"Title":"Just So Stories","review":"Rudyard Kipling's writing style is suited to a time in history when people were named &quot;Rudyard.&quot; No parent would dream of naming a kid Rudyard nowadays because it's an old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy name. And these stories are old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy stories.The prose harkens back to a time when old men told tales around pot-bellied stoves. There is a lot of repetition. There is a lot of repetition.Kipling clearly was pleasing himself when he wrote these stories; you get a sense that he's reveling in his own cleverness. He comes off like an old blowhard uncle who makes you sit down and listen to his boring stories while you impatiently wait for him to finish so you can go outside and play. Instead, though, you end up wanting to take a nap because your uncle has bored you so.I'm giving this three stars instead of two because my 5-year-old son likes these stories more than I do, mainly because they make him sleepy at bedtime. Better-written material, such as the Cat in the Hat, stimulates my son and keeps him awake.So there you have it -- Just So Stories is a great collection of bedtime tales because they'll put your kids to sleep."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"No other Melville novel reminds me more of William Gaddis than The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade. In other words, Melville's corrosive yet understated, quintessentially American apocalypse is not an easy read but it rewards the attentive reader. Since I first read it I've never heard the word \\"confidence\\" spoken without re-experiencing something of Melville's irony. (And I've been reminded of that irony more frequently recently because the word has seems to have become a great favorite of our own president!) Melville's ironic sense, sharper here than in any of his other novels, shines in wonderfully wrought sentences. Such as:\\"[H]e seemed to have courted oblivion, a boon not often withheld from so humble an applicant as he.\\" (Chapter 2)And, \\"Gradually overtaken by slumber, his flaxen head drooped, his whole lamb-like figure relaxed, and half reclining against the ladder's foot, lay motionless, as some sugar-snow in March, which, softly stealing down over night, with its white placidity startles the brown farmer peering out from his threshold at daybreak.\\" (Chapter 1)And, \\"[O]ne of those who, at three-score-and-ten, are fresh-hearted as at fifteen; to whom seclusion gives a boon more blessed than knowledge, and at last sends them to heaven untainted by the world, because ignorant of it; just as a countryman putting up at a London inn, and never stirring out of it as a sight-seer, will leave London at last without once being lost in its fog or soiled by its mud.\\" (Chapter 45)"},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"I tried this book thinking that I should get into more of the 'classic type'.

The devil is appearing in diffent guises on April Fool's day on the ship Fidele, a story that had a lot of potential for greatness. Sadly, the &quot;Confidence Man&quot; (Satan) uses the same routine over and over, and he is far from fiendishly clever. Certain passages contain interesting symbolisms (like Emerson and Thoreau being depicted as novel characters), but as a whole this novel is a failure."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"This, the last Herman Melville novel published during the author's lifetime, is not his best work. It's a great theme -- how confidence is necessary for personal success and a thriving market economy yet subject to abuse -- that could have been dealt with much more succintly. The book could have been 15 to 20 chapters instead of the 45 that it is (although most of the chapters are short). Melville also punishes the readers with many dependent clauses. The great man could certainly have used an editor here.But it's still Melville thus \\"The Confidence Man\\" inevitably sparkles at times. But the suggested time scale makes the book highly improbable. There's no way a single man could pull off so many cons on a single boat trip down the Mississippi River. Had \\"The Confidence Man\\" done his \\"business\\" during several trips over several years then that would have been credible. But 30-something cons during a single voyage without being detected by the ship's crew? No sale.Had Melville made things shorter and more believable with a postscript added as to what the Civil War did to American optimism then the book may have become a classic.For a lesser author \\"The Confidence Man\\" would have been a great achievement. But for Melville it pales beside \\"Moby Dick\\" and \\"Billy Budd.\\"The politically astute may notice Melville mentions Cape Girardeau, Missouri, hometown of \\"conservative\\" commentator Rush Limbaugh, the greatest Republican Party confidence man of the post-WW II era. Nice foreshadowing, Herman!"},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"I consider Melville's more famous work, \\"Moby Dick\\", to be perhaps the most overrated book in the English language; in spite of that, I decided to try this one on the grounds that perhaps my dislike of that one was a fluke (no pun intended) and that perhaps some other of Melville's works might be more congenial.This book definitely has some advantages over \\"Moby Dick\\". It's shorter, for one thing, and the digressions are both shorter themselves, and less frequent. But they are, if anything, even more annoying; if there's anything I LESS need to read than dissertations on the nuts and bolts of 19th century whaling, it's chapters in which an author steps outside of his story to defend details of his writing. What's more, while \\"Moby Dick\\" is 400+ pages of story with about 50 pages of plot, this book is 250+ pages with absolutely NO plot; all it is is episodic recitations of one character (a man of 1000 faces) swindling numerous other characters, some more well-developed than others. And if the writing style isn't QUITE as pretentious as in \\"Moby Dick\\", it's still too pretentious for my taste.Still, the book is not completely worthless. It brings to mind some interesting points for debate; which is worse, the con man himself, or the people who he CAN'T swindle because they're so cynical and untrusting? Is it worth becoming that cynical to avoid being gulled by such a con man? Is it possible to retain a reasonable amount of faith in people, and still avoid being swindled? What would have been the appropriate response in (pick a scene)? I would recommend that if you are going to read it, do so as a part of a literary discussion group, or something similar, so that you will have someone to discuss it with. That's where its value lies, certainly not as an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"This is like a precurser to the Beat movement of the 1950's.

Because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust, confidence and cons. Though the setting is a riverboat on the Mississippi River just before the U.S. exploded into Civil War, its insights cross cultural boundaries.This is not an easy book to read for several reasons. First, it is undoubtedly one of the first \\"post-modern\\" novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling. ( Another example: Dostoevsky's Notes From the Underground.) The Confidence-Man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat--beggars, absurdly dressed frontiersmen, sickly misers, shysters, patent medicine hucksters, veterans (of the Mexican-American War) and the \\"hero\\" in the latter part of the book, the Cosmopolitan.In typical Melville fashion, you also get asides--directly to the reader, in several cases, as if Melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel. The lack of structure, action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book, but if you read each conversation as a separate story, then it starts to make more sense.For what ties the book together is not a story but a theme: the nature of trust and confidence. In a very sly way, Melville shows how a variety of cons are worked, as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do: buy the \\"herbal\\" patent medicine, buy shares in a bogus stock venture, or donate cash to a suspect \\"charity.\\"In other chapters, it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself. Since the book is mostly conversations, we are left to our own conclusions; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending. This elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust; we don't want to be taken, but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted. To trust no one is to be entirely isolated.Melville also raises the question: is it always a bad thing to be conned? The sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy, and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life. The ornery frontiersman who's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner. Is that a terrible thing, to trust despite a history of being burned?The ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored. We think the Cosmopolitan is a con-man, but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum, he returns it, just to prove a point. Is that a continuance of the con, or is he actually trustworthy?The book is also an exploration of a peculiarly American task: sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens. In a traditional society, things operate in rote ways; young people follow in their parents' traditional roles, money is made and lent according to unchanging standards, and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways.But in America, none of this structure is available. Even in Melville's day, America was a polyglot culture on the move; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress, manner and speech/pitch. The con, of course, works on precisely this necessity to rely on one's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods. So the con man dresses well and has a good story, and an answer for every doubt.The second reason why Melville is hard to read is his long, leisurely, clause upon clause sentences.

It is offered at at W.W. Norton's website... The Hendricks House edition edited by Elizabeth Foster is another good edition, but it seems to be out of print at the moment.On November 12, 1856 Herman Melville and Nathanial Hawthorne took a walk among the sandhills near Liverpool, England. They smoked cigars, and Hawthorne wrote about a week later that Melville spoke of Providence and futurity, and he, Melville, had pretty much made up his mind to be annilated.\\"The Confidence-Man\\" is the last novel that Melville published during his lifetime. I agree with Newton Arvin, who called \\"The Confidence-Man\\" \\"one of the most infidel books ever written by an American; one of the most completely nihilistic, morally and metaphysically.\\"About 150 years after the book was first published, and about fifty since the book was first taken seriously by literary critics, The Confidence-Man is not a settled matter. In fact there remains excessive discord among readers and critics about the worth of this novel. Some compare it to Swift's \\"Tale of the Tub,\\" others will tell you that this book is static and formless.The idea is simple enough. On April 1 a devil in the guise of a deaf mute goes aboard a Mississippi river steamboat, and begs for charity. In rapid succession he transforms himself into a crippled Black man, a man with the weed, the man in the grey coat , the gentleman with the big book, the man with the plate and finally the Cosmopolitan. In these different guises he gulls and diddles people. He asks for trust. He is not always successful, but he can take solace in his failures. The reason for the devil's failures is the cyniscim, mistrust and mysandry of his marks. It is their human failings that accounts for his failures. And that's not so bad for the devil.Melville's control of his material was never greater. I recommend the Northwestern Newberry edition because it contains draft fragments of chapter 14. You can see how carefullly Melville wrote this novel. The blandness of the prose is deliberate. If you read the surviving drafts you will see how Melville purposedly silenced and muted his message. Perhaps Melville was too successful for even close readers get lost sometimes.At the end there is an increase of seriousness. An old man closes his Bible and asks for a life preserver. The Cosmopolitan hands the old man a chamberpot which appears to be full, and calls it a life preserver. The Cosmopolitan then extinguishes the lamp, and then leads the other into the darkness."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"Hardly any action, absurd labyrinthine plot, hilarious mis-pronunciation of the word 'herbs'. I want to convey just how uncanny it is that a book can be both a disturbing vortex of meaninglessness AND a jolly good read AT THE SAME TIME. I don't want to sound pretentious, but there's no way around it: Melville's final and supremely unpopular novel pushes the conceptual boundaries of the traditional novel genre, the act of writing itself, and indeed the very idea of representation. What is at stake here is the foundation of Western thought and self-fashioning. Meanwhile, following along with the ruses and rhymes of the trickster con-man (or con-men) and the sly narrator makes for a very amusing trip.I just hope nobody ever tries to make a movie out of this.PS make sure you get the oxford classics edition because the introduction essay is especially good; it points out all sorts of interesting stuff about the novel's composition and resonances with American culture and intellectual history in a lucid and enlightening way."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"Set aboard a Mississippi side-wheel steamer in the 1850s, Melville's novel charts the progress of the American character at a time when the old frontier was giving way, albeit slowly, to a new, urban frontier.&quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; works at so many different levels that it is no wonder Melville's readers weren't quite sure what to make of his ninth novel. It is a call-and-response of idealism suborned for the purposes of sheer humbuggery, material theft and moral sophistry.I think readers would do well to always keep the word &quot;confidence&quot; in mind as they read the novel; it recurs time and again in different contexts throughout the book. Melville's purpose is to highlight the rift between what things seem to be and what they truly are. It is eerily existential in tone and readers familiar with Kierkegaard and Camus will be delighted by Melville's keen appreciation for the absurdity of the human condition.The wretched reception of &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; undermined what little was left of Melville's own self-confidence as a writer whose work could support his family. In one sense, this was a grievous shame, because Melville lived for nearly four more decades and, presumably, could have spent that time producing more great literature had his contemporaries simply recognized the intellectual genius of his work.In another sense, though, &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; is a fitting send-off to a literary career hobbled by critical inattention and plain bad luck. Melville's America is not an America where dreams come true (note how China Aster is destroyed by his) and where confidence -- optimism -- is rewarded or even warranted. Yet, it is an America recognizably closer to the one we live in than those crafted by Melville's contemporaries -- Emerson, Thoreau, Irving.&quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; is a very complex novel of ideas. This particular edition is very useful because it provides fairly thorough annotation throughout the book. I would highly recommend it for use in a graduate course on American intellectual history, particularly juxtaposed against Emerson and Tocqueville's analyses of American society and culture."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"With &quot;The Confidence-Man,&quot; Melville offered a final novelistic expression of his hopes, doubts, and frustrations about the American nation on the verge of Civil War in the late 1850's.Many critics and reviewers take a negative point of view on this novel, saying that the narrative instability and episodic nature of the novel represents Melville's anger with the increasingly poor reception of his later novels, including the brilliant &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.Over the course of the novel's first half, we are presented with a string of characters who spout the virtues of charity and trust, all supposedly different manifestations of one Confidence-Man. The confidence-man engages passengers of the riverboat Fidele from St. Louis to New Orleans in philosophical, literary, personal, and business-related conversations. This is the heart of the novel, even in the second half, where only one confidence-man appears. As in Cervantes' &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; you are able to tease out more about the ambiguous purposes of the novel through speeches rather than actions.At points amusing, horrifying, and sad, &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; is difficult, if not impossible to categorize in any simple fashion. An extremely worthwhile read, especially if you read it as a prophetic work of the American Civil War and try to figure out for yourself if Melville thought things would turn out alright, or if the US was due for an apocalyptic judgment."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"As I read this book, I didn't catch all the subtleties of it, and could never be precisely sure whether each confidence man was evil or not- it seemed ambiguous, or at least, the author never once allows the reader to find out definitively that the 'vicitms' are being gulled. However, by the end of the book, this becomes more clear as the second half settles into sxome extremely thought-provoking conversations and exchanges. After reading literary reviews online, the book in its totality makes even more sense as in retrospect its sublte points become clearer.That being said, the writing is absolutely superb. Although far more wordy than Hemingway, one cannot avoid comparing to Hemingway's writing, which, like this, is extremely controlled, restrained and pointed. As you read this, you cannot avoid the feeling that the author spent hours on each sentence.It is therefore very much so worth reading, but don't expect it to be easy. It's certainly not your verbose, nineteenth century romanctic glop, but it can be difficult, as some readers appear to have found it. But try it."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"The Confidence Man is without question the most revolutionary work of nineteenth century fiction--enormously experimental, provocative and simply bizarre. The experimentations with flatenned characterizations; the episodic, even repetitive plot structure; and the sheer power of its hallucinatory narration make this novel a post-modern work before there was even modernism. Greatly ignored in its own day, and for much of ours, the Confidence Man is central to an understanding of narrative history and the evolution of this tortured genius who, after his novel Pierre, seems to have transformed narrative conventions in a way that few readers have ever grasped. A brilliant, absolutely central work that makes the much-lauded experimentations of near-contemporary American writers seem puny by comparison."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"The image of the book on the web is that of the Northwestern University edition.

The river is wide, 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) at certain points, but a river boat is generally thought to be a reassuring form of travel.This is not the case, not once in the 45 chapters which follow. The concentration of psychological violence is so intense that the reader is unaware of its insidious presence which manifests itself continually in its different disguises.In Chapter 14, in a brief aside, Melville gives the reader a kind of passepartout to his novel, when he describes the first stuffed platypus from Australia, the so-called \\"duck-billed beaver\\", which many naturalists refused to recognize as a separate species and preferred to conclude that the bill had been ably glued on.In a letter to his friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, in 1851, Melville writes: \\"Let any clergyman try to preach the Truth from its very stronghold, the pulpit, and they would ride him out of his church on his own pulpit bannister.\\"Obviously for many this is a totally unacceptable view of the human race. Incomprehension anddenial are natural defensive reactions. But considering that 153 years have passed since thepublication of \\"The Confidence Man\\" and considering the accumulated evidence we have at hand, this prophetic novel provides the ONLY credible conclusive appraisal of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"This is Melville testament. He left us with an affair we could recreate in our mind countless times , each time reaching a different conclusion.. We could peel off the confidence man mask after mask and would never reach the end. Because there is no such a thing as a face behind a mask. While in fact is the allegory and what you make of it the only thing that really matters. Melville loves to expose the blundering arrogance of man in his believing to posses the capacity of knowledge and of eternal life. The wisest man is the one that knows that he doesn't know anything. And the barber, after he got taken by the confidence man , realizes that his downfall was his pride, the worst of all sins. The very thing wich cost Prometeus eternal suffering and Lucifer banishment , set the barber back the price of an haircut. And while Melville is making us a little more humble with this, he's using the most unforgiving satire of the grotesque evolution of american society to do so. This was a dangerous book at the time it was written and it's even more so nowdays, that's why its been buried for such a long time.The masquerade is actually your perception, life it's the only reality and only the fools fear death because they believe they have to know what comes after.

It all takes place on April 1st, on a boat. The \\"confidence man\\" is a sneaky character, as you will not spot him before a few chapters, and critics and readers alike can only guess which character he was hiding as in the beginning. I entirely missed out on him myself, as I am not used to suppose that various characters might just be the same, disguised.This is not a typical novel, and if you're looking for a sea adventure as with \\"Omoo\\" or \\"Typee\\" or other of Melville's novels, you will not find it. It is aboard a boat indeed, but that's as far as the similarities go. The \\"confidence man\\" mostly argues with other characters on said boat, and their conversations are mighty interesting. This is no adventure novel, but more like a conversational novel, and a good one at that.Nevertheless, it is a bit bewildering perhaps, because of its obscurity, if any, and you will probably feel like you missed out on much, as I did (feel).A good read for sure, and good dialogues, and a very important topic: trust, confidence, faith."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"There are as many sea stories as there are sailors and their ships.

Towards the end of his life, Melville's books increasingly lose traditional narrative form. The Confidence Man is the height of this break down. There is something of a story, but it is a thin one that mostly just serves to allow the characters to philosophize with one another at will.If you're favorite part of Melville's novels are the stories he tells, this book probably isn't for you. However, if you love the tangents he tends to go off on, buy this now: this book is just one long tangent."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"You'll notice that the reviewers of this book have read biographies and/or scholarly criticism of the book. They infer Melville's intent in \\"The Confidence Man,\\" based on what scholars have learned about him through his dealings with other literary figures and from his other writings.I read this book without any of the benefits of a literary criticism or in the context of a course. Basically, I found this book on my shelf, and I picked it up. I majored in English in college a long time ago, and I vaguely remembered liking the Melville that I had read in the past. I can report that taking on this book without scholarly grounding is difficult. I enjoyed it anyway, and I understood a lot of the arguments that characters in the book were making and the absurdity of the situations that they postured to each other. But the greater import of those discussions and digressions was less obvious to me than to other reviewers -- or perhaps I'm more modest in what I claim to have divined from the book.The book is choppy at first. In early chapters, different characters emerge and interact on a riverboat that's heading down the Mississippi at a time when the West was still largely unexplored. In each vignette, a \\"confidence man\\" tries to get money from an \\"innocent\\" or group of innocents. (It's not clear if some of them are the same person. A few reviewers state definitely that all the early confidence men are the devil in disguise -- but it's not important anyway whether they are the same person or different people.) In the early going, the confidence men are almost universally successful at borrowing money, selling useless medicine or stock certificates, etc. In the second half of the book, wiser and more cynical people challenge the confidence men, and the confidence men take their lack of success in stride. This slim plot outline brings forth a series of logical and illogical arguments about the need to trust people and the reasons for a lack of trust in the world -- and that's the point of the book.If you enjoy reading philosophical arguments, then you will enjoy the book. These are short arguments, sometimes leavened with humor. Some hold up well today, and some are silly to our modern sensibilities. But the book is a nice digression from modern novel fare, despite its difficult passages."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"The book was fascinating, but not nearly so much as the different opinions about the book and its meaning.And so here is my theory: The Confidence Man is not a shape-shifter. In fact, there is no character in the book we could call the Confidence Man. The con is within ourselves, an intrinsic part of our natures. We are not conned we con ourselves. Perhaps best illustrated in the part where Melville talks about writing.In the end, how do you choose the outcome? You will take a walk in the dark, whether it be with faith or fear."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"\\"The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade\\" is, as its title would suggest, a satirical farce. In spite of its wit and the occasional laugh, however, it is the hardest of all Melville's works to follow, in no small part because its lead character keeps changing his identity--and that is assuming, by the way, that there's just one lead character to begin with. If at times the novel feels like a patchwork, it's because it is: Melville merged a number of stories and travel pieces originally intended for magazine publication into a continuous, claustrophobic cyclorama.Set on the Mississippi River on April Fool's Day, \\"The Confidence-Man\\" follows the interrelated episodes and adventures of a stream of passengers who board and disembark a steamboat. Many of the confidence men (and their prophetic counterparts) may be the same person in various disguises. (Melville's deliberate obfuscation on this point has launched a hundred academic papers.)The various scoundrels, shills, suckers, and shape-shifters are a parade of American types: \\"men of business and men of pleasure; parlor men and backwoodsmen; farm-hunters and fame-hunters; heiress-hunters, gold-hunters, buffalo-hunters, bee-hunters, happiness-hunters, truth-hunters, and still keener hunters after all these hunters.\\" Everyone on board is trying to sell something or to swindle someone or to raise money for a charity or to find a job or to convince a fellow passenger of his own integrity. A persistent theme is the typically American monomaniacal pursuit of money.\\"I am neither prophet nor charlatan,\\" says a peddler of medicine to a sick man. \\"But again I say, you must have confidence.\\" Yet only a fool would have confidence, and this insecurity leads to an irrational paranoia. Nobody can trust anyone: \\"it is one of the imbecilities of the suspicious person to fancy that every stranger, however absent-minded, he sees so much as smiling or gesturing to himself in any odd sort of way, is secretly making him his butt.\\"For obvious reasons, \\"The Confidence-Man\\" is considered the precursor of the modernist novel. As an academic exercise, it's both intriguing and (to use a technical term) \\"mind-blowing.\\" And there is certainly a steady stream of quotable aphorisms and clever anecdotes. Yet I also found the novel to be frustrating: somewhat like entering a labyrinth from which there is no hope of escape or solution--and at the end of the book you're still stuck in the maze. The farce is a lot of fun initially but it becomes a bit maddening and repetitive after reaching one too many of the novel's narrative dead ends.As one of Melville's contemporary reviewers noted, the novel makes as much sense if the chapters are read in reverse order, and the \\"characters\\" are distinguishable not by their personalities as much as they are defined by their wholly predictable actions and reactions. Halfway down the Old Muddy, after meeting the Melville's umpteenth American stereotype, I realized that the novel had no Bartleby or Nippers, nor, for that matter, would readers be introduced to a K. or an Olga. Instead, \\"The Confidence-Man\\" is like Kafka without characters."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"What is it that makes us trust someone we don't even know?Melville's novel constantly asks this question of the reader as we follow the progressive duping of passengers aboard the Fidele. By doing so, the novel actually functions to question our methods of representation; do we trust someone based on the clothes they wear? What they say? By showing the limits of these kinds of representational efforts it seems as though Melville may also be forcing us as readers to question our perspective of what we read. Should we inherently trust the narrator as reliable, or is it possible that we can also be duped, even being \\"outside\\" of the text?It is, however, a wonderful book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"... and all the passengers merely players; / They have their exits and their entrances, / and one man in his time plays many parts.Melville knew his Shakespeare. Shakespearian allusions and inflections abound in Moby Dick as well as in his final novel, The Confidence Man. Even better he knew his King James Bible. Like his contemporary, Abraham Lincoln, Melville had internalized the cadences and syntax of the Bible, and used them to powerful literary effect. In The Confidence Man, that Biblical rhetoric manifests the bitterest irony and skepticism. Language indeed is the Con Man's chief tool of deception and obfuscation, as well as the author's chief tool of parody. Stuffed to its Mississippi gills with intricate allusions and sardonic word games, The Confidence Man is not an easy novel for a 21st C reader, which is odd in a way since it was a book far ahead of its times. Published in 1857, it has a strong claim on being regarded as the first novel of the 2oth Century.If Father Abraham was the prophet Isaiah of an America purged of the sin of slavery and regenerated, Melville was Jeremiah, weeping over the failure of American ideals, the hollowness and hypocrisy of a Wall Street culture committed only to the fast buck at whatever cost. The Confidence man can be read as the Prophet Melville's book of Apocalypse, and as a prophet, Melville has proven painfully foresightful.The Mute in White, the negro cripple, the man in mourning, the colorful philanthropist, the cosmopolitan, and others... they're all the same personage, the Mississippi \`operator', the con man who at one point calls himself Frank Goodman. It's obvious from every angle that our Con Man isn't merely a greedy swindler, since he goes to fabulous lengths just to snatch a few coins or to cadge a free hair cut. He has preternatural talents with disguises. The single constant in his diverse impersonations is his insistence that confidence - trust, faith, belief - is the most glorious and indispensible of human virtues. His posture and dress may change, but his modus is invariable: to lure his victims into an act of confidence against their own better judgement. He almost always succeeds, though often the victims realize that they've been conned even before he fades into the crowd. A more cynical demonstration of the futility of trust and belief could not be imagined!The targets of Melville's pessimism represent all the rampant optimisms and beliefs of his (and our) America: progress, charity, business ethics, economic expansion, rugged individualism, libertarian ideals, and underlying all of them, Christian expectations of \\"a better life\\" to come. It's the Wall Street Spirit that the Con Man parodies and exploits most ferociously. In chapter seven, the Con Man (in his role as a charity agent) expounds his notion of a \`single tax' - ala Steve Forbes - on everyone in the world, in order to end poverty forever:\\"For one thing,\\" he says, \\"missions I would reform. Missions I would quicken with the Wall Street Spirit.... for if, confessdedly, certain spiritual ends are to be gained but through the auxiliary agency of worldly means... the example of wordly policy in worldly projects should not by spiritual projectors be slighted. In brief, the conversion of the heathen... would, by the World's Charity, be let out on contract.\\"As usual, the Con Man's gab is successful, even while his victim feels he's benefiting a foolish optimist. But look closely at the Con Man's scheme and see if you don't recognize the incipient hokum of Bush-age \\"privatization.\\" Read this book, I urge you, with the future in mind; you'll be amazed at how presciently Melville scorns the ideals of the Gilded Age, of Social Darwinism, and of libertarian \`objectivism' before such ideals were even articulated.The last \`operation' is the Con Man's sardonic exegesis of the Bible, with the Apocrypha, that he borrows from a pious old man during the darkness before dawn. Melville is expressing his own bleak despair at his loss of religious trust, you may be sure, a despair from which he never fully recovered, but he expresses it with almost diabolical humor. Several critics have gone so far as to suggest that the Con man, Frank Goodman, is in fact the Devil, or a devil at least, but Melville had something subtler in mind. The Con Man is in fact America incarnate, the glib false promises of America against which Melville found himself helplessly disillusioned.Humor is what makes this darkly pessimistic book readable. Just get past any problems you may have with the involuted syntax, and you'll find this to be one of the funniest books you've ever read. Melville's Mississippi riverboat churned through the same muddy waters of frontier exaggeration as Mark Twain's, and the horse laughs sound about the same. The two funniest scenes in the book are 1. when another \`operator' tries to con the Con Man by getting him drunk and drugged with cigar smoke -- unsuccessfully, of course; and 2. when the Con Man wheedles a free shave out of the boat's barber, a scene that would fit into a Coen Brothers film without editing.All this in 1857? When Gaskell and Trollope were writing their sagas of manners? When novels were expected to have beginnings, middles, and very conclusive ends? No wonder The Confidence Man was an utter commercial failure and dismissed by even the most literate critics! No wonder Melville lost confidence in his ability to hold a readership, and spent the rest of his life as a psychological hermit writing only poems for his own edification! What a tragedy, this loss of confidence!"},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"The year was 1859 but the strange novel \\"The Confidence-Man\\" is a modern, psychologically dense exploration of the human psyche. The novel begins on April Fool's day concerning itself with a cruise down the Mississippi River between St. Louis and New Orleans. A cosmopolitan confidence-man fools several passengers in his playing many different types of individuals. Melville quotes Shakespeare's \\"all the world is a stage and all the men and women are but players...\\" How true in this weird fictional journey about the \\"Fidele\\" boat. Fidelity is ironic since Melville had a skeptical, non-Christian believing view of life. He did not believe we can even trust our best friends.Along the way we meet such strange characters as Black Guinea an old slave who is crippled. Melville despised chattel slavery. We hear tall frontier tales about a pioneer and Indian killer from Illinois who is named Moreland. Because of the quest for more land the Indians were deemed worthy of slaughter. Melville lived during the time of the Cherokee deportation from the southeast to the American West. We seeFrank Goodman (who is really a con man) cheat a barber out of a free slave.Voltaire's Candide believes this is the best of all possible worlds. Unlike him, Melville's ironically named Frank Goodman puts on a happy face while cheating a barber out of a shave. Goodman seeks to convince the Barber that human nature is good.The book has over 40 characters who are given time to expound their worldviews. The novel is basically plotless. Melville became increasingly pessimistic in his later years much like Mark Twain. This book is a challenge to read and comprehend. I am a neophyte in the study of its perplexing pages. I do know that Melville has something to say to us in modern America about our mask wearing materialistic culture of deception and notoriety. I enjoyed his satirical portraits of such thinkers as Emerson and Thoreau and author Edgar Allen Poe. His chapter on the art of writing fiction could be used in a writing seminar.Those readers who enjoy philisophical discussion within the confines of a book will benefit from this novel. Those folks who want a good story and an exciting plot should perhaps stay away from these difficult pages."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"As Melvillians will know (and as new readers will discover), this is an astoundingly modern work in the guise of an 'older' style. Re-reading it in this new edition is especially rewarding: abundant and illuminating notes, essays, and reviews in a beautifully produced book make for a very rich reading experience -- I got much more out of this reading than from earlier encounters with other editions. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"OK, well maybe read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; too, but if you're going to read just one book by Melville, I suggest this one. Disregarded in Melville's lifetime, this book could have been written today...except that it exemplifies the cultural moment that produced it. Lyrical, magnificent, prescient, and wonderfully confusing, I'm on a personal mission to introduce this novel to as many people as possible."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"\\"The Confidence Man\\" was Melville's last novel. Like all his novels except \\"Moby Dick\\" it was a commercial failure. It is purported to be Melville's personal favorite of his own creation.Melville takes a very special position in this book. He is an active author who directly interacts with the reader. The book is especially intricate and disguised. Melville tried to show the \`Confidence Game' from all angles. He illustrates those performing the game, those who are victims of the game, and those who are just side players in the game.In a brilliant fashion, Melville creates his text in such a way so as to leave the reader wondering just who is the player and who is the victim. He recognizes that his uniquely obtuse style in this book is particularly nebulous to the reader. In a technique that is rarely used by any author, Melville directly addresses the reader in two chapters. His words help the reader reach the conclusions that are elucidated.In the book, Melville seems to try to explain the essence of the Game; in a very interesting manner. He seems to be saying that \`All people are seeking confidence. They are either seeking self-confidence, or they are seeking the confidence of others, or they are preying on other people's confidence.' With this basic premise, Melville shows how the Game is executed and how manipulative it can be. There is no lack of the psychological in this book. Melville writes almost exclusively about the mental machinations that are utilized to play the Game effectively.The book is highly recommended to those who are interested in the workings of the human mind and how those operations can be persuasive and even dangerous. It is a true classic in every sense of the word. It should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"Embarking from St Louis on a Mississippi riverboat named Fid&egrave;le (Faithful) two hand written signs are on display. On one a Christ like deaf mute writes lines from Corinthians like \\"Charity thinketh no evil\\" and \\"Charity believeth all things\\" and on the other a barber not wishing to give credit writes \\"NO TRUST\\". A line from The Merchant of Venice comes to mind \\"The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose\\" because the deaf mute holds up his sign filled with scriptural tolerance right beside a placard offering a reward for the capture of the Confidence man. The deaf mute \\"went forward, seating himself in a retired spot on the forecastle, nigh the foot of a ladder there leading to a deck above, up and down which ladder some of the boatmen, in discharge of their duties, were occasionally going.\\" and he goes to sleep. This Jacob's ladder signals us to possible otherworldly access to the boat and as we know angels ascend and descend Jacob's ladder a fallen fellow of their kin might have made his way onto the boat via this ladder and now this Jacob sleeping at the foot of it is ready to assume successive avatars of the Confidence man. Jacob in Genesis was a trickster and it being April fools day the Confidence man takes on many a masquerade as he tries to persuade people on the riverboat to have confidence. At minimum Melville in this novel has given us a comedic Mississippi boat ride on the nature of illusion and trust and a scathing critique of mid nineteenth century America. The Confidence man as the crippled slave, Black Guinea, catches pennies in his mouth he assumes complex disguises as representatives of various charities--the Seminole Widows and Orphans Fund--the inventor of the Protean Chair that relaxes all infirmities by its flexibility, including infirmities of the tormented conscience, a naturopath herb doctor, and a representative of the Philosophical Intelligence Office. Through all of this his profits are minuscule--a dollar or three, a shave on credit, and so forth. His triumphs are the granting of confidence in him, not the money. At the close of the novel the last avatar of the Confidence man, the Cosmopolitan, is talking to an old man but the old man is trying to find a life preserver something he has never seen. The Cosmopolitan gives him a wooden stool chamber pot and tells him that it is a life preserver. He humorously tells him \\"I think that in case of a wreck, barring sharp-pointed timbers, you could have confidence in that stool for a special providence.\\" In a book rife with symbolism this penultimate symbol typifies the main theme of the novel: Look to what you place confidence in or you might be left holding a chamber pot believing it to be a life preserver."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"H. Bruce Franklin's finely annotated Melville is once again available.Perhaps not the best place to discuss the story, at least let's discuss the edition. I have always thought these footnotes have been a necessary part of this long running joke. The book seems tough and well-constructed. Not everyone's copy will be read through, but the others will be thumbed to death, almost like an airliner in static test destruction.And what a ride! This is a story about story-telling and about story-telling techniques. One of the longest and most absurd being Wilbur/Thoreau's honking of the story of China Aster. Everyone is fighting over how to tell this tale! Himmlerian Mark Winsome lays down the Party Line, Wilbur trying to strain off the tannins. Frank Goodman tries to redeem it. Melville attempts to hide behind it. I find myself arguing with myself about it. Is it genius? Is it that bad? Is Emerson so hateful? Did The Confidence Man actually get angry -- or did he know the barber was just about set to close up shop for the night.Melville's greatest work in a clean new lifetime edition, available right now."},{"Title":"The Confidence-Man (World's Classics)","review":"I take &quot;The Confidence Man&quot; to be a comedy of confused identities and good humor which together help us look at our notions of trust and kindness. A modern example of this level of the story can be found in the film &quot;The Sting&quot;. There are other, more subtler things going on in Melville's book that merit more readings, of course, but much of the book can be enjoyed for its seemingly light-hearted look at our willingness to be duped by salesmen and hucksters.The particular edition that I read seemed to be a re-print of an earlier edition. There is a too-brief introduction to the author and the book. Likewise, there are no notes to help with some of the expressions common in the 19th century but since fallen into disuse in the 21st. For example, when one of the confidence men refers to his &quot;father's friend, James Hall, the judge&quot;, I wondered if Melville was referring to his own father-in-law, who was a judge. Hall, it turns out, was a writer whose 1835 book &quot;Sketches...&quot; was one of Melville's sources.A good &quot;companion&quot; to The Confidence Man and other Melville works is The Cambridge Companion to Herman Melville, edited by R. S. Levine.

They all are a fabulous blends of History and Arthurian legend. In this particular book gives a detailed account of Merlyn's life and how he became the wizard we all think of him as. It is a new look at an old legend from a point of view that should have been put to use long before Whyte came along. The change in Merlyn from man of myth and legend like other Arthurian novels to a man of arms with problems and sorrows just like anyone else places this book on a level of its own. Although it is a very long book it is worth nearly every minute. It is a fantasy book, history lesson, and a great way to spend a rainy day all put into one. If you have every fell in love with knights, chivalry, or kings this book will restore that childhood dream or if it never left keep it burning bright. I know it has done so for me. If you ever just want to get away form life and find like me that a book helps this one is great for just that purpose.

The era of history covered by the books has been throughly researched by the author and retains a tone of authenticity as regards the daily life and times of it's many and varied characters.

But anyone expecting the conventional, or Hollywood slant on the legend of Arthur, i.e. knights riding around on destriers in full body armour, something invented several hundred years after Arthur had gone to his grave, if he ever existed at all, will be in for a sharp shock.The books are set in the 5th century AD a much more likely time for Arthur to have existed, a time when Britain, although free of the Romans, who had gone back across the channel to Rome, was still very much influenced by their occupation.Camulod, a settlement founded by the descendants of both Roman and Celt continues in its development. Arthur has been born and orphaned and is in the care of Merlyn. It is in Camulod that Arthur's mind is fashioned under the teachings of Merlyn.

It is a great series, and I enjoyed each one of them.It is to be expected that Whyte departs from the (rather sketchy) history Aavailable of the period, in a fiction series. And yet he has done his research, obviously, which is important to me in historical novels.There have been several very good books written about the pre-Arthurian period in England, many of which I've read. Jack Whyte's worked ranks right at the top, with me. I am familiar with what history is available, having read much of the period, and his research effort is obvious.He begins with a couple of Roman legionaires as his protagonists, before the Legions pulled out of England: Publius Varrus and Caius Brittanicus. The series then follows their lives and their family's lives through a series of gripping adventures, as they strive to maintain order and peace on the colony they have created in the South of England.Publius Varrus, a blacksmith, creates a great and beautiful sword from a meteorite before he dies, which he names Excalibur, King Arthur's famous blade. Of course, eventually the series chronicles the lives of Merlyn (Merlin) and Arthur.I was caught up in the story, and I strongly recommend it.

On the other hand it tries to give one a sense of the times as they actually were and does that reasonably well."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"Incredibly padded. Every conversation begins with 'what's up?' and the story is in a perspective that is unecessary. Even in the first person, it's impossible to have a full grasp of the character of Merlin.There's nothing to really offer, and any potentially intense moment is overlapped by quick descriptions. Ie. Clear the burburs from the so-and-so town is just 'there were some street fights and two of my guys were wounded and one dead, but all of the enemy was slaughtered, so I recorded it as a victory and then mailed the report to accounting'. It's like listening to somebody's recollection of a videogame. For 'realism' the author picks and chooses which events to describe in greater detail (usually if the protagonist's life is at stake) and the rest is just endless conversations about marriage and the protagonist's sexual feelings for Shelague, which he says he shouldn't feel because he's trying to be celibate because he is lord reagent of camelot and...It gets really tedious and there's a lot of stuff that mostly amounts to nothing. Again, there's hardly any character development except a few social difficulties merlin has to go over (pendragon whathisname says merlin's egotistical and oh no!), his fear of his own sorcerous ways (basically covered with what amounts to 'I'm afraid! Okay? Got it? Cool.'). So from that, the only moral lessons are basically, don't be egotistical, and if you have freaky vision of the future powers, don't announce them to the locals, because they'll lynch you... if you happen to live in 500 AD dark ages.The entire book is filled with bland and emotionless padding. Like was already mentioned by somebody else, if it were shortened 500 pages, it'd be somewhat enjoyable, but it isn't.

Every time the action and plot seem to be about to catch their groove, instead we get...nothing. Lots of ideas that lead nowhere in particular. And I know Whyte is keeping it readable, but do we really need Arthurian characters approaching each other with a \\"What's up?\\" Bleh.This one was certainly the dullest by far, with little payoff.

Now, that I've totally lost you, I'll begin again. . .This series, The Camulod Chronicles, outlines the story of King Arthur as it might have been in a historical perspective, beginning with the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. If there were such a person as Arthur, he would have lived during this time. Most likely, he was a composite character, based on some of the more influential warlords and petty kings of the day. As an aside, I am reminded of a vacation in southern England that my family took in 1995. My sons, who were 11 and 13 at the time, could not understand my excitement in viewing the ruins of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, asking \\"How can this be the birthplace of someone who never was?\\" But, that's a different story. . .The first two books of the series, which outlined the founding of Camulod (or Camelot) and Avalon and the forging of the sword Excalibur, were told from the viewpoint of an old Roman soldier. These last two books, which detail the birth of Arthur and his early boyhood years, are told from the viewpoint of Merlin, or, \\"Merlyn\\" in the Chronicles. As an avid reader of Arthurian legend and all its various retellings, let me tell you that the character of Merlin is probably one of the most varied of them all, probably due to the fact that he was actually a minor character in Mallory. Hence, the details are free to be filled in by the current chronicler. Merlin ranges from an evil wizard living backward in time to a benevolent sorcerer to merely a human being who is just a little smarter than most. The most esoteric version of Merlin can be found in Stephen Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle in which Merlin is the son of Charis, the last princess of Atlantis, and Taliesen, the greatest of the Celtic Bards. Except for the exotic birth, Jack Whyte's Merlyn has much in common with Lawhead's Merlin in that both were mortal men, though a little larger than life in that they were fierce warriors, outstanding field generals, and outstanding scholars. Also, neither possessed the true gift of magic, though they were believed to by the masses of humanity.The Camulod Chronicles begin earlier than Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\", in a time that historically did occur, hence the tales carry an air of realism. The descriptions of the Roman influence on Britain in the late Fourth and early Fifth centuries are fascinating. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, but the pages just keep on turning. The story is easy to follow as well as fun. There are those critics who complain that some of the dates given are inaccurate, as well as some of the situations. As Don Henley sang, \\"Get over it.\\" This is historical *fiction* at it's finest, with the emphasis on *fiction*. Granted, there are differences between this series and others of its kind, but the abundant variety of viewpoints and details are what make Arthurian literature the great store that it is. The only \\"disconcerting\\" thing I've found so far is that the character of Vortigern (who was an actual person, by the way) is far more sympathetic in these tales than in others I've read. But, then, Jack Whyte has turned out such a magnum opus that I can only admire and respect his poetic license.I have begun the fifth book of the series, \\"The Fort at River's Bend\\" and the level has not dropped. I will keep reading these books as long as Mr. Whyte keeps writing them (book 6 is in print and book 7 is due to be published later this year). So far, I consider this to be among the best Arthurian series' I have ever read. I would recommend them to anyone who has an interest in the Arthurian legend, anyone who has an interest in historical fiction, or both. As a bonus, anyone who likes these books would most likely like Stephen Lawhaead's Pendragon Cycle and Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy. The order you read them in is not important, though somewhere in the mix you should read Mallory to see where it all began. I love Arthurian fiction and fact, and, after reading these books, I'm sure a lot of the rest of you will, too."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"While I enjoyed book 4 in this series,I can't help but feel that this is just a bridge between the days of the colony and what is obviously about to follow in book 5.The scenes are graphic and very well written and I have never before read historical works which spring to life in such reality.Mr Whyte is without doubt a master story teller but I just wanted to hurry through this one to get to &quot;The Fort at River Bend&quot; (which fortunately,I already possessed)"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend.

I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"I enjoy reading about distant times and I had read the first two of this series as books and enjoyed them This is the fourth and I can tell I have missed the intervening book so will have to order that . This early period in British history when Romans and Romanized Britons were trying to survive the chaos left behind when the Roman administrators and armies left Britain in the 400s AD ;and had to face the local Celts tribes as well as the beginning Saxon invasion ( not to mention Danes in the north ) makes for fascinating reading if sometimes violent descriptions of action. It has the added attraction of treating the Arthur myth as historical fact. It is good fiction writing even if one does not buy it as historical truth"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"A few years ago my son accidentally left The Lance Thrower behind after one of his visits home. I picked it up and couldn't put it down.'Of course, then I had to begin with the first book, which I also loved. Well, then I started giving them away and of course never getting them back. So, I probably have bought the entire set at least four times. (Your welcome Mr. Whyte) The Saxon Shore truly is one of my favorites. I wish the books would just continue.

I had to write a whole new one when I realized my mistake. Oops!* The hardest part for me, in this novel, was the complete character change-over from the earlier books in the Camulod Chronicles series. In the previous book, &quot;The Eagle's Brood&quot;, many of the older characters from &quot;Skystone&quot; and &quot;Singing Sword&quot; still lived on, and played an important role. In this book however, the reader must get used to a complete lack of our old favorites. While good, this book is a slower read then the rest, while by no means boring. Merlyn and Uther prove very fascinating characters, full of grit and integrity, but flawed, like all of Whyte's characters. This is part of what makes his books so orginal, fresh, and delicious. A good addition to the his series, but not the best book of them all."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"In response to fredderf@worldnet.att.com from Santa Barbara, CA, USA , November 29, 1998 The Great Train Wreck continues...As a reader for the purpose of relaxation and enjoyment Jack Whyte has given me a world I can escape to. Jack provides a feeling of plausibility that makes me feel that I am not merely letting imagination fly, but rather exercising my imagination, to explore the possibility that legends could be based on a foundation of some factual events.Any criticism as you have vented here, is no more than weak verbal attack as would be made in a school yard spat. True constructive criticism requires a strong backing of counter evidence to show why and how the failings have occurred. To simply state that one is wrong or inadequate, without providing substantiated reasoning, places the accuser in the position of fighting with emotion rather than fact.Jack has opened our minds to the fact that entertainment can also be a learning experience. One can challenge our selves to believe without straying to fantasy or far out science fiction. We can question the dismissal of old legends as pure fantasy. If in fact we can once again believe in that fact that the heros of legend might have been real people, maybe their virtues could also have been real. These virtues are something that all of us need an ability to revive once again."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"I have read many books about Arthurian lore. The Camulod chronicles are by far the quintesential embodiment of a truly page-turning series. Realistic characters unencumbered by aimless fantasy and unrealistic sorcerey give The Camulod Chronicles what the Arthurian legend has been lacking for centuries;Humanity,and believable plot progression. Caius Merlyn Brittanicus is to be praised as the most respectable and admirable embodiment of young Arthur's guardian ever. Whyte's books have explained in a clever and plausible fashion many of the confusing mysteries of the Arthurian realm, such as the connection between Excalibur and the mysterious Lady of the Lake. Magnificent! Our only hope is that Jack Whyte will grace us with more installments of the Arthurian legacy. Three cheers for Jack Whyte!"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"I have to wonder to myself why I even bother to continue reading this man's work (see my previous reviews of the earlier volumes). If he wrote purely as fantasy the world would pass him off as a hack, but as a writer of historical fiction he should be drummed out of the club. Has the man never read even the basics of Celtic culture? Surely with all the hundreds of books available on the subject he should be able to find something! His knowledge of the era is fascinatingly scanty and he fills it in with such wild speculation that one is tempted to believe tha aliens are at work. The plot, once again, happens -- there is no reason for anything to happen, but it happens anyway. The characters are caricatures. The relation to the Arthurian legends is even scantier then the relation to history. This man is an awful writer. Camelot 3000 is more plausible than this tripe."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"Amazing. I am not done with the book yet (I got a few 300 pages to go) But I recommend to anyone who loves the legend of King Arthur. It's long but worth reading. I bought it last week and I have not put it done since (only to eat and shower etc.) It was confusing to me at first because I did not know that this book is part of a series and there are 3 books before, but I still love it anyway..and I'm going to read the first 3!!"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"If you liked Whyte's previous sophomoric efforts, you'll love this. In addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler: in no real way does the story get advanced. Arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy. There are adventures, but nothing important happens. As usual, in Whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters. With all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, Merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in Camelot. Anyone who would read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship. So go for it. But please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good Arthurian efforts out there--Gillian Brandshaw, A.A. Attanasio, or Barbara Taylor Bradford to name just a very few..."},{"Title":"A current of electricity sufficient in intensity to cause immediate death: A pre-Furman history of Florida's electric chair","review":"Biographer Epstein does a straightforward, almost journalistic description of the life and times of Armand Hammer, considered by many to be a man of vision, humanity, and charity until details of his life began to seep out following his death. Even the New York Times gave this man a glowing obituary. But, thanks to the tremendous research done by Epstein, we see Hammer for what he was: an evil, self-serving, egomanic. And Epstein's non-sensational telling of the details of Hammer's life is appropriate; it is unnecessary to augment beyond the notoriousness of Hammer's own actions. What Hammer did speaks for itself, and Epstein catalogues his many sins. He was a traitor to his country, his family, his friends. He was such a lowlife that he allowed his father to go to prison for crime he, the son, committed. He was a perpetual adulterer. He laundered millions of dollars and had secret accounts everywhere. He drove what most believed to be a successful company to the brink of bankruptcy. But I could have done without the incessant mini-flashbacks that kept creeping into the narration. And I think it was a really bad choice to begin the book with the prologue describing Hammer's final days. It would work much better at the end, as this failure of a human being tops himself while he is dying with malicious, coniving, and deceitful steps to preserve his false characterization upon his passing. I would strongly recommend that you read the prologue at the end of the book. I would also suggest that as you finish each chapter, you turn to the source notes for that chapter and be amazed by the research Epstein did to compile his facts. He paints Hammer as such a dispicable character, that you will be astounded that this character got away with his ruse for his entire life. In this day of rotten corporate big-business, the book shows the rot has been going on for decades."},{"Title":"A current of electricity sufficient in intensity to cause immediate death: A pre-Furman history of Florida's electric chair","review":"I remember Armand Hammer appearing on the Tonight Show and other of guest appearances on the popular shows of the day doing his best to create a positive public image. He largely succeeded.This book shows the deals he cut with rather awful people and Hammer's, being kind, questionable character. It is an engrossing story and the book is a great read.The point is that this is an important story because of the relationships Hammer had with people in power in the Soviet Union, in the Middle East, and in Washington. Occidental Petroleum was and is an important company. Of course, Al Gore's father success, and much of Gore's personal wealth, is based upon carrying water for Occidental Petroleum. The company worked hard in post Hammer times to erase that difficult past. You can judge for yourself.I believe that you will enjoy this book and warmly recommend it to you."},{"Title":"A current of electricity sufficient in intensity to cause immediate death: A pre-Furman history of Florida's electric chair","review":"There exists an unusually wide breadth of opinions about Armand Hammer -- he almost won the Nobel Peace Prize, and is revered by those who have benefited from his charitable endeavors, yet is excoriated by the political right. The latter group became particularly vocal in the United States around 2000, as Hammer's ties to Al Gore's father became fodder for talk-radio rumor mongering in that year's presidential election.Dossier is the only biography of Hammer written with reference to both the U.S. government's records on the man, made available under the Freedom of Information Act after he died, and Soviet records, made available after the collapse of the U.S.S.R. It is therefore the only book that comes close to explaining the nature of Hammer's ties to the Soviet Union. (Spoiler: In the early 1920s, he set up some companies that were used as channels by the Soviets for financing secret operations abroad).Unfortunately, Epstein was not satisfied with these records, and turns to some really marginal sources to sex up the story. The book contains a number of particularly shocking accusations that, if you follow through the footnotes, all come from a woman who claims to have been Hammer's mistress, decades ago. Take for example Epstein's rendition of the well-known 1920 conviction of Hammer's father for manslaughter. Hammer's father had performed an abortion after which the woman had died. Among those who testified at the trial were the woman's maid, who had been present when the operation took place. Every other source on Hammer treats this as the start of Hammer's business career -- with his father incarcerated, Hammer had to take the reins of the family business.Epstein, on the other hand, writes that it was the 21-year-old *Hammer himself* who had committed the abortion, not his father, and that he had allowed his father to go to jail for the crime. Epstein bases this remarkable claim on the 1990s recollection of a woman who claimed to have been Hammer's mistress in the 1950s, and who said that Hammer confessed to this crime (along with a string of other appalling things) to her. He ignores the fact that much more credible contemporary witnesses testified to the contrary.Repeatedly in the book, Epstein takes credit for \\"discovering\\" things that have been widely known for decades, and which are discussed in detail in previous Hammer biographies. Meanwhile, his discussion of Hammer's 70-year-long business career is cursory.If you do read the book, be sure to check the footnotes on any novel claim; some of the sources are really weak. See Weinberg's biography of Hammer for a much better treatment of everything except the early Soviet material."},{"Title":"A current of electricity sufficient in intensity to cause immediate death: A pre-Furman history of Florida's electric chair","review":"This book details the life of a rotten man. Probably a psychopathic man (to read more about this breed, read WITHOUT CONSCIENCE by Robert Hare). Armand Hammer was so ego-ridden, he was always having some book published about how wonderful he was. So it's great to have a book to counter his propoganda about himself. People--especially Americans--love a success, and often willfully overlook the rotten ends the successful person went to to become successful. As was the case with Hammer. A vain vain, conscience-free man. This book was both nauseating and fascinating to read."},{"Title":"A current of electricity sufficient in intensity to cause immediate death: A pre-Furman history of Florida's electric chair","review":"The man the media held out to us as a humanitarian, art lover, and brilliant capitalist is finally exposed in this brilliantly-written and thoroughly-researched book. From performing illegal abortions to twenty years as a hard-core Soviet agent for Lenin and Stalin, to international bribes, to Watergate, to fathering and abandoning bastard children, to the theft of tens if not hundreds of millions, Hammer would do anything. As a Jew he was able to be one of the major agents between the early Soviet government and the American communist movement both of which contained a very large proportion of Jews. Only the communists, our Republican, and Democratic politicians, and media liked this total fraud. In the end even his family loathed him."},{"Title":"A current of electricity sufficient in intensity to cause immediate death: A pre-Furman history of Florida's electric chair","review":"I found this book to be utterly fascinating. There has been so much smoke blown about Armand Hammer over the years (a lot of it from the mouth of the Hammer himself) that it is refreshing to read a less worshipful account.

Hammer, whether as a Soviet agent or as a &quot;businessman&quot; and &quot;philanthropist&quot; was motivated primarily by power and greed, Epstein demonstrates with a deft touch. It is difficult for ordinary--that is, mostly moral and honorable--people to accept that such moral monsters exist among us. Fortunately the &quot;evil empire&quot; that Hammer served has crumbled, and that's the best revenge against Hammer and his commrades. In every aspect of his life--whether in bribing Venezuelan politicos to gain oil concessions or contributing illegal campaign funds to people like Richard Nixon, Hammer took the dishonorable course. Thanks to Epstein, now in death Hammer hasn't really gotten away with it, since he cared so deeply about his legacy.

Here, author Epstein, provides a captivating biography of Armand Hammer - a con's con. Hammer pulled &quot;all the stops&quot; in a brazen existence of deception that is way beyond what can be imagined by all but the most cunning connivers. Crossing even blood and family members, Epstein's true chronicle of Hammer far surpasses anything of the mass media fictional yarns or true, related stories of the same ilk. Exceptionally well-written and very difficult to put down: most readers will find Hammer's m.o. incredulous and not being able to wait to see what happens next.

I was hoping for more information on their dealings with Robert Maxwell but it was only mentioned in brief. Hammer, like is father, presented to the public as immensely wealthy and powerful individuals, yet reality had dictated the opposite. Hammer, a man in quest for power, could have taken the time to do good things but instead he worked to expand not only his own personal image/power but to keep the secret line open to advance the Communist movement.

Probably not, she was so sweet, with wisdom beyond her years. I actuallydidn't see any villans in the book, truth be told.

But so far I have liked all Sandra Browns books, and not to my suprise it was great, I read it in one day.

So when she was offered a chance to try to change her title she marries Roscoe (a very wealthy man),and the father of Rink, whom she had a slight past with. When Rink comes home for his fathers death, they find out the passion that he and Caroline had shared was stronger now then 12 years ago when Rink left her behind. And before Roscoe dies he lets known all the secrets of his dirty scams that he was involved in and set up, and the couple has to figure out where to go from there, now that they know the truth.

Even if the circumstance was the marriage of the heroine to the hero's father. Okay, so the father was evil was orchestrated everything. He was cruel and used the heroine, verbally abusing her as well as being physically rough with her.So how is the son different from the father? When he gets angry with her (which is most of the time), he grabs her, mauls her, tells her she's trash, while she fights to get away from him. How is it we're supposed to believe she loves him? Their summer romance was when she was 15, and this is some 12 years later. He certainly doesn't rekindle any romantic feelings by being kind.The sex scenes are embarassing with their euphemisms and overall lameness.The book wasn't a horrible premise. It was just horribly done. A hero should be likeable and it should be obvious why the heroine wants to be with him."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I love her suspense and wasn't sure about the romance type.

Maybe the many good things I had heard and read about the author had raised my expectations too much or maybe this is just not one of her best works, but I was fairly disappointed with this book.Sure Mrs. Brown adheres to the 411 of romance writing and the basic story is not without originality. But the characters and their actions are as real as the ones in a cheap soap opera, complete with all the tears, screams and clich&eacute; stances (his cornering her, hand against the wall, her walking away turning her back, his standing rigidly, head forward, tight fists by the sides). The heroine was given more maturity with 15 than with 27 and the lead couple was more likable in those flashbacks (these were however well interwoven with the main story). Also, the couple's reasons to stay apart until the end of the book, her concern about her reputation in the town and his pride are really weak. This and some of the character's other flaws kept me from ever relating to either protagonist.Additionally, some of the plot twists were unconvincing (Caroline's sex life with Roscoe); others were easily reconizable crutches to give the couple more time together and later vanished into obscurity. Some promising threads were never tied up. The sexual tension was overbearing and the prolific sex scenes dragged on too long, all for the price of some deeper character exploration.So if you just start out with romances or with Sandra Brown for that matter you can probably make a better choice than this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I bought this book today and I've already finished it.

The story had a good opening, but then it didn't really go anywhere. The sub-plot of Laura Jane and Steve was more interesting than the hero and heroine. I'm still a big fan of Sandra Brown and on the whole it's a good book, but I've come to expect more from her work."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Wow, that was terribly hard to read. I had no idea it was going to have so many lame sex scenes. They overtook the story and frankly I completely missed the point. So sorry to have bought it. I dont need a picture painted, I have an imagination."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I realize that this book was originally released in the early 80's, so some of the themes were reflective of the times. One of them being a 15 year old having a relationship with a 22 year old man. Putting that aside, I still had issues with the story.Rink (I love that name)returns 12 years after his romance with Caroline ended. Caroline is now married to Rinks very rich father and is dying. Rink is bitter about the marriage, but was the one who had ended the relationship with Caroline 12 years before.While the attraction is still there, there's lots of resentment on Rinks part and he's pretty vocal about it. Other than the physical attraction, there just didn't seem to be more to it, in spite of what was written. Also, the story with the father (Roscoe) just seemed to be so not believable.The aspect of the story that I did enjoy was a blossoming romance between Rinks sister, a mildly mentally handicapped woman, with a sweet demeaner and Steve a somewhat cynical man who is recovering from the horrors of Vietnam. It's a sweet story and tells that there is someone out there for everyone. That romance was both believable and sweet."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book starts out with promise, and kept me wondering what really happened to the lovers that kept them apart. Other than the supsense of finding out what really happened between Caroline and Rink, there was nothing good about this novel. The secondary characters seem pointless, as if Brown only included them in her novel to fill space and add more pages to this book. With character names like Rink, Roscoe, and Granger, Brown tries too hard to make this into a romance. There is no distinguished climax to this story, other than Caroline becoming pregnant. I was always taught in English class that stories should have climaxes, and shame on the publishers for not noticing that there is none. It was a big let down to receive this book, which kept me in supsense for a while, and read as nothing came of it. The characters aren't very likeable and Caroline is not the heroine one might expect her to be."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I can't even finish this book-it is that terrible! The characters are so thoroughly unlikable and the plot so unbelievable it's ridiculous. A waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

What a love story."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I belong to a monthly bookclub with sixteen members. We try to pick books from a list of authors with bestsellers. This is the first that over half of us did not like. I felt it started out with the &quot;I cannot stop reading&quot; feeling. I wish Caroline's husband, Roscoe had been introduced before his illness. I think he would of added so much more to the story. Roscoe and Rink had a father/son relationship that the author missed. Why the daughter and caretaker? I feel no point was made. We were all put on a high cliff and left without a parachute. Disappointed club member."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This was the first novel I've read by Sandra Brown and I'm glad to say that I was not disappointed. I usually steer clear of contemporary romances (unless it's a book from Judith McNaught), but I'm now real glad that I gave Brown a try; the story was very romantic. I didn't think she could pull it off, with Caroline being married to Rink's father. Their relationship was very sweet though, and the author conveys the tension, love and longing between the couple so well that it was as if nothing was lost between them despite the long separation. The only problem I've had with the book was that I found the names of the characters (Rink!) a bit strange which is a minor complaint which will not deter my appreciation for this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book was interesting, and it kept my attention with all that lovey-dovey stuff, but I think Sandra's way to obssessed with just one topic, and it's not romance."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've only just finished this book yesterday and I've already forgotten much of it. It's just plain unremarkable. There is a villian, the heroine's evil older husband. There are two romances in the story; one of the heroine, and one of the hero's younger, developmentally-disabled sister. The love scenes are trite and although they do not go into graphic detail, there's something vulgar about the language. This novel was written in 1984, and perhaps it read differently then, but I found the dialogue and descriptions during love scenes a bit smarmy. It's not terrible, but there's not much to enjoy either."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"There is no question that this is definately one of my favorite Sandra Brown books.

Not that that is a good thing or a bad thing either way. Rink was gone for twelve long years after breaking Caroline's heart.

I just could not imagine a love story where the heroine is first married to the father of the hero. Being a Sandra Brown fan, and I buy all of Sandra Brown's releases, I went ahead and bought it. I must say I was not disappointed. The plot turned out to be very good, and kept me interested. The book was also a double treat of romance, with not only Rink and Caroline, the main couple, but with Steve and Laura Jane (Rink's sister). I fell in love with this couple just as much as Rink and Caroline! I would most definitely recommend &quot;Bittersweet Rain&quot;.

It kept me reading until I found out what kept them together, then the startling truth that kept them together."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"SANDRA BROWN'S BITTERSWEET RAIN takes a more convoluted twist to the plot when the couple in the book, Caroline and Rink are wedged apart by Rink's father, Roscoe with his scathing treachery.However, readers may find it hard to digest the plot of a stepmother in unrequited love with her son.The stunning revelation of Roscoe's plan to ruin his son upon his deathbed remains a shadow over Caroline's undying love for Rink. Despite their strong attraction, Rink cannot cast off the fact that Caroline belonged to Roscoe once.Fortunately, SANDRA BROWN handles the twisted plot with unexpected maturity in her perspective. Caroline and Rink are fuelled by desires but at the same time they tried to fend off the attraction for the relationship is bound to explode in a conservative town still in awe of Roscoe. To fight off the shadow, Rink has to confront himself their bond is too strong such that Roscoe has never once taken his beloved away.Right till the last moment when Caroline fainted at award ceremony dedicated to Roscoe because of pregnancy, readers are gripped by the powerful emotions spun by Ms. Brown. It is savagely tender and their love no less bittersweet. She transforms an unconventional tale into one of simplicity and poignancy with her rousing narrative.For this, BITTERSWEET RAIN is one romance that will wring heartfelt tears for Caroline and Rink, and incessant accolades for this beautiful writer constantly producing textured materials."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to sream with frustration at the characters pig-headedness, yet I could understand their logic. The bickering between them is sweet yet very sexual and sassy. This isn't one of Sandra Brown's finest but it is very intriguing."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've read more recent books by Sandra Brown and really liked them, so I thought I'd give this one a shot. Should have known better. First off, reading the scenes where the heroine, Caroline, is 15, made me feel like a pedophile. And we're supposed to think that some 22-year old guy who takes advantage of an obviously naive 15-year old is a good guy? Just because he oh-so-nobly decides to wait to have sex with her until he tells his dad about her, that makes it OK?Next, how you can you have any sympathy or respect for a romantic heroine who flat out admits that she married a nasty, horrible man for wealth and status? She had a job, she was supporting herself fine. It's not like she was living on the streets and that was her only way out. Chalk up two in the ick factor.Finally, while it was much better handled than the rest of the story, the subplot involving a developmentally disabled girl and a much older Vietnam vet bothered me, probably because Brown was never consistent or detailed in explaining what the developmental disability was. And the descriptions of her actions were inconsistent as to her capabilities. The net result is, it feels a little creepy. And even though she does try to make it sweet, the first time the vet kisses her, he's feeling her up. Which again, makes it feel like she's taken advantage of.All in all, while I still really like Sandra Brown, I'm sticking to her books that were written in the last decade.I would also caution anyone against buying this on a Kindle, as the spelling and punctuation is awful, so that you have to go back and reread whole paragraphs just to figure out what it's supposed to say."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This is the first of Sandra brown's books I've ever read but will not be the last! Not only an author but an artist! She made the characters come to life for me and I could visualize in my mind's eye what they all looked like and even the looks they gave each other! It made me long to be at The Retreat, I can't wait to get another of her books. I hope it's just as good because I'm not sure it can be better!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"If you don't mind relationships where the surviving spouse takes up with a family member or friend of the dead spouse, then you might like this book. But if you're like me, you won't. However, even without my convictions, this book was still pretty sorry. First off, it's slow. Second, the leading lady, who by the way was the main reason I disliked this book so much. (However, judging by the other reviews, I'm in the minority)It might not have been so bad if we weren't made to believe that Rink, the son of the man Caroline married, was the real love of her life, yet she married the father anyway for money, status, and a stupid house. What kind of woman does that? Not one that I could like. The Retreat? PLEASE!!! Give me a break. She must not have loved Rink too much. What made me the maddest about her was her response to the reading of the will. She tells Rink \\"her true love\\" to contest the will in which his father left him nothing, but left his mothers house (The Retreat) to her, his stupid wife. I just could not believe it. I would have said, contest it huh, why don't you just give it back to me you tramp. She was just selfish, stupid, of weak moral character, and she was always putting her nose where it didn't belong. SB tried to redeem her in the end, but it was too late as far as I was concerned. Anyway, bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"What would you do if the person you hated most in the world took everything from you, including your mother and the love of your life? And still he was not satisfied.On his deathbed, Roscoe Lancaster requests that his long absent son come home so that he can see him one last time. His wife complies and the prodigal son is summoned. Of course not on is Rink her stepson, he is also her first (and only) love. Of course Roscoe's motivations for a reunion are not all out of compassion for the son he lost; it is just one more chance to one up him by flaunting his relationship with wife Caroline in Rink's face. Roscoe was the main antagonist who drove the two apart when they were engaging in an elicit relationship (Caroline was 15; Rink was 22 - kinda icky).Rink cannot help himself and his still intense feelings for Caroline. A stolen kiss here; a grope there. But underlying in his thoughts is that his father made love to her first. Can Rink ever get over his pride and declare his love for Caroline?\\"Bittersweet Rain\\" is a melodramatic love story set against the machinations of a truly evil and desperate man, who loves no one, least of all himself. His contempt for the less than perfect daughter (who loves him unconditionally) makes you want to punch him. There is a lot of chemistry between the two leads; but clunky, dated love scenes (his \\"maleness\\"; her \\"feminine core\\"). One of the most endearing qualities of the book is the emerging relationship between Rink's sister Laura Jane, and the disabled ranch hand, Steve.Though a little dated (it was originally written in 1984; re-released in 2000), it was an enjoyable and romantic romp."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Only Sandra Brown will put together the most unexpected couple, step mom &amp; step son. But the story was so beautifully woven that I don't mind at all the weirdness of the situation. Although Caroline was married to Rink's father, she had been Rink's lover even before she got acquainted with Roscoe. Only years after Rink left her to marry somebody else, did she chose the father. For those who are familiar with SB's other books, the relationship between Caroline and Rink resembles Schyler &amp; Cash in &quot;Slow Heat in Heaven&quot;; the secondary characters, Mary Jane and Steve are Janellen &amp; Bowie in &quot;Where There's Smoke&quot; only for Mary Jane and Steve, SB went deeper with their love story. Quite a treat for the readers. Two romances in one book - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I loved this story!! It is romantic and heart wrenching at the same time.

In this book, Rink first knew caroline when she was of tender age of fifteen. they fell in love but because of some circumstances they were kept apart.Without any explanation from Rink for his running away Caroline found it hard to wait for him forever and took the chance of having respect and money that she always craved for by marrying a rich but older man. Well till now it isn't so bad, is it? But as it happened that older man was Rink's father and Caroline knew it. Now how is that for feeling antipathy for a woman who married the father of the man she loved? And i don't really blame Rink for being angry with her again and again for what she had done.Caroline wasn't a saint and i don't think any person in her shoes can afford to be anyway. Who knows what i would do if i happened to be in her place? So i wouldn't judge her and would advice other readers to not judge her too.Both the times Rink came in contact with Caroline she was forbidden for him. That part of this romance was best. Their summer romance so many years back was very sweet. Rink's conscience and desire were in fight with each other. i like this in a romance and i like the build of sexual tension in Sandra brown's novel.She really is the best!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"WOW, WHAT A PREDICAMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND THE WOMAN YOU ONCE AND STILL LOVED MARRIED TO THE MAN YOU HATE TO CALL YOUR FATHER?

I bought this book mostly just to see how on earth she could make the step-mother/step-son scenerio work and I was amazed. It started off alittle slow, but it picked up and boy...I didn't want it to end. And if the story about Caroline and Rink wasn't enough, there was a secondary romance between his sweet little sister Laura Jane and Steve going on. This book stirred my emotions with the cruel Roscoe (I was furious!!),Caroline's years growing up with the town drunk, Rink's first wife and her daughter that he missed...there was just so much. I couldn't put it down once I got about half-way and stayed up until 2:30am this morning to see how it ended.

If you have time for a short romance this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Okay, so I read this book because I read three others by Brown. I was motivated to do so by the fact that each of the previous books had at least one great sex scene in it. This book has one pretty good sex scene, but is negated and made all the more unlikely by everything that happens later in the story. My biggest problem with the book though is Brown's characterization of women. There are two main female characters: one is a virgin (and complete idiot) who marries the father of the man she loves for no apparently good reason other than to live in his big house; and, the other is a mentally retarded(but in a &quot;endearing&quot; way, i.e., as long as she's being told what to do, she's happy), makes me wonder if its not Brown's intention to propagate the myth that women are all a deficient sub-species when it comes to getting along in life.Brown's main female character in this book wants love under the ideal (i.e., the right) conditions, but needs a &quot;good&quot; man to calm her down, relax her into the groove, and open her eyes to the subliminal realities that can arise from &quot;great&quot; sex even when life is less than perfect. Hogwash! Only the mentally retarded woman seems to understand what joys may be had on the wings of pure desire, and only the mentally retarded one is ready to get down anywhere, anytime with her lover, which, of course, she does not get to do because she couldn't possibly know what she's doing. &quot;What if she has an orgasm?&quot; -- is the question uppermost on the minds of the family. Her big brother decides to let her try sex (by getting married first), but vows to kill the new husband (a crippled man) if sex hurts his little sis. And all the while I was reading this, I was wondering - how'll he find out? Will there be regular debriefings or as long as she's wandering around blissfully oblivious, is everything supposedly fine?Anyway, the main female character, Caroline, is boring, easily manipulated, dumb (as opposed to being legitimately brain damaged), and totally unbelievable. Nobody...I repeat...nobody could be as unaccountably indecisive as this woman. Half the time she's heaving and sweating over the man (his name is Rink?), the rest of the time she's running away from him because she's worried about anything and everything except working things out with him. She's so insubstantial, she's sickening. The male lead sounds delicious sometimes, then he'll say something so stupid you want to throw the book out the window. I'm supposed to be reading these books for fun; nibbling on them between re-readings of Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton. Mind candy, however, has to at least be palatable, or whats the point? If you like your romance with a little reality, drop Brown like a hot rivet. Start by NOT reading this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I am a long term fan of Sandrea Brown, but this book was a waste of money to buy and a waste of time to read.The male character either has a case of arrested development or child molest tendencies, and even if he had beeen a character in a forensic novel rather than a romance , he would not have been interesting. The female character was equally pathetic for putting up with his obnoxious behavior. I like a good escape novel now and then but this was too unbelievable to be the least bit enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"The story line for this book is good, if you are looking for a Romance by Sandra Brown.

Then I was introduced to the miracle of Kindle for PC and I began looking to see which of Sandra's books were in this format. This romantic love story is as well written as any of her mystery books and a welcomed change from that genre, although she tells her readers in a note at the front of the e-book that she wrote this story before she began writing mysteries. The characters are well developed and delightfully diverse. The story line is gripping and has a nice surprise ending. I especially liked her treatment of two social issues in the book. I don't want to spoil it by telling you what they are, but she handled the situations with accuracy and sensitivity. As is the case in all of the Sandra Brown novels that I've read so far, the sex scenes are written with both passion and grace.

Excellent."},{"Title":"Battle of Crecy, 1346","review":"The Battle of Crecy, 1346 follows in a gathering library of recent scholarly examination of the Hundred Years War. It is a literature that questions our assumptions about battle in the middle ages, and particularly this momentous conflict between England and France.This is a collection of essays, scholarly and at times difficult for the casual history reader to scale. However it so questions our previous understanding of this battle, frequently identified as one of the most decisive in history, that is a must read for those interested in a true understanding of Crecy.The authors question three important assumptions we've come to accept about the battle.1. Edward III avoided battle with the Philip's superior French army and was forced to fight. Our essayists insist that this was a battle Edward sought, and it was his intention to bring on a decisive action with the French.2. Crecy was the place Edward was brought to bay, and in a remarkable eye for terrain chose a perfectly sited battlefield. The authors assert that Edward knew the region of Ponthieu well, and likely had the site of the battlefield in mind as he drew the pursuing French after him.3. Most intriguing to me is a new look at the battlefield. Prior historians of Crecy have presumed that the French ordered their attacks from the eastern slope and across the length of the Vallee de Clercs into the face of archers and men at arms on the western slope. Sir Philip Preston's essay claims that this was impossible due to the steep slope on the eastern side of the valley. It was much more likely that the French army entered through the narrow, but accessible southern neck of the valley and were annihilated in a narrow killing zone.There is considerable additional information about the campaign, organization of the English army and other useful topics. It is an excellent book that suffers only from the lack of a couple of detailed maps. A detailed map of the battlefield today, and a second map projecting the authors' views on the position of English forces would have been very helpful."},{"Title":"Battle of Crecy, 1346","review":"In August 1346 the French royal army was defeated by an expeditionary force from England: an event which marked the turning point in the English king's struggle with his French adversary and lent the English army a reputation as the best fighters in Europe. Military history fans will relish THE BATTLE OF CRECY, 1346: it explains the politics on both sides, the meaning of the battle to both sides, and how the English achieved victory. It reviews and re-interprets the battle and provides the latest scholarly research on the era. While a specialty item, THE BATTLE OF CRECY 1346 is a highly recommended acquisition for any in-depth, definitive military history collection."},{"Title":"Battle of Crecy, 1346","review":"This is truly a definitive book on the subject of the early portion of the Hundred Years War."},{"Title":"Battle of Crecy, 1346","review":"So why is the battle of Crecy, a one day battle that happened in 1346, so interesting today? Well I conjecture that it is not so much that its just that longbows are better than crossbows or that the English got the upper hand in a seemingly hopeless situation but that a mix of revolutionary technology a little inginuity and a lot of luck drives at something deeper within us. But the battle itself was brilliantly documented by the chronicler Jean Froissart and his account provides not only a great account of a very successfully executed battle on the part of the English but an excellent account of how war was fought in the high middle ages. This book explores this and really brings the battle to life by setting up the situation in a tactical matter and attempting to understand the mechanics of the battle.While the english did have the high ground in open but jagged ground they also forced the French through an approach that made them an easier target. Any tactitian understand the importance of funnelling your enemy. This was enacted beautifully. Then comes the archers - The Genoese fighting fo the french with their beatifully crafted crossbows were matched against the english longbowmen. While the longbow was simpler it certainly still required expert craftsmanship. The range on the longbow was superior and the the speed was too. But research shows in this book that the Genoese Crossbowman werent totally useless as a fighting force. But they forgot their sheilds and after retreating got hacked to bits not by the english but by the French.This is a work of history that is probably not for the causal reader but by the student of history or military science. The book sheds new light on a well known battle and really is interesting as it dissects the chronicles brings in applied science aspects of terrain and tries to answer what really went on in 1346.Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Building the Maine Guide Canoe","review":"I read the book because I wanted to know how wood and canvas canoes are made.

The drawings are complicated and require a bit of forehand knowledge. Fantastic book for anyone interested in building their own canoe."},{"Title":"Building the Maine Guide Canoe","review":"Great Book for those who love the classic wooden canoes.

It is very informative and written at a child's level; I am quite pleased with that aspect of the book. The one problem I have with it is that it repeats the legend that everyone thought the earth was flat up until 500 years ago, when Columbus and Magellan finally proved otherwise (see pp. 6-11). Though we probably all heard that one while growing up (I certainly did) it has been debunked (see the book _Inventing the Flat Earth_). The ancient Greeks first figured out that the earth was round when they noted that it casts a round shadow on the moon during an eclipse and that ships seem to move downward as they disappear over the horizon. By Columbus' time all learned people actually knew the earth was round; they only disputed his theory that traveling west rather than east would prove to be a \\"shortcut\\" to the Indies.Anyway, I just wanted to warn parents about that bit of misinformation since none of the other reviewers mention it. It's actually understandable since the book is copyright 1985; AFAIK the research debunking the \\"Everyone was a flat earther until five centuries ago\\" notion was done after that. Still, there's a lot of good information about maps otherwise so you may still wish to use the book and just explain the error or skip over those pages."},{"Title":"Maps and Globes","review":"This was a great book to explain maps, where they came from, etc. It is for children 2nd grade and up, and can be rather detailed at times.

It is especially useful because it informs young readers that maps are not always accurate. The historic discussion helps to bring students to the present in terms of how maps, in general, evolved. Comparison of globes and flat maps is very instructive. I would havesaid more about the utility of Mercator and similar maps (especially rhumb lines, shortest distances), but the Greenland/South America discussion is on target. I would have included another map -- the Western and Eastern Hemisphere and related cartographic data to Old and New World -- it introduces what young students will learn in later classes. Measurement on maps is effectively dealt with, but it is important to distinguishthe 'naturalness' of the Equator from the 'arbitrariness' of the Prime Meridian. Nice coverage of South America, but it might be more useful to put the pair of maps opposite each other. Authors should avoid referring to the land area as 'dry' land. It could be confusing.

The title is a German word for ski-racer and the story takes place at a remote ski resort in the Austrian Alps. The racing champion is a young man named Dieter Schnell (\\"fast\\" in German)and his parents own a ski-pension outside a small village. In the middle of winter, while Dieter practices for the world championship in downhill skiing, his parents have four guests. Baldur is a young north German architecture and design student. His wife, Freia (real name Ada Levin) is a Jewish-American girl from the edge of Beverly Hills. Stanley M is an old college friend of Freia's, who shows up in the same place entirely by accident. Herr von S is a former Nazi officer, also from northern Germany. Everyone has an attraction to Dieter. It should be noted that the book takes place in the period 1963-1965, so that prominent Nazis are still alive and young people such as Baldur would have spent their early years in the Hitler Youth. The war is much closer than it would seem to people today. The interaction of the characters is laced with delicious irony, and no one is who he or she seems to be. Freia is trying so hard to be more German than the Germans, except when it gets difficult. Baldur at first seems kind, loving and a bit dense, until his past is reawakened by some childhood friends. Stanley M doesn't speak German and is truely clueless as to the game he plays along with, to his peril. Herr von S is so diabolically clever, he outsmarts himself. The story builds against an impressive backdrop. A tragedy occurs, and people start to reveal themselves, building up to an ending of truly horrifying possibilities. Nina Galen is a brilliant writer, and I highly recommend this book. Although she uses German words at various places, I can tell you that she translates for English readers, and the usage is correct. Hopefully the book will be reprinted."},{"Title":"The reign of grace: From its rise to its consummation","review":"This is not a review of the content but of the Kindle format.

Kumin faces the truth that soon there will be a reckoning with the Grim Reaper. So begins the revelatory poetry of a woman dissecting her life, the recollections and reminders that spring to mind in the autumn years. In Magda of Hospice House:\\"I love my work as a specialist in easement.Death is the thing I know, its catch and gurgle.\\"Those of a certain generation are blessed with such reminiscences, be it yesterday or sixty years ago, each as fresh as the new morning. Perhaps this is the reward of old age, as visions spring complete from the mind, the passing years insignificant. But it is these memories that so endear Kumin's poetry, her incisive observations, without the taint of revision. In The Snarl, the poet reveals a bitter memory:\\"...one of the clique that had snubbed me down to the boneso that I ate my dry sandwich daily in a stallin the john after Latin class\\"The New England poet plants her feet squarely on the ground, knows her neighbor's names, takes nothing for granted and grapples daily with the disintegration of ageing bones. She gives no quarter and exposes her own foolish pretensions, bolstered by memories of old yearnings and bittersweet recollections. In sturdy Yankee phrases, Kumin writes of animals, dogs and horses as familiar as lifelong friends, their losses just as deeply mourned. In the title poem, Jack, Kumin writes of a long lost horse:\\"Oh Jack, tethered in what rough stall alonedid you remember that one good winter?\\"The endless cycle of death and the nature of ritual are familiar topics on a New England farm and Kumin lives each moment of this world, on intimate terms with its comings and goings. The subtle strength of these poems reaffirm Kumin's tenacity and appreciation for the living beings that surround her, their spirits as beloved as friends and family. Certainly, the world intrudes, but not with such great import as to erode the precious rhythms of farm life: \\"Let them slip through my hands/ weightless as the wind and fugitive as a dream\\" (Crossing Over).

I am giving a copy to my 14 year old grandson to introduce him to the fascinating world of programming. He lives 500 km away from me, so he will largely be on his own. I do not expect this to be a problem because the book is perfect for self study.I want my grandson to learn the essence of computing without spending time on things that he will have to unlearn later or that prove to be blind alleys on his road to computer proficiency . This book is ideal for this purpose. It will let him experience the basic notions of computing in carefully graded steps. Each step tells him how to do fun experiments in the provided environment where he directs a robot/turtle to draw interesting patterns on the screen. The 22 steps take him from a simple sequence of commands to the creation of elaborate simulations; ending at the point where my grandson should start creating his own classes and subclasses.The experiments are all done in Squeak, a dialect of Smalltalk. It could be argued that my grandson had better learn Java or some other mainstream language. I believe Smalltalk is a better choice because it is simpler, cleaner, and more immediate. The basic concepts are universal and my grandson can easily switch to some other language after he has mastered the fundamentals.The book is written in a fluent, idiomatic English. It is written in the first person; the writer speaks directly to the reader. This writing style combined with the examples being concrete makes for the smooth communication of what are really abstract ideas.Anybody wanting to understand more than e-mail and text processing could not do better than to install the free robotic environment on their computer and work through the book&#8217;s text and examples."},{"Title":"Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots (Technology in Action)","review":"This book actually teaches computer programming, rather than teaching a computer programming language. It has to use something, and Smalltalk (Squeak) is gentle enough that it doesn't get in the way of the topic.St&eacute;phane Ducasse, a prolific writer about object-oriented programming, says in his preface: \\"The material for this book was originally developed by my wife, who is a physics and mathematics teacher in a French school where the students are between eleven and fifteen years old\\". Indeed, the pains taken to make object-oriented programming understandable to someone with no background are quite apparent, and they certainly pay off. The author has more than met his goal \\"to teach you object-oriented programming, because this paradigm provides an excellent metaphor for teaching programming\\".Instead of teaching Smalltalk, the computer language he uses, he's actually teaching programming. Smalltalk, originally designed as a teaching language, has minimal syntatic issues and it very simple once the student knows a few basic rules. The reader of this book doesn't have to know much to start working though, since the author distributes a working Squeak environment that's ready to use. He's already provided a \\"Bot factory\\" and a working (virtual) robot to which the reader can send commands, much like the LOGO language and its turtle. Without getting caught in the details of object or class design, the readers start out simply by interacting with objects and sending them messages to control their behavior.As the reader learns more about what the robot knows how to do, the author devises trickier problems for the reader to solve. These usually involve causing the robot to move in such a way as to draw out a pattern. In doing so, the reader is actually writing programs that control the robots behavior to accomplish the goal. Although the language is really SmallTalk, the author effectively hides most of that through the use of the robot's little language.The Squeak environment the author distributes is easy to use for anyone with a basic idea of computers (i.e. mouse and keyboard, click here, and so on). It's easy to install because you only need to download it and click on the file. From there, you see the Squeak environment and a ready-to-use robot. Move the mouse near the robot and a speech bubble with a blinking cursor appears. Type a command and the robot responds. Easy peasy.If you are already a computer programmer, or have some experience with computer programming and want to learn Smalltalk, this book is probably too basic for you. However, if you go to the authors web page (Amazon tends to edit links from reviews, so google the author's name) you'll find links to many free Smalltalk books that you can download as PDFs."},{"Title":"Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots (Technology in Action)","review":"The use of an Integrated Development Environment [IDE] for a user to learn a language in, and to then program within, is well known. Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE.The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span.Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.I wonder a little about the book itself, though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it."},{"Title":"Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots (Technology in Action)","review":"This book uses Smalltalk to teach the basics of object oriented programming on Mac or PC. Before getting my hands on this book I have to say I was having trouble grasping the basics.I personally bought the book as I want to learn Smalltalk. For some reason the \\"with Robots\\" in the title had me skip over this book for almost a year. Most, if not all the other Smalltalk books I got, although great, usually assume differing levels of pre-existing programming knowledge and experience and approach the teaching of Smalltalk skimming over the stuff that is a required foundation to *understand* it. Stephane Ducasse does an excellent job of explaining that missing foundational stuff. And he does it without getting too deep into Smalltalk or Squeak itself.As others have pointed out this book is not really focussed on teaching Smalltalk - Smalltalk is the tool used to teach basic O-O programming. However, he's done an excellent job of doing both!!!Having finished this book I'm writing basic programs - and finally understanding better the programs of others."},{"Title":"Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots (Technology in Action)","review":"I've used this book and the BotsInc environment to show my 12-yr old daughter how much fun writing software can be and it's been a wild success!In fact, it all fits together so well that I'm planning to use it as the basis of an introductory series of classes on software writing as craftwork, to be offered through a local craft organization.Help train the next generation of software writers!

The term 'social engineering' makes me uncomfortable. I do not believe in the concept of Utopia. There is no One Right Way to live, no solution that will bring about the End of History. Humans are what they are, and the sooner we quit trying to mold people into what we think they should be and accept that fact, the happier we will all be.So why do I rate Walden Two highly? Because of it's pragmatism.The basic approach put forth in the book is simply to do what works. Experiment. Try something. If it works, keep it. If it doesn't, discard it and try something new. This approach seems obvious, but in fact it's pretty rare in our daily lives. Instead we are ruled by dogmatism: we do things because that is the 'right' way to do it, no matter how poor the outcome.This pragmatic approach, and the examples used to illustrate it, hint at methodologies currently being used with much success. Two that interest me the most are NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) and Permaculture."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Approximately 20 years after I first read this amazing book as port of my college assigned reading, I have felt ready, yet again, to read this little masterpiece about an alternative to our way-of-life. My idealism of old has been replaced by experience and maturity, at least in some areas of my life and thinking, and Skinner's work has lost nothing of its thoughtful freshness, radical mindset, and yet virgorous with its underlying logic and simple conviction. I can highly recommend this book for anybody who feels that they have an open mind and can consider an idea for what it is, and not crash with that idea because of their intellectual, moral or social convictions. This is a book to make you think... maybe even more than that, but just that impulse to constructively think about your own existence and society and your role within that society is enough benefit from any work of literature, and there's plenty of these qualities in Skinner's book.

Instead of boring readers with an extensive review of the research by himself or others, Skinner returns to his literary roots and provides a novel. This book provides a working knowledge of Skinnerian psychology and should be on the book list in psychology classes that deal with Skinner's theories. Beyond academia, this book provides an interesting dialogue concerning science's role in society. The novel is fairly easy to read and moves along well. However, this is not a book to read solely for entertainment -- it does not move quite that quickly! As Skinner intended, this book is a conversation piece."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Walden Two has given me a significant hope that this world can actually be bettered in every way.First, we'd work MUCH LESS. So many of us today don't work efficiently at all. Even for some of those that do, they might be working for nothing. For example, while brokers and technicians in Wall Street work their butt off almost every day, simply a sound monetary system, that restricts such fraudulent groups like Wall Street investment firms, can set millions of people free from wasting so much unnecessary energy.A right money system under right people would disable wastful sectors and enable only the practical ones, that truely HELP people, instead of rubbing from them.With more free time off from work, we could ENJOY our lives more. What's your favorite thing to do? We'll have more time to do it. And what's even more exciting is that we'll be BETTER at doing them, because the education system allows us to seek and focus on our own interests.When I was 14, I desperately wanted to learn to play drums. But unfortunately my parents had prejudice against joining a band, assuming it would ruin my youth. Thinking back, not learning rather seems to have wasted my passionate youth. A sound educational system, that prevents prejudiced thinking and encourages listening to liberal ideas, would make so many of our lives affluent, affluent with expertise in personal interests, satisfaction, and joy.Under this educational system, my parents wouldn't have had such bias against learning drums, and I would have been a fine drummer.. or maybe even a fine musician.Alike, a right system under the right people will defeat the wrongs and frauds, and breed opportunities and fruits.However, there's ONE thing that I disagree with Mr Skinner. I do not believe that a true utopia has a monetary system, since advanced technology would require no moeny or more than available resources to produce whatever that the whole mankind desires. So much inhumane issues like starvation, curable diseases, homelessness would no longer exist but only in history. No one will be left out, ignored off, from the society. And the society should be us, the whole hamanity, not just a group of people fenced in a castle.And that is the true Utopia I believe in.Despite so, Skinner gave me the inspiration, and it is fantastic.Highly recommend for everyone."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"The book \\"Walden Two\\" by B.F.Skinner is excellent. It is written in a story form so most of us will not get lost with the psychology jargon, and the story is very interesting and moves right along.For those of you not familiar with his work Skinner explains what behavioral engineering is and his main charcter uses this as his platfrom for a utopic society. I liked many things about Waldon Two how the residents created a more scientifically efficent community and I thought th behavioral engineering of the children in the community was billiant. I also really enjoyed the idea of the four hour work day and how it promotes a more creative group of people. Naturally this type of work week would enable its residents to become much more creative and spend more time with the arts. I didn't enjoy every part of Walden Two I felt the economic structure was very similar to communism. I understand how it relates to how the society is to succeed. Overall the book is very enjoyable and it was very helpful in learning more about behavioral engineering I would reccomend it and its not a very long read either its about 280 pages."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"I am amazed that people are criticizing this book because of behaviorism's obsolescence. Maybe Walden Two was presented differently to other people, but I initially read this book as class assignment for Psych 101 at Harvard. Professor Fernald described Skinner's WT as an interesting attempt to apply the principles of behaviorism to a society/community. I doubt even Skinner thought his novel accurately outlined the exact methods by which civilization should operate.It's not an instruction manual for humanity; it's an exploration of certain models present in most communities. Many of these models still exist in our 21st-century culture. For example, children are still raised to compete with everyone else, through sports and the ubiquitous honor societies. We laud the winners and humiliate the losers. This undoubtedly enhances the inherent duality of the human mind; it exacerbates the (harmful IMO) mode of looking at the world with the &quot;us - them&quot; or &quot;me - everyone else&quot; perspective.In WT, Skinner presents another way of raising children to allay this competitive, often merciless instinct. Is Skinner's answer the correct solution? One can only assume it isn't, but his solution does make the reader think about these societal patterns that are so often just accepted with no forethought or even conscious choice.I know people who have/make time in their lives to question the very foundations of our civilization. I let my own life be too hectic; I often just fall into patterns of behavior. However, I do often spend nights reading, and when I randomly pick up Walden Two once every few years, Skinner reminds me that all of the flaws in our society are not absolute rules of human behavior. There other ways to live, and Skinner presents some of his opinions on what those other ways might be.My own opinion is the Frazier's community in WT is not scalable, not even slightly, but I still greatly enjoy Skinner's exploration of civilization."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"I will not dupe you into thinking that B.F. Skinner is a master novelist, and that is the only reason I docked B.F. one star. However there are so many interesting ideas in here that you really need to read it if you would like a book that is enjoyable, but also leaves you with something to think about for months after you've read it. Whether you agree or not, you should read it!"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Experiment. Vary conditions. Collect and share results. Raise concerns. Avoid arguments over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.These are the ways of a scientist and ways that Skinner suggested we all consider using.Somehow this guy who worked with rats had other interests and other ways of sharing his concerns. \\"Walden Two\\" is one of them.It's not \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" but, compared to what I could do, it's awfully well written. It's not the final answer on how folks should live together or even that much of a start - but it is a start and an invitation to all of us to consider how we can improve our conditions.Even in \\"Beyond Freedomn And Dignity\\", Skinner didn't have many answers as to how culture could be designed for the better. But he did have the realization that we ought have to start somewhere. He also had worked on a technology that he expected others would improve on that might help us live more sensibly.\\"Walden Two\\" provides an intimate glimpse into Skinner's world. I may not want to live there, at least for long, but I respect Skinner's efforts to make me think about what I can do to improve my living conditions.Behaviorism may be limited but it can be effective, more than arguing over angels on pins. Small visible steps may be the best steps; small acquisitions of tested knowledge may lead farther than pompous rants or deep meditations.Reading \\"Walden Two\\" is a good small step. A good step after that would be to learn about Los Horcones, a remarkable community in Mexico that, like Walden Two, applies behavioral science to design its culture. Los Horcones calls itself a Walden Two community, not because it imitates what's in the novel but because it also applies Radical Behaviorism. Skinner never intended that Walden Two remain just a book."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"The concept of the book is interesting but it is too slow.

Burris remembers that Frazier was a classmate of his in graduate school, one with radical ideas. He sends a letter to Frazier and immediately gets a reply inviting him to visit the community. Burris agrees to take time off from his academic duties to accompany Rogers and Steve on a visit to &quot;Walden Two,&quot; Frazier's community. Rodge's girlfriend Barbara, Steve's girlfriend Mary, and Burris' Colleague Castle, also come. The population of Walden Two is about one thousand people, all of whom seem to be healthy and happy. They live in dwellings, eat in common dining spaces, raise their children in a nursery, and grow and build much of what they need. The standard workday lasts only four hours, or less; no one is paid wages--but nothing at Walden Two costs money. Each of the visitors responds to the community differently. Castle finds it challenging he spends the duration of the visit arguing with Frazier about such a community like Walden Two. Burris, on the other hand, finds himself somewhere in the middle: he is skeptical that such a community could work, but he finds Frazier's arguments compelling and he cannot forget the evidence of success in front of him. Steve and Mary are both convinced that this is the life for them; they decide to stay at Walden Two. Rodge, too, is convinced, but Barbara is not; he leaves Walden Two with her at the end of their visit. Burris decides to return to his academic life. However, at the train station he suddenly realizes that he would rather try life at Walden Two, for whatever it's worth, than go back to the university. He walks back to Walden Two and begins his new life there along with the rest of the group."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Before we talk about the book, Walden 2, you need to know something about B.F. Skinner. He was a behavioral psychologist and behavior psychologists like to be able to predict and to control human activity. He believed in his theories so much that when he brought home his 2nd daughter from the hospital he placed her in an controlled environment much like the one in the book. His daughter lived there for 2 1/2 years. Skinner became famous for his work with rats using his \\"Skinner Box\\". The Skinner Box was an apparatus which allows an experimenter to observe, manipulate, measure and record animals behaviors. Skinner also insisted that their environments, the environments which humans themselves built, controlled humans. Skinner's main aim in analyzing behavior was to find out the relationship between behavior and the environment, the interactions between the two. Walden 2 is a book about how he imagined the application of is theories would work out in real life.Walden 2 is a very good book but is arguably the worst story ever. Besides being amateurish, it's downright silly. But luckily the story is not a big part of the book. infact, Walden 2 transcends its mediocre story by being so provocative. Through the course of Walden 2, so many interesting ideas are brought up. It took me forever to finish the book because every couple of pages, I'd have to stop and think about whatever I was reading. This book brings up many extreme alternatives to modern life that are for the most part, surprisingly logical. Between child rearing and distribution of labor, you will have your jaw open. He talks about having the youth produce children and then putting the children through a system involving not moving out of the crib until a baby turns one and not putting on clothes till the age of three. This may seem like a very stupid idea and that's the reaction that you should have but there are many benefits to it. Clothes can be uncomfortable and temperature sun exposure isn't problem because they don't go outside. It also decides how much a job pays based on the demand for that job. A job like sniffing flowers would not be high paying because everyone wants that job. Some may say well isn't that how capitalism works but its not even close. We know this isn't true because actors are getting paid much more then farmers. Everyone wants to be an actor and yet it still has a large paycheck, I rest my case. This book is so progressive and so ahead of it's time. It brings up many ideas that no one else has and B. F. Skinner did it in 1948. On the contrary, the concepts B. F. Skinner presents are flawed. The whole book requires that our nature is very, very malleable. Whether or not that is true is debatable. One of the flaws of the book is that the reader isn't the one who gets to question Frazier (the guy running Walden 2). B. F. Skinner gets to question Frazier and that makes the whole book very biased. If the guy who feels a certain way writes a book proving his point and the book happens to be fiction, then there is a very high chance that the person is wrong and needs to make a fake bias story to prove his point. But like I said earlier, lots of good ideas too. Either way I enjoyed the book and I would advise any person interested in philosophy, different forms of society, or just progressive ideas, to read this book.The book also comes with an interesting preface written by Skinner many years after he wrote Walden 2. He talks about how common society is horrible and how we should convert the world into a humongous Walden 2. Quite a stretch if I may say so myself. This is because he forgets to mention the thing that Karl Marx always talked about, the between stage. Marx talks about Socialism and the violent revolution and how to reach Communism, while Walden 2 is just supposed to happen. The book isn't intended to have the same purpose as the Communist Manifesto or anything of that sort. The book as a whole shouldn't be looked upon as a good idea for a society; it should be viewed as a group of different ideas about different things that can be placed relevantly into our modern society."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"First off, I'm not a Skinner basher. I work with an intellectually disabled population and I will be the first person to tell you that his methods work - extremely well for some folks and I use them. That said, I was incredibly disappointed by this book, even though it had some extremely interesting flashes of insight.Walden Two just isn't Skinner's best stuff. Skinner is a behavoral analyst, and a brilliant one, at that. He should have stuck with that. He's not very good at writing a novel - or reshaping society to his whims. The whole book comes across as a very forced attempt to shove an ideology into a novel, almost like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Characters are wooden and only serve to ask questions that leads to the commune leader to describe how much better Walden 2 is than the rest of the world. The only character of any distinction is the commune leader, and he comes across as having a god complex, which I doubt was intended.Skinner does have some really interesting philosophical points regarding the way we teach ethics to children (which is really fairly brilliant), social engineering, scheduling to maximize spatial resources, and spook notions, but I honestly would've preferred a different treatment. This thing is painful to read. Technically, the writing itself is fine, but Skinner just should never have written in the genre of the novel, he doesn't understand how to create conflict and action. As a novel, it's just atrocious.Regarding the work's philosophy, this book is basically an apologia for determinism (which makes an interesting companion piece to Sartre if you use excerpts), bashing Freudian Psychology (e.g. an incubated nursery apart from mothers for no practical socioeconomic reasons), and trying to change the world one token at a time.The economic system is insane, and is basically Fourier socialism, but with a managerial component. As previously mentioned, the concept of cultural engineering is extremely interesting (especially the dinner trays), but you have to wade through large portions of ridiculousness fairly typical of the utopian novel to get to it. Skinner wildly overextends himself.Part and parcel of Skinner's Utopia is the usual desire to eliminate conflict (which as readers of the book will note leads to boredeom) and all the standard utopic nonsense, which invades every one of these books since Moore's Utopia. To that, Skinner adds contempt for crowds (which he treats the same as individuals on p.35) something that seems kind of silly in a commune and goes against recent work in emergentism, existent work like LeBon and plain old common sense - people act differently in groups. To eliminate conflict and jealousy and ego is to eliminate human striving itself. It's horrifying. Skinner starts to come off like a mad scientist from a comic book.If you're interested in determinism or radical behaviorism applied broadly to society and have an open mind (and are able to stomach boredom) it's a fairly intriguing read to skim through with some truly awesome (and frightening) ideas, but I'd read something else by Skinner first.This book may also be useful for research in terms of social philosophy (vs. existentialists) and utopic fiction (taken with Moore, Neville, Bacon) but it's less useful as Psychology.If you're interested in using Radical Behaviorism in your classroom or residence setting, \\"Technology of Teaching\\" is, in my opinion, probably the greatest book ever written regarding managing a classroom and one of the all time greatest books in the history of Psychology. If you want to use Skinner's stuff in a classroom or a setting where you want to minimize negative behaviors, buy that. It's very practical. It's a much easier read than Walden Two, even though it's more technical because Skinner writes nonfiction well."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Like Copernicus, Galeleo and Darwin, Skinner was verbaly crucified for what he discovered. Those who dismiss this book are the flat earth theorists and religious dogmatic right.It was not Skinner's first choice to be a social scientist. He openly admitted that his discoveries were just that - Discoveries. At first most scientists have little idea of what thier discoveries mean. The lazer was first described as 'a solution looking for a problem' - its first imagined use to cut James Bond in half. Who would have dreamt that lazers would be used for delicate eye surgery to give people clear sight. In Walden II Skinner set about thinking what his discoveries could mean for individuals and societies.The two principle characters of Walden II are Frederick and Burrhus. These are Skinner's two christian names. Walden II is an arguement that Skinner had with himself. Both sides robustly stated, it reveals both the confidence and doubts that Skinner had about the meaning and value of his discoveries.Individuals and society always benefit from advances in science. The scientists who split the atom did not intend its use to be destructive and many campaigned against the atomic bomb. Skinner realised that the lottery is very effective way for governments to extract excessive tax from the poor. It must have been one of his worst nightmares that governments would do so. He must be turning in his grave at present British government's use of the lottery to pay for education. Skinner was a teacher and devoted part of his life to improving teaching.Walden II was never a 'blue-print for living'. Taken as such it is inevitable inadequate, as discovered by those who have tried to 'live the experiment'. Written in 1948, it is now dated. Regretably no-one has since updated it, maybe because the reality is that we all live in a token economy.Skinner's first career choice was to be a writer. He wasn't a very good one, but in Walden II he is surprisingly good for an academic. A radical thinker, it should be no surprise that Skinner should borrow the title of one of his literary heroes - Thoreau. Only a few have lived that utopia of the original Walden.The world is not flat, man evolved and real social science can help us improve life and society. Ignorance is a prison without bars. It was centuries before Galeleo showed that Copernicus was right. A century has passed since Darwin's death. Many still do not want to accept evoluiton and many of those who do simply do not understand it, despite calling themselves Darwinians. It will be some time before society understands behavioural science, its full benefits and just how great a scientist Skinner was."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Besides for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, the worst book I've ever read. Illogical, arrogant, proselytizing ramblings! I want my time and my money back."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Having no great fondness for B. F. to begin with, from the little I know of him and his work, I thought I'd give this a try just to see what the Grand Old Man of conditioned rats and pigeons had to say about Utopias. What kind of Utopia would be imagined by some guy who saw no essential behavioral difference (and presumably no other important difference) between rats and humans? As I had expected, I had a distinctly uneasy feeling about it well before finishing it-by about p. 60, in fact-but I couldn't clearly define or articulate it. So, like anyone looking for easy answers, I Googled the book, and the first citation on the page was \\"A critical review of B.F. Skinner's philosophy, with focus on _Walden Two_\\", by Edward Rozycki (1999, based on a 1995 article for the journal _Educational Studies_). And Rozycki made amply clear a few points which seem to have escaped all the raving enthusiasts of the book, such as:(1) Skinner was a lousy scientist, who explicitly rejected some of the fundamental tenets of the scientific method, such as considering all the observed data. In the book, Frazier says, \\"To go to all the trouble of running controls would be to make a fetish of scientific method.\\" Although Skinner kept telling everyone he was an empiricist and not a theorist, most of his work is basically theory based on what he chose to consider the world to be.(2) His \\"vision\\" is fundamentally totalitarian (Roz tactfully avoids the term \\"fascist,\\" but I would not be that polite). As Frazier says, \\"Each of us has interests which conflict with the interests of everybody else. ... Now, \`everybody else' we call \`society.' It's a powerful opponent and it always wins.\\" Substitute \\"State\\" for \\"society\\" and that's pretty clear totalitarianism.(3) The reason everybody in the community is so blissfully happy is that anyone who is not blissfully happy is made to feel unwelcome by the community and subtly cold-shouldered out. About anyone who is \\"incorrigible,\\" Frazier says that \\"it's more likely that he would long since have gone of his own accord.\\" As Rosycki dryly notes, \\"The point is not elaborated on.\\" I don't think it needs to be.So, given my impression that Skinner's starry-eyed Utopian vision of a \\"culturally engineered\\" bliss of humanoid pigeons is one of the most terrifying things I've read since the daily news, I fail to see why everyone seems to think it's so wonderful. I think it's a dreadful vision, just as dystopic, in its sinister way, as _Brave New World_. And it's a boring read to boot."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Rarely has a book evoked such rage in me as this one did. It's not that I completely disagreed with everything that Skinner said about a Utopian society. While there are a lot of things--mainly to do with raising children and marriage--that I don't agree with, some of it could probably be beneficial. But the way that Skinner set up the book was not the best way to prove his point.While Skinner is a notable psychologist, I can't say much about him as a writer. The characters were all annoying (the only one I didn't loathe was Castle, who was incredibly anti-Walden Two). Frazier, the founder of the community, seemed so manipulative and power-hungry that I was put off to the idea of anyone living there. I couldn't help but feel that if the people in the community had known how much Frazier was manipulating them, they would've wanted to leave. The ending, where Frazier blatantly stated that he was like God and that his community was acutally better than what God had created just put the icing on the cake--I would not want to live in a community created by this man.The book is poorly written and any statements that Skinner might have made about Utopian societies were eclipsed by my anger towards the characters and their offensive behavior."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"If you're a thinking person, read _Walden Two_. When I first picked it up, I expected a boring piece of behaviorist propaganda by a stuffy man in a lab coat. I was wrong. In the end, the book is about where humanity is vs. where we might like to be--and, most importantly, how to get there. Whatever you think of Skinner's answers, his book is worth reading for the questions alone. (Note--the criticism that _WT_ isn't much of a philosophic novel along the lines of _1984_ is correct; it much more reminds me of a Platonic dialogue. Not a bad thing, if you ask me.)"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"First of all, I agree with those readers who pointed out that this is not a great work of literature. There is no story and almost no character development, and it is much too long for its content. It is basically 300 pages of rambling monologues and debates about the virtues of behavioral engineering.Second, it is also not satisfying as a work of science or philosophy. There are a number of interesting ideas and some thoughtful debate, but little in the way of convincing arguments. For example, everyone at Walden II seems to be constantly in a state of blissful content. Please!Ultimately, creating a fictional utopia is not very impressive."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Walden Two is an excellent portrayal of a working utopian society contrasted with the relatively gloomy style of life as we know it. A Brave New World and 1984 portray attempted utopian societies which fail or appear to be failing, but Walden Two works, according to its author. All throughout this novel, readers wonder if they would really like to live in a society like this by weighing the costs and benefits. Written in more of a philosophical type of dialogue between the protaganists and the antagonists, the novel at first presents to be dull, but persistence proves to be worthwhile. This is a must read for any student or professor, as it is for anyone interested in the psychology or philosophy of the book. Try to make your decision to live in the society before the last few chapters and debate it with your friends! Good luck!"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"This is a masterpiece of writing fun. I read Walden Two every few years and always get some good laughs out of it because it is so up to date although it was written in 1948. Walden Two opened the door of behaviorism to me and began my journey studying behavioral science and becoming a master behavioral scientist and engineer.Behaviorism is the \\"Holy Grail\\" of psychology. Control is inevitable and you are controlled. You can learn to be a controller rather than a controllee and begin to enjoy the benefits of behavioral science. I started my career as a controller in 1965 while in junior high. I put my teachers under my control. It was so much fun to control \\"educated\\" adults and get the grades and behavior that I wanted from my adult controllees. I went into \\"higher\\" education and I took more and more control over the teachers. They were like putty in my hands. Wherever I went I was a controller. No Vietnam War for me because I had controller status. Only the controllees fight in wars. In love or business I was always in control. My controllees loved me like a dog loves its master. By using control I easily became financially independent and enjoy the highest standard of living. It's all because of brilliant teaching of the master of behaviorism, B.F. Skinner. Thank you Master Skinner for a lifetime of control."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"the book came in an acceptable condition, the description should have been a little more detailed as to how old this book really was but overall shipping was quick and the book was only 4$, so I cant complain"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"\\"Walden Two\\" serves, on its surface, as a work of escapist fiction. A party of B.F. Skinner's academic colleagues and their friends journey to a utopian community outside Canton, Ohio whose residents only work four hours per day and live in a resort community. Today's SF fans would quickly recognize the setting as a perpetual SF convention. They meet Skinner the Behaviorist, cleverly disguised as Frazier, and tour the community from tea service to Frazier's \\"throne\\". A Code created by experiment and the ministrations of psychologists from birth forward keep everybody happy and productive. For good measure, Skinner treats us to a superficial discussion of true liberty and freedom, which no work of speculative fiction aspiring above the pulps lacks.The novel also serves as a view of the anxieties of America as it demobilized from WWII. Would swinging from wartime Keynesian spending to paying off the debts incurred defending the nation cripple the economy just as millions of young men demobilized? Three variations of fascism lay defeated by Communism and liberal democracy: which of the two systems left standing was best? It was too early to know that a combination of government policy, piles of war bonds in every patriotic American's mattress and a near-monopoly of industry would raise most Americans to heights of prosperity they could not imagine in 1946. It was certainly too early to get a complete picture of Soviet oppression and Mao Zedong was still fighting in the countryside.Skinner ends with a surprise: his characters' trajectories are exactly what a model assuming pure materialism would predict. Steve and Mary, representatives of the prewar working class, choose life at Walden Two, which is arguably better in every material respect than what they expected given their lives before the war. Rodge and Barbara choose the upper middle-class life of a new lawyer. Rodge chooses the outside more relucantly than Barbara to be sure, but the end of the book does not find him in Walden Two looking for a new fiancee. Castle and Burris live in the Faculty Club, which means the decent bachelor housing of the era: one or two comfortable rooms, with all of the necessities and some of the luxuries met. Universities offer cultural amenities comparable to Walden Two as well. So, in material and cultural terms, Walden Two is equivalent to the Faculty Club, which lets each professor's disposition choose his destiny.As a fanfic, I've wanted to offer yearly installments of Steve, Mary and Burris' life in Walden Two. Would Walden Two's studio apartments pale next to a Levittown's luxurious 700 square-foot houses, or would it take the split-level ranch that a factory worker of the 1960s could afford? Would the advent of television kill the community's endless round of live performances and barn dances? Would the cultural contributions of Steve Jamnik's Eastern European heritage be encouraged or discouraged, and would his (likely) Catholic faith survive? How would the first black couple entering Walden Two experience it, and some of their fellow communards emigrating from a fundamentally racist society? America's thermidor of the early 1950s awaited; would Walden Two survive Joe McCarthy?"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"The product was not what I expected, the cover wasn't even the cover that was shown in the picture.

While someone who is just looking for a entertaining story may be disappointed or even call this book boring, I'm pretty sure that you'll like it if you have some serious interest in Behaviorism or behavioral engineering. Even if I have a master in cognitive sciences, I didn't find Skinner's ideas *really* \\"incompatible\\" with what I know, even if much of it probably remains to be proven, but the only way to prove it would be to set up such a community. Some other reviews call it a communist model, but the book actually includes chapters pointing out the differences between fascist and communist models, and Skinner's analysis shows, some 40 years before the Berlin wall collapses why the Soviet Union wouldn't survive.I wouldn't call this book \\"unscientific\\" or \\"outdated\\" as some other reviewers did. True, I would enjoy some footnotes to connect Skinner's ideas from this book to the rest of his writing and I'm wondering what would happen if we \\"upgraded\\" this book to take place in the modern internet society and taking into account all new things cognitive sciences and emotional intelligence have brought us over the 50+ years since this book has been written.

Is this better living through operant conditioning?This fictional community is the brain-child of the famous (and imfamous) behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner. Skinner believed that all behavior can be controlled by modification and 'positive reinforcement.' Well, here it is. A Skinnerian utopia.The book itself has no real plot to speak of. The central characters,a group of 2 university professors, 2 twenty-somethings fresh from army service, and their two girlfriends that have been invited to take a tour of the Walden Two community. The book (narrated by one of the professors) is the fictional account of the tour which gets extraordinarily specific. The communes education, commerce, child-rearing, and governing practices are well-examined and this book, whether you agree with good ol' B.F. or not, will have you constantly thinking from new angles. If you're anything like me (frightening thought!) you might find yourself actually talking back to the book. What a rare experience!The four stars are for both the writing- Skinner does much better than most psychologists crossing over to fiction- and for the wealth of ideas which are sharp, challenging and scary.

Further, Aldus Huxley, author of \\"Brave New World\\", was so impressed with the ideas presented in \\"Walden Two\\", that he incorporated and expanded on them in his last novel, \\"Island\\". And many people feel this was his best work. I concur.The book is not a monument to fine novel writing and was not intended to be, yet it is fascinating and eye-opening as a fictional dissertation on utopian social structure can be. Huxley's \\"Island\\", on the other hand was beautifully written and requires no awareness of the psychology of social construction going on at the same time- neither book does, really. They are both interesting and thought provoking.Skinner's basic premise was that with gentle behavioral modifications using positive re-enforcement and academics, coupled with leveling the social playing field with no class structure our hyper-competitive, private enterprise, we could then concentrate all of our energies on education and entertainment, thereby removing most all of the ills and stress that conventional society suffers from- sounds enticing, on paper anyway.B.F. Skinner was a famous research psychologist who had a life-time of noted insights into the human psyche and his constant experimentation with behavioral studies led him to map-out, in a fictional utopian setting, a demonstration of what the supposed benefits of behavioral modification would do for a large group of people. He was not trying to be a novelist, rather he was submitting to a broader audience than his peers, a theoretic utopian society that the general public could assess on their own and no doubt, Skinner was probably keen to see how the public would respond- further studies of human response to mechanisms- his favorite occupation.His very clinical approach to human behavioral studies was often criticized, but he was always quick to point out that he had no interest in debate on his methods. The following two paragraphs are borrowed from Skinner's bio seen at the Muskingum College, New Concord, Ohio website Skinner pages. Material was compiled by Christa Swenson, 1999.\\"Skinner was never highly influenced by critical reactions, he is not interested in the right or wrong because they are either effective or ineffective, and arguments of no avail. For that reason he is not interested in psychological theories, rational equations, or other verbal systems that are required to be proven right.\\"- whoa. And:[Following the principles of Bacon, Skinner rejects verbal authority, stating, \\"I have studied nature not books asking questions of the organism rather than those who have studied the organism.\\"... \\"Observation overemphasizes stimuli; experimentation includes the rest of the contingencies which generate repertoires\\" (Dews, 1970, p18).]It is interesting to note about his life that he is mainly remembered for such famous/infamous experiments as his \\"Skinner Box\\"- a replica of the famous Russian psychologist, Ivan Pavlov and his \\"Pavlov's Dog\\" positive response contraption. To say the least, he was highly impressed with Pavlov's work, but instead of dogs, he preferred rats and humans for study subjects and behavior reaction, not dog saliva studies (however interesting that might be).So I would imagine that if Skinner were alive today, he would get a kick out of the reviews here that are somewhat unflattering and he would have no problem brushing them off as he would also see fit to do with the flattering ones.His Walden Two book was influenced by the writing of Henry David Thoreau's \\"Walden\\" (Note the borrowed title) and many other similar writers. No wonder then, that he was keen to let that influence mellow his somewhat starchy, clinical outlook when he wrote it. And we are thankful for that- it made for a much more human and pleasing read.Understandably, it does not please many that his story characters had embraced such social quirks as seeing no benefit in saying \\"thank you\\" and many other social graces- this is Skinner's personality coming through: social graces are a waste time. Level-headed, nothing-to-hide, and non-competitive people supposedly don\`t need that nonsense.Did Skinner miss something in the demonstrated efficacy of social courtesy? No matter, he lets many of his characters have their conventional, \\"good\\" social habits- he has to, to show contrast.The communal setting the book describes is egalitarian, fair and desires no material gain other than normal sustenance. Labor needs are divvied-up at the start of each day and earn the communards \\"work credits\\" to ensure that they work a minimal amount for their keep. Over-work is discouraged and considered counter-productive, education and entertainment are much more important and with a large labor pool, daily chores can be completed quickly.New incoming members must agree to the communities social dictates: \\"The Walden Code\\" , a set of easy rules of conduct for harmony in the communal setting. Administrative members called \\"Planners\\" have a bit more leeway and can over-ride the rules when dealing with the outside world. All social positions are on a rotating basis including work, to facilitate an even distribution of duties so everyone can gain experience of the total spectrum of communal life.So what became of the communities that formed on Skinner's ideas? Many of them are still going and the most renown one modeled completely around Walden Two, \\"Twin Oaks Community\\", is still at it. Kathleen \\"Kat\\" Kinkade, one of the founding members, wrote a book about the \\"real\\" experimental commune, \\"A Walden Two Experiment\\"- Foreword by Skinner himself.This assessment of the project was written about two years into the project and then followed by another report, \\"Is It Utopia Yet?: An Insider's View of Twin Oaks Community In Its 26th Year\\". Kat Kinkade is now the longest standing member and although she left the community for some time and then returned, she has a substantial history and intimate view of the project. Her assessments are an open, frank and honest look at intentional, communal living with all of it's inherrant ups and downs and is a fascinating follow-up to Skinner's Walden Two."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Walden Two is a work of fiction that gives us an outline for a modern utopia. In the book, six people - two college professors, a former student and his friend from the army, and the girlfriends of the two young men - visited a commune out in the country. The commune had been created by an old school mate of one of the two professors. When Professor Burris received a visit from his former student, Rogers, and Rogers' friend Jamnik, about T. E. Frazier, who had set out to create a modern utopia, Burris discovered that his old friend Frazier had indeed succeeded at creating his utopia. But even more interesting was that when Burris sent a letter to Frazier, a return letter invited Burris and some friends to visit and see Frazier's utopia, Walden Two. Rogers and Jamnik were delighted to accompany him and brought their girlfriends along. Burris also brought along another professor, Castle, who was intrigued by the creation of a utopia, a feat he had believed impossible. Together, the six traveled into the countryside to find the utopia of which Frazier had boasted.The visitors found that the members of the utopia worked short days, on average four-hour work days, had a great appreciation for art and science, used a hybrid economic system combining Marxism and capitalism that worked for the benefit of all members, and enjoyed happiness all the time. Frazier had thought the entire utopia through, and did many things very differently than the rest of the United States of America, from the communal raising of children, to new systems of education, and even to new ways of raising farm animals. He even used new ways of carrying food from the food lines of the communal mess halls to nooks in the \\"Ladder,\\" a long stairway that doubled as a communal gathering place. Frazier had created an efficient utopia in a corrupt world. Though they see it before their eyes, some of them don't believe it, and they try to look for problems in the system. Professor Castle is always on Frazier's heels, trying to find contradictions in the system and failures to achieve true fairness and equality; he even accuses Frazier of being the despotic dictator of Walden Two. But Frazier is always ready for any attack with a defense, and even an attack of his own at times. From the \\"Ladder\\" to the \\"Walk\\", Frazier's Walden Two Utopia was truly something to be admired.And how had he managed it? He had used a science called \\"Behavioral Engineering\\". In this system, adults signed contracts to abide by the rules of Walden Two and reinforced one another's behavior through their common acceptance of these rules. Children were raised to absorb and live by the values of this modern utopia, including the values of sharing, working their fair share for the benefit of the whole community, and maintaining impartiality. The adults used positive reinforcement to encourage appropriate behavior by the children. It seemed like a viable system, but I think an all too well known cynical writer, George Orwell, would have a field day with how this might go wrong if even one person failed to absorb the communal values and found a way to use the system for his own personal gain.Despite how good this community sounds, we must remember that this is a work of fiction. Though creating a \\"Walden Two\\" type of community could be a good start towards forming a fair society, I am not convinced that this model could work in a large society. In the small community, where everyone knows each other and trusts each other, there is a sense of loyalty that keeps the members subscribing to the ideals of the fair society. In a large society, nobody knows everyone and therefore cannot trust everyone, and this undermines trust in the system itself.Walden Two is worth reading if you're trying to find a way to create a modern utopia. But, if you are going to read this book, I also suggest reading \\"The Case Against B. F. Skinner\\", by Noam Chomsky. The essay discusses why Skinner is wrong about the malleability of human nature, and why this society would fail to attract enough members to be viable. Walden Two and \\"The Case Against B.F. Skinner\\" are very \\"hard reads,\\" and take a lot of time to fully understand the points that are being made. Take a month or two so you can read it slowly and understand the concepts that are being presented. If you do not understand anything, that is okay. The ideas are pretty hard to understand. I recommend talking it over with a political science teacher. Still, despite the difficulty, this book is a great read for an intellectual mind, and the essay is as well."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"\\"Walden Two\\" is a bizarre utopian novel by the notorious behaviourist B.F. Skinner. The novel (first published in 1948) is quite seriously intended, but nevertheless comes across as an unintentional parody of social engineering. Had it been a work of considerable antiquity, I'm sure Leo Strauss and Alan Bloom would have assumed that it *is* a parody!As classical utopian novels, \\"Walden Two\\" has no real plot. Most of the \\"novel\\" is a description of an imaginary utopian community, named Walden Two after the forest where Thoreau wrote his famous work \\"Walden\\". The similarity between Thoreau and Skinner isn't very striking, however. Walden Two may be surrounded by farmland, but it's really a large public housing complex with about 1,000 inhabitants, and obviously based on high technology. It has plans to expand and eventually take over all of the United States. Thoreau, as far as I know, mostly wanted to be left alone!The main character of the story is Frazier, the founder of Walden Two, who guides six visitors (and the reader) through the community and explains its ideology. Another character is named Burris. Apparently this is supposed to be B.F. Skinner himself, although Frazier is probably Skinner's real alter ego. Yet another character is an unsympathetic, useless and abstract philosophy professor named Castle, who is Frazier's main protagonist and constantly questions both him and the utopian society. The four remaining characters are named Roger, Barbara, Mary and Steve.Walden Two turns out to be a benevolent dictatorship ruled by anonymous Planners and Managers. They are not elected but appoint their own successors. The law of the community is called the Code and can be changed only be the Planners and Managers. The members of the community are not allowed to discuss any changes of the Code amongst themselves. The meaning of the Code is explained at mass meetings. There are also a kind of Sunday sermons. Children are taken from their parents immediately at birth and given a collective upbringing and education, based on (bizarre) behavioural psychology and conditioning. There is no sense of history. In fact, study of history is discouraged. Not even Frazier, who founded the community, expects to be remembered. At death, people are cremated and quietly forgotten. The important thing is the collective and the plan. Everyone in Walden Two seems to live in an eternal now.All problems are solved by behavioural engineering. If anyone has problems with the Code, he is considered to be sick and sent to a psychologist. A group of medical doctors have complete control of nutrition, physical training and sanitation. Even the tea service is managed according to scientific principles! Despite these authoritarian features, everyone in Walden Two is happy and contended. They only work four hours per day, and spend the rest of their time playing music, watching theatre or tending the gardens.And that, of course, is the point.What struck me when reading \\"Walden Two\\" was Skinner's unabashed elitism. He has a kind of benevolent contempt for the common man. Anti-democratic arguments abound. Society must be rationally planned by a scientific elite steeped in behaviourism. Elections are unnecessary and \\"freedom\\" is just an illusion. The important thing is to make the common people feel happy. Of course, people have no idea how to accomplish this, and the task should therefore be left to experts. But since people will be happy-happy-happy, what grounds are there for complaints? Two of the characters, Mary and Steve, join the community almost immediately. They are real simpletons and sign up because Walden Two has a high standard of living and provides them with simple pleasures. In other words, Mary and Steve (just listen to those common names!) are symbols of the plain folk Skinner both despised and wanted to \\"help\\" with his social engineering. By contrast, the intellectual Castle turns out to be quite impossible.Frazier openly talks about how Walden Two will eventually take over the neighbouring towns, buy up the farmers' land and force the local dealers to join \\"the cooperative\\"...or else, apparently. Frazier also reveals that all of Walden Two's inhabitants vote for the same candidates in the local elections. Both methods (economic compulsion and bloc vote) were used by Mormons to wield political power in both Nauvoo and Utah during the 19th century. Indeed, Skinner might have gotten the idea from a study of Mormon history (he mentions Joseph Smith in passing). At an even more candid moment, Frazier climbs onto a spot known as the Throne, assumes a position similar to the crucifixion, and fancies himself an equal to God and Jesus Christ! As for the inevitable parallels with Soviet Russia, Skinner's alter ego brushes them aside by accusing the Russians of not being radical enough. After all, they never abolished the family or religion.\\"Walden Two\\" is a fascinating, bizarre and interesting example of the darker sides of social engineering. As already mentioned, it could be read as an unintentional parody. One recurring scene in the novel is a flock of sheep seemingly conditioned to stay within a moving enclosure, but actually carefully watched by a large sheepdog. The symbolism is ambiguous. I suppose it's intended as a symbol of how people behave when *not* converted to Skinner's program. However, it may just as well be seen as a symbol of Walden Two. Indeed, Castle sees it that way.Somehow, it feels as if he has the last word."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"There is a lot of confusion about this book.Walden Two is one big dialogue on the possibilities of society design. Like Orwell's 1984 or Plato's Republic, it is about ideas. All that happens in it is a lot of gab about how we might or might not want to design a society, so it makes poor light reading. The book has little stylistic or rhetorical appeal, so if it became your favorite book it would probably be because you liked thinking about the things Skinner was thinking about.The concept at the heart of Walden Two is that of making our social institutions scientifically self-improving - matching up our needs and problems with any relevant solutions, and designing the institutions so that they will readily develop and take up scientific knowledge. The reader is invited to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of this via Skinner's sketch of one implementation and its consequences.That sketch dominates the book with little details, leading many readers (pro and con alike) to conclude that the details presented were Skinner's literal suggestions. I suggest sidestepping the issue by evaluating ideas rather than people, as Skinner provided us with no firm evidence of what he believed (in my opinion a definite, but not unrecoverable, flaw of the work). Walden Two was devised by the character Frazier, who has some rhetorical similarities to Skinner in his more rhetorical moods. On the other hand, the narrator shares a wealth of detail with Skinner, and particular is very distinct from Frazier. Heis named Burris (to Skinner's Burrhus), teaches unhappily at University, finds Frazier to be personally irritating and arrogant, and is interested in the possibilities of improving society and applying behavior, though often giving Frazier mild challenges. Of particular note, Burris admits quite explicitly that he does not understand the basis of the techniques that Frazier is using. They are wild future technology. All we see of them - via Burris - are a handful of brief sketches and a lot of results. Like the flying car or Newspeak, the implementation is not the point, but the consequences are. Once again, the book will be more interesting if you can separate out the overarching ideas.Walden Two is (by assumption, obviously not empirically) leaderless, policeless, and virtually free of any punishment, restraint, surveillance or coercion. The techniques do not involve any surgery or drugging. Anyone but Skinner, the steadfast determinist, would characterize them as minimal-impact, minimal-control, giving people as much choice as possible and using the same kind of incentives that now 'control' us, but in the pursuit of more leisurely, healthy, diverse, etc. lives. If Skinner had not been such a slave to his words, he could have conveyed this important nuance by simply using ordinary words. His utopia is really intended to be a utopia, explicitly different from the nasty controls that governments now use: surveillance and reporting to central authorities, beatings, war, etc.And this is really the point. After a couple of careful readings, the one thing I can noticeably identify Skinner embracing and defending is perhaps the one essentially utopian notion: that things now are being done in very wrong and ineffective ways (which they are), and that some mixture of technical knowhow and good-heartedness might under some conditions correct the problems and make things better for everyone. There is something deeply naive in this, in the age and perpetual lack of delivery of such things, that always arouses my cynicism. But in some ways it does get delivered - without anyone to act on this impulse, you and I would be working the dirt in fear, unhealthy and about as far from free as possible.Bottom line:Skinner's defense of essential utopian ideas is refreshing, and he presents a slightly different angle that bears useful comparison with other political utopian and dystopian novels like 1984, Brave New World, etc. However, the execution is poor on several counts, so Walden Two is a pass for anyone who really wants to get to the point or who is essentially uninterested in the topics described above.If you do read it, be patient and engage the topic on YOUR terms - not Chomsky's and not Skinner's, either!"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"I decided to reread this book not too long ago because I could remember little from my initial reading. I discovered many new nuances in the text that I picked up on immediately and had much fun with myself debating its many philosophical points. I would recommend this book to anyone, from the intellectual to the beginning reader, to the communist, to the libertarian.For a book with no discernable plot, it comes across very well as a fun read. The book is merely the story of the narrator (Burris) writing a book about Walden Two. Unlike 1984 with its dramatic, albeit melodramatic, story line, Walden Two is simply a first-person narrative of a party's foray into Walden Two. However, Skinner rarely allows one to see this by assailing the reader with a barrage of his thoughts, opinions and findings.There are, however, some shortcomings of this work, which warrant a one-star deduction. Skinner paints a wonderful Utopia and accounts for more of the minor details than most Utopia-oriented authors, but he makes a few glaring assumptions. Three come to mind as being the most detrimental to his argument. One) He assumes that Walden Two will magically produce enough goods to sustain itself with ample to spare for trade. Two) He assumes that a science of Behavioral Engineering is possible and implementable. And three) He assumes that this Behavioral Engineering will magically keep the Planners and Managers, the government of the community, from lusting after power, and that in this non-competitive-by-admission environment, people will still manage to excell past the norm. He attempts to support them, but he failed to convince me, no matter how I looked at the problem. Also, he is blatantly sympathetic to Russian Communism, although it was 1948 when he published the book, and Burris is so obviously a straw man concocted for Frazier to fight and convert that the last few chapters are almost laughable, if very poetic and well-written.All in all, I give the book and Skinner's tactics of argument four stars, but Walden Two as a community, one. Although it seems tempting with four hour work days and no competition, Walden Two seems, at least on paper, as believable as Lilliput or Fantasia, or any other fanciful land.Maybe Skinner should have made Walden Two a floating island and Frazier a green skinned dwarf, or something......."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Walden Two is not a story so much as it is Skinner's idea that by using the psycological techniques of a behaviorist a utopian society can be built (it can even be considered propaganda promoting the school of behaviorism). The book lacks story, there is little charactor development or anything thing of the sort. It is essentially a grocery list of items that should be in a perfect society.With that said I justify my rating.Walden Two is a the model of a utopia, set in the United States just after World War Two. Skinner illustrates what needs to be done for the happiness of humans, but not the bliss the few ruling class or even the bliss of the majority(as presented loosely in democracy) but the bliss of everyone. The main idea behind behaviorism is that humans are born with nothing and we are the product of our histories, everything that ever happened to the indivisual will affect that person's choices in whatever endevour the indivisual is faced with. All the problems within people are learned, they can therefor be unlearned. Within Walden Two those who were born into the society never learn these bad behaviors and those who have come into the society, by following 'The Walden Code' simply unlearn them. None of the problems of modern society linger within Walden Two because of the technology of behavioral engineering. Negative emotions like jelousy or greed or hate are not present in Walden Two because the circumstances from which they arise are not preseant. There are no pressures from society itself to corrupt man, he has no reason to be corrupted if all his needs are accounted for.While this exact model of a utopia may not apply to the modern world, it's basic ideas certanly do, all that would need to be updated is the technology. Humanity will not remain static, amoung its potential directions is one towards the utopian society another, the distopian society. I'd sooner be living the life of T.E. Frazier than that of Winston Smith."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"&quot;social engineering.&quot; it sounds preposterous. but it works. in a totalitarian society. history teaches such a society eventually fails. but if you'd look into it, at the root of its failure is just a managerial issue. a country is too big to be controllable. there exist subsocieties that try to overturn the government. but what if the size's small enough? meet skinner's walden two.it's where flowers bloom, children play and learn things on their own, and people draw beau--tiful pictures everyday. but wait, beauty is subjective. who judged their beauty? that's our narrator, professor burris. what's wrong with hard rock, acid rock, and punk rock? let those be and let us choose what's to our taste. frasier might say that he gives enough exposure of those to their children. who knows what aesthetic preferences those little ones might have? but in the novel, children never leave walden two. :-P"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"something i noticed the other reviewers did not mention (perhaps did not know) is that this book originally inspired one of the longest standing intentional communities the u.s. ~ twin oaks. you can check out &quot;a walden two experiment&quot; documenting their first 5 years &amp; &quot;is it utopia yet&quot; written after their 25th anniversary - both by kat kinkade, one of the founding memebers. they are much more personable than this; funny and refreshingly honest they give you a glimpse into what actually happened when people tried to materialize this vision.

Thoreau wrote about individualism and self reliance in &quot;Walden&quot; (which I recently reviewed). &quot;Walden Two&quot; is a novel about a socially engineered utopia, far from anything Thoreau would have ever advocated. I read both Walden Two and the now out of print &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; many years ago after Skinner spoke at the college I attended. I found &quot;Walden Two&quot; captivating (I wasn't bored as were some reviewers) but I was captivated by what, quite frankly, is nonsense. Such a Utopian community would curb ambition; after all, who would aspire to break from the pack and achieve great things such as advances in medical research, if we were made contented in such a &quot;utopian&quot; society? Skinner could induce certain behavior by behaviorist techniques. If you were talking to him, for example, and you were scratching your head from time to time, he could get you to scratch your head more by giving you verbal positive feedback every time you did it. Sort of like Pavlov's dog. However, just because behaviorists can successfully control behavior does not mean they should. After all, who is to decide the behavior society wants that behaviorists should then induce? I'm sorry, we cannot go beyond freedom and dignity because these are ever enduring values, not the values that a controlled society may decide is best for us."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Skinner describes an interesting scientific approach toward an utopian society.

F. Skinner has written many texts. In &quot;Walden Two&quot; (a fictional work) B. F. Skinner describes his utopian community vision. &quot;Walden Two&quot; concentrates on behavioral psychology but neglects questions concerning family values and community finances.Walden Two's lifestyle maximizes leisure time, but it does not build strong families. Family members live separately: spouses in adjoining rooms; older children in dormitories; and babies in shared infant-care facilities. Members eat in shared dining rooms with young children in different dining rooms. Teenagers are encouraged to marry in their late teens -- these young marrieds are encouraged to move to Walden Two's sister communities. Walden Two has a stated policy of supporting its senior citizens, but few members have reached senior citizen age.Walden Two is governed by its religion: &quot;The Code&quot;. The Code is a set of behavioral rules that encourages pleasantry. When members have difficulty following The Code they are encouraged to consult Walden Two's &quot;psychologist-priests&quot;. Other members (including members' own spouses and children) pressure uncooperative Walden Two members to conform. A member facing an unresolved dilemma has potential family problems and has little external recourse. Senior citizens face their special problems with few family members to assist them.B. F. Skinner's discussion of Walden Two's finances is weak. The author does not discuss who supplies the large amounts of money required to purchase the land, the capital equipment, and to feed and house people during the construction of Walden Two and its sister communities. The author also does not dwell on the *impact* of leaving Walden Two. Members leave Walden Two with the possessions they brought to Walden Two -- little to show for their many years' work. Children leave Walden Two with the clothing on their backs -- their families have few resources to help them. And Walden Two has not yet faced the financial and labor cost of supporting a significant number of senior citizen members.I believe that &quot;Walden Two&quot; is *not* a humanistic utopian community design. The forced comformance with The Code, the disassociation of family members from birth through middle age, the financial penalties for leaving, and senior citizens' potential separation from family makes &quot;Walden Two&quot; resemble a pleasant version of George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;.

The book itself is full of extremely challenging in its ideas. It raises many points that can have a person strong in their faith even take these ideas and ponder them. What if it really could work? Skinner does a good job presenting his ideas, but he has no basis or foundation for which to rest them on. The inconsistancies of his thoughts stand out more than the characters themselves. If Skinner is hailed as an exceptional psychologist, why then can ten high school juniors take every one of his ideas and prove why they can't work? Also, these juniors can take his ideas, match them up with the worldview that applies (Naturalism), and predict where, why, and how his plans will fail."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"SHIPPED SUPER FAST!!! the book sucks though. written poorly probably because the author is the well renouned scientist B.F.

For anyone other than an engineering student, this book probably goes into too much theoretical &quot;rocket science.&quot;In spite of this level of technical detail, the author also makes some questionable comments about marker beacons, radio altimeters, and lightning detection. These comments were carried over from the first edition (I have both).Again, lots of good info but you might want to look at a less expensive avionics books first. I'd recommend looking at T.K.

Hundreds of fossils are beautifully illustrated on the 98 plates. Many species and genera are illustrated and described for the first time. The changes in the coastal waters of eastern North America during the last 30 million years are well documented in this book.Ed uses drawings and vivid descriptions to detail the physical changes to the coast, but he goes one step further by describing the fossil communities that existed in specific areas at specific times. As a fossil collector, I appreciate the way Ed brings the fossil shells to life by using his knowledge of modern marine biology to describe the physical environment and the interactions among the fossil organisms. The book has proven to be a valuable resource for the identification of fossils, but more that that, it has given me an understanding of how these fossils acted while they were alive.I highly recommend this book. I feel that reading this book has increased my understanding of paleontology and it will be a valuable part of my reference library for years to come."},{"Title":"Cenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America","review":"The Geology of the Everglades and Adjacent Areas, by Edward J.

These books have definitely expanded my understanding of the relationships of living mollusk species through the evolution of their ancestors. I am looking forward to Dr. Petuch's next book."},{"Title":"Cenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America","review":"Dr. Petuch has the ability to make what might seem a mundane subject - how did one of our states come into being - a fascinating historical detective story. Petuch is now ivory-tower intellectual. He has been an active field worker in Florida's numerous fossil-rich deposits since the mid-1970s. Based on his knowledge of mollusks and their habitat requirements (he's also a marine biologist), he has used the record of molluscan fossils to reconstruct the way the Florida peninsula was built over the last 30 million or so years. It's a fascinating story, beautifully constructed and marvelously illustrated with photos of the fossil mollusks that help tell the story and numerous maps that show how Florida was built, layer by layer, over the millenia."},{"Title":"Cenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America","review":"I am not a scientist, nor a professional shell collector - but I am very interested in the environment of ancient Florida as an amateur fossil collector, and Dr. Petuch's book has helped me gain a greater understanding of that environment. I found \\"Cenozoic Seas\\" to be incredibly organized - each area of the Southeast USA is systematically presented in a manner that even a novice such as myself could understand. Dr. Petuch's presentation of the placement of the ancient seas of the Southeastern USA clarified for me just how much change has taken place in this area, both in geographic and evolutionary terms. Of particular interest to me is his presentation of the formations in Okeechobee County, where I happen to live. I have had several opportunities to visit the Ruck's Pit in northern Okeechobee County, and I have found Dr. Petuch's book to accurately interpret for me what was found in this area of the state 3 million years ago. \\"Cenozoic Seas\\" is a very well-written, systematic, and (from my experience) accurate presentation of ancient Florida (as well as other locations throughout the South). I have seen for myself the diversity of species in Ruck's Pit, especially in the cowrie shells found there in the pit...even someone as untrained as myself can see the variation that occurs in this location with its particular species of cowries. I highly recommend this book to any person who is interested in the fossil shell history of Florida as well as any of the other areas of the Southeastern USA.

There is always something I will use in my business, and this is the eye with which I read these books. This book is a joy to read explicitly because it doesn't have anything I NEED to know. I know some (or most) of the knifemakers in this book and think every one (company or individual) is an asset to his calling. There are others (many) who equally deserved space in there and maybe will if there is a book 100 More Legendary Knives. The pictures are terrific and the information is the most up-to-date I have seen anywhere.

The pics absolutely make the book worthwhile. However, because of Pacella's arbitrary choices of knives, some of the selected knives are not really &quot;legendary&quot; in any true degree, but simply an example of one of many types of knives. Various of the non-American bladesmiths and certainly most of the examples of French knife makers could have been replaced with more prominent names, most likely American. Of course, having arbitrarily named certain knives as legendary, like the Mississippi Gambler's knife, Pacella immediately opens himself to statements such as mine. It is good to remember that everybody's list of 100 legendary anything is up for discussion and disagreement. As well, the writing style at times creates ridiculous senses of things--&quot;The various periods of prehistory succeeded each other, ...&quot; What is &quot;prehistory,&quot; that is, what exact time is before historical reckoning?

Mike"},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"This is the story of the development and refinement of evolutionary thought in the Nineteenth Century. The author allows a little slop into the end of the Eighteenth Century with such as Hutton and Buffon, and a bit into the Twentieth with Alfred Russell Wallace's last years, but basically this is the story of how the medieval view of the Great Chain of Being coming into sudden being along with the earth 6000-odd years ago evolved into an altogether grander but not-remotely-Biblical view of time, geology, life, and change.Charles Darwin is, of course, the centerpiece of such a discussion, but by no means crowds out consideration of other thinkers and workers. In terms of space, Darwin does not take up terribly much of the book, but many of the ideas and discoveries made before him are highlighted because of the use he is to make of them, and the loss of Mendel's work is seen as ironic because it was not there when Darwin needed it. It seems to be Eiseley's position that Darwin was not making a leap that others could not make, or had not made, but that, rather, he was positioned to carry the new paradigm of natural selection through an opposition that could not combat his thorough preparation and his dedicated cadre of younger naturalists. The time was ripe, and Darwin struck. It is ironic that he was, in later editions of his book, forced to revert to rather Lamarkian explanations of organic change because of the physicists. They just wouldn't give him an Earth old enough to allow his leisurely form of natural selection by the pruning of occasional random variations to create, eventually, the great variety of life.After Darwin was pruned the story goes on, of course, and Eiseley mentions the work of the Germans in cytology and heredity, the rediscovery of Mendel, and Wallace's speculations about the brain. This book was written in 1958, but Loren Eiseley anticipates, to a certain extent, the evolutionary psychology that is now explaining so much about the human mind. And he weighs in on the side of free will: finally, we must become less impressed with our technology and begin to grapple with the questions that should interest a creature that can look at itself-the basic questions of morality and the meaning of life. It is fascinating to know what we are, but we must ask what we can become.This book is well worth reading (I've read it twice) for the compelling story and the fine prose style. Eiseley was a naturalist and paleontologist as well as an essayist of great evocative power. Here he proves himself a fine historian as well: he seems to have read everything that impinges on the story he is telling, and given us a clear view of a fascinating period in science."},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"Anthropologist Loren Eiseley is best known for his poetic essays on evolution, biology, and human nature._Darwin's Century_ may be a leap for fans of this work. It's a scholarly work, written while Eiseley was wearing his Professor hat instead of his Philosopher cap. It's a comprehensive (but very readable) look at the intellectual climate in which Charles Darwin was educated and scentific traditions of the time.Like any good history of science, _Darwin's Century_ clears away a lot of the mythological gleam surrounding Darwin's great realization. It shows us that, despite the genuine controversy the publication of the theory engendered, that _evolution evolved_. The seeds of the idea were all around.Indeed, much of the ideological &quot;flavor&quot; we associate with evolution arises not from the theory itself, but were inherited from these ur-notions, such as the Great Chain of Being and Malthus's writings.Put this one on your list if you enjoy the work of writers like Stephen Jay Gould and Freeman Dyson."},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"Loren Eiseley's DARWIN'S CENTURY is an interesting survey of the men whose scientific investigations led to advances in studies in biology and, interestingly enough, physics. Eiseley presents a readable account of the complex background to Darwin's work, and Eiseley examines the Darwin's contemporaries and those benefitted from his work as well as those who enhanced it.Eiseley presents Darwin's work with the 19th century intellectual background. The book makes clear that Darwin's work leading to the his theory of evolution was not an isolated venture devoid of other scientific work. One must note that there signficances studies in geology, and with the rapid industrialization in Europe and the United States, the mining industries led not only to the extraction of natural resources but the discovery of the remains of extinct species.Charles Darwin was not the only one who noticed the possibilities extinct species. However, he was one of the first to carefully investigate why species survived. His work led to the realization that within surviving species there were noticable differences in color, habits, etc. This led to Darwin's ORIGINS OF THE SPECIES which was published in 1859. Darwin may have had this published book \\"prematurely\\" in hopes of prempting others who were doing similiar work.Eiseley's explanation of Gregor Mendal's (1822-1884)pioneer work in genetics is a clear explation of both Mendal's work and the historical importance of genetics which helped the Darwinists in that it gave them a theorhetically mechanism for changes in species. The advances in the study of genetics in recent history indicates just how important Mendal's work was.Eiseley also gives a readable explation of some of the developments in atomic physics. His explation of the importance of the Curries-Laborde experiments in 1903 which proved that radium maintains its temperatures above the surroundings was so important to studies in astronomy and geology. Such work help astronomers develop radio telescopes and a means of examining \\"space debris.\\" Developments in atomic physics were important in examining the astronomical age of the sun which undermined Kelvin's conception of this star. Geologists benefitted from atomic physics which helped with the invention of the atomic clock which enabled geologists to push the age of the earth back to millions and eventually billions of years. Both genetics atomic physics gave the evolutionists the means of change and the time they needed to explain evolution.DARWIN'S CENTURY is an important book in explaining biological theories and evolution. Before one engages in the childish debates about intelligent design, this book would assist anyone to have a calm, rational view of Darwin and others whose work was so important and certainly above the childish debate of what some try to pass as science. Rather than popularize one side or the other in intelligent design debate, Eiseley's book would give a dispassionate, readable view of the actual science involved."},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"Newton said, &quot;If I have seen so far, it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.&quot; The same could be said for Charles Darwin, as Eisley shows in _Darwin's Century_.It is a fascinating read, to be sure. I had always assumed that Dawin's _Origin of Species_ and _Decent of Man_ were discoveries made by a brilliant flash of intuition and genius. Eisley clarifies this misconception, demonstrating the ideas and theories that influenced Darwin - from Buffon and Lamarck to Malthus and Linneaus were critical in the development of his theory. Of course, all of these naturalists were &quot;close&quot; to evolution, but it was Darwin who managed to connect the dots, and it was Darwin's genius that made sense of it all. However, the theories of natural selection, species variation and adaptation did not occur in an academic vacuum. Eisely does a great job of showing this.The only criticism I have is that it is written more for the &quot;scholarly set&quot; - maybe as a supplementary text for a college class rather than for the general public. This is not a weakness, but certainly something the lay reader should be aware of going into this remarkable book."},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"This is a very readable account of a topic that can be daunting at times, especially for those without much background in the natural or physical sciences. Eiseley was a superb writer and he adds a lot of life and zest to the history of evolutionary theory. One becomes fascinated by the men who were at the forefront of &quot;discovering&quot; evolution (of whom Charles Darwin was only one), as well as the events that led to evolution's eventual widespread acceptance."},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"This book is not explicitly about Darwin, rather it is about the science that shaped Darwin's ideas and made it possible for him to develop the theory of evolution. The book starts with the idea of time and how the science of the late 18th and early 19th centuries provided a counterpoint to the idea that the earth was only about 6000 years old. The book shows how the development of geology made it possible to think of an earth that was older than many millions of years, making evolution possible. The book then discuses those scientists who preceded Darwin and came very close to developing the idea of natural selection. Darwin does not even enter the book until about its mid point and then it is assumed that the reader is very familiar with him and how he came to write his famous books. Only 15 pages are actually allotted to the voyage of the Beagle and only part of another chapter is devoted to Darwin's writings. Following this are chapters about those who supported Darwin and those who opposed his ideas.I found the book interesting and it corrected some misconceptions that I had about Darwin and evolution. For instance, I always believed that Alfred Russel Wallace was unknown to Darwin before he received his paper on evolution and that Wallace's ideas were not based on very many personal observations. The book shows that I was wrong on both counts. Wallace, like Darwin, was a naturalist who traveled widely and made many personal observations. Furthermore, he exchanged letters with Darwin before he wrote his paper and thus Darwin should not have been surprised when Wallace's paper arrived. I also did not realize that as the 19th century was ending sufficient objections were raised to have put Darwin's theories in serious jeopardy. The book also shows how the new science of atomic physics and the rediscovery of Mendel's ideas of inheritance answered these questions.While I liked some aspects of the book on the whole I was disappointed for several reasons, namely:1) The book provides almost no information regarding Darwin's life and his theories.2) The book presupposes that the reader is very familiar with Darwin, his life and his theories.3) The style of writing is more 19th century than 20th century. Most sentences contain subordinate clauses and several ideas. To some degree I felt as if I were reading a 300-page SAT essay, which was chosen to be as complex and confusing as possible. This coupled with the assumption that I knew more about Darwin than I did, made this a tough read.Because of the aforementioned problems, from my perspective this was only at best a 3 star book, but for someone with more knowledge of Darwin and evolution it would be a 4 or 5 star book. For them it does provide a lot of information on the science and scientists who made it possible for Darwin to develop his ideas. For this reason, and because I do not think that it is fair to criticize a book because of my shortcomings, I am giving the book 4-stars, with the proviso that this would only be so for a reader with sufficient background knowledge of Darwin and the theory of evolution to enable them to get more from the book than I did."},{"Title":"Darwin's century: evolution and the men who discovered it (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"\\"Only James Hutton brooding over a little Scottish brook that carried sediment down to the sea felt the weight of the solid continent slide uneasily beneath his feet and cities and empires flow away as insubstantially as a summer cloud.\\" It's tough to read this line and not have shivers go down your spine. This book approaches poetry in places. A classic that should remain in courses on history as well as evolution and geology. Darwin was a man of his times, and to understand him, one must understand his times. This book is an excellent leg up on that."},{"Title":"InstallAnywhere Tutorial and Reference Guide","review":"Usually the process of bundling together a software project along with an installation script is hurriedly done at the end of the project. And the scripts might differ for each target operating system. So you might think of InstallAnywhere as a meta-installer. The authors wrote the program to make installers under a gamut of operating systems - linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, XP etc. The hope is to free you from a lot of grungy operating system specific nuances that are probably not even the core expertise of you or anyone on your project.In practice, even in this book, there are often unavoidable details specific to some operating systems. Like where to put files and resources. You will still have to contend with items like these. Still, the authors offer an intriguing and quite useful investment of your time. To the extent that it can relieve you of even some, if not most, of the installation details, it has merit.As an added bonus, there is full internationalisation. You can run this program using text resources in many languages. As well as changing any localised text."},{"Title":"InstallAnywhere Tutorial and Reference Guide","review":"This book is an excellent guide to using InstallAnywhere no matter which platform you are running or how much experience you have with the product. This is the kind of documentation that you wish that the company would provide especially when you consider the price of the software. According to the introduction, the book was produced from the handouts that Zero G had produced for their three day InstallAnywhere course.The book starts with a quick introduction and some screen shots showing what running an installer would look like from a customer's point of view. The authors next show a simple example of building an installer. Unfortunately, and this remains true for the rest of the book, no screen shots are included. This means that you must be running the software to take full advantage of the book. No reading this book in the bathtub. The book works well as both a tutorial and reference guide. The authors take you step by step through an exercise explaining each of the options even if they aren't used in this exercise. The instructions for each exercise are very clear. The use of the product is clearly explained while you are using it, which makes the learning \\"stick\\".The book covers everything from the most basic installer all the way up to writing your own custom plug-ins. If you are interested in taking full advantage of the InstallAnywhere software and don't want to spend the money for three days of training, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Basic statistics: A primer for the biomedical sciences (Series on quantitative methods for biologists and medical scientists)","review":"seller said it had some writing but I did not ecpect that much with all the yellow highlighting.

After spending an hour reading it, I looked at the cover and truly thought I would see the words \\"edited by...\\".If you are owned by a basset hound that's driving you nuts and you're looking to this book as a last resort to saving your sanity or giving your hound up for adoption, PLEASE LOOK ELSEWHERE. This book will do you no good. It's full of cutesy stories written by other people and very short on hard facts. As another reviewer pointed out, this book portrays all basset hounds as lazy, overweight lumps that do only what pleases them. It's a very narrow view of the breed.Join the mailing lists and get this for free. ..."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"I was looking for an informative guide about The Basset Hound.I read this book, it was okay , definetly not worth the list price.It was just a book containing little stories of Basset Hounds.If anyone could recommend an informative guide i would appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"This book has been recommended on various web sites and I thought I would give it a try since we just got a basset puppy. It was not helpful to us in understanding the breed, and now my husband is convinced we have a hard headed dog who is never going to be housebroken and is going to let burglars waltz right into our house."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"This book is a delightful look inside the intimate relationships that many people develop with their Basset Hounds. At first glance it seems light in content but a thorough reading will yield a wealth of information about these great drooling clowns.As a Basset Hound owner myself, it is difficult to judge the attraction of this book to those poor souls who do not share their lives with a Hound. Everyone with a Basset should read it. It captures the magic, the messes and the mysteries of life with a Basset Hound. Everyone considering adding a Basset to their lives should read it. It is this group that stands to benefit most.As a first time Basset Hound (and dog) owner several years ago, it was learn as you go. Sure there were Basset books out there, many with valuable information. They explained in detail how things were supposed to go (by the book). Diane's book adds reality through the use of short stories and anecdotes by Basset Hound owners who participate in a couple of on-line forums.Typical is the accurate comment by Amanda Sherwin under the heading, &quot;Do Bassets Make Good Watch Dogs?&quot; She says, &quot;Bassets are fine watch dogs. You can tell the time by them. Especially meal time.&quot; Almost every page has a similar paragraph that illustrates and illuminates breed peculiarities. Under the heading, &quot;Do Bassets Enjoy Sex?,&quot; MS Morgan sums up life with bassets perfectly by saying, &quot;Not if they have to get off the couch to participate.&quot;If you are owned by a Basset Hound you must have this book. It will explain to your longsuffering friends why you find joy in your Hound. If you are considering a Basset as a pet, reading The Basset Hound Owner's Survival Guide should be mandatory. As a volunteer with Basset Hound Rescue of Southern California, I believe that ignorance of the breed is the primary reason they show up abandoned in animal shelters. Read this book before you adopt a Basset. Involve the whole family as it is funny and very suitable for reading aloud to children.The Basset Hound Owner's Survival Guide will tickle your fancy while stealthily teaching you all about Basset Hounds that you need to know. It had to be a labor of love because the love shines through the whole book."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"For anyone who has ever loved a basset hound, and especially for anyone considering being owned by a basset hound, this is an essential read.For all it's humour, it is also a book that cautions people that although basset hounds are cute and funny, they are also difficult and complex dogs - not your average well-behaved lab, in other words. Not a dog for the easily grossed-out (think drool flings), for the impatient (think laying down in the middle of a walk) or for those who demand obedience (what are you kidding?)Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"Having read a number of other Basset Hound how-to books, I expected more of the same dry education you usually find. However, I soon found myself laughing at descriptions of MY Basset Hound. Diane has a way of telling the bald truth with such humor that I have read this book twice for the sheer enjoyment of it and for a deeper knowledge of my basset. She has climbed right into the basset mind and is right on the money in her conclusions about basset behavior. It makes you realize what a unique and funny animal you live with. If you own a Basset Hound, this is an essential handbook. She inserts many comments and experiences from other basset owners as well as pictures and the wonderful illustrations of Pam Tanzey. Not only can you learn a lot about the Basset Hound from this book, but you will be immensely entertained as well. She covers not only the physical health of the hound, but the mental health and development as well. For me, this put her head and shoulders above the competition. Her hands-on knowledge and biting wit will keep you turning the pages rapidly, then going back to relish it again. It will either make you want to run right out and get a basset, or sure that you never want to own one. She's right - Bassets aren't for everybody, but this book is great reading for all."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"Don't get fooled by the casual way this book is written. It really is valuable, and provides deep information about this special breed of dogs. Having two basset hounds myself, Diane Morgan's insightful information made me understand my dogs better and when I faced serious health problems with my female puppy I knew who to contact via e-mail to give me some expert advice. I also appreciated the wit of the book; bassets are indeed dogs best suited for owners with a sense of humor since they have lots of it themselves. In a few words, if you own or you are thinking to own a basset hound, this is a must-have!"},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"One of my favorite basset books.

I have experience with bassets and was able to enjoy the anecdotes, but the anecdotes are the problem. The book is overflowing with little vignettes and not much else. There are other owner guides to the basset hound that address in detail important issues like feeding, health and grooming without the endless accompanying tales. I was extremely disappointed and wouldn't recommend it for a novice basset owner. it just doesn't cover the hard facts it needs to."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"This book provides a lot of information about this breed of dog, but fails to provide solutions on how to deal with these traits. This book heavily relies on questions posted by people on newsgroups for its content to describe how a basset hound is different from other breeds. That's fine, but it never answers any of those questions. For example, one newsgroup passage is from someone who is having problems removing drool from the walls without removing the paint, and the book just ends the topic without saying how you can do this. (By the way, from trial and error, we've discovered the Mr. Clean Magic Erasers work like a charm) This gives the whole book the tone, \\"Yep, bassets do that. Isn't that cute! Get used to it.\\" If you're looking for a book that accurately describes some of the peculiarities of bassets, this is a good book. But if you're looking for one that provides training answers, get a quality training book and look at the newsgroups."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"Being owned by two Bassets myself, the stories were funny and easy to relate to.

However, if you are looking for a book that tells you the peculiarities of the Basset breed, or tells you surprising things to expect with a Basset, or tells you about life with a Basset, then this book is everything you want/need to know. Bassets are called \\"clowns\\" for a reason ... well, actually, for many reasons! And most of those reasons are included in this book. If you are a finicky housekeeper, or if you think that everything should have its place (and you weren't thinking it should be on a shelf right below ceiling level), you may not see the humor in Bassets. If you get upset by clothing disappearing out of the clothes hamper and down the throat of a Basset (and out a different route), you may not see the humor in Bassets. If you want a dog who will walk beside you and not pay attention to all the wonderful sights and smells in the grass, you may not see the humor in Bassets. But if you enjoy a good laugh, especially if you are fortunate enough to be owned by one of these wonderful creatures, then this book deserves to be in your library where it can be enjoyed over and over again."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but don't feel it was worth what I paid for it.

It takes a special person to endure the quirks of this loveable breed. I've found THE BASSET HOUND OWNER'S SURVIVAL GUIDE to be an indispensable guide to help me find the rewards in the midst of the challenges.The book is not really a step-by-step resource for daily Basset care (although it does offer much good advice); instead, its strong suit is a collection of anecdotes and observations that describe the personalities of Bassets and those who love them. I've found great \\"ah, your hound does that too?\\" comfort in the stories in this book, which are written with a sometimes laugh-out-loud sense of humor.Anyone who knows and admires the breed will find much to please, inform, and entertain in this book, and it should be required reading for all who are considering inviting a Basset into home and heart."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"After almost 30 years of Saints (Bernards,) I got a Basset!Diane Morgan tells new &quot;basseteers&quot; everything we need to know about the breed and how, specifically, to make the family basset happy &amp; healthy.

Very fun reading!"},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"The basset hound owner's survival guide is appropriately titled, and gives wonderful insight into the charachter of the breed.I have read many basset hound breed books, but this one was different in that it contained so much humor and whimsical fancy, which is so necessary when you are the owner of this particular breed. :)I highly recommend it to all basset hound enthusiasts....you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"This book makes small mention of the fact that bassets have long, weak backs which may cause lameness down the road. They don't tell you how expensive the operation is to fix such a problem, and that it could all be avoided by never allowing your basset climb or jump down from furniture, go up/down stairs or jump into your car without benefit of a ramp. The problem, unfortunately, is fairly common and is known as \\"intervertebral disc disease\\". You may have, by all appearances, a very healthy, happy animal, but over time, a basset may be suffering injury to its back. There are barely any symptoms, but if your basset starts to walk very slowly one day, or shows resistance to walking downhill, it needs several weeks crate rest IMMEDIATELY and call your vet! If your basset doesn't get enough rest to heal the back, it could wind up being unable to walk or be unable to move its head, in a great deal of pain, and needing an extremely expensive operation, which may or may not solve the problem. We found out the hard way with our 6 year female basset. The operation to save her was going to cost $10,000 and they refused to negotiate the price. We had to put her down, a dog that was never overweight and healthy in every other way. Don't let this happen to your wonderful hound. Learn from our heartbreak experience. There is nothing worse than not being able to save a young dog because of a preventable problem that ended up costing way more than most people can afford."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"I am a proud Basset Hound owner. Diane Morgan sure captured the essence of this peculiar breed. She gives a real complete well rounded picture of this adorable breed.

I totally recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"HilarIous!! I laughed through the entire book. This is not a care & training book. It's more like comical insite on Basset behavior and antics from Basset Hound owners. Definitely a MUST READ for Basset owners to be.

The basic information about the breed is very helpful, but the anecdotes about bassets are the part that should not be missed.

Even if, as another reviewer noted (unpleasantly at that), much of the book is commentary by actual Basset Hound owners (Oh, excuse me. I should say by many individuals who are owned by Basset Hounds.), their real-life, everyday insights can be more revealing and informative than the formula dog behavior books that are out there. You know the type: 5% about the specific breed, 95% about products, commonalities, etc. It's not an A-to-Z answer guide -- no book ever is. But, it IS a fun time for YOU and your Hound. And you begin to understand that you're not the ONLY person in the world owned by a zany, lovable beast. I recommend it highly to any Basset Hound lover. It's a shame that other breeds don't have something similar -- or maybe they do?"},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"I own what I thought was the only basset in the world with a personality disorder, only until after reading this wonderful book did I know ALL bassets have a certain eccentric side to them.

Thanks for the great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"This is a terrific book for anyone considering being acquired by a basset hound. Anyone already ensnared will find themselves saying, &quot;my dog does that too,&quot; or &quot;how did she know that?&quot;These dogs are different and so are those of us with whom they share their lives. The book gives a great deal of good, practical information as opposed to some which try to apply esoteric theories or ideas best suited to other breeds. More importantly, it gives the reader a real taste of what life with this breed can be like.These dogs aren't for everyone -- but those once truly smitten rarely go astray -- search the web and you will find links and rings galore. More than once I laughed out loud causing my snoozing lap basset to glance up at me to ensure that everything was as it should be and that I wasn't about to get up and disturb his post-dinner nap.I have several books on bassets and this, by far, is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"This book is a wonderful loving look at the charming basset hound.

Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"My biggest problem with this book is that a good portion of it, at least 30-40%, is stuff available verbatim on the web. There are lengthy quotes of email discussions which are archived on the related sites, the &quot;email joke&quot; about taking pictures of puppies that I remember getting in my email at least 3 different times and can find on at least 2 web sites, and more. That in and of itself isn't that bad, but in a book of its list price, I expect some original content. I expect tons of information from the author's experience raising countless bassets. While the anecdotes are amusing, and at least part of why I bought it, they come across as a poorly organized web site: random and chaotic. If you are going to stick a price like that on a book, it had better be more than a cut'n'paste from past email discussions with a little commentary thrown in. Bottom line? Save your money and read the archives of the email discussions."},{"Title":"The Basset Hound Owner's Surival Guide (Your Happy Healthy Pet Guides)","review":"We recently inherited our bassett hound Mickey from my father-in-law who recently passed away.

We thought we were the only ones experiencing such doggie situations but it's with a sense of relief that I read this intelligent, witty book. It's been helpful with identifying with other owners, the author's humor is perfectly woven into each chapter. However, this will not be the only book I read on Bassets.

I'm not sure it would convince someone considering adopting a Basset Hound for the first time that the breed was for them though. An absolute must for someone that knows the breed, as it will delight and entertain and teach you things you didn't know, but more of a companion book for a Basset Hound Newbie... they'll need the no-nonsense breed book as well for the serious info about these beloved, low-slung, drooly, loud, lovable dogs!

I was in despair of ever bonding with the little guy. No other basset book fully prepared me for him; they all talked about the breed's basic good points. After reading this book, it was as if a bolt of understanding hit me, I went with my puppy's will, and we had many wonderful years together. I've recommended this book to many prospective basset owners so they can fully underand what they are getting into and either embrace their new friend fully or run screaming to a new, different breed."},{"Title":"Japan Before Perry: A Short History","review":"This book covers the history of Japan in an enthusiastic way from its early histories with the Joman dolls up to the blackships of commodore Perry. I first read this in my Japanese history course, we were required to read parts of the book as a backbone for the lectures, but soon i found that I was reading the entire book. It's actually quite a easy read and Japan's history is quite refreshing for someone who's been embraced in european histories all his life.

I wish the author/photographer would have done another book"},{"Title":"City of Secrets: photographs of Naples by Jed Fielding","review":"This is not a book for people looking for architectural or landscape photographs of Naples; the pictures focus solely on the people (mostly female children) of this ancient Italian city.The photographs in this book are not technically brilliant, even by standards of the time, yet the dark shadows are rich with secret meaning: a woman in a doorway is seen only as a skirt and arms holding an infant, for example. The essay does a dutiful job of answering questions about why the photographs were taken in the loose fashion that some of them were, and why they are mostly focused on girls, but is neither boring nor compelling.However, the real reason to get this book is to get a sense of the living, breathing city, both old and young, in its extremes of glamour and squalor, that makes you both wish you could go see that time and place and hope that it has vanished."},{"Title":"SOUTHERN HONOR: ETHICS & BEHAVIOR IN THE OLD SOUTH.","review":"When I purchased this book, I expected a topical history of the ways of the Old South. WRONG! This work is an in-depth sociological study of the way honor (and other areas of person) were perceived and displayed in that lost era. Not only is the exposition a shock for those who mourn for the Old South, but gives personal insight into the behavior of the region today. Excellent book - slow reading"},{"Title":"SOUTHERN HONOR: ETHICS & BEHAVIOR IN THE OLD SOUTH.","review":"Slavery was a major cause of the civil war, and yet most Southerners did not own slaves. This is a very telling fact and an interesting question. Southern Honor is an interesting look at the concept of Honor in the south and how it tied into the culture of the whole region and all classes. When Northerners attack the south for slavery, because of the concept of honor, it became not just an attack on the slave owners, or the rich southerners it was an attack on the whole region and culture. This is an important fact when looking at the causes of the civil war. I enjoyed reading this book, I learned a lot from it, and it helped to explain why many Southerners did what they did. This is an important book to read when studying the civil war or the history of the South."},{"Title":"SOUTHERN HONOR: ETHICS & BEHAVIOR IN THE OLD SOUTH.","review":"I had the privelege of reading Brown's work in the eleventh grade. It was recomended to me by a former History proffesor at West Point who was my American Studies instructor.While, as pointed out by some other reviews, the book is slow to read (such as other great authors such as Page Smith, and select works by Stephen Ambrose, it offers a vital and credible perspective into the society that we lost, in my opinion, when reconstruction began. I enjoyed the read (it took me two weeks) and found it enlightening and, while comprehensive and labyrinthian in references it is a populist perspectiveon the very elitist social environment in the pre-bellum South. Overall, I would reccomend this book to any intellectual, especially those young WASPs in the South who find their cultural influences constantly being bruised by hasty generalizations, who has an interest in the gentry class of the Old South. I would reccomend a parralel read with William Faulkner or other promenint Southern writers, such as Twain, as well."},{"Title":"SOUTHERN HONOR: ETHICS & BEHAVIOR IN THE OLD SOUTH.","review":"It is a very interesting read although at times I think it generalizes and comes close to stereotyping some behaviors and attitudes but it does provide many real life examples and quotes to support its conclusions."},{"Title":"SOUTHERN HONOR: ETHICS & BEHAVIOR IN THE OLD SOUTH.","review":"It arrived at my sisters as a gift and I am she she will love it.

I don't think the book was written with students particularly in mind, since (for example) there are no examples or problems in the book as typically found in university course work In his introduction, Agrawal says &quot;[t]he book is aimed for researchers already engaged in or wishing to enter the filed of nonlinear fiber optics.&quot; As the title suggests, the book's emphasis is on nonlinear effects in optical fibers, as opposed to nonlinear effects in bulk materials.The first chapter is pretty basic, and is mostly review material that describes things like the index cross section in an optical fiber, material issues, fabrication, chromatic dispersion, modal birefringence (which leads to polarization mode dispersion), non linear refraction and stimulated inelastic scattering. The review here is pretty brief (the chapter has only about 25 pages).Chapter two develops the mathematics of wave propagation in optical fibers, including the mathematics of mode propagation and basic propagation equations derived from Maxwell's equations. This chapter actually develops several different differential equations; each based on various assumptions applicable to different pulse widths. These differential equations then form the basis for later investigations into various non-linear effects discussed in the book. Chapter two is thus a foundational chapter and should be read and understood completely before moving on. There is a brief discussion at the end of the chapter that describes numerical methods.Chapter three describes group-velocity dispersion, including chromatic dispersion as well as dispersion-induced pulse broadening and higher-order dispersion and their implications for optical systems.Chapter four introduces self-phase modulation and self steepening.Chapter five describes optical solitons (including fundamental and higher order solitions), soliton lasers, and soliton-based communications systems.Chapter 6 describes some techniques for optical pulse compression using gratings and chirped optical pulses. It also describes soliton-effect compressors.Chapter 7 is devoted to the subject of cross-phase modulation, chapter 8 to stimulated Raman scattering, chapter 9 to stimulated Brillouin scattering, and chapter 10 to parametric processes, including four-wave mixing, parametric gain, and phase matching.The book is quantitative, making (as you'd expect in a graduate text) liberal use of mathematics. The level of mathematics, however, should be well within the grasp of senior college students majoring in physics, engineering, or mathematics. The subject, however, is non-trivial, and you should expect this book to present a real intellectual challenge in reading and understanding all the details. I took about six months to finish the book, including time taken to fill in some details in the derivations and to plot some of the equations on my computer.Agrawal makes good use of figures and illustrations, which I found particularly helpful. The book also has an adequate index that makes the book more valuable as a desk reference.Each chapter cites a wealth of reference material in the literature so that any subject covered within its pages can be studied in more detail and from the original sources.I would not make this a first study of nonlinear optics (although it was for me). Rather, I'd look for texts that discuss nonlinear effects qualitatively, and I'd try to expose myself to experiments that illustrate these nonlinear effects to gain a more qualitative understanding before diving into Agrawal's mathematical derivations. With a more qualitative basis first acquired, however, Agrawal's book is an invaluable tool for understanding the most obscure nonlinear effects in optical fibers."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Fiber Optics (Optics and Photonics)","review":"There are so many careless errors in the most important equations in this book. Some plots are wrong too. Some claims are ungrounded.Not for entry level. For expert who already knows this stuff and who can easily spot his errors. Otherwise you will be so confused and almost wanted to kill yourself after sitting there staring at those erroneous equations.

My professor also agrees somehow with me that this book needs to be revised."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Fiber Optics (Optics and Photonics)","review":"This book is the first and foremost reference book on many aspects of nonlinear fibre effect. It is written for non-experts in fibres but is also an invaluable resource for those who are.It starts off with a quick review of linear fibre characteristics (dispersion, loss, fabrication) and devotes a chapter each to a systematic study of how dispersion without nonlinearity and nonlinearity without dispersion affect pulse propagation. Higher order nonlinearity and dispersion are also covered.From this introduction, the problem of having both nonlinearity and dispersion present is introduced, leading to solitons. This treatment does not go deeply into the algebraic solution of the NLS equation, but gives a good background of the properties of solitons.Several other topics are covered which span a broad array of important nonlinear phenomenon in optical fibres under active research. This seems to be the book to buy if you need to know about solitons and other nonlinear effects, and is continually referenced."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Fiber Optics (Optics and Photonics)","review":"I'm absolutly sure that everyone can find something useful in this book, no matter who you are - a novice in this subject or well experienced researcher in optics.This book is also useful as a reference book on nonlinear effects.

I've used the simple drawings to make charts, flashcards, games, etc. to accompany thematic units and have even used a few of the worksheets to review basic concepts with older kids. I'm giving the book a four instead of a five because the unit topics are quite basic.

Anscombe is herself is an accomplished philosopher and respected Wittgenstein commentator.This short work (although longer than the Tractatus) discusses Wittgenstein's early thoughts on a range of concepts pertinent to understanding the Tractatus, e.g. formal logic, language etc. In looking at Wittgenstein she examines his work in light of his contemporaries Frege and Russell. From my perspective, given the austereness of the Tractatus, this latter point is particularly important to understanding Wittgenstein (in many ways he represents the culmination of their work in logic). Without some historic context (perhaps even with it) the Tractatus can seem pedantic.Despite its strengths, however, I think that Anscombe's text offers little for the non-expert Wittgenstein reader. To improve it in this regard a limited discussion of late nineteenth century idealism may be helpful - given that the extreme analytical approach taken by Frege and company seems in part a reaction to Hegelian idealism. Wittgenstein can seem almost impenetrable and times and a guide to his work can be helpful. Unfortunately, in this effort Anscombe is as opaque as the master and provides limited assistance.Overall, Anscombe's work is a solid commentary. I do not think, however, that it offers much to the reader who is not versed in Wittgenstein thought. From my point of view, Russell's introduction to the original English translation of the Tractatus is much superior in situating the work for the uninitiated."},{"Title":"An introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus (Hutchinson University Library: Philosophy)","review":"Throughout most of his adult life, Wittgenstein flirted with conversion to the Catholic faith. Don't read the Tractatus and fall into the naive trap of logical positivism. Wittgenstein was above all concerned with fighting the modern, secular worldview and promoting a religious one.

Author Carl Van Doren presents a rich and detailed portrait of Franklin - printer, writer, philosopher, scientist, inventor, politician, statesman, and one of the founding fathers of the United States of America.By tracing the major influences on Franklin, and the key events of his life, Van Doren presents this self-educated genius as the apotheosis of the 18th century &quot;Enlightened&quot; man. Imbued with an insatiable intellectual appetite, a keen scientific mind, a high sense of morality, and a fervent patriotism, he was shrewd, wise, witty, and always confident in his own limitless abilities. The author describes in detail the great events of Franklin's life - his youth and young adulthood as a printer and writer of Poor Richard's Almamack; the philosopher, scientist and inventor of note; Postmaster General for Pennsylvania, and later for all the colonies; representative of the American colonies to Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution; signer of the Declaration of Independence; U.S. Ambassador to France after the Revolution; and signer of the U.S. Constitution.As good a biography as this is, &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is also outstanding history. Van Doren skillfully &quot;paints&quot; Franklin's portrait against the backdrop of the tremendous social ferment, scientific awakening, and tumultuous political events which occurred during the second half of the 18th century. I gained not only a fuller understanding of Franklin's life and great genius, but also a greater appreciation of the times in which he lived.&quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is written with grace, clarity and obviously great scholarship. Winner of the 1959 Pulitzer Prize for biography, it is a brilliant masterpiece - one of the best biographies of any person I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"My summer project was to read biographies of our Founding Fathers. I was not looking forward to this rather daunting book and have never been so completely turned around on a subject. Van Doren masterfully handles an immense amount of factual information in such a way that makes this biography read like a novel. I love Ben Franklin! Thank you Carl Van Doren."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"Van Doren's biography of Franklin is nothing short of remarkable. While the author may be faulted for the near veneration of his subject, Franklin's continuing reputation supports the author's obvious admiration of Franklin. Franklin's life is reviewed from start to finish almost as a metaphor for the 18th Century enlightenment, the early colonlial life in America, the beginnings of the industrial revolution, the decadence and decline of British Imperialism, as well as the making and maturation of a true genius and renaissance man. Parallel with the swiftly changing account of the myriad activities of Franklin is the story of a truly fine human being; a man whose essentially humble and self deprecating nature belied his strength of character and integrity. Anyone who reads this book will come away awed by this unique individual and the question: Where are the Franklins of our time?"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"1991 Penguin Books reissue of 1st edition (1938), 862 pages (of which 782 pages form the main body of the book).I read this book because of Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner). Benjamin Franklin is the man Charlie Munger admires and has attempted to emulate most. Franklin's autobiography was one of the twenty books Munger recommended at the back of the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (the most useful book I have read). After reading Franklin's autobiography I was very interested to learn more about him - which I'm sure was Munger's intention. Thus I was led to this biography (one of two on Franklin that Munger has recommended), which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939. I chose to read Van Doren's before Walter Issacson's newer \`Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,' as I liked the idea of being able to see what new material might have been discovered since 1938.With each of the large biographies I have read over the last year, I have found it has taken quite a lot of reading before I really got into the book. This one was no different. It was only when I was about half way through, reading about Franklin's activities dealing with the appalling British government/monarchy in the run up to the American War of Independence, that I found myself gripped. That may have something to do with me having already read Franklin's autobiography, which was the main source for the early part of Van Doren's book (as the author said: \`Plenty of other men could find materials for the story of his latest years. Only he had known about his obscure youth...').I suspect another significant reason was that up until roughly that point there was very little information on what Franklin was actually like and how he spent his days (as opposed to things he had done or places he had been). Without this information I find it difficult to mentally associate or connect with the subject. This is one of the two key areas of weakness I identified in Van Doren's otherwise admirable book and is also the reason why I preferred Ron Chernow's biography of Rockefeller, Titan to Joseph Frazier Wall's biography of Andrew Carnegie. From about halfway through Van Doren's book we do get very interesting snippets, from Franklin himself and also from other people, about what Franklin was actually like (on pages 405, 419, 521, 600 & 649/650, in particular). I wish there was more, but perhaps the material was simply unavailable.The second weakness was in the account of Franklin's finances. Franklin became quite wealthy through his printing activities before he left business and went to Britain. At sixty years of age, after many years of easy living and generosity, he found himself with money worries. His most important business partnership ended in 1766, depriving Franklin of a significant proportion of his income. He was also concerned that he might lose his position at the post office around the same time. Though this did not happen and he was actually appointed as agent to three further states, I was rather surprised that Franklin left a significant financial legacy when he was close to being hard up a little over twenty years before his death.He did not appear to live frugally for the latter part of his life and so I am not sure where the funds came from. I would much have preferred it if this apparent paradox had been resolved. It seems of particular importance here, as Franklin was a man who preached the gospel of frugality, but also said: \`frugality was \\"a virtue I never could acquire in myself.\\"'I suspect that Van Doren was correct when he said of Franklin: \`That he talked about them [industry and frugality] so much made it clear that they came less from his nature than from his discipline.' So, after frugality had served its purpose he perhaps left it behind (though long held habits almost always leave a residue).With those caveats, Van Doren's biography of Franklin is an impressive piece of work. I am not surprised that \`The final writing of the book called for almost daily use of the New York Public Library over a period of two years.' And that \`This book, full as it is, is a biography cut with hard labour to the bone.' The difficulty (as well as the interest) in writing a biography of a truly extraordinary man like Franklin was that he was extraordinary in many different areas. He was a successful businessman, an absolutely pre-eminent scientist and philosopher, as well as a remarkable and successful statesman (and that in a place and era when rank by birth was of paramount importance).I am not paid for them and so write these book reviews primarily for myself. I thus like to include the most important things I have learned and that I wish to retain and include into my life and conduct. In this case - because of the subject - there are far too many to include here. And that is surely the reason why Franklin is Munger's biggest hero: he was not only successful but he was also wise, generous and benevolent with it. Unlike Rockefeller, for example, he seemed to really enjoy his life. And unlike Carnegie, who appeared to fail Solon's warning (I might rather call it Taleb's warning, as that is where I learned it) to Croesus to call no man happy until he is dead.I do not wish to be happy because I have a distorted view of reality, but because I have seen the world as it is and can accept it. Franklin's life is thus a message of hope: he saw the world with exceptional clarity and was able to love it anyway."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"Van Doren's biography, long the definitive biography of Franklin, is rich in detail (sometimes exhaustingly so), yet accurately portrays the life of this fascinating multi-faceted man. From the statesman's humble beginnings in Boston, to his journeys to Philadelphia and ultimately abroad, Franklin is seen in very human terms, yet within the rich tapestry of the historical period.The author's style is typical of many historians of the 1930's, very linear, precise and detailed with a wealth of background information on every facet of Franklin's life. This may be a difficulty for many readers; the book is so comprehensive that many will be put off by its sheer volume. I found myself reading the book in starts and stops, only because of my personal time limitations. After the first 400+ pages, I found myself skipping over sections to get to portions of Franklin's life I found more fascinating. Fortunately, Van Doren's writing is such that one can do this without any significant loss of continuity."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"This remarkable, scholarly, and readable book brings the reader face-to-face with what seems an impossible life. The usual picture we get in school is intriguing, but here we meet a man whose range is staggering. Franklin the young, self-educated adventurer, writer, apprentice. Franklin the printer, entrepreneur, community activist. Franklin the pioneering scientist, delegate, historical visionary. Franklin the publisher, the spy, the sometimes invisible hand steering the birth of the modern republic. The inventor of a musical instrument that Mozart and others composed for. The outrageous wit who shocked Abigail and John Adams. Franklin the friend, free-thinker, and moralist. Creator of the stove, the lightning rod, the watertight compartment for ships' hulls. The first to understand how weather systems move, and ocean currents, and continents. Designer of roadways to connect the colonies and then the nation. Richly incorporating excerpts of Franklin's own voluminous writing, Van Doren's account is clearly factual, yet appropriately awed and inspired by a man \\"unsurpassed . . . in the range of his gifts or the important uses to which he put them.\\""},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"Sure, this book was written before my parents were born, but it seems to stand the test of time very well. If I hadn't checked the copyright date when I bought it, I might have thought this worek had been published only recently. The detailed information the author provides is fascinating and is presented in such a way that it avoids clouding the writing or boring the reader. One gets a feel not only for what Franklin did, but for what sort of man he was. The author is sympathetic to the object of his study, but not to the point where it becomes distracting. All in all, a wonderful read which contains an immense amount of fascinating information."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"I'm a big Van Doren Bio fan, and a bigger Ben Franklin fan. Carl captures the essence of the scoundrel Franklin. This is a bigger than life, juicy life. I almost don't recognize the Ben I learned about in school. The dried up old husk of a man who was part of that long ago effort to free our nation. Read this and laugh at the ways Franklin manipulated and succeeded against many odds."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"After reading &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, he would be the one person -- dead or living -- who would make the most fascinating dinner guest for an evening. His list of accomplishments is practically endless: printer, writer, philosopher, postmaster general, inventor, scientist, diplomat, statesman, traveler, and conversationalist. The majority of people who are ultimately successful have a key talent in one area, focus on that talent, and rise to the top. It is so inexplicably rare to find someone of such vast talent who also excels in all his (her) talents. Benjamin Franklin was such a gifted individual and, thankfully for our nation, focused much of his energy and time into serving the public. Carl Van Doren has written an incredibly well-researched biography of one of our key founding fathers. Van Doren's style can sometimes be dry and too academic, but keep in mind that this book was initially published in 1938. Today's reader may expect a more conversational tone and faster moving story. However, Carl Van Doren's biography is heroic in its effort and the author's admiration clearly shines through for Mr. Franklin."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"With this hefty tome, Carl Van Doren succeeds in authoring a compelling biography equal to the intellectual scope and achievement of his subject, Benjamin Franklin. The title 'renaissance man' was perhaps never more aptly bestowed than on Franklin, whose pursuits ranged from printing to (most famously) electricity to temperature patterns and ocean currents to politics.Following the sweep of Franklin's advancing renown, first in the United States and then in Europe, the narrative never descends to a mere recounting of the man's many achievements (though this would undoubtedly make for fascinating reading in its own right). Rather, Van Doren devotes substantial attention to the greater social context in which Franklin works; in particular, the thread of family life in Philadelphia and later in France helps to anchor the broadening pace of his scientific and political thought, culminating in the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the establishment of republican government in America.Fittingly, the treatment of Franklin's death sounds only the faintest of elegiac tones. Van Doren recognizes the triumph of Franklin's life in the contributions to science, philosophy, and politics that would long outlive the man himself.A must-read."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"In my many years studying the history of our great nation and others, a carelessness of sorts followed my endeavors on Benjamin Franklin. As I finally considered closely examining the great philosopher/politician's life and accomplishments, I set out to find something written from a point of view somewhat unbiased yet informative. Carl Van Doren's accomplishments here should be considered in a manner befitting high esteem by any colleague serious enough to take the time out to comprehend his work. The facts of Franklin's life are grounded in traceable formatting, generously unbound with a sense of Mr. Van Doren's recurrent commitment to uphold a standard sometimes arguably overlooked by today's historians. Although I would have enjoyed added information on Franklin's later Constitutional convention involvement, enough was presented to obtain the idea of his role in shaping our important beginning. You will not be disappointed if you were to add this fine book to your collection."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"I read Franklin's Autobiography years ago and loved every word. Now my interest led me to Van Doren's work and a truely wonderful book. Filled with Franklin's whitty quotes and substantive research, Van Doren gives you a great book packed full of interesting facts and a great view of history. It is a very long book, as the preface tells you in its first line, but a page turner which reads quickly and envelopes you into Franklin's life. One of my favorite biographies I have ever read."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"As I get around to it I read Pulitzer Prize winners and when I came across this one I decided to read it, tho Franklin did not seem too interesting to me when I first learned about him in 4th grade.

He was a great man, and the most famous American of his time."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"I have not read Cabel's bio from 1918 on Franklin but this one by Carl van Doren might be the best. I tend to discount autobiographies as they tend to be highly partisan & even revisionist. The version Franklin's autobiography I read, & there seems to be dozens of them, was fairly modest.This is a whole life biography & is taken in large part from Franklin's own writings, letters to from & about Franklin. The unabridged audio version was a real treat & the amount of research must have been staggering, considering it was written in the thirties.This is a very through book. Where it treads lightly, whole books have been written. That is Franklin's lovers & the numerous children from these liasons, mostly in France. Mr. Van Doren is skeptical, keeping in mind when this book was written. Franklin loved woman & woman loved him but not nessarily in that way. He had many friends & \\"daughters\\" refering to his many, young female admirers. He keeps the wise grandfatherly image I had of him. In fact he was a neglectful husband & an absentee father to his own daughter deserting his wife during all those years overseas.There is so much to him, a true citizen of the world. He was a self-made wealthy merchant, inventor, scientist, philospher & statesman. The title he was most proud was master printer, an individual who started from nothing. He had many roles in life & van Doren covers them all.His most important years were spent in England & France. He loved London & Paris. He may have been tempted but he was always loyal to America, keeping her interest in mind. He was the face of America in Europe. He played the part expected of him; a rustic American philospher with a fur hat & was all the rage in the royal court of France.The colonies were fortunate to have Franklin in England before the revolution & France during & after. That is where with, Franklin's connivance, the major decisions concerning America were being made.His accomplishments ranged over various disiplines, as the inventor of the lightening rod, the Franklin stove used for heating, bifocals etc. He founded the first public library & fire department in America. He was the major contributor to the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. A document way ahead of its time, was a useful reference during the constitutional convention in 1789. He assisted Thomas Jefferson with key phrases in the Declaration of Independence. He was important in reaching consensus when the U.S. Consititution was being drafted.Had he stayed in Philadelphia, he may simply have remained a popular, loyal, prosperous printer & businessmen. He saw first hand the disdain King George III had for him & the colonies. To him America was merely a source of taxes without the rights accorded to all free Englishmen. This & the humiliation he suffered at the hands of British Parliment, turned him into a uncompromising (for one of the few times in his life) rebel. With his patience, gentle diplomacy, wisdom & sense of fairness, America was well served. With apologies to Washington who never left North America & Jefferson, Franklin may be the greatest founding father.While writing this review it occured to me that there are many similarities to Winston Churchill. Franklin was not a warrior as Churchill was but both men were visionaries & peace makers. Both were geniuses & prolific writers on any number of subjects. They were both statesmen & active in public service to a very old age. Both men dominated the times they lived in.Read or listen to this fine book, then move on to other newer biographies. They all add somthing to this remarkable man."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin,","review":"I loved this book. A great picture of Franklin throughout his life. Political, scientific and personal history."},{"Title":"American Palestine: Melville, Twain, and the Holy Land Mania.(Book Review): An article from: Leviathan","review":"American Palestine: Melville, Twain, and the Holy Land Mania is a strong and insightful study that sheds light on an important geographic-cultural landscape that shapes American culture. By focusing on the ideological construction of late Nineteenth-century Palestine in the American imagination, Obenzinger shows that this imagination contains much more than meets the eye of those who only look at the domestic spaces of Melville and Twain. Both writers traveled to Palestine, and the texts they produced about these experiences have been deeply and intimately related to their perceptions of, and contributions to, U.S. national culture, which has been obsessed, as the book so persuasively shows, with images and beliefs about &quot;the Holy Land.&quot; Obenzinger writes beautifully about Melville's melancholic and Twain's humorous treatment of Palestine and its significance for U.S. culture."},{"Title":"American Palestine: Melville, Twain, and the Holy Land Mania.(Book Review): An article from: Leviathan","review":"I expected more from Hilton Obenzinger's book American Palestine. Though there are nuggets that can be mined about 19th Century American fascination with the Holy Land in this book, Obenzinger seems to be more enthralled with literary theory and jargon than with a straight forward analysis of Mellville's poem and Mark Twain's travelogue.Mr. Obenzinger seems to know his American history; but, he seems to want to make the argument that Zionism is an American phenomena linked to Christian yearning for the second coming of Christ. The roots of Zionism predate the nineteenth century. Modern Political Zionism finds its roots in Classic Liberalism's failure to protect Jews with the rise of modern anti-semitism (Anti-semitism being a term coined in the latter half of the 19th century. Vienna had the honor of electing the first mayor who campaigned on an Anti-Semetic platform.) In effect, Modern Political Zionism was a Jewish response to the rise of European nationalism. He gives too much credit where credit is not due weakening the thrust of his entire argument.I was surprised that Mr. Obenzinger did not try to deconstruct Melville's poem's title Clarel where one may argue that it may mean Brightness of God, Clearness of God, God's Famous and then relate it to the text.I was not surprised that Mr. Obenzinger had to analyze Twain's humor. Something is lost on the way.Overall, it seems that Mr. Obenzinger wishes to make the claim that he understands Mellville and Twain better than they understood themselves. I leave that to the verdict of the readers. For me, I have my doubts."},{"Title":"Dolphins into the Future","review":"This fabulous and deeply satisfying book is about exploring dolphins on an energetic level, rather than from a distant scientific standpoint. She did not do controlled scientific studies of such things as social behaviors and sounds. Instead she has become a dolphin. Her own wonderful sensitivities to energy, wordless communication, and connections with all &quot;peoples,&quot; human and non-human, have enabled her to make a huge contribution to the answers many of us are seeking: Who are the dolphins? Why are they here? Why do we like them and why do they like us? And what can they teach us? Joan Ocean's dolphin friends are thirsty to share with us levels of awareness that most people don't know exist, yet experiences of these levels will help us move joyfully into the energetic changes that are occuring on earth."},{"Title":"Dolphins into the Future","review":"Joan Ocean is a wonderful writer, and she has had countless extraordinary experiences with dolphins, swimming in the open ocean with them in Hawaii. This is her second book about those experiences (the first was The Dolphin Connection), and it delves deeper into the mystical connection that people feel when they swim with dolphins. Joan's open-hearted relationships with the many dolphins she meets in the water give her direct access to the spiritual information that they send her psychically. The dolphins' wisdom and Joan's own visionary insights give the reader a front row seat to interspecies communication and interdimensional travel beyond the time/space continuum. This is a fascinating book, and the experiences Joan has with the dolphins are very real. I've swum with Joan and the dolphins several times and have had many of those experiences myself. Great book!Peggy Korneggerauthor of Living with Spirit, Journey of a Flower Child"},{"Title":"Getting Even (Harlequin American Romance No. 313)","review":"I read many of the Beverly Sommers books when they came out (Outside In, Losing It) and she has a fun, unique voice. This one feels like a predecessor to the Chick-Lit craze that has since swept publishing. Dumped by her cheating husband, our heroine is forced to move into a single room (with a shared bath and kitchen) while swinging between plotting revenge and moving on with her life. All the characters feel wonderfully real, which is one reason the heroine isn't always romance-novel likeable... something else this book shares with a lot of Chick-Lit. But that said, it's a truly satisfying plot, and by the end the heroine's journey is no less tha empowering. Great read!"},{"Title":"Bible questions answered","review":"Serious students of the Word of God will find some answers to their questions in this well-researched book. Pettingill goes to the original sources and puts things into the proper context in examining the \\"difficult\\" questions not found in a super-level reading of the Bible. Pettingill's strength is when he sticks to what he knows. In places where he asserts his personal interpretations, I disagree. A discerning reader will be able to pick up on when that occurs.A sampling of the insights he provides include: The fact that \\"God\\" is originally \\"Elohim\\" in Genesis when the plural is used about \\"Us\\" creating man in our own imagine and the plural form indicates more than two (i.e., Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) (p. 19). An explanation on the earthly genealogies of the Lord Jesus in Matthew and Luke is clarified and explained on pages 40 and 41. Pettingill explains what the unpardonable sin is on page 61.There are numerous other passages examined thoroughly throughout this book. Anyone interested in learning more about the meaning contained in Scripture will benefit from Pettingill's scholarship. His contribution endures from one generation to the next."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},q={key:1};function L(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(B,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-56dbf497"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/53.md","filePath":"drive/53.md"}'),F={name:"drive/53.md"},R=Object.assign(F,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{D as __pageData,R as default};
