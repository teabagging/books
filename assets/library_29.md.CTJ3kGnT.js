Forester's characters aboard His Majesty's Frigate the Indefatigable are unforgettable. The hero, Horatio Hornblower, seems like a realistic character. He has faults and makes mistakes...he is also a young 17 year old eager to please.The entire series is exciting reading, but this title is my number one pick. The adventures of Horatio Hornblower are well worth reading! Order it today!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"In CS Forester's first book of the now famous HORATIO HORNBLOWER series, the resourceful hero acquires his sea legs--plus the respect of some of his superiors and peers. Young, unpredictable, quick to anger and self-reproach, he grows to love the life of a seaman in majesty's 18th century service. When not outsmarting the Frogs or the Dons, HH dazzles seasoned naval officers with incredible daring and brazen foolhardiness--which often succeed! Although a raw youth of 17, he learns to swallow his pride as he metes out his own self-punishment--in rough and ready maritime morality.Forester points out the benefits of linguistic skills, as his hero is pitted against a pompous French captain and a wily Spanish Don. His adventures in this debut novel run the gamut of foreign intrigue, shipboard politics, and naval life in general--all served up with an extra measure of human nature. Thanks to Forester's remarkable knowledge of the maritime milieu, the entire series offers readers great details about various types of ships, national differences on the high seas, and the inevitable internal and foreign affairs. An underlying theme emerges re the responsibility and fitness of those in command. This is one delightful swashbuckler which will appeal to boys (and women) of all ages! Set your sights on Adventure!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"In this book Forester truely shows of his genious in written and especially describing characters.

Maybe it isn't a fair comparison.The story telling is good here, albeit a little sparse and hurried. But it doesn't immerse you in the world of Nelson like the O'Brian books do. It reads more like a TV screen play than a literary work. I am such a fan of the period that I will undoubtedly read the entire series.

I had never heard of Mr. Forester or these novels, and when they came recommended to me over a short period of time from several different sources, I picked up this, the first in the series chronologically (we meet a young Hornblower as he first joins His Majesty's Navy) and had a very good time reading it. The book is a collection of short stories which occasionally build on each other. The writing is blunt and to the point, the action fast paced, the life-lessons brutally self-apparent, but they are put together in a very entertaining manner which creates quite an enjoyable book.I would compare the book to a historically placed Clive Cussler novel, or perhaps even a more modern and quickly told version of James Fenimore Cooper's Leather-Stocking Tales.I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light-hearted, fast-paced adventure novel that doesn't weigh too heavily on the soul. I think this would be a great novel to read to/with kids.

For this specific book (Mr. Midshipman Hornblower). the editing was fine, and better than some cases of ebooks for which I've paid more. There were perhaps a dozen typos.

They did a good job on this one."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"GENRE: Historical Fiction (British Navy, during the Napoleonic Wars)SUMMARY: The series follows the main character, Horatio Hornblower, across his entire Naval career, from wet behind the ears midshipman, to his days as an Admiral, Lord and Commander in Chief of the Navy.When it comes to novels about \\"wooden ships and iron men\\", THIS is THE series that everyone is referring to. It is a true and timeless classic - the kind of book that you read, and re-read, and pass down to your children to read and re-read - or you can just cut to the chase and read it to them, in episodic fashion.Unlike most historical novels, the author appears to have gone to considerable lengths to get all his historical facts and naval/sailing terminology correct ... the result is a masterpiece in which you can really feel like you're there with the characters, with the winds howling, the decks tilting, and the guns roaring about you.I have a few tiny nits, but not big enough to warrant mentioning.This rip roaringly good yarn has earned my heartfelt praise - which is given neither lightly nor easily, I can assure you.A must read."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"These books are good fun, fine examples of adventure novels. The action is often quite exciting and the interest rarely flags. However, if one was to criticise the series then perhaps Forrester's characterisation could be questioned; Hornblower is the world's most popular/beloved man in these works, despite being a rather cold character. This stikes one as odd. However, perhaps the greatest reason that I am reluctant to unreservedly recommend this series is that O'Brian's &quot;Aubrey and Maturin series&quot; trumps Hornblower in every way, and can fairly be considered literature instead of adventure stories (a category to which Forrester's works must be confined). I simply can't be overly enthusiastic about Hornblower when I compare it to O'Brian's sparkling achievement. However, I very much doubt that a reader would be disappointed with Forrester's novels, especially perhaps the younger reader."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Well, I have been meaning to read this series of Hornblower books since I watched the series on AMC years ago. I remember the Gregory Peck version was pretty good. While waiting for the price of a few e-books to go down, I downloaded the first book in the saga. $6 ain't bad. It will not be the last of these Hornblower books.The Kindle version has some typos, but too many paper books do too. Editing is (has?) becoming a lost art(or publishers have gotten cheap) and people do not know how to use spell checkers and grammar checkers nor whether the checkers are right or wrong in the first place.I do like the book. I do like how Forester presents the action and I do like how Forester lets the reader into Hornblower's mind."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is a 1950 novel by C. S. Forester. It is, chronologically, the first book in the eleven-book Hornblower series, although Forester wrote it sixth. It reads and flows considerably more like a sequence of short stories than a novel. In 1794, the young Horatio Hornblower enters the Royal Navy as a midshipman. Britain is involved in military action against France and Spain (it is the dawn of the Napoleonic Wars), and Hornblower has adventures in and out of combat.The gawky, seasick Hornblower is an interesting character. He is intelligent, brave, and clever, but he is also extremely introspective, self-critical, and insecure, which makes him an unnecessarily harsh judge of himself, as he typically focuses on what he perceives as his cowardice and dishonesty. To a large degree, the way Forester handles and develops this character is what keeps things interesting.Forester's writing is not for everyone. He is short on the physical details of characters and rather long on the use of two hundred year old naval jargon. This latter gives his writing a profound ring of authenticity, although it may prove somewhat inscrutable at times to most twenty-first century landsmen. Mostly, though, the stories and dialogue flow coherently.With a collection of entertaining if largely unremarkable stories, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is a solid introduction to the Hornblower series for those desiring to read them chronologically."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is without a doubt one of the best novels I have ever read regardless of genre. My exposure to C.S. Forester's classic works was a little unorthodox. Unorthodox that unlike most books I have read I saw a cinematic adaptation before reading the novel rather then the other way around. The A&amp;E presentation was very good and entertaining and I new that these were books that I had to read and so I did.The book is stupendous. As another reviewer has stated the readability is very good. The book does not have the depth of Melville but is definitely not juvenile its prose or topics. The book introduces us to one Horatio Hornblower who spends the majority of the novel as a Midshipman aboard His Majesty's Frigate the Indefatigable. We follow Horatio for a few years in his journey from a novice with no confidence in himself and no experience as a leader and watch his maturation into a very resourceful and charismatic leader. Along the way we are treated to adventures all across the English Channel, Northern France, Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.The novels were written the mid 20th century and take place shortly after the French revolution. The novels are action packed and the prose, although dated, is to the point with few wasted words or tales. Much happens to young Horatio in this one novel. I heartily recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I liked this so much that I just bought books 2-4 for kindle. I will look forward to building on this first book."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I am obsessed with the entire Hornblower saga. I originally bought a set of paperback Hornblower Saga novels in about the mid-80s. Read them probably once every year since. In about 2009 I started a collection of early edition, hardcover Hornblower novels. Where I got copies without or with poor quality covers, I created covers and used library plastic protection for all of them. I now have a handsome collection standing between to halves of a square rigger model made into bookends!I started to collect an entire group of the novels in the more modern hardcover editions.

Very happy with them.Book was terrific and sent it on to a teenager to see if we can pry him away computer games."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This was not the first novel written in the Hornblower series, but is the first one chronologically, starting with Hornblower reporting for duty as a new midshipman (he gets seasick while at anchor in port). He has the good luck to receive a transfer to a frigate commanded by Pellew (a real legendary frigate captain). He distinguishes himself in a number of actions, commands and loses a prize captured by the frigate, commands a ship loaded with cattle, commands a boat attack on a Spanish galley, assists a senior captain during a Spanish raid with fireships, and is given command of a small courier vessel carrying dispatches, this last command leading to his capture.Overall, this is a good account of the varied duties that might be assigned to a junior officer. Readers are referred to the biography of Peter Puget for an account of a real officer.C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a fictional biography of Hornblower to fill in a family background, and provide some information on how a young man would receive his education and end up in the Royal Navy."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This is the start (biographically speaking) to the thrilling Horatio Hornblower series set in the British navy at the culmination of the Age of Fighting Sail two centuries ago. Here are 10 short stories that fill out the early background for the original Capt. Hornblower trilogy (Beat to Quarters, et seq.). Each story reveals a successive character-forming or -revealing stage in Hornblower's emergence from abject misery, through disaster, small success, and capture, to a leader with a passion for action. Curiously, however, we learn nothing of his family or who bought his way aboard ship.Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series may take you authentically deeper into the lives and concerns of able sailors and quarterdeck commanders, but no one's prose scintillates like Forester's. His writing is flowing, precise, colorful, and atmospheric. With stirring descriptions and flashes of humor, he leaves a tingle of pride in Hornblower's excellence and goodness amidst a harsh and butcherous, but passionate, world. (Dewey Lambdin's LEWRIE rather exploits and revels in it instead.) Far from the boys' adventure stories of a bombastic figure I once thought would be Hornblower, he is shy and insecure (until gripped by a brilliant battle madness), and enmeshed in real historical situations and events (although their larger political contexts during the French revolution may not be so clear as in, for example, Woodman's rather gray DRINKWATER series).The Back Bay pb edition is appropriately old-fashioned in appearance. It lacks any &quot;navigational aids,&quot; like ship diagrams or maps. Those who have finished Hornblower might want to keep an eye out for the vivid new series by Julian Stockwin entitled KYDD (and to avoid the new one by W.P.Mack). For the landsmen's view of the Napoleonic Wars there is, of course, Cornwell's outstanding SHARPE series."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This was the first Hornblower book I ever read, assigned to me in my Literature of the Sea class at the U.S. Naval Academy during my Third class year. I had a great time, and since then I've read both &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot; and &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;. This one has been my favorite so far (though the others are excellent as well). Ten excellent, consequent short stories that paint a picture of a 17 year old boy fresh out of prep school, thrust into battle almost immediately. Forester's style is excellent...by simply telling the story, he offers up the important lessons that Horatio must learn about command at sea. The way literature should be."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"It irks me to see people say a book isn't great literature, and then say, &quot;But...&quot; If a book excites you, if it entertains you, if it's well-written, well-constructed, then why isn't it great literature? Simply because it's an adventure novel? Please! Some of the best writing occurs in genres that get no respect because they aren't &quot;literary&quot; in the classical sense of the term. Well, Jane Austen's work was pop fiction in its day. Oh, don't get me started. Anyway, the entire Hornblower series is, imho, great literature because it meets the above criteria. Forester is great at crafting his books, and he offers more than just an adventure. Read these books! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Although they were written decades ago, C.S. Forester's Hornblower books rival the best of present-day historical fiction. I'm a big fan of current 90's style best sellers like 'The Triumph and the Glory' and 'War of the Rats', but classics are classics, and 'Mr. Midshipman Hornblower' is one. The storytelling is first-rate, the characters memorable, and the thematic appeal remains as strong as ever."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Forester's entire Hornblower series are first rate nautical adventure's that carry the reader along with well written prose and cracking plots.Horatio Hornblower, hero of Forester's series, is almost impossible to believe. Brave, handsome and a skilled seaman he is almost without flaw - a tendency to seasickness and constant self doubt are the two that make him human.This novel gives us the early maritime life of Hornblower, though not the first written, and we are introduced to a seasick, slightly miserable young man as he starts a naval career that will end many years (and novels) later with him reaching the pinnacles of the British Navy.The historical background of the Napoleonic wars throughout this and most of the other Hornblower novels is well played out and made me want to delve back into the history books to follow up on some of the slighter historical allusions. The same skill is brought to bear on all elements of life, struggle, battle and death in the British Navy of the time.I first read all these novels as an adult and enjoyed them. My nephew in his early teens, not a big reader, devoured the entire series in short order after I gave him this volume. We both wanted more and continue an unsuccesful search for another author of seafaring adventures who combines excellent writing, fine detail and constant action with the same skill as Forester.I would recommend this book to anyone from their early teens on who enjoys a good adventure story."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Maybe not best of the series, it is the first in the timeline and you may wish to read it first. It is set up as a series of short stories, so you can put it down and pick it up later, taking breaks between chapters without the 'flow' being broken. Hornblower is a amazing character, with both merits and some funny flaws, like getting seasick! His character is a balance between smarts and greed, fear of failure and a strong sense of honor. The books follow him as he goes up the ladder of command, each book's scope getting larger and the problems he faces becoming more and more complex.Other books you might enjoy, if you enjoy this series, is the 'Honor' series by David Weber (a sci-fi version of Hornblower, but pretty) and the large hardcover: Stephen Biesty's Cross-Sections Man-Of-War, which is great for understanding the ships and their crew. All the books, including the Hornblower books are something both young adults and older parents would love."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Chronologically speaking, \`Mr. Midshipman Hornblower' begins C.S. Forester's great age of sail naval adventure series, but was the sixth book when published 1950. Unlike Patrick O'Brian, Forester did not shy away from \`prequels' in his 11 book series. \`Mr. Midshipman Hornblower' is a collection of nine short stories that feature plenty of action, including the effect of water on a cargo of rice and a flotilla of fireships interrupting Horatio's lieutenant examination.By the way, both O'Brian and Forester based their stories in part on the real life adventures of Captain Lord Thomas Cochrane, the 10th Earl of Dundonald. Indeed, Cochrane led a fire ship attack on the French fleet anchored in Basque Roads on the west coast of France in 1809. O'Brian featured the use of fireships in more than one of his books, including one story that was clearly based on Cochrane's attack. O'Brian gave a much more detailed description of their use than Forester does.Readers interested in historical accounts may want to check outCochrane: Britannia's Sea Wolfand more generallyEvery Man Will Do His Duty: An Anthology of Firsthand Accounts from the Age of Nelson.Highly recommended. \`Mr. Midshipman Hornblower' is a good starting point in historical fiction for fans of the age of sail."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Reading CS Forester's Horatio Hornblower series is always great.

This is what happens to young Horatio Hornblower. For his own good and the good of England he is sent to serve on a frigate fighting France.

When reading Mr. Midshipman Hornblower you learn to feel for young Horatio. He is like a graceful and intelligent swan that has to glide across a rocky and uncertain lake. Through his successes you feel success, through his defeats you feel defeated. Teenagers learn how lucky they are that they did not live at the turn of the eighteenth century in England. C. S. Forester weaves a tale of daring, suspense, adventure and loyalty all through the eyes of a young man trying to work his way through the discipline of the Navy.

Similarly, look elsewhere for the symbolism and multi-layered thoughts that make Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot; such a rich source of inspiration. Forester is by no means an historian, nor can he reach the inspiring heights of Melville as a novelist.Nonetheless, Forester can not only spin an engrossing sea yarn but can also introduce us to young Hornblower in such a way that we really come to know him and look forward to following his career in the Royal Navy. To this landlubber, Forester's familiar use of nautical terminology, especially that which is relevant to the various accoutrements of a sailing ship, causes me mentally to falter from time to time, but the broader contextual meanings of his terms are never lost, and the story line is simply enchanting.Forester's entire collection of novels featuring the trials, tribulations, fears, doubts and successes of Hornblower as he rises from midshipman to lieutenent to captain and on up the hierarchy of officer-dom in the Royal Navy is a grand read for everyone with the least interest in adventure on the high seas. His is more mature reading than, say, &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; but it is nowhere near as &quot;heavy&quot; as the seafaring works of Melville or Conrad.

Forester lets his character develop here to grow the man that would command the books in his novel already written. Each story builds more of the &quot;hornblower&quot; way from decisive and caluclation action to his own judgement of himself which is always the harshist.

Later, when he realized that he hadcreated something bigger than himself, he went back and filledin Hornblower's earlier years.So, if you haven't read Hornblower at all, or if yourappetite for watery adventure has been kindled byThe Secret Ever Keeps, this might not bethe place to start. The novellas of which it is composed aredelightful, but not compelling. On the other hand, if you knowthat you are a sucker for naval warfare/Napoleonic Europe/BritLit/Boys at Sea, or if a taste of Patrick O'Brian and Cap't. Aubreyhas you searching for roots, and you suspect that you'relikely to get hooked-then by all means, take a leap of faithand watch the sophistication of the series develop along withthe character and the complexity of the application of English seapower.On the other hand, if you just want a truly great action-laden navalbang-'em-up, better read Beat To Quarters.--Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG, a novel about a female Hornblower."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This is the first Hornblower chronologically, it was not the first one written. Now that the series is completed it makes sense to read it as Hornblower's career progresses in the Royal Navy.The whole series is a pleasure to read full of action and adventure; with enough time for a little romance. This first outing is compressed of ten short stories that relate Horatio's first adventures at sea till he becomes a Lieutenant.This is not the best outing of the series but a great beginning to get acquainted with one of the most popular characters in modern literature.After reading this you will be back for more. And that is a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"After every movie about Horatio Hornblower, someone will askif anything was ever written about Hornblowers early life.This IS the start of it all. This book is typical for theauthor, detail and nothing going on and then absolute terror.Hornblower's attempt at suicide is not only sad but originaland the result of the attempt is classic. After you read thisbook, go on and read the rest of the Hornblower series. And ifthat is not enough for you, try Patrick O'brian. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"If you enjoy military nautical themes, then I recommend this historical fiction page turning book.

One can hear the creaking and moaning of the rigging. I was truly transported. The character of Horatio Hornblower enters the heart easily and Forester makes it impossible to guess what situation our hero will be involved in next. Everything is here: history, adventure and a good rollicking tale."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"No more need be said than the comment of Papa H on the cover of this first rate &quot;Book of the Line&quot; - The great one states &quot; I recommend Forester to every literate I know&quot;.

For technical accuracy and engrossing plots they can not be beaten."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"In response to the review of a reader from Palo Alto: &quot;an outstanding series for young boys&quot;, may I point out that this is an outstanding series for either sex. The majority of my colleagues, male and female officers of all the military services, enthusiastically agreed. Anyone who hasn't yet read the Hornblower saga can be assured that it will enthrall all ages. And both sexes. A desire for a naval career is not a pre-requisite."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Forester displays an unique talent for interesting details of the setting and action packed battle scenes. His stories include both historical and fictional information that enhance the reader's interest in the book while reading. The only downfall is that the book starts off a little slow and the reader may lose interest in the first few chapters. Be patient! The book develops further along and becomes very exciting. This book is a must read for anybody interested in the Napoleonic Wars and naval battles!!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I began the Hornblower series with this book. I recently completed 10 of the 11 novels in the Series. Having seen Gregory Peck as Hornblower and the BBC series, my imagination was fired with the images of Hornblower both as a young man and as and older, wiser gentleman. This book raised my interest in the rest of the series and completing the series has a certain regret about it. Like Cornwell's \\"Sharpe's Rifles\\" series it has some implausibilities and drag points but by in large it is an excellent read.I would comment on the a problem I have had with some kindle books. There seems to be a lack of good editorial control on many of them. Spelling errors and grammar problems pop up, inadvertently. I can accept the problem on books that are low cost and transcribed by volunteers. When you pay full price on books sometimes well above the $10 norm, you deserve professional editing."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"The \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" books cannot be beat for adventure, excitement, and historic depiction. These novels of the British navy during the Napoleonic wars depict a man of average, or even below average physical ability, who relies on his mind, struggles with moral issues, and wins through with courage and planning. Hornblower's success is often shown to stem from his productive activity -- his motto: \\"Do it now.\\" Interestingly, Hornblower thinks he is a coward, even while he illustrates the true nature of courage -- he is embarrassed for being afraid in the face of danger, even while he leads the way."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I just ordered &quot;Ship of the Line&quot; and &quot;Beat to Quarters&quot; along with the companion. This is one of the most enjoyable, page-turning series I have ever read! I read one of the books in a sitting and none so far has lasted more than a week. Like most of the other reviewers, I got started with the A&amp;E series. Do yourself a favor and get the companion from the start.Hornblower, without a doubt, reflects the personality traits of people I know-honorable, self-critical, confused, alternately depressed/ecstatic, reflective, etc. His vigorous actions and direct approach despite uncertainty is so refreshing! It is the epitome of the philosophy &quot;I'm not quite sure of exactly what to do, but moving forward with gusto beats the hell out of standing around!&quot; I have found myself laughing out loud on several occasions! Hornblower's characteristics reflect those of successful real-life naval officers I have known and read about.If you are looking for some enjoyable, accurate, and adventuresome reading, you're in for a good time! (I gave THIS book 4 stars, but some other books in the series are definitely 5.)"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I will admit I'm one of those who first watched the made-for-TV movies before reading the books, and am now catching up in chronological (by Hornblower's timeline, not publication date) order. Mr. Midshipman Hornblower was written quite a bit after Forester introduced our hero in Beat to Quarters, but most of the movies are based on the short stories collected in this volume, though rather different in detail.Unfortunately, as a collection of short stories, Mr. Midshipman is not as cohesive or as compelling as Hornblower's later adventures, and earns my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. However, it is pivotal reading into not only how Hornblower started his naval career, but how the lessons he learned as a midshipman forged him into the great leader of men he will become.One final recommendation (other than to buy and read this book and series) is to get a good reference of naval terms, since they fly thick and heavy throughout the books, and a reader ignorant of such terminology will get quickly lost in the action."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":". In Mr. Midshipman Hornblower By C.S. Forester, the main character is a young man named Horatio who is nineteen and is brand new to the British Navy right after the American Revolution. He is a midshipman who is recently out of school and the book is stories of how he moved up in the ranks. This book was pretty good.I would recommend this book because it reveals Horatio's life as you read. One time it tells you about how Horatio studied in France for a time in his teen years. And that he knows how to understand French; which helps him in a certain adventure where he has captured a French ship who has crew men who only speak French.Each story was a different adventure of Horatio Hornblower in the Navy and they are all exciting. One of these stories takes place on Horatio's first ship the Indefatigable which was full of midshipmen who never were able to move up in the ranks, and a sick captain. Because Horatio is so young, the other midshipman basically torture him. When the midshipman eat dinner the older officers make him answer questions and when he hesitates, one of the older officers hits Horatio's hand with a sword case. When he had enough of the torture, he challenged his superior officer to a duel. That is exciting because, you can see Horatio finally taking a stand for all the midshipmen who were being harassedIn conclusion, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower has great appeal to anyone who likes British Naval history, but even if you don't, you can still enjoy this book. Reading this book will make you want to read the rest of the series, which you will also enjoy that."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I have finally begun to read Forester's Hornblower series, starting chronologically with respect to the fictional world of course. This is one series I've been intending to read for quite some time, and I don't plan to stop with just the first book.As opposed to great and wonderful descriptions of naval battles, Forester uses a series of loosely connected short stories to acquaint the reader with the Hornblower character. Traveling from place to place, ship to shore, command to command, Hornblower is thrust into various situations which begin to define his command style and ability.I urge everyone who is looking for a good classic to read, begin reading the Hornblower series. A little fun fiction helps you out every now and then."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"When I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. Every word had to be savoured, it was such a brilliant book. It is about a young boy, Horatio Hornblower, who joins the Royal Navy in the fateful year of 1793, when Britain and France decvlared war on each other. Aboard the ship of the line Justinian Hornblower is seasick in 'calm' weather and gets mixed in a brutal duel, not caring if he lives or dies. Soon later, Hornblower is posted to a new ship, the Indefatigable, a large frigate under the command of Captain Sir Edward Pellew, one of the most famous officers of the navy. After encountering an enemy brig in the Bay of Biscay, Pellew sends Hornblower and four men to sail it back towards an English port. However, the brig, holed below the waterline in the encounter sinks, and Hornblower is captured by a French privateer. He deliberatly sets it alight when none other ship than the Indefatigable comes into sight. I don't want to spoil the book for you, but I would heavily recommend this historical novel by CS Forrester which leaves you speechless by the end, if you love a nice, long story about the live and battles of ships in the arly stages of the Napoleonic Wars.By Francis Newman, age 10"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Rather than review each book, I'll comment here on the entire series. Compared to other similar series (those of O'Brian, Kent, Pope, etc.), Forester scores at the top right along side O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin chronicle. The two series both revolve around the British navy in the Napoleonic era and take their fictional queues from Cochrane's real life exploits. The natures of the two main characters and the authors' styles of writing, however, are quite different. O'Brian's Aubrey is a loud, earthy, Falstaff of a character while Forester's Hornblower is a moody, self-doubting, self-conscious Hamlet flavored protagonist. O'Brian's writing is slightly more sparse (more fully modern in that respect), while Forester's style has a bit of old-fashionedness to it that perhaps gets one into the period better. As a slight criticism of Forester, it is obvious (as one reads the series in the chronological order of Hornblower's life) that the earlier books were written later. Primarily, this is apparent in finding Hornblower to be a more mature character as a midshipman and lieutenant than he is in later books. This is explained by suggesting that as Forester's knowledge of and familiarity with his creation grew he unconsciously wrote the more deeply known character into the later written/historically earlier volumes. At any rate, it does not significantly take away from the series - which is very good. I give it high marks: 4 stars (because that is how I ranked the O'Brian series and found them equally enjoyable); not 5 - I hold that in reserve, still hoping to find the perfect storm of British Naval fiction out there somewhere."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"While widely considered to be the first book in the Horatio Hornblower series, \\"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower\\" instead regarded as a collection of short stories, not to the latter. That small detail aside, \\"Midshipman Hornblower\\" was a great joy to read. I literally could not put the book down as I was soared through each storyline after another. Historical based stories are usually good fun to read since their not so tied down to actual events, they just take place during that time. That aside, I suppose I could relate to Horatio in the sense of the word, my being seventeen and all. Not that age counts in this fictional matter - two completely different centuries here after all-. Right off at the start, the description of the character himself would bleed sympathy out of you, I'm not kidding. Horatio starts off constantly seasick and the butt of everyman's joke's aboard the Justinian, especially the likes of a most unlikable character by the name of Simpson, who promptly make matters worse for the young Midshipman and the entire crew for that matter.Hornblower is described with a lack of confidence and does indeed contemplate suicide for a time (though I'm not entirely sure how this is connected with the Duel he engages in against Simpson), you only find yourself feeling worse for the \`lad.' But like any character of merit, he develops into a stronger character, that usually still doubts himself. Of course from that point on, Hornblower continues in its compelling stories the further you read. There were plenty of words --Ship lingo or otherwise-- that were quite foreign to me, like \\"polysyllables\\" and \\"Cutlass\\" to name a couple.I sometimes find old books hard to read and long in atmosphere. And while this book is no exception, thankfully the paragraphs and dialogue in the book were a breeze to read. I.E., the Author didn't go all philosophical in constructing the sentences. The description of the ships allow the vivid imagination to bring them to life, the \\"action scenes\\" were nicely described, they really get the excitement a little higher. The characters spanning beyond Horatio are in their own way, quirky and interesting, though I find reading their grammar a bit strange. All in all I enjoyed reading \\"Midshipman Hornblower.\\" I recommend this book to anyone looking for adventure with substance.

He has the good luck to receive a transfer to a frigate commanded by Pellew (a real legendary frigate captain). He distinguishes himself in a number of actions, commands and loses a prize captured by the frigate, commands a ship loaded with cattle, commands a boat attack on a Spanish galley, assists a senior captain during a Spanish raid with fireships, and is given command of a small courier vessel carrying dispatches, this last command leading to his capture.Overall, this is a good account of the varied duties that might be assigned to a junior officer. Readers are referred to the biography of Peter Puget for an account of a real officer.C.

Beautifully written."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I have no idea why why this book is so special to people. I read it because i was very bored, having no O'brian on hand. The book is made terrible by forester's choice of a main character. Hornblower is a despicable piece of scum. He is a coward. He has no sense of duty. He is the type of sniveling piece of scum that would harbor a grudge for years and kill you in your old age for having looked wrong at him. He gambles as a sort of profession. He absolutely despises himself. he contemplates suicide a bit. yes, very cheerful reading. he can only be brave because he must keep up his facade of an officer in his majesty's navy. If the real navy was made of sniveling spiteful scheming demented grudge-bearing cowards him like napolean would have had no trouble at all. Hornblower is the type of person that turns your mouth sour. I absolutely despise him even though he is fictional, and i don't plan on reading another of these books."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This is a very good book I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and sailing or fighting.

It's interesting how this series starts with the main character as a midshipman while the Aubrey novels start with the main character becoming a Post Captain. (I also loved all the Aubrey novels...)You can't go wrong with this book or with the entire series.If you know a reader who is about to get their hip replaced and who is going to need a lot of material to read, I can highly recommend this book. If they like it, buy them the whole series!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"The book introduces the a young seventeen-year-old Hornblower introduced to the harsh life of being a sailor and an officer at sea around the time of the Napoleonic wars. The book is divided into ten chapters which are each short stories in chronological order showing how Hornblower develops his skills as a sailor and leader aboard various vessels spanning around four years of his life. The stories are lively and the focus of the writing was made into moving the storyline by using action and putting the characters in danger or conflict at the cost of describing the scenery or the mindset of the characters, those things that bring a vibrant picture and emotion to the circumstances of the book. Also the book throws about nautical terms left and right as well as archaic dialogue that is usually not expected from a 20th century writer. But considering that the writer is Engish I can understand the elitist, forgive me for the accusatory overtones, approach towards the writing style in the dialogues. Just make sure you've got a reference source to look up nautical terms like mizzen, larboard, three bells in the forenoon watch, so that you don't get lost in the jargon. The book will be more satisfying and fun similar to learning a new language. If you like vivid descriptions of a story I would suggest an author like Bernard Cornwall. I remember his descriptions of the ships to be much more complete than Forester. This book is pretty good but yet this is the only the first book I've read in the series and not enough to judge whether it would merit reading the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I became entrapped by Hornblower 45 years ago. My bookshelf isn't complete (never has been) without a full set right there where I can get to them when the urge strikes to read them all again. Seems to happen every 2-3 years. I thoroughly recommend them for young and old."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"It would be impossible to call this great literature, but then again, I don't think that great literature is what Forester was aiming at when he wrote this. This book is, however, a real page-turner: fast-paced, action-filled, and realistic. I especially like the narrative style that Forester adopts: since Hornblower is only a midshipman, a strictly sequential narration of his service aboard the Indefatigable would likely be tedious. By writing the chapters as a series of relatively unconnected vignettes, Forester is able to skip the most of the monotony that characterized a junior officer's life and to produce a highly readable book. I wouldn't come to this book expecting to find higher truths about the Nelsonian navy or about life in general, but the book is rollicking good fun and certainly a cut above most of the pulp fiction that tops the bestseller lists nowadays."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman HornblowerC.S ForesterI read Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. It is a really good book in the genre historical fiction. It does a very good job at portraying history. This the book seems so real that some might mistake it for a nonfiction book.It takes place in the year is 1793, at the beginning of the Napoleonic wars. The main character, Horacio Hornblower, is a young midshipmen who has no naval experience. This book follows his first times on a ship from epic sea battles to thrilling duels to the death. The author's style of writing was good, but left to much to the imagination when he could have written about a grueling battle he simple said skirmish or fight or battle leaving out the blood and gore. His way of always putting Hornblower in the best place for suspense was unrealistic but flowed very well. It showed the mannerisms of the British navy and their emphasis on honor and discipline.I did like this book even though it seemed to drag some times. It was an interesting book that at some times I could not put down. I would rate this book a three out of five. It is a way for post World War II Britons to remember their past glory but to a present day reader it seemed boring at times. I may say that this book might be for older reader. But if you like this book then you may want to read Lieutenant Hornblower, Hornblower and the Hotspur and Hornblower During a Crisis since they are written by the same author and they follow Hornblower all though his naval life"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"To put my review in context I must say that this is the first Hornblower book I've read. I understand that it is chronologically the beginning of the Hornblower series, but the book was not written first. If I had read this particular book in the order it was released my review might be different; I don't know. Anyway, from the point of view of one who is new to this series I will say that overall I enjoyed the book.If you're expecting this to be one smooth flowing story you may be somewhat disappointed. I didn't know what to expect when I picked the book up and I ended up being pleased with what I read. This book is basically a collection of short stories illustrating Hornblower's accomplishments as a young Midshipman. It starts with the first time he sets foot on one of the King's vessels and continues on through various trials and tribulations a young Midshipman might expect.The book is written in chronological order, but each chapter is really its own story. Each Chapter has its own plot, its own setting, its own characters (with the exception that Hornblower is in them all), its own climax, etc. Some may see this as a negative, I view it positively.The action in this book is constant. But what is most intriguing to me is you are witnessing the birth of a great Naval Officer. In every chapter Hornblower learns something new about Naval Service and, more importantly, about himself. And you get to learn it all with him. This can only serve to improve the enjoyment you will derive when you continue reading the remaining books in this series.What I view as a slight negative in this book is there was not as much time spent in character development as I would've liked to see. I believe the purpose of the book was to develop Hornblower himself; but it's difficult to relate to characters you don't get to know.One example of this is Hornblower's Commanding Officer, Captain Edward Pellew. He's one of Great Britain's great heroes and in actual history lead the HMS Indefatiguable to be the most successful Razee Frigate in Britain's History. Perhaps he comes more into play in the following books, but I'd have liked to have gotten to know him just a bit more right from the beginning.But just to clarify, the development of these secondary and tertiary characters was not insufficient. O'Brian obviously had a plan and he executed it well. I just personally would've liked to see a bit more development in some of the other characters who I expect will have a significant role in the upcoming novels.In conclusion, if you are a fan of Naval History, Military History or just History in general, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend you get started on this series at your earliest convenience."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is a 1950 novel by C. S. Forester. It is, chronologically, the first book in the eleven-book Hornblower series, although Forester wrote it sixth. It reads and flows considerably more like a sequence of short stories than a novel. In 1794, the young Horatio Hornblower enters the Royal Navy as a midshipman. Britain is involved in military action against France and Spain (it is the dawn of the Napoleonic Wars), and Hornblower has adventures in and out of combat.The gawky, seasick Hornblower is an interesting character. He is intelligent, brave, and clever, but he is also extremely introspective, self-critical, and insecure, which makes him an unnecessarily harsh judge of himself, as he typically focuses on what he perceives as his cowardice and dishonesty. To a large degree, the way Forester handles and develops this character is what keeps things interesting.Forester's writing is not for everyone. He is short on the physical details of characters and rather long on the use of two hundred year old naval jargon. This latter gives his writing a profound ring of authenticity, although it may prove somewhat inscrutable at times to most twenty-first century landsmen. Mostly, though, the stories and dialogue flow coherently.With a collection of entertaining if largely unremarkable stories, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is a solid introduction to the Hornblower series for those desiring to read them chronologically."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is actually a series of short stories that chronicle the 18th Century (Napoleonic era) beginning naval career of C.

However it is the first in chronological order of Hornblower himself.All that said, this was a really good book. The first night, I read over 100 pages without stopping. It's really not a flowing story as much as a collection of short stories about the life of a particular midshipman in 1794.He is first stationed on a Line of Battle ship. CS doesn't really describe the ship much, but by what the surroundings seem to be like and the number of officers, I'd say she is a two decker of 74 guns or so. On this ship his life is one of misery until he gets a fair shake from the captain.On he goes to a frigate and the real adventures begin. Enough said, I don't like to tell the story. You can read it.This is a good book. Easy to read. Each chapter is 20 - 30 pages and tells an entire short story. They are unconnected stories(other than the characters and the ship)....

He is shown to be a vulnerable yet strong willed young man in may ways out of place aboard ship. Written as a series of separate seagoing adventures, Hornblower uses his wit and native intellegence to overcome seemingly hopeless situations on the high seas.

The plot is outstanding and it is well written, but it doesn't keep you reading like it should."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is without a doubt one of the best novels I have ever read regardless of genre. My exposure to C.S. Forester's classic works was a little unorthodox. Unorthodox that unlike most books I have read I saw a cinematic adaptation before reading the novel rather then the other way around. The A&E; presentation was very good and entertaining and I new that these were books that I had to read and so I did.The book is stupendous. As another reviewer has stated the readability is very good. The book does not have the depth of Melville but is definitely not juvenile its prose or topics. The book introduces us to one Horatio Hornblower who spends the majority of the novel as a Midshipman aboard His Majesty's Frigate the Indefatigable. We follow Horatio for a few years in his journey from a novice with no confidence in himself and no experience as a leader and watch his maturation into a very resourceful and charismatic leader. Along the way we are treated to adventures all across the English Channel, Northern France, Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.The novels were written the mid 20th century and take place shortly after the French revolution. The novels are action packed and the prose, although dated, is to the point with few wasted words or tales. Much happens to young Horatio in this one novel. I heartily recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Meet the young midshipman who will become the captain whom Gene Roddenberry used as a model for James Kirk. Well-written and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This is a well written adventure novel about a young man named Horatio Hornblower. He joins the navy as a Midshipman the lowest rank in the navy. The rest of the novel describes his exiting adventures such as destroying french ships and escaping spanish prisons. C.S. Forester's humorous and exiting stories shouldn't be missed by any reader"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Hornblower has captured my heart. There is just the right balance of elements in this book! A good read!!!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I instantly fell in love with the Hornblower saga through the wonderful series of A&amp;E movies (available on DVD). I thought I'd give the first Hornblower book a try but was rather disappointed. You won't find the nuanced, charismatic versions of Hornblower, Pellew, Matthews, Stiles, and other characters in this book; it turns out that much of what makes the films great is actually the work of the screenwriters and actors, not Forester.Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is simply a well-paced but psychologically shallow series of adventure yarns best geared towards young-adult readers. Don't expect serious, insightful nautical literature a la Conrad or Melville (and perhaps O'Brian) nor the rich characters of the Hornblower films. The book is fun for a breezy read, but you'll likely enjoy the movies much more."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This book is a collection of stories about the first three years of Horatio Hornblower's career in the British Navy. Over the coarse of the book, we get to see him become involved in a number of adventures during the early 1800's. He takes over a captured ship and helps with fights on other ships and forts among other adventures.Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this book. I really didn't like Hornblower's actions in the first story, and it took most of the book for me to get over that. The sailing terms could have used better explanations as well.Still, there were some entertaining moments in the book. I especially enjoyed the story where he went for his first test for the rank of lieutenant.I've heard enough positive things about the series that I will probably read the next one. But this book wasn't the engaging start to the series I expected."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Wonderful adventure at sea! I have seen some of the TV series and decided to read the books. A little hard to read sometimes with the slang and ship terms of the old world but still an exciting adventure."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This is a collection of short stories about Horatio Hornblower as a midshipman, and later an acting lieutenant. It is thus somewhat episodic, as several reviewers have already noted. I vaguely remember some of these stories from the A&E; series starring Ioan Gruffudd, which I watched on DVD about 5 or 6 years ago. I liked the stories enough to want to continue reading the series, and I look forward to installments with book-length plots and stories. Forester is a remarkably clear and lucid writer, but have a dictionary of nautical terms (or the Internet) handy as you read these stories, if you haven't recently brushed up on late 18th Century sailing terminology.I only wish that affordable hardbound volumes with the beautiful woodcut covers were available for other books in this series. Sadly, they aren't."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"New midshipman Hornblower endures bullying and self-accusations of cowardice at the start of his naval career, although his creativity earns praise from his captain and respect from the men.Probably the weakest of this justly-famous series. Forester does too much telling the reader how Hornblower is feeling, rather than showing. But the action storylines are wonderful, as are Hornblower's developing capabilities under Captain Sir Edward Pellew. And it's worth mentioning that the book is not nearly as depressing as the first of the Ioan Gruffudd Hornblower movies!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"\\"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower\\" is not the best Hornblower novel of the series, but it is the beginning of the series and a good place to start. This is really a number of short stories about Midshipman (later Lieutenant) Hornblower as he begins his commission first on the Justinian (a near-useless backwater ship in the Royal Navy) and later the Indefatigable, a dashing British frigate. The stories are told, for the most part, in the distant third person, and this takes some of the zip out of the prose. No matter, this is the beginning of the best series in all of naval adventure literature, and is well worth the reader's time. The second book in the series, \\"Lieutenant Hornblower\\" moves at a brisker pace and has better prose and for these reasons it is also not a bad place to start reading this series. In fact, that is what I did, and then I doubled back and read \\"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower\\" after I was thoroughly hooked.Highly recommended without reservation. RJB."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"My love of seafaring stories began withThe True Confessions of Charlotte Doyleas a young girl. I then discovered theMutiny on the Bounty (Back Bay Books), enjoyed it enough to readMen Against the Sea: A Noveland loved it anymore. I've seen the A&E; miniseries of Horatio Hornblower, and between my enjoyment of that production and love of the seafaring genre, I wanted to check out the Hornblower books.Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is the first book in the Horatio Hornblower series in terms of Hornblower's chronological age. It is a collection of 1 or 2 chapter stories of his midshipman years. It is from this book that the A&E; miniseries obtained the basic plots of the first four episodes. This book gives a very good feel for who Hornblower is, and each of the chapters is very well written in and of itself. However there are no direct connections between the various stories contained in this book, and so it has the potential to feel a bit disjointed.This book is the one I would recommend as the starting point, even if it was not the first one written. It begins at the beginning of Hornblower's story, and I think the foundation is critical to fully appreciating the later book ofHornblower : Beat to Quarters(the first written, but taking place when Hornblower is already an experienced captain). If you enjoy the individual stories, but don't like the format of this book, please do go on and readLieutenant Hornblower. It is a more typical cohesive narrative, and it's where I felt the real fun began."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Having only seen the recent television adaptation of these stories I was not sure what to expect.

I've read almost all of the books of the Hornblower series, and reread them again and again. This fictional narrative follows the life of English Naval officer Horatio Hornblower from his first post as a seasick Midshipman aboard HMS Justinian under the ailing Captain Keene through bold action after bold action while serving as acting lieutenant aboard HMS Indefatigable under the command of the noble Sir William Pellew.

This beautifully written series of novels is a must read for anyone who either: likes action/adventure stories, enjoys learning about history, gets happily engrossed in emotion-charged romance, appreciates beautiful writing, or has a fascination with the sea and things nautical. If you are a person who likes all of the above in your reading, then by all means get online right now (or go to your book seller) and buy the entire series of Hornblower novels, and start with the first one, \\"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower.\\" These are books worth reading and a collection worth having."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This first Hornblower book that Forester wrote was BEAT TO QUARTERS, and that is still arguably the best Hornblower book to read first (though not the best in the series). Because MR. MIDSHIPMAN HORNBLOWER comes first in the saga's timeline, though, many readers start here and unfortunately do not get Hornblower at his best point of entry. The pacing of this collection of stories simply does not grip the reader as well as that of the novels. I'm sure they worked fine when published individually in the popular magazines of the day, but when clutched together like this, an awkward lack of fluidity results.That said, MR. MIDSHIPMAN HORNBLOWER is still an excellent book, rich with fascinating incident and detail, and anyone who has started the series will certainly read it -- the whole series is just too good! Certainly by the last episode in this book, quite a long story, the young Hornblower has gotten into the thick of it and you have begun to find out (if this is indeed where you've come in) just why Forester continues to be held in such high regard by generation after generation of readers.Another important point is that MR. MIDSHIPMAN HORNBLOWER is the material from which the recent A&amp;E series took its inspiration, and you do owe it to yourself if you saw it on TV to read the book and find out why and how that pivotal duel *really* happened. Be prepared to learn that C.S. Forester's plot turns were considerably more dramatic and thought-provoking than the hash (though admittedly watchable hash) made of them for TV consumption.Incidentally, this paperback edition is lovely. The woodcut-style cover artwork looks really nice, and the pages and typeface being about the same size as a hardback edition make handling it and reading it a special pleasure"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"For those of you getting started with this series, here is the series order (hey, we need to know this in order to buy the darn books!): Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, Lieutenant Hornblower, Hornblower and the Hotspur, Hornblower During the Crisis, Hornblower and the Atropos, Beat to Quarters, Ship of the Line, Flying Colours, Commodore Hornblower, Lord Hownblower, Admiral Hornblower in the West Indies. The other titles you'll see are different 3-in-1-cover combinations of the above titles, though not always in series order (go figure), Cadet versions of the same titles above by different titles (REALLY go figure), and companion books. There IS one omnibus, so I'm told, with some short stories in it that fall chronologically somewhere in the time span covered by the first three books, but I don't know any more than that yet."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"The 'Hornblower' novels by C. S. Forester are all consistently entertaining and fun, but the first novel in the series, 'Mr. Midshipman Hornblower,' is a rather slow start. Rather than a single novel, it is a series of short stories revolving around Hornblower's first years at sea. While the stories maintain that sense of adventure that are Forester's trademark, it lacks a consistency which is to be found in the later volumes. 'Mr. Midshipman Hornblower' is must reading for fans of the series but for those new to the 'Hornblower' novels perhaps a better introduction would be to read 'Lieutenant Hornblower,' the second novel of the series."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I LOVE Forester's Hornblower novels, and have worn out a couple of paperback sets. It's great to have these stories in ebook form, but whoever transcribed them did a terrible job. There are incorrect words used in many places, and in some places find-and-replace has created errors. For example in Hornblower and the Atropos, the word \\"triumph\\" always appears as \\"Triumph\\", capitalized and in italics, because at one place in the book there is a ship named the Triumph.Such sloppy work would be acceptable in a $.99 edition, but not in a $6.00 one.This comment applies to ALL the Hornblower ebooks."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"C.S. Forester's Hornblower series is unequalled, however, this eBook edition needs proofreading. For example, at one point \\"jolly boat\\" is mistyped as \\"oily boat\\". Surely for $6.00 readers should expect basic proofreading to be performed."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is the first installment chronologically in the saga of Horatio Hornblower, certainly one of the most beloved characters of 20th century fiction. Unlike other works, this one is not so much a novel as a series of short stories intended to show the progression of Hornblower from a scared schoolboy to a young adult exercising leadership. As such the series opener can be read with equal enjoyment by young or old. Younger readers will certainly identify with the scared midshipman who is bullied by a senior midshipman and in light of the Columbine High School tragedy, this section bears re-reading. For older readers, like me, it will help rekindle the spirit of adventure that seemed to fill life in earlier years. I am reluctant to give it a five star rating, as I know later works in the series will be even better but I am justifying it because it is a series of short stories as opposed to a novel.Mr. Midshipman Hornblower was first published in 1950 by an English author who had lived extensively in the US and who was having some of his novels made into films. It only makes sense for Forester to avoid offending a very large American audience. He achieves this goal with incredible marketing panache. He establishes Hornblower's birth date as July 4, 1776 and manages a double coup. First, he avoids having Hornblower fight in the American Revolution. Second, he says as an Englishmen to his American audience, \`We are the same people you are with the same values and heroes.' Given the close relationship of Britain and the US following the end of WWII and the non-reflective American patriotism of the time, Forester could not have his hero countering American values, as those were the same values that Britons espoused.Forester also included some parallels for his fellow Britons. The most obvious is the British supported landing of French monarchists on French soil. As expected the monarchists crumble under republican assaults and the British have to conduct a rear guard action. The stolid British infantry give at least as good as they get but are forced to withdraw due to their ally's collapse. All this sounds very reminiscent of Dunkirk and there are other parallels to WWII in the book. Surprisingly, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower does not end with a furious sea battle but with a rescue of an enemy's crew. How soon after the Berlin Blockade was this written?"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is the prequel to the Horatio Hornblower series. Written as the sixth book chronologically, it covers the very first times when Hornblower served in His Majesty&#8217;s navy. My recommendation is that you read it first, so that you can follow Hornblower chronologically along over his career as it develops.Since much of service aboard a naval vessel is routine, C.S. Forester gives us the high spots of Hornblower&#8217;s first years in the form of short stories beginning at age 17 when he entered the navy.Each story is nicely balanced among the following qualities: Hornblower&#8217;s inexperience; the rapid shift of circumstances that can occur at sea; Hornblower&#8217;s physical and psychological weaknesses and courage to overcome them; the demands of honor; the importance of thinking clearly, getting good information, and making a swift decision; the benefits of discipline; and the brotherhood of all seaman before the dangers they face.Those who are interested in the war between Britain and France after the French Revolution in 1789 will find the material to bring those events to life in a vivid way. I learned a lot about the details of naval warfare as it was conducted then.The weakness of most short story writers is that their plots and resolutions often become overly predictable. These short stories are predictable only in their originality and unpredictability. As such, I found myself drawn forward, wondering what rabbit Forester would next pull out of the hat.This is just the sort of book that I loved to read as a teenager, and I could feel the years peeling off as I raced through the stories. This book would be a wonderful gift to a teenager who likes adventure tales based on historical events. Readers will be reminded of how embarrassing and emotionally daunting it can be to launch off to operate in the adult world at age 17.Unlike many adventure books, Hornblower serves the dual role of hero and morally-inspired man. It&#8217;s too bad that so much modern fiction chooses to develop the action without developing any character in the process."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"The Horatio Hornblower Series is my favorite group of books I've ever read. C.S. Forester gives an expert portrayal of life at sea in the 19th century Royal Navy that is too good to miss. If you like the great ships of the line of the 17th-19th century, you should read this series.About the book as an individual: MR MIDSHIPMAN HORNBLOWER is my favorite book out of the first three I've read. Why? The first book seems a lot longer and takes place over a MUCH longer time period than the others so far. And this is one of two of the books where Hornblower isn't a captain. I liked this book and if you like Master and Commander, sailing, the military, or the 19th century, you owe it to yourself to by this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Others have written thorough reviews of this book, so I will only agree that it is an exciting, excellent series. I started reading them to check (as I often do) to see how well the (A&amp;E) made-for-TV series and the old movie (starring Gregory Peck) held up against the books. I found myself pulled through the entire series by the personal struggles and strengths of Hornblower and others (does a man really think like that?), the thrilling descriptions of the handling of ships under sail (I needed a nautical glossary!), and the detailed historical settings (how much was non-fiction?). Four stars because parts could have been handled better, but on the whole it was a great reading experience."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"As the chronological beginning of C.S. Forester's epic Horatio Hornblower saga, Mr. Midshipman is reasonably good. It is a collection of ten stories following Hornblower from the first moment he steps on board a ship (and promptly gets seasick) to his early triumphs that bring him to the brink of promotion. In this novel, we begin to see the characteristics that will turn Hornblower into the one of the most compelling figures in literature -- courage and daring, yes -- but also self-doubt, introspection and his overwhelming sense of honor and duty. We see the boy that will become a great man.The only reason it does not get more stars is the episodic nature of the work. It took me a while to warm to the character and get an idea of what was going on. Granted, some of this is deliberate, as Hornblower is often enigmatic. Also, as in most of the novels of the series, the naval terms and history were often poorly explained, forcing me to bone up on the history of the Napoleonic wars and the Royal Navy. Of course, that's a *bonus* is you're a history buff like me. For other readers, it might be a little frustrating. But it is by no means a dramatic flaw.As a stand-alone novel, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is good. As the beginning of the epic Hornblower series, however, it is a must-read and will only whet your appetite for the outstanding novels to come."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"These stories are good enough--cleverly written, reasonably exciting, and with just enough nautical jargon and explanation to make a reader feel as if he/she is learning something in a fun way. In this \\"introduction\\" to the series, we see Hornblower as a much smarter and more resourceful hero than he sees himself, which is an altogether fine way to meet a hero.That said, I confess I was spoiled by reading Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series first. For me--though admittedly not for everyone--the tales about Lucky Jack and his surgeon friend are far superior in almost every way, from the depth of the plotting to the elegance of the language to the detail about seamanship during the Napoleanic wars. They're among my all-time favorite novels, and \\"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower\\" is, by comparison, just a good read.But my HUGE problem is with Kindle formatting and not what C.S. Forester did. On my Kindle, with the latest update, the normal type size for this book is so tiny I'd need a magnifying glass to read it. When I change the font size so \\"Hornblower\\" is readable, everything else on the Kindle winds up with text so large there are only 10 or 12 words on a page. Sure, I can keep changing it (and I do), but because I tend to read several books at a time, this is immensely annoying. Frankly, it will keep me from buying other books in the series. This has never happened before, so...what gives, Amazon?"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"This book is a must for all who plan to read the entire Hornblower Series. Having starter with Lord Hornblower it answered many of my questions. It is a well written account of the life of a 18th Century Midshipman in the Royal Navy during the Wars with revolutionary and Napoleonic France."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"It's difficult not to compare this to Patrick O'Brian's stellar Aubrey/Maturin series (which certainly was influenced by this one), and it suffers in comparison. It lacks a strong linear plot, much less interesting subplots or meaningful character interaction. But for what it is, it's also charming in its own right. The historical tidbits and the marvelous Hornblower character are worth the read alone."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I finally decided to start the Hornblower series and decided to go at it in the order of Horblower's life.

I look forward to an enjoyable summer going through these stories."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr. Midshipman chronicles Hornblower's first years in the navy.

As time passes and he has various trials and adventures he begins to become the leader and expert sailor of later tales.

Great beginning to a great adventure series."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"Mr Midshipman was an interesting fictional story taking place during the late 18th century, during the Napoleonic Wars. It was the 1st book of its kind that I have about this time period. This book, for the most part, reads pretty well. I had also bought The Hornblower Companion to help me follow the series better. It was a big help using this companion because of the diagrams and maps it has which helps a reader follow the action better. The tough part about reading this book was the nautical terms being used. I did several searches for nautical terms on the internet, in which I had printed. This did not help 100% however, since some of the terms I still could not find. I plan on buying the next book in the series, Lieutenant Hornblower; hopefully it will go a little easier for me!"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I started this series and couldn't stop.

Excellent adventure stories with a fine naval setting. The quality of print and binding of the book (trade paperback size) was excellent. What more needs to be said?"},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I listened to the recorded book, read by Geoffrey Howard, who is perfect for the job. He is excellent with all the varieties of a British accent, including English spoken with a French or Spanish accent, and his voice lends due nobility to the Hornblower saga. This book, tho not the first written, begins Hornblower's naval career as a 17 year old youth. Each chapter is a separate adventure, confronting the young officer with foreign enemies and untrustworthy allies, the trials of his own service, deprivation and disease, and of course, the mighty sea itself. It deals with a time when officers were gentlemen, at least in fiction, and Hornblower embodies all the qualities in a man that make for leadership and honorable service. Unlike the superhero types so popular in comics, movies, and popular fiction today, Hornblower does not always succeed (therein lies true adventure), but he does have style. They don't write adventure like this any more. When you become tired of aliens and the occult, sex and gore, or tortured hard-drinking divorced anti-heroes, let the exploits of Horatio Hornblower thrill you again."},{"Title":"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower","review":"I probably haven't read a work of fiction since being required to do so back in college (or possibly high school) over ten years ago. I was introduced to the Horatio Hornblower series by the video series presented on A&amp;E a couple of years ago. I decided to read the first book in the series and I was not disappointed.I found the action compelling and I was kept interested throughout the entire book. Watching the development of Horatio Hornblower from midshipman to lieutenant through a series of failures and successes gives depth to the whole work.I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Hordes of the Red Butcher: The Spider: Master of Men (Hordes of the Red Butcher)","review":"No, it's not the UK basketball team, it's a collection of giant wildmen, under the control of a vicious master criminal, bent on -- Well, it's never exactly clear what they're bent on, but clear plots have never been part of THE SPIDER, nor are they that important. The important thing, as always, is slam-bang action. This has somew of the most intense action of any SPIDER story. Particularly impressive are Richard Wentworth's run through the mountains to spread the news about the wild-men, and his hand to hand battle at the farmhouse."},{"Title":"Conversations With The Moon","review":"This is a nice collection of short stories and great bedtime reading. The moon is something of an older, wiser friend who likes to talk about the things he's seen over time. Each chapter is a story that stands alone, but they're all part of the moon's perspective as an observer. There's also a touch of fantasy in the narrative portions where the author is speaking directly to the moon, but the actual stories are written with realism. This makes for a nice transition from one genre to another that works well."},{"Title":"Conversations With The Moon","review":"I received this book as a gift from a good friend of mine. I had been feeling a little down about my job and this book was a great pick me up. It got my mind off my situation for a while and the stories left me with a very positive feeling.Two other reasons why I liked this book: 1) There is a different story in each chapter. I like variety. 2) It was a quick read. I don't like long books that take me weeks to read. I don't have a lot of time on my hands."},{"Title":"Conversations With The Moon","review":"This is a book that reminds me very much of The Little Prince, one of my all-time favorite books. Although the plots of these two books are completely different, they both have similar themes and tell a series of stories. Both are well written and touching narratives.Most of the women I know have loved this book. Men seem to be split on it, so if you're a man who doesn't like to think about your emotions you may want to stay away from this one. If you're an artist, however, you may want to look it for the story about the two painters. Another friend of mine who's a sculptor thought that story was the best in the book because the issues in that story are very relevant to him.As a librarian, I would just like to add that there is nothing that I value more than a request from patrons concerning a book. So, if you're thinking about buying this book and don't want to risk $12 to buy it, check to see if your public or university library has the book on the shelf. If they don't, then put in a request for them to buy it. The author may not sell as many books this way, but the book is available for everyone to read. The only way I learned about this book is because one of my patrons asked me to order it - and I'm glad that she did. I may never have known about it, otherwise. It will be one of my favorites for a very long time."},{"Title":"Conversations With The Moon","review":"This is a wonderful collection of short stories, as told by the moon to the author.

It consists of several, thin short stories linked by a heavy-handed attempt at poetic prose centered around the moon and its mannerisms (it's pompous and exhales glittering light, basically).The short stories are pedantic, thinly guised attempts to communicate values for living. Even the character's names are boring and unimaginative, as if they were extracted from a second-grade reader.It *is* a quick read, I'll agree there. But it's an unfulfilling and empty read as well. I bought this on an Amazon recommendation after choosing Big Fish. No doubt there are similarities in structure, but at least Big Fish entertains and makes you think.Some authors write prose that you savor in your mind like a confection. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Irving or Tom Robbins for example. Conversations with the Moon sets your expectation for a special read but doesn't deliver."},{"Title":"Conversations With The Moon","review":"I disliked this book so much after reading the first two of the stories that the moon tells that I won't read the rest. The stories were no more touching than a bad made for televison movie. I found myself thinking, &quot;Where's the meat?&quot; and it wasn't that I was particularly invested in reading an intellectual or heavy piece. This book cannot be the same one that other readers/reviewers found touching and poignant... or compared to The Little Prince. Conversations With The Moon is a definite dust collector on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Life of Lord Byron","review":"The print is good and there is a table of contents with links to chapters.Another biography which I think is very competent and pleasant is Edna O Brien's Byron in Love.Lord Byron is an inspired but tragically flawed man.

Once you open the appealing cover, the photocopied print is difficult and unappealing to read. A bad buy on my part."},{"Title":"The Life of Lord Byron","review":"I bought this item as a gift and was upset to discover that the last 25 pages were blank and that there was no publisher's page or footnotes.

What a great read. Obviously written by a fine writer, (as opposed to someone with a story first, writing second). Fun, great writing, vocabulary, use of metaphor, twisting timeline, historical references, interesting, varied settings, snappy dialogue, internal conflict, a-typical characters but a univeral theme, must have really kicked ass in Italian. I really enjoyed it. The part about the younger brother was a bit rough, and I could see it coming based on the Greek Mythology reference. Stretched out the pain that you knew was just around the corner."},{"Title":"Head Above Water (City Lights Italian Voices)","review":"If you are as fascinated as I am by the complexities of the human psyche, you will enjoy this poignant and humorous study of the interior life of a man in turmoil. If you are enticed by the idea of going along for a somewhat wild ride with an Italian male of a certain age who is forced to adjust to evolving perceptions of what is important in life, you will probably love this book as much as I did. The novel explores the heart and mind of a middle-aged Italian writer as he attempts to cope with the news that he is about to become a father, largely by focusing on, and trying to revive, his youthful past. Once you've started the book, you will quickly understand why Anne Milano Appel recently won the prestigious Northern California Book Award for her English translation of poet and playwright Bortolussi's first novel. Milano Appel masterfully grasps and skillfully presents all of the subtleties and contradictions of the protagonist's internal struggle as he battles the twin fears of responsibility and loss."},{"Title":"Head Above Water (City Lights Italian Voices)","review":"This is a wonderfully deft treatment of a delicate topic. A man coming into middle age subtly being manipulated by anxieties he doesn't understand, struggles to keep his head above water. His fear is not the extrinsic variety we so often feel in modern life, but a pervasive almost indescribable angst anchored in a tragic moment in his past but shadowing him in his present life. Cardo, the main character, must find a way to come to terms with his fear in order to keep his marriage afloat. Blessed with a wise spouse, in Sol, he is given the space and time he needs. But he charts a most amusing course through this maze of confused emotions.High recommended. This is an impressive debut in English (translated from his Italian novel) for this well-know Italian Poet, commentator and translator. Bravo Bortolussi!"},{"Title":"Max Pam: Indian Ocean Journals","review":"Photographically this is pretty much a \\"cult\\" book, which badly needs to be re-issued, such is the demand.A visual diary of Pam's peregrinations in South Asia, Yemen, etc, spanning twenty years or more, it is remarkable for the vibrancy of the portraits, possibly enhanced by judicious use of slow shutter speeds. Many of the images are searingly unforgettable, sometimes dreamlike, always strong.ONE CAVEAT (accounting for the 4 stars instead of 5): I deplore the presence of the obligatory SE Asian naked bar girl pics in what is otherwise a powerful and hugely dignified work. I suspect Pam may have started a sad trend among Western shooters, which consists of displaying blurred pictures of naked Asian girls in the name of what.. Full disclosure? Honesty? Beyond the prurient value I cannot see a justification for these. All I know is the idea was picked up and amplified by such perverse luminaries as Antoine D'Agata of Magnum Photos, who has made a specialty of this exploitative, debasing genre."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"If you have followed Searle's journey through the contemporary philosophy of mind and language, you'll enjoy this new book from one of America's most interesting and forceful philosophers."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"John Searle is one of America's most prominent philosophers. Although he always writes clearly, some of his works (such as Speech Acts and Intentionality) are of an unavoidably technical nature. However, here he distills his work there (and in other places) down to its essence. This work then is an excellent introduction to his thought as well as an excellent introduction to philosophy. Searle is particularly good when he attacks scepticism. I don't, however, agree with his apparent agnosticism [pps. 36-37]."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"In this book Searle takes on the broad topics of scientific realism, the mind-body problem and the puzzle of socially constructed concepts (e.g. money), among other things. His goal seems to be to defend the \\"common sense\\" view on these topics, but as a philosopher he wants to do so rigorously. In this case, \\"rigorous\\" means mixing lots of specialized terminology with an otherwise breezy style, which has the overall effect of making him sound smug. His is a rare style that manages to convey that the author would sneer at any counterarguments to his positions; maybe this is because he stakes out his ground almost wholly by attacking the positions of others and deeming them obviously wrong.What's worse, despite his fantastic reputation, his philosophy seems really sloppy to me. For example, he claims that \\"consciousness\\" is a definite non-physical property of the brain that has evolved. Then, he argues against epiphenomenalism by noting how implausible it would be that something so useful evolved while making no real difference. Seeing as how evolution is a physical theory, Searle seems to be arguing in circles. And that's about how the whole book is, seeing as how you have to buy into his mind-body \\"resolution\\" before you can even start pondering his ideas on the other stuff.So, if you feel that invoking \\"the way it is like\\" to drink a glass of wine is a good philosophical argument for consciousness being non-physical and are already dead-certain that rocks have no such sensations, the you might find this book a reassuring read.Personally, I think that to understand a proposition you have to also understand its negation. And while Searle claims to be an expert at characterizing what it is to be conscious, I have a hard time taking any of his \\"analysis\\" seriously, since he surely can't explain to me what it's like to be unconscious.For those with a scientific bent, there are better authors out there covering similar material. In particular, I recommend \\"Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience\\", by Max Bennet and PMS Hacker. Hacker makes sure the philosophy is reasonable, Bennet makes sure the science is accurate. Searle's book falls a little shy in both areas, which makes his smuggness all the more infuriating."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"Blah blah"},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"This book is subtitled 'Philosophy in the Real World'. This is inaccurate. The real world and ultimate reality, according to Searle, is the world of physics and chemistry and the fields and forces of nature. With his mind made up from the start, this is not philosophy (which would not take such a dogmatic position) but a theory of consciousness according to science.This is fine if it is what we have come to expect from science, but a tragedy if it represents the philosophical position. It may be that philosophy has succumbed to the pressure and become absorbed into the service of science, but this view of consciousness is notable for its etiolated view of reality, excluding much that is fundamental to an understanding of it.From its own standpoint as a piece of work concerned with the workings of the mind, it is reasonably clear as far as it goes, and does not say anything that is new or radical when considered alongside the mass of literature that already surrounds it. However, it feigns difference with other writers such as Daniel Dennett since they are more or less of one accord with basic assumptions, or default positions as Searle calls them.The reason I say this is simple enough. It is odd to hear so much concerning the nature of consciousness, and yet never a reference to death.There is a simple reason why this is significant. In the absence of death, we would not need to reproduce. In the absence of that, there would be no need to experience desire. Yet the closest Searle manages to get to this is by the metaphor of digestion and the usual comparisons with motor cars.Of course, desire and consciousness are not the same thing, but the question is, could one arise or emerge without the other. If not, then the presence of death in each molecule of us has an active function, even though it is unconscious.But these are the real philosophical issues and the fact that they get no mention at all is very worrying. Consciousness is turned into a phenomena like any other inert process that has all reference to death stripped out of it to make it scientifically amenable. Out of this one gets a sense that science is not so much concerned with the nature of reality, but a reality that does not need to consider the concept of death as an activity, which is more illusory than the delusions Searle points out are unreal (such as the experience of being in love).To discuss consciousness without death as part of its content is virtually a hollow pursuit, for no matter how many properties one may find in it, one is eventually forced to talk of nothing more than brain processes and bio-mechanisms. Such study provides insight that may help in the treatment of brain-damaged patients etc, but this usefulness should not be read as a synonym for understanding, unless we equate philosophy with a kind of science-waiting-in-the-wings. Certainly there are many types of consciousness, and different forms of intention etc, but we should not be fooled into thinking this to be philosophy in the real world, and it does not move our understanding forward by an inch, simply because we have identified many such states. No, this is not philosophy in the real world, but science in an idealised form in a world that is deathless."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"John Searle has a huge problem in understanding the grammar of 'fact'. His book would have hugely benefited from a study of Alan White's TRUTH (Doubleday-Anchor, 1970) which has the best treatment of this issue I know of. His juxtaposition of philosophical 'doctrines' (viz. 'realism' versus 'anti-realism') could have been disciplined, if not dissolved, by such a consideration. He also neglect almost all of the Wittgensteinian and neo-Wittgenstenian literature of the past 25 years, ranging from Malcolm to Baker &amp; Hacker. He does not address himself to the traditions of microsociology (e.g., ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism) which have debated these issues for ages, not always without interesting intellectual results. Searle is a bit arrogant about this, but, then, I suppose her is not alone in the current US intellectual climate. (He never talsk about G.H. Mead, Alfred Schutz, Berger and Luckmann nor Harold Garfinkel). But the most weird aspect of Searle is his conjoint insistence upon the INTENTIONALITY (in the Brenato-sense) of 'consciousness' and, thence, his appeal to the notion that 'consciousness' is a biological phenomenon. Well, John, you can't have it both ways. Either 'consciousness' is a relational concept or it is a substantive noun. There is much to commend in this work, but also much to disparage. But Searle write exceptionally well, and for that we can surely forgive him some of his oversights and misconceptions..."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"Whether you agree with Searle or not, you have to concede that this work of his tastes very much like a liverwurst sandwich. Dennett, no doubt, will turn dials on his robotic brainwave filtration devices to counter Searle's latest argument, called &quot;The Mexican Hat Dance Argument&quot;, which slams the coffin lid closed on the question of whether or not consciousness is really Melvin Laird. But whether you take laxatives or merely bide the passing hours flipping through old medical journals, you'll be taken by Searle's unflinching stance on The Sirens of Titan (he never mentions it). Like a David Gilmour guitar solo, society and mind are here caught up in a ferocious battle on which turns all of Western civilizations. Like Macgruder once said, &quot;he falls over&quot;. Be that as it may, one is reminded of Hilary Putnam, but for no reason in particular. That's the low point of the book, but when Searle concludes that dill pickles are better than sweet pickles, then you know that Mind, Language, and Society are really real in the Hindu sense, but not in the sense that would make Homo Erectus turn his attention away from the savanna. Good read."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"I have read some of the book and can say that i respect his views;but have to disagree with his summation of mind and conciousnes. how can the mind produce conciousness the mind is matter matter cannot produce.it has to be a thought first existing in conciousness first all that exist existed in mind first as thought or idea but all come from conciousness."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"This book substantially advances the pursuit of a naturalized theory of consciousness, and in so doing further undermines relativistic accounts of belief. Anyone who has read any philosophy will find this book manageable. In addition to the cognitive science audience, the distinctions presented could be helpful to counseling psychologists interested in developing and evaluating theoretical positions in their area."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"For anyone familiar with contemporary analytical philosophy, they will indubitably recognize the name John Searle. Well known for taking up the Speech Act project started by the late Oxford philosopher J.L. Austin, Searle has found his niche in Mind, Language and Society: a clear and concise presentation that brings complex philosophical issues from the Ivory Tower to the casual reader (the Real World?).This book is a very good &quot;intermediate&quot; philosophical text for the younger student interested in getting a more in depth look at some the many major problems that have always perplexed philosophers -- skepticism, the mind-body problem, intentionality and consciousness -- but Searle also places these issues into his own philosophical project -- a &quot;re-invention&quot; of enlightenment philosophy and the cartesian theatre of the mind.I would not recommend, as others have, of using this book as a source for advanced philosophical research. Searle's other texts and papers like *Intentionality* and *Speech Acts* take these discussions a few steps further in thier analytic analysis. Also, the endnoting used in the book is not very practical for those of us who follow footnotes as crucial elements of a discussion.All in all, however, this book is a excellent achievement of transparent style and presentation."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"In my mind the most unforgivable &quot;sin&quot; a philosopher can commit is the straw man fallacy, that is, accusing your opponents of holding positions they don't really hold and then proceeding to refute those points of view as a support for building your own positive position. The second most unforgivable &quot;sin&quot; is to do all of this in a not-very-polite way. In this book Mr. Searle is guilty of both of these sins. In the opening pages of the book Mr. Searle says he has three objectives in writing: (1) to advance a series of claims about mind, language, and society; (2) to exemplify a certain style of philosophical analysis; (3) a series of passing observations about thenature of philosophical puzzlement. Surprisingly Mr. Searle says very little about his own positive claims, although one would assume that to really understand his claims, we need to look at his other books. As for objective two, his &quot;style&quot; is somewhat the opposite of objective and rational: his &quot;dialectic&quot; consists of an attack on opponents - one which occasionally borders on ad hominem vitriol - followed by a passing positive affirmation of his own claims; the third objective is really just a thinly veiled revelation that Mr. Searle has axes to grind and may be inclined to pause and grind his axes spontaneously and without warning.In regards to objective 2, Mr. Searle's methodology seems to consist of a mockery of opponents and an exhuberant, emotionally charged language (time and again Mr. Searle tells us how &quot;embarrassed&quot; he is for his opponents for holding such &quot;obviously&quot; wrong positions) combined with purposeful &quot;straw man&quot; style distortions and misrepresentations of diverse sets of opponents under collective rhubrics (such as that &quot;idealists&quot; like Hegel, Rorty, Kuhn and Derrida (!?!) deny the existence of a real world); to me this is hardly what can be called a &quot;refutation.&quot; Further, I fail to see, even after all of Mr. Searle's effort, how an alleged refutation of one's opponents constitutes a successful defense on one's own positive claims.It is one thing if Mr. Searle simply were guilty of misunderstanding some of his opponents. But Mr. Searle's style is so incredibly arrogant, so incredibly self-assured and aggressive in its mockery of others (&quot;feeble&quot; is a favorite adjective he uses over and over again to describe his opponents' arguments), that I am left feeling rather impatient to find the diamond in the rough of Mr. Searle's writing. I don't mean to say that his ideas don't have substance, but rather that it is so difficult to seperate the substance from the vitriol that one quickly loses patience and may be inclined to seek philosophical substance elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"It's pretty breathtaking how much ground Searle manages to cover in so few pages. MLS is the epitome of fine philosophy writing: clear, concise, and precise. As Searle himself notes, MLS only scratches the surface of the problems he takes on. But what problems they are, and what scratches he makes! This is a book I know I'll be revisiting in future. Searle's arguments are very deep and, as they unfold (from mind to language to society) they are, in places, tough going. Overall, I'm sympathetic to his anti-anti-realism, though I don't entirely agree with the arguments he marshals in support of his own realist position nor the criticisms he marshals against (a certain stripe of) idealism. I am also skeptical of Searle's efforts, at a few key junctures in the exposition, to obviate certain philosophical problems (e.g., dualism v. materialism) through a simple reframing of the terms of the debate. I see the virtue in this type of reframing -- not least the possibility that it might open productive new lines of inquiry. But I don't see Searle's take on the problems in question as remotely final. His reframing sidesteps certain questions while begging others. Whatever. MLS gave me an enormous amount to think about, and spurred my interest in pursuing fundamental questions to do with mind, language, and society elsewhere in the literature. MLS is a profound and deeply rewarding book."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"I can't imagine why I didn't write this review when I first read this outstanding book. In under 170 pages Searle gives the curious reader a complete overview of the mind and how it works, along with extensions to language and society. The only thing left is for neuroscience to figure out how the brain manages to do it.Over the last few years we've been bombarded by the almost science fiction claims and speculations of cognitive science, which has a view of the mind that isn't any improvement over that of traditional religion.Searle, on the other hand, gets right to the point, from showing the error of dualism, to explaining how the mind creates an objective social reality to how language works. While this subject could easily be intimidating, Searle writes as if he were explaining it to you over a beer at your favorite pub.This is a well-written, delightful book, and one you will want to reread every few years."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"If you've followed Searle to date you'll appreciate this new book of his. As you might be able to tell from the lengthier review above, it is not an introductory text of philosophy and is certainly not a pop self-help book for guiding lost souls through the &quot;painful reality of our world.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"I found the &quot;mind&quot; section of this book more interesting than the &quot;language&quot; or &quot;society&quot; parts, for the reason that it provides a compelling alternative to dualism - that the mind and body are separate. Searle's approach is that of course the mind is biological, but it's qualitatively different than any other biological system. Consious activity in the brain cannot be reduced to components as can digestion in the stomach. A delightful read."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"happy with the book i got it was in the right condition and will use for my college studies. thank you for this book."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"Whether you agree with Searle's conclusions or not, you have to give him credit for his exceedingly clear writing. This book is easily accessible to the non-philosopher lay-person. The book deals with some of the so-called typical areas of philosophy - consciousness (mind), language and society. Searle claims to have solved the mind-body problem that has existed since Descartes created it. What is the mind? How does it affect the body if it is not a material thing? Etc. Searle claims that the problem is with starting out with a dualist perspective to being with. By eliminating this starting point, the dualism problem evaporates. You will need to read the details of how he arrives at this. My take is that no matter what neuroscience finds in terms of identifying what parts of the brain light up or what chemical travel within the brain, that there will always be a sense that consciousness and though are something else. Even, for example, when someone perceives something, an action for example, and that is reflected in an fMRI, what about the simultaneous judgment about that act? If I just read an article about some heinous abuse, can my judgment of that abuse really be reduced to the electrical impulses and chemical swishing going on in my head?I found Searle's treatment of institutional facts particularly enlightening. This understanding of the term \\"institution\\", as in the institution of money or the institution of marriage, for example, has been replaced to mean something more akin to \\"long-standing\\" or \\"precious\\" rather than what it means in this philosophical sense - something that relies on its meaning and definition based on consensus. Thus, the institution of marriage refers to the currently accepted definition by the society at large of marriage as being between one consenting man and woman. Some engaged in the same-sex marriage debate challenge those who oppose same-sex marriage with posters of people like Newt Gingrich, who has been unfaithful in his marriage, yet defends the \\"institution of marriage\\", and refer to Gingrich as hypocritical. However, Gingrich and others with similar poor marriage records (Britney Spears, et al) are actually supporting the institution of marriage when they marry someone of the opposite sex. So the question is really about redefining the institution of marriage to allow same sex marriage. Who's to say that same-sex marriages will not also be subject to the same infidelities, break ups and other negative happenstances?This book is an excellent example of how to write clearly about very complex topics. Whether you agree with the premises and conclusions is another story."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"Overall, I think Searle is right on the mark with his view on consciousness as a biological function and language/institutions as an artifact of consciousnesses interacting. The clarity and insight is excellent - and he's right: once someone says it (i.e., him), it all sound so simple and obvious.The only complaint that I have are the frequent use of the philosopher's &quot;It seems to me&quot; style of argument, which &quot;seems to me&quot; to leave him an easy &quot;out&quot; if counter arguments arise. I also disagree with some of his conclusions, such as the notion of &quot;status function&quot;.But none of that stopped me from enjoying the book!"},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"About fifteen years ago, Mortimer Adler wrote a slim volume, &quot;Ten Philosophical Mistakes,&quot; which received little attention. Adler was deemed not a professional philosopher and was thus summarily dismissed. Moreover, he argued cogently for a return to what in philosophical parlance is know as &quot;naive realism,&quot; but all the chic thinkers then, and now, debunk such a world view as archaic and not very interesting. It didn't help, perhaps, that Adler repeatedly appealed to Aristotle and Aquinas to justify his positions - whether these sages have something to contribute or not.Now comes John Searle, a very professional philosopher and a distinguished professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. He's written a great many books, some of which have been standards in the field of language and psychology throughout the world. He's Oxford trained and is widely respected. And, like Adler, he has a few philosophical mistakes he'd like to clear up. And does so incisively against those who attack the external world, mind, consciousness, intentionality, society, and language with clarity, elegance, style, and wit. Unlike Adler, he applies the Anglo-American style of analytic philosophy, the most rigorous intellectual approach, but one doesn't need to know logic to understand the force of his compelling arguments.In many ways, this is Searle's best book. Not because it is a detailed examination of every philosophical nuance, but because he brutally demythologizes idealism and all attending -isms that have no foundation, no raison d'etre, no excuse, other than the &quot;will to power&quot; to force _their_ reality onto others. In 161 short pages he turns many philosophical &quot;puzzles&quot; into enigmas of someone else's making, not perplexities we have to live with. It's a refreshing and enjoyable read. I only hope time will bear the fruit of Searle's views on ethics, one field in which he has been curiously silent."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"In this somewhat informal presentation, philosopher John R. Searle condenses a lifetime-to-date of thought on various issues surrounding the so-called \\"mind-body\\" problem.The solution to this problem, he contends, is to regard mind as a natural phenomenon that depends causally on the brain but also has causal powers of its own (much like such macro-properties of matter as \\"solidity\\" and \\"color\\"). In this way, he argues, we can do justice to the empirical facts without falling into either of the twin errors \\"dualism\\" and \\"materialism,\\" both of which he ascribes to an inherited philosophical language that is frankly better dispensed with.He summarizes his views on consciousness and \\"intentionality,\\" quickly but precisely describing the essential features of mental activity that set it apart from other natural phenomena.On this foundation, he builds his theories of speech acts and socially-constructed reality, never losing sight of the fact that each of these depends on a \\"background\\" of what he calls \\"external realism\\" (the view that there is a given reality that exists independently of our minds, which he correctly notes is not really a \\"view\\" but the implicit basis on which _all_ \\"views\\" are held).And there are other delights along the way: for example, we are also treated, in summary fashion, to Searle's engagingly straightforward defense of the aforementioned \\"external realism\\" (presented more fully in the three closing chapters of his previous work, _The Construction of Social Reality_).All in all, this highly readable, entertaining, and thought-provoking volume by an eminent modern philosopher succeeds in its aim of restoring, and even somewhat advancing, the ideals of the Enlightenment against a modern/postmodern onslaught of obfuscatory antirealism. It should lead satisfied readers to investigate the rest of his works, to which this volume is a valuable introduction and which they will find equally brilliant: Searle does philosophy as it ought to be done."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"This book is an excellent summation of Searle's thought. The first section is an attack on antirealist (i.e., there are no facts in the world independent of facts we construct with thoughts and language) strains in contemporary intellectual circles that is right on the money. The next section reiterates Searle's position that consciousness is a biological phenomenon and the product of the brain. While I think that Searle avoids ontological issues, his main aim is to do away with the Cartesian (i.e., the mind is a distinct substance from matter) framework that haunts the mind-body debate.Finally, Searle presents his thoughts on how social and institutional facts (like &quot;money&quot;, &quot;points in a ballgame&quot;, &quot;marriage&quot;, etc.) enter into the world. The conclusion of the book talks about what the role of philosophy is and how philosophy makes progress. That is, Searle explains the importance of philosophy."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"As a student of philosophy, I found, first of all, Searle's methodological approach to philosophical analysis and conceptual mapping very helpful. The clarity, rigor, and logical structure that Searle writes with are to be admired. For anyone looking for well-done and well-written philosophy text, this is certainly a book to consult.Although I am not sympathetic to analytic philosophy and its problems, this book deserves to be read and thought through. Furthermore, even though this book was intended to scratch the surface of conscienceness, language, etc., it is certainly not lacking in rigor.Finally, Searle has an interesting philosophical tool to analyzing philosophical problems: he attempts to get past the dominant and current categorization of problems (for example, materialism and dualism when talking about the mind and constitution) and form his own way of talking about the problem (and thus forming his own category). I am not sure if the methodological approach is of any help (because it just creates another category). But I will say that his break with the traditional notions of dualism and materialism is helpful and rather thought provoking.My one question: Even though Searle attempts to get past these traditional categories in thinking about the mind and its structure, I think that, even though he says he does not, he has a prior commitment to a naturalistic worldview. If so, fine. I just wish he was explicit. If not, then what is he?Great book. Read it and enjoy. Simply put: this is great philosophy and done very well."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"In this short, readable book, John Searle gives an account of how minds, language, and social institutions are situated within a material universe. The account goes roughly like this: consciousness is a biological phenomena; conscious minds exhibit intentionality (i.e., the ability to refer to or \\"fit\\" the external world); and intentionality allows human minds to create social institutions and vest meaning in words. Searle transcends standard materialist and dualist positions in philosophy. He insists that mental, social, and linguistic phenomena must be explained in natural terms, but he does not try to \\"reduce\\" them to other categories or \\"explain\\" them out of existence. Along the way, he discusses a variety of issues ranging from realism to philosophical method.A professor at UC Berkeley, Searle has a genius for cutting to the heart of a philosophical position and keeping his concepts tied to reality and common experience. He also writes so well that it's hard not to be carried along by his argument. At the same time, I never really bought his argument that consciousness is a purely biological category, especially after he conceded that \\"first person\\" conscious experiences cannot be reduced to \\"third person\\" facts about brains. Nor did I understand his account of how consciouness operates as a \\"macro\\" feature of the brain able to cause effects in \\"micro\\" features such as neurons. He draws an analogy with an automobile engine, where macro-features such as pistons and spark plugs have causal effects even though everything in the engine obeys the laws of subatomic physics. Unfortunately, the analogy doesn't convince: whatever else consciousness is, it doesn't seem to function like a piston. Searle blames our inability to see the force of his analogy on our cramped intuitions about causation. He doesn't provide any alternative intuitions.It seems undeniable that conscious experience is constructed by material brains -- anyone who doubts this should read a few clinical essays by Oliver Sacks or A. R. Luria that describe the deformed consciousness of brain-injured patients. However, the mind also exhibits so many non-physical features that fitting it into \\"nature\\" may be harder than Searle lets on. The puzzle isn't solved -- just restated -- by insisting, \\"The mind is OBVIOUSLY real (so materialism is false), the mind is OBVIOUSLY part of the brain (so dualism is false), the mind OBVIOUSLY can cause effects in the brain (so epiphenomenalism is false),\\" and so forth. Maybe Searle is right that materialism and dualism are outmoded categories. Even so, consciousness is such a peculiar biological phenomenon, and so totally unlike any other process or feature of our bodies, that dualistic philosophies will inevitably emerge to account for it -- and will, in turn, spawn materialistic counter-philosophies aimed at resolving the paradoxes of dualism. The dualism/materialism debate may be sterile, but I doubt that Searle has brought it to an end.None of these remarks should be taken as serious criticism of \\"Mind, Language, and Society,\\" which covers a lot of ground beside the mind/body question. In only 150 pages or so, the book summarizes work Searle has published over the years in modern classics such as \\"The Rediscovery of the Mind,\\" \\"Intentionality,\\" and \\"The Construction of Social Reality.\\" In fact, I recall that Searle presented some of this material in undergraduate courses at Berkeley in the late 1970s. Even though Searle doesn't discuss the free will problem or give equal time to opposing positions, his book is first-rate, and I definitely want to read it a second time. Anyone who has already taken a few introductory classes in philosophy and wants to probe deeper into the subject would benefit from reading it."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"I'd like to note, first of all, that I didn't find Searle as uncharitable as some of the other reviewers here. He did give a few low blows, but I think his arguments appeared as straw-man's because rather than refute a lot of the other claims, he was integrating them subtly: dropping off parts which were unnecessary and then using the leftovers to create a greater and more encompassing theory. He never goes into depth of why he finds the parts of theories credible that he does, as this book is not intended for deep analysis. The reader must simply take Searle's word for it at times to understand what he is getting at (Searle does provide a nice \\"Further Reading\\" section at the end for readers who are more interested in the \\"why's\\" behind his arguments).Which leads me into the content of his book...This book is a modern introduction to more recent philosophical issues. Searle sums up in the first chapter most of the out-standing problems in the field that remain unsolved from the last few hundred years. These include the mind-body problem, skepticism, realism, and issues relating to consciousness such as binding and intentionality. Searle has an interesting perspective in that he tries to alleviate conflicts by \\"going behind the issue and merging premises.\\" With this method he finds complete theories that integrate many perspectives that before seemed contradictory.The writing of this book is not as thick as his other works. Most of his language is quite precise and his arguments are logically spelled out. The analogies are simple for easy understanding; more advanced readers will probably want to contemplate further implications of Searle's ideas than he discusses.Searle is yet another voice in the last few decades that has shown a tendency towards integration to solve logical issues. This seems to be a trend with many other authors, and might be called the \\"leading edge\\" of philosophical thought right now. The book takes the reader from step one, and slowly builds up a view of reality that integrates mind, society, and language exquisitely.And if you happen to be a proponent of one of the many theories Searle disagrees with, try to be patient, and see where he's going. He does use a condescending tone now and then. But other than that, recommended..."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"Ever since I read &quot;The Construction of Social Reality&quot; I have admired Searle. Yet, after reading this work I am left with a foul aftertatse that i can't shake off.Essentially, Searle is presenting a summary package of his overall philosophy and, in doing so, is also writing a sort of &quot;introduction to philosophy&quot; type book, where he will take the reader through the various problems of philosophy. However, he does a disservice to the uniformed reader by seriously underrepresenting his opponent's arguments. I'm not sure if he does this simply because he is writing to a more elementary reader and, thus, feels justified in brushing off the &quot;hard&quot; philosophical positions by using words like &quot;preposterous&quot; to characteristically push them to the periphery, but this is a common tactic in this book. In the very first chapter Searle classifies the &quot;default positions&quot; that the &quot;common man&quot; will undoubtedly take for granted in every day life. These are positions like naive realism, the correspondance view of truth, the referential theory of meaning, etc. He then states that it is his intention to defend these doctrines, which is fine, but he also is very upfront about his presupposition that denying any of these doctrines is obviously absurd. While in the end I'm sure it matters very little, there is still an air of unsportsman-like conduct festering in Searle's writing. Searle should know better than to commit the strawman fallacy, even if he is writing a more elementary text. It can misrepresent some serious challenges that &quot;ought&quot; to be given serious attention to the average reader. After reading Searle's book, one might mistakenly think that these matters are pretty much settled.It is still an interesting read, but if this is one of your first reads as a student of philosophy I encourage you delve deeper into the issues Searle has addressed."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"For anyone familiar with contemporary analytical philosophy, they will indubitably recognize the name John Searle. Well known for taking up the Speech Act project started by the late Oxford philosopher J.L. Austin, Searle has found his niche in Mind, Language and Society: a clear and concise presentation that brings complex philosophical issues from the Ivory Tower to the casual reader (the Real World?).This book is a very good &quot;intermediate&quot; philosophical text for the younger student interested in getting a more in depth look at some the many major problems that have always perplexed philosophers -- skepticism, the mind-body problem, intentionality and consciousness -- but Searle also places these issues into his own philosophical project -- a &quot;re-invention&quot; of enlightenment philosophy and the cartesian theatre of the mind.I would not recommend, as others have, of using this book as a source for advanced philosophical research. Searle's other texts and papers like *Intentionality* and *Speech Acts* take these discussions a few steps further in thier analytic analysis. Also, the endnoting used in the book is not very practical for those of us who follow footnotes as crucial elements of a discussion.All in all, however, this book is a excellent achievement of transparent style and presentation."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"John Searle has presented brilliantly original basic theories in the philosophy of language, mind, and the nature of institutional reality. This book summarizes this work, and very importantly, shows the interconnections and hierarchical arrangement of his ideas. Those new to Searle should read this as *the* introduction to his work; those familiar with his work will profit from the arrangement of all of his theories into a single, fully integrated, philosophy."},{"Title":"Mind, Language, and Society : Philosophy in the Real World","review":"This is a typically clear and compelling book from this distinguished philosopher. It is an excellent summary of Searle's work and can be read profitably by those unfamiliar with his books. Readers familiar with Searle will find little novel but Searle's effort to link his views into a coherent whole is very interesting and worth reading. In this book Searle is concerned not only with describing and synthesizing his prior work but also with illustrating his approach to philosophical problems. This approach can be best seen in his discussion of consciousness. Searle attacks this problem by attempting to give an account that seems to take known facts as a point of departure and avoids use of traditional categories of analysis, such as casting the problem in the form of the mind-body problem. This section is particularly successful and can be read easily as a stand alone document. I believe the sections on challenges to realism and the construction of social reality are also particularly good and can also be used readily as stand alone documents. Another issue very important to Searle is clarity of presentation, and this work, like his prior books, is very well written. At one point in this book Searle mentions that he is working on a new book on rationality. There is no one better qualified to study this subject."},{"Title":"Billy F Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead","review":"The book is kind of like going to Billy's house and him showing you around... lots of fun!

That said, it's a little disappointing because there are no new anecdotes about Billy's life with ZZ that anybody who's read interviews or album liners doesn't already know. Much is made of the Rev's mucial life before ZZ, and Dusty and Frank are mentioned only briefly, almost as an afterthought. I guess I expected more stories about touring with the band, how they get along, how they write. The writing style is a little bit tedious also. Isn't that what ghost writers are for?The photographs, however, are another story. This is a coffee table book with large colorful pictures of Billy and the band, his cars and guitars. The section on guitars is especially good and many of the crazy guitars BFG is seen playing live are described. Check out the license plate on Cadzilla: 8JAPAN.

He has always had the respect of the music community however the secretive nature of his long time manager, Bill Ham, has presented Billy from really streching outside ZZ until recently. In the past year Billy has guested on albums by Les Paul, BB King, Queens of the Stone Age, Nickelback and Vivian Campbell. He has also appeared in videos by Tim McGraw and the QOTSA. Now he is releasing an autobiography. Let me say that this book is outstanding. It's a handsome coffee table sized, hard cover. Each page is well thought out with terrific pictures in interesting locations. The book is split into 3 sections. The Life, The Cars and the Guitars. My only very slight disappointment is with the life section. Billy mostly recounts the stock tales he has been telling over the years. Not much new is revealed for the true fan. The sidebars with his favorite custom guitar and car builders is a nice touch. The real fans will however love the sections on his guitars and cars. The photgraphy and quick commentaries are are joy to behold. I'm sure I'll be pulling this one off the shelf for many years to come. My only question to Billy - whens volume II coming? Thanks Billy - awesome job."},{"Title":"Billy F Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead","review":"I Just received this oversized hardbound treasure and four hours later, yeah, i'm still drooling over it...

Realizing what Tohru has become to the family, Akito ominously storms off to have it out with her. But Akito didn't count on being challenged by someone who will not stand for him going after Tohru...Momiji.Such emphasis has been placed on Yuki and Kyo's relationship with Tohru that it's easy to overlook how close she's become to Momiji in a very different way, and since we often forget how old he is because he looks and acts so young it's a shock when it's he who faces Akito down. Momiji's confrontation with Akito is well done and frightening - considering our knowledge of Rin's trip to the hospital and Haru's warning in the last volume that Akito dislikes him. This is definitely his volume, as he shows himself to be as much Tohru's prince as Yuki or Kyo - if not more.Also including the stunning revealation of Akito's place in the Zodiac, this volume is one of the strongest so far."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"After the moonlight moment between Yuki and Tohru they head back to the Sohma home together. The next day Akito summons for Haru to pay him a visit, while Tohru and Kyo head to the beach to make sand castles. Yuki and Momitchi meets up with them and Yuki is tender with Tohru again. Akito and Kureno head to the Sohma house to meet with Tohru, a woman whom Akito despises. They find their way to the beach, where he sees Kyo and Tohru having fun and being happy, and it unnerves him so much he decides to prolong the visit. On the way home Tohru encounters a horse on the ground. This turns out to be Isuzu Sohma, another member of the zodiac. She turns back to her female form and warns Tohru and Yuki not to tell anyone she was there and runs off half naked.Akito has demanded that Kyo be brought to him. Tohru thinks this is a good sign, though Kyo knows it cannot be. Yuki warns him not to lose his temper in front of Akito, but this proves futile as Akito brings up some painful memories, including a bet he and Kyo have that will ultimately seal Kyo's doom if he loses. Kyo reveals to Akito just how much Tohru means to him. Akito becomes enraged over the revelations of Kyo's heart, which he attempts to deny. He leaves Akito to go see her, and tries to pretend nothing bad happened.The Sohmas decide to end their vacation with a bang...literally, by blowing off an obscene amount of fireworks at Momitchi's suggestion. Akito makes an appearance in the middle of the night at the house and demands to see Tohru. Momitchi bars his way, and gets hurt in the process. Akito tells her of his true plans for the members of the zodiac, plans that don't include outsiders, or Kyo for that matter. Akito hurts Tohru's face and Kureno shows up to retrieve him. Akito tells Tohru Kureno is the rooster, and also that as long as he exists he (Akito) is the God of the Sohma clan. This leaves Tohru thinking into the next evening when they finally have their fireworks. She decides that she must endeavor to break the curse, no matter what it takes....wow... It didn't seem possible but the series just keeps getting better and better... my gods, I didn't see this coming. The revelation of the relationship between Kyo and Akito was amazing. The fact that Kyo must defeat Yuki to win his freedom, heart wrenching. Ultimately, I think he will defeat him, but not in the manner of fighting. What I would like to see is that Kyo defeats him in the manners of the heart, by winning Tohru's heart. I think that would be a terrific ending, though I would be sorry to see Yuki get hurt. Realistically though, he has had so much of Tohru's time in the series a far as romance goes, but him being the rat has a better chance of being with someone than Kyo, what with his \\"true cat form\\" and all, who's going to accept him like that besides Tohru? I may be waxing sentimental, but I would prefer to see I end with Tohru and Kyo together for that reason alone... I'd like to see that cat win something tangible, and I hope that is the direction that it will end up going."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"Fruits Basket volume 11 is probably among the darkest volumes in the series. When you read this one, I can assure you that you will easily be moved to tears - and also part of what makes it dark is our finding out about the zodiacs' futures, particularly Kyo's.It's obvious that this family holds lots of betrayal and backstabbing, and this volume makes that a big part of its aura. Parts of the book are rather surprising and catch you off-guard while you're reading it. I remember sitting on my bed while reading it, turning to the next page and going \\"WTF KYO KNEW KYOKO\\" because basically, this is the volume where we find out about that.Akito finally confronts Tohru with her real attitude towards outsiders, and gives her a small wound in her anger (poor Tohru!). However, Momiji fans will love this volume, as we see his courageous and protective side towards loved ones.And LAST but not least, the \\"love triangle\\" Between Tohru, Yuki and Kyo is certainly getting more complex. You'll know that in the previous volume, Yuki confessed to himself his love for Tohru. In this volume, the same happens with Kyo. I know who she ends up with in the end at this point (and also by reading spoilers! Haha), but I won't tell you for the sake of my poor head before getting hit by an iron skillet. VERY worthy of five stars, although my favorite volumes are still 1, 4, 6, and 13."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"So in the last volume, Yuki (secretly says to himself that he loves Tohru!) poor Kyo fans, although I could never chose between the two. Both are just as deserving. But in this volume Akito calls in all the Sohma's at their vacationing site and singaling punishes them emotionally. He realizes that Tohru has become one of the family and then he storms off to get her, but Momiji defends Tohru! Despite what he looks like he's only a year younger and has every right to be Tohru's prince charming too!But anyway, Kyo won't admit it when Akito is talking to him but he's also in love with Tohru...what will happen next? Things seem to just get more intense but it's becoming better and BETTER!

The art work is fantistic and they even put in fan art at the end of each book. The plot is truly unique and Tohru is the main character along with Kyo (the cat) and Yuki (the rat). Yuki and Kyo hearts are very clouded with fear and anger until Tohru Honda (the \\"flower\\")comes into there lives. Anyway in the 11th volume in fruits basket Akito starts wanting everyone except Kyo to come and visit him. But then one day Kyo is requested to come over and Akito (while in a argument) helps Kyo realize something very important, and Akito reveals his place in the Zodiac!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"I must say, this is definetly intense. I mean just to protect Tohru, Kyo tells Akito he doesn't love her though he really does. How sweet!!I must say I cannot decide between the two if I were to choose.I do have a lot of respect for Momiji, though. I think he has actually grown up more in this volume, going against Akito the way he did. The way Momiji is not afraid to go to Tohru and transform I think he is more apt to sharing his feelings with Tohru then shy Kyo and Yuki. I think he Momiji does trully love Tohru but we won't find out until later, I guess.It's so sad what will happen to Kyo. He doesn't deserve that, nor do any of the Zodiac having to return to Akito. Kyo doesn't tell Tohru but Akito does, the cold-hearted, ------I must say this is a great series and it's just getting better and better. I do agree with the previous reviewer it's not for everybody so do research over it."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"Of course this book is gonna rock! it has the major funny, the good story,(made me sniffle) and of course, it has Momiji. He rocks. The story focuses what's going on with Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo. While still at the summer house, Akito starts calling the members of the zodiac to \\"speak\\" with him. He calls Kyo and after an argument, jumps to some pretty amazing conclusions. That's all i can say without giving it away, but all in all, this book is a MUST READ. If you don't read it cause of the romance stuff, or the fact that this is(don't take any offense, ladies) a chick's (shojo, right?) manga, at least read it for the awesome rabbit. rock on Takaya-San!!!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"Fruits Basket #11 WILL make you sad. I was sad (and I still am!) when I read this. Kyo fans, this will literally crush you, and Some people may even ask you if somebody in your family died or somthing.Basicly, Akito showed up at the summer home and now, for \\"some\\" reason, Akito wanted to talk to Kyo. For the usual reason. To crush him, his dreams and his hopes.Then somthing very unexpected (WEll I knew it would happen XD) Kyo realizes how he feels about Tohru. He loves her.Well, Akito, as you might have figured, guesses. Now, on the back of the book, it will mislead you, it will make you think that Akito will tell Tohru of Kyo's love. Akito does not. Instead, you will finally meet the last andd final zodiac member. AND Akito's true colors are shown to Tohru.This IS A MUST-READ!ps. I cried. You will probably cry or at least it will feel as if your stomach has sunk down to your toesIt is very sweet an you WILL need tissues!Ms. Shishou Master Sensei Kyo Sohma"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"for people who love fruits basket, this will probably be one of your favorites in the series. full of drama and revealation, i think it is one of the best. i like how there is drama, but not too much of it; it's just in the right spots. kyo realizes his feelings about toruh, and yuki does too, i believe. momiji has really grown up! and u finally realize things about akito. a great read for furuba fans, but i say if u haven't tried this series bfore, research a little on it before deciding to read it!!!!:) i know i can't wait for volume 14!!!!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 11","review":"After reading the previous ten volumes of Fruits Basket and enjoying them so much, I read this volume to see what would happen to the characters and their storylines.Tohru and the Sohmas must visit Akito everyday while everyone is at the summerhouse. However, as the days go on, relationshipd become more complicated. The worst confrontation takes place between Akito and Kyo. Akito insists on seeing Tohru, and Momiji tries to stop Akito from seeing her. Akito does manage to talk to Tohru, and reveals his true place among the zodiac members. Akito also makes it clear that there's no place for either Tohru or Kyo in his plans for the cursed members of the Sohma family. After this confrontation, Tohru's resolve to stay with the Sohmas and find a way to break the curse is hardened.Wow... a lot comes to a head in this volume. The tenseness builds throughout the volume, and climaxes with Akito's confrontation with Tohru. I believe this is truly a turning point for Tohru as a character. For most of the volumes, Tohru was rather meek. And while we started seeing her be a little more willing to stand up for herself a couple of volumes back, it is at this point where Tohru truly starts becoming a little more confident of herself, and becomes more willing to stand up for herself. This was a great read, and I definitely think that readers who have read and enjoyed the previous volumes of the Fruits Basket manga series will not be disappointed with this one.I wrote this review after checking out a copy of this manga volume through the King County Library System."},{"Title":"Deck planner: 25 outstanding decks you can build","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

One of the remarkable things about this book is its emphasis on Keats's understanding of the healing powers of imagination and of poetry. Many, many years ago, my favorite English teacher told me that she hoped to write a book about Keats's letters. I remember wondering how a book about anyone's letters could be interesting, and hoped someday to see her book. She never wrote it, alas-- so it was a wonderful discovery to find in Andres Rodriguez's book some of the depths that my long-ago mentor had hoped to plumb.

This book reviews and examines not only the poems of Keates but what could be argued to be even more important in the understanding of the man, his letters. The very mention of John Keates conjures up images of everything related to the \\"Romantics,\\" however, Rodriguez successfully pays tribute to Keates \\"the author\\" instead of Keates as a member of the \\"Romantic Period.\\" This book would be interesting to both avid fans of Keates and those who are taking their first approach in studying the genius."},{"Title":"Book of the Heart: The Poetics, Letters, and Life of John Keats (Studies in Imagination)","review":"The book functions both as a biography of Keats and as a story of a person in the process of \\"the Great Work\\"--the forging of a soul/identity. Not only was Keats a great poet, he also had remarkable things to say in his letters about death, love, beauty, and salvation.I gave it four stars instead of five because I felt that some chapters had less to offer than others, but overall the book gave me a greater appreciation for Keats's life and work, and it also gave me inspiration for my own living life poetically."},{"Title":"Book of the Heart: The Poetics, Letters, and Life of John Keats (Studies in Imagination)","review":"I purchased this book based on the editorial reviews.Well, I've been fooled again and again by glowing MOVIE reviews, but this is a first for me in literature.

The idea of cutting out everything but the \\"good parts\\" may have seemed like a good plan, (it did to me me at first) but, though the excerpt-like contributions by 59 different authors are well written, most lack the sexual tension and emotional build up an actual story or novel would have. Every character always \\"gets lucky\\" within one page. No surprises, no hot dialog, no hints, no chance that the page might end without every character getting laid. This book makes you realize that the actual sex acts aren't what makes a good story really erotic."},{"Title":"The Good Parts: Pure Lesbian Erotica","review":"I bought this book on a whim and loved it! I would read a story every night and go to sleep happy. No matter how experienced you are, you'll probably be surprised and educated by the stories. I lent it to a straight friend and she was really surprised by what \\"lesbians do.\\" I recommend it - it was a great read."},{"Title":"The Good Parts: Pure Lesbian Erotica","review":"The stories in this anthology are generally fine, and some of them are quite good. But I bet they were considerably better before they were edited quite so brutally. Indeed, I have read one or two of the stories in other erotica anthologies and although they were only minimally longer they were notably more compelling. Though in theory I don't mind just getting to the hot and heavy part of an erotica story, I found the choppy editing disorienting and somewhat annoying."},{"Title":"The Good Parts: Pure Lesbian Erotica","review":"I don't think any of the 60 stories are over 8 pages, thus you get right to 'the good parts' lol.I bought this collection for the wide variety of authors and because of favorites whose stories are always well written and enjoyable:Therese Szymanski - \\"Sex Girlfriends and Videotape!\\" is a standout as is her other story in this collection \\"Vive La France!\\"MJ Williamz' is another author that delivers in her story - \\"Perks\\"Among the dozens of contributors are authors that you'll know -Rachel Kramer BusselNicole FosterJean RobertaLynne JamneckHeather TowneRakelle ValenciaKristina WrightMia DominguezSachi GreenDebra HydeJulie MitchellPeggy Munson"},{"Title":"The Good Parts: Pure Lesbian Erotica","review":"I purchased this book expecting a pleasurable read. Unfortunately, I didn't get this as a result.

I will be dropping this book at the nearest rummage sale!"},{"Title":"Cunning Treatment","review":"Cunning Treatment is a legal thriller set in a richly detailed Southern backdrop, reminiscent of the early efforts of John Grisham. A rigged election and blackmail storyline weave through this story of corrupt, power-hungry movers-and-shakers.

I was raised in the forties and our trees were alway cut trees and very simple,so I could relate to trees not being very beautiful in some peoples eye but these trees were beautiful to me and I I enjoyed this little book since I could write down all those memories and pass them onto my children. I wrote some of the stories and passed the book onto my daughter to write some of her own memories of trees at Christmas. Sometimes simple books like &quot;Christmas Trees&quot; are the best.

But Sebastian is different. He's handsome and he's a gentleman. But how can she love him when he is one of the enemy.This book was rather short for an adult historical romance (around 250 pages), but the characters were appealing as was their love story, and I really love the time period this book was set in. I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoy romances set in colonial times."},{"Title":"Cacti (Wisley)","review":"This book has been around for quite some time now, and it shows. The content is very good, the photographs are adequate (over 100 colour photographs), and for a collector of cacti books this should be an essential buy. The author founded the famous Holly Gate Nursery in Sussex, England and has been quite a prolific author on the subject. His books are much sought after, but there are many more recent books on the subject and these will probably be more pleasing to the buyers eye. New printing techniques and improvements in photography have made the book look somewhat dated. Having said that the book is well written and provides lots of useful information.

Child protective services have interfeared with the way parents discipline their children, for lack of a better phrase, we as American's have strayed off the beaten path. Parents are afraid to punish their kids for fear of retaliation from the government. Also, parents are afraid to tell their kids \\"no\\" afraid to put their kids in \\"time out\\" afraid to do all the things that teach them to good contributing members of society. Now of days, all that children are taught is if you scream and cry and make a scene in public your authority figure will eventually give in and you will get what you want, even though you have behaved in the wrong you will still get the rewards of good behaved children, because your mommy or daddy is too afraid that you will make a scene and someone will call the police and report them for child abuse."},{"Title":"Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect","review":"The book came quickly and came in great condition!

Chapters are logically laid out and interesting for the student of the subject.However,(and this is a big however) this edition does not seem to be very updated for practice in 2004. It also is very American, so the sections on law have less applicablity for Canadian students.Some examples of dated information can be found on page 238, which talks of the use of anotomically correct dolls for child interviews. The use of these dolls (in Canadian child welfare anyway) peaked in the early 1990's. Dolls are generally seen in the field as leading and interviews that still use them would be questionable in court.Also on page 238, there are some interviewing tips that could be seen as somewhat leading. Page 216, makes passing reference to the &quot;emergence of ritual abuse&quot;. Ritual abuse actually emerged in the 1980's and early 1990's and is not accepted as widespread, as originally had been thought. The ritual abuse panic of that period is a bit of an embarrassment for the field.Since the late 1990's there has been a re-definition of practice in child protection (within Canada and in parts of the USA) that has re-focused child welfare on early intervention, early planning and permanency for children. This is in contrast to earlier attempts at family preservation at-all-costs and foster care drift. I think that this text book, although well written, has not been fully updated in this fifth edition. I see 1989 as the first edition date and 1993 as the second edition. I would hazard a guess that this text was very current in 1989 and 1993."},{"Title":"Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect","review":"Crossan-Towers is a fabulous introduction to child abuse and neglect for undergraduates and graduates students alike."},{"Title":"Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect","review":"This is an excellent read for students and people who are just interested in the dynamics of the field of child abuse.

Masters have often expressed their insights in the form of these songs, whose meaning is considered indestructable and unchanging. This particular doha is part of the Kagy&uuml; Gurtso, or \\"Ocean of Kagy&uuml; Songs.\\"From the foreword: \\"Using the vajra song as a starting point, Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul Rinpoche presents both an overview of mahamudra, the heart of the Kagyu teachings, and some very practical advice for those who wish to tread upon the mahamudra path.From the commentary: \\"What is meant by mahamudra? Mahamudra consists basically of three aspects: ground, path, and view mahamudra.\\"Ground mahamudra is the unity of relative truth and ultimate truth. It is freedom from both the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism.\\"Path mahamudra is the union of skillful means and wisdom. (...) one accomplishes the two types of accumulations, merit and wisdom. In essence, the path consists in uniting these two accumulations.\\"Fruition mahamudra is freedom from the extremes of samsara and nirvana. (...) Fruition mahamudra is the realization of the unity of dharmakaya and the form kayas.\\"In other words, mahamudra is recognizing the nature of one's own mind.\\"The book also contains a moving biography of the third Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul by Bokar Rinpoche."},{"Title":"Cloudless Sky","review":"I found this book (in English) in a bookstore in Kathmandu, Nepal.

It is extremely well written and the content held my attention from beginning to end. It is the best account I have ever read regarding the US unmanned space program from the early space race through the Apollo era. The book provides fine accounts of the people and technology involved in the unmanned program, particularly the contributions of the scientists at JPL. I'm awestruck at the technology invented by these scientists and their scientific discoveries. The JPL was often ignored in the shadow of the more popular manned space program. Moreover, I believe the discoveries discussed in \\"Moon Hunters\\" contribute more to space science than the manned space program. The book is easy to read and has extremely intersting information about the planets and moons of our Solar System. Perhaps more remarkable is how the JPL scientists were able to navigate unmanned craft in deep space with such great accuracy to \\"visit\\" the many moons of the solar system."},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"This book is well worth reading if you're interested in space probes. (About half is Voyager related, for any Voyagerphiles out there.) Unfortunately the author deploys a gimmicky writing style that slowed my progress and kind of wore me down. Apparently he's some big-time Time magazine writer, so I suppose he's accustomed to writing for the masses. Definitely some interesting stuff that I hadn't read before though, and I would buy it again. Not sure how to describe the writing issue other than it being overdone. Maybe uses too many fake conversations that he reenacts with implausible detail."},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"This was a pretty easy read about the history of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, especially the unmanned missions to the different moons in the solar system.I couldn't put the book down when I started it. I loved the \\"behind the scenes\\" view into the workings of the JPL project teams, and how they dealt with failures as much as their successes. That and the way that each new discovery is described it gives a very differnent perspective on events you might have read about in a textbook or seen the standard pictures of a million times. I liked reading about the not so-well known events like the fact that Voyager 1 only went to Titan but was then sent outside the plane of the solar system due to the unique orbital encounter with Titan.My only problem is that the copy of the book I had ended with the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Cassini mission was still enroute. Would have liked to read more about the missions to Mars as well as Cassini and any future missions, such as DAWN, Deep Impact, etc..Maybe time for a sequel?"},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"This was an excellent survey of the USA's unmanned missions to explore the solar system. Kluger wisely chose the Ranger program to delve into detail for the first American space program, and his description of the problems of getting a Ranger to the Moon and to fulfill its duty (the first six missions were failures) were a great way to highlight the later successes of the Viking, Mariner and especially, Voyager 1 and 2 missions to the outer planets. He gives an entertaining, if somewhat melodramatic, view of the science and human factors involved in developing space programs. The latter part of the book gives emphasis to the Voyager mission, a good choice to contrast with the early failures of Ranger.It's not stated directly, but the book ultimately makes a great case for the further use of unmanned missions as the most cost-effective way to do scientific exploration in space, as opposed to the stunts of manned missions to the Moon and Mars. The present success of the Cassini mission to Saturn and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers on Mars is making the case stronger still, that unmanned missions are the way to go if you really want to do science in space."},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"The writer often uses too many adjectives. The book is however full of interesting tidbits of information about the science returned from voyager etc. It also has some interesting anecdotes about the people and events surrounding a mission.Over all : a good book to get you started on solar system science-kg"},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"Kluger has tackled the task of covering the complete history of the exploration of the solar system's moons. In 320 pages Kluger has managed to fill a long standing gap in the historic documentation of space exploration. Beginning with the Ranger projects of the 1960's the author continues summarizing the major planetary/moon visits up until this time (2001). While, in so few pages, the book cannot delve into the level of technical and management detail that many would like to see, the author has done justice to the task in so few pages. Kluger has gone well beyond the usual abbreviated technical presentations found in NASA/JPL news releases.This book should prove of great interest to engineers involved in space and ocean exploration where technical failure is a constant threat. Those who practice engineering understand that learning how things fail is as important as learning how things succeed and Kluger has shown several examples of the engineering difficulties and work arounds that led to the most far reaching and remarkable exploratory effort in human history. From a scientific perspective the author has done a nice job summarizing the scientific interests and expectations for the known moons in the solar system.This book will prove to be a good one source reading for a concise summary of planetary exploration to this time."},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its intended audience is probably those who have an interest in space, without being true fanatics (I use that term in a good way), since a great deal of what is presented in the book probably would be well-known to the long-time enthusiast. It should also be enlightening for those who just wish to learn more about the early space program and some of the robot probes first sent to the outer solar system.The book is arranged chronologically and begins with the Ranger program, which was intended to send probes crashing into our own moon. This may be a program readers under 30 or so will have very little knowledge of (this reviewer is slightly older than that and still had little working knowledge of it). This portion of the book is most effective in its descriptions of the personalities involved (again, most of whom most people have never heard of) and the long, tedious, error-prone process by which these things got off the ground and to their eventual destination. The descriptions of the various problems that caused the first Rangers to fail is enlightening and shows how difficult spaceflight was (and is) even when the mission is fairly simple. Also of particular interest is the effects of failure on programs and personnel; recent events regarding the shuttle fleet show that constant vigilance on quality and safety issues are a recurring, probably an intrinsic, problem within NASA and really any organization.I would have liked more discussion on the followup Surveyor missions, but from that point focus shifts outwards to the outer planets, and Mars and Venus. The Voyager program is where the book hits its stride, describing the inception of the program and the tradeoffs that had to be made within congressional budget constraints. Also fascinating is the explanation of how these things are navigated through space a billion miles away, a tedious job that most people don't think about. It is sure to increase our respect for the accomplishment of flying a small, barely-powered spacecraft to within a few thousands of miles away from a moon from over a billion miles away. It was truly an extraordinary accomplishment.The later missions, Casini and Galileo, are probably more familiar to most readers so the novelty somewhat wears off at this point. There is still a good deal of useful information, much of which did not make it into the general news media so it is worth reading for this reason.The great strength of the book is its descriptions of the spacecraft systems themselves and the personalities that built and flew them. The instruments, how they worked (or didn't), and the myriad of small things that had to go exactly right for the mission to succeed makes this book an excellent read for the technologically interested. Just as remarkable are the systems that didn't work and the ways the engineers and flight controllers worked around them. Less effective, though necessary of course, are the scientific examinations of the moons themselves and what was learned about them. However, this is a minor quibble and Kluger handles these issues effectively, providing enough detail for context but not getting bogged down in planetary detail. All in all, definitely a worthwhile read if you are at all interested in this aspect of NASA's history of unmanned spaceflight."},{"Title":"Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar Systems","review":"The content is not bad, not technical enough, and, frankly, the book is definitly too short to cover those 60 moons.

Having arrived at 63 Svechnoi Street, he meets Anna Sergeyevna and her daughter Matryona in their apartment. This is the place where is son Pavel Alexandrovich used to reside before his recent death. In deep grief, Fyodor Mikhailovich covers his face with his hands and tears run over his fingers as he discovers his son's room. &quot;I am the one who is dead, he thinks; or rather, I died but my death failed to arrive.&quot; Such are the thoughts that burden Fyodor Mikhailovich's mind as the hunger to talk about his son and to hear others talk about him rises in him. There is no one present to strike his hair, no murmurs of consolation in his ear.Mr Coetzee places himself between known facts and Dostoevski's fiction, as Fyodor Mikhailovich seeks the truth about his son's death. Indeed, the circumstances of his death remain obscure because Pavel Alexandrovich was the member of a gang lead by Sergei Gennadevich Nechaev. This student anarchist movement became notorious for having murdered one of its own members...A tour de force, Mr Coetzee's novel reflects on the relation of writers to events. It's also a touching account of a father's deep grief and his painful adjustment to the past of his son.

He signs himself only as &quot;Artie&quot; and sends along a photograph of a young priest, killed for &quot;the sin of recklessness&quot;. &quot;One down&quot;, is part of the warning.Kline's interviews the parents and family of a murdered young woman in Boston, as part of his ongoing research, and meets the driven and enigmatic FBI agent, Veronica Pace. Her ties to the investigation of the murder seem to be only peripherally professional.Kline, a widower, understands the loneliness and regrets which haunt the survivors of the murder victims he interviews. Although the death he experienced was &quot;expected&quot; one, it nonetheless shattered dreams of a future shared with someone with whom he had chosen to live and grow old. Death changed and interrupted his life, even as it ended his wife's. This insight serves him well as he pursues a killer who is intent on dispensing his own category of justice. Luber provides the reader with an admirable selection of well motivated potential killers, each reacting to their personal losses in a variety of destructive ways. The clues are there and fair, and the d&eacute;nouement may be a head slapper to those readers too busy with being caught up in the excitement to pay close attention to the clues."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"This book gives excellent -- thorough, concise, and well-documented -- answers to questions that some people have about why the Catholic Church believes and teaches what it does -- especially those aspects of Catholicism with which many Protestants vehemently disagree. The questions in the book are posed exactly as the Protestants who submitted them asked them -- complete with Scripture quotations that supposedly \\"prove\\" their position against Catholic teaching; and this book does a wonderful job of answering these questions by quoting the Bible extensively -- as well as very early Christian writings which show that the beliefs that are being defended really do go back to apostolic times. This book also explains where, how, and why the Bible is often quoted out of context to make an argument against certain aspects of Catholic teaching or practice. This book is gentle enough to give to Protestant friends without much fear of insulting them (This is the only apologetics book I've ever given to Protestant friends, even though I've read many different -- and excellent -- apologetics books) I own & have read both \\"Where Is THAT in the Bible?\\" and \\"Why is That in Tradition?\\" (both by Patrick Madrid), but I think that this book is superior even to those other two excellent books by the same author."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"This is the perfect book to give to any of your Protestant friends who question your Catholic faith. In it, Patrick Madrid literally takes fifty of the top questions and arguments that Protestants throw at Catholics to debunk their faith and uses solid, extensive Biblical evidence to answer them. In using the Bible as the primary force in each rebuttal, Madrid uses the one weapon that works best when talking to Protestants. Since Catholic Tradition holds little weight in these arguments, Madrid makes mention of them but always goes to great lengths to use the Bible first and foremost.Another reason to give this book to Protestants is that Madrid's writing style is a lot easier to swallow than, say, Karl Keating. Though Keating is definitely one of the best Catholic apologists around, he does sometimes come across as a brutish force when defending his faith. Don't get me wrong, his fire is impressive and necessary, but Madrid manages to get his point across without being as blunt as Keating.Had I read this book before I myself came home to the Church in 2000, it definitely would have been one of the key reasons that I became Catholic. But now I'm glad that I have it to give to any and every person who is interested in the faith.This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to both Catholics and non-Catholics. It will not only strengthen your faith as a Christian, it will also make you more prepared to take on a barrage of questions about your faith. Another good book to pick up, and the one that did solidify my decision to become Catholic is \\"Why Do Catholics Do That?\\" by Kevin Orlin Johnson. Much like Madrid, Johnson takes an easier to swallow approach in answering questions about the faith. It's highly recommend."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"This is a great book for catholics and non-catholics alike. This is a must-read for anyone who has questions about the catholic faith. The author is very clear and enable you to better defend your faith."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"Anyone who shares with other Christians that he is a member of a church that largely adheres to the historic Christian faith and practice is bound to have been challenged by a barrage of questions based largely on a complete misreading of Church history promoted in more sectarian circles. Because historic forms of Christianity have a more holistic approach to the faith whose parts are interrelated in a cohesive whole, giving a thorough understanding to someone used to dealing with isolated propositions in digestible soundbites can be difficult and often border on the impossible. Patrick Madrid gives an example of how this can be accomplished in his book Answer Me This! as he responds to fifty of the most common objections to Catholicism.While Madrid is concerned primarily with bolstering Catholic claims, many of the points are equally valid for Orthodox, Anglicans, and others seeking a degree of catholicity within their own traditions. The questions are grouped by topic with the more fundamental objections coming first and ones reliant on these erroneous assumptions following. This is an important feature since sometimes the question given is built upon an unmentioned assumption that isn't true. The reader could then take the discussion back to the more basic issue and work from there.The approach is not to give a thorough presentation of patristic or contemporary Catholic theology but merely to respond to particular points of attack. The focus is usually kept to disarming the opponent rather than attacking him. With this goal in mind, the reader can fire back with biblical and historical evidence and give the opponent food for thought. The fact that many recent converts to Catholicism mention that they raised similar objections until someone shocked them by responding with counterarguments gives testimony to the effectiveness of the approach.As for the arguments themselves, much of it is pretty basic stuff to those who know some Church history and an understanding of the development of the Canon of Holy Scripture. It is here that is the book's strength. Rather than try to beat the opponent into submission with a barrage of information and a condescending tone, Madrid gives quick and easily understood arguments that neutralize objections and lead to further points of discussion.The points where many informed readers will part with Madrid is in his treatment of doctrines that are peculiar to Rome. His treatment of the papacy seems forced by comparison to much of the rest of the book and does not face the most important and common objections to papal claims given by Orthodox and traditional Anglicans. Yet, even with these areas of difference, Madrid gives a strong tool for overcoming many fallacies concerning historic Christianity and for this Answer Me This! is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"Answer Me This is a very wise choice for a Catholic who would like to know the Church's answers to the claims of the doorstep protestants and anti-catholics. An excellent choice for a Catholic layman who wants answers but doesn't want to sit and read volumes and volumes of Cathecism proof for the Catholic (apostolic) position. ;)Some of the most frequently asked questions about the Catholic faith are addressed in this book.I give this book three stars because it is a great point of beginning for contending for \\"the faith that was once delivered to the saints\\"-St. Jude It is short, quick, and has the essence of the truth about Catholic teaching, and answers why Catholic's teach these things. Yet it is not nearly the whole of apologetic answers that can offered to our curious but mislead nu-Christian brothers. It's good ground to build on.A Great place to start, fun, and interesting book with great pointers. Honest, unbaised, unpassionate. Madrid is pointing to the bible and offering the apostles and saints take on Scripture.\\"we can learn a lot about what Scripture actually means by studying how the early saints and apostles took it to mean\\"-Frank Sheed."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"This is an excellent book on the Biblical basis for Catholic beliefs. It is an easy read and an excellent reference book for later."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"This is a great work by Mr. Madrid. It's an book for Catholic apologetic, and it surely does what it promises to. In fact, I think this is one of the best books on the topic, if not the best. It goes straight to the point, and gives some very good insight. I've read lots of apologetics books, and some are just to \\"dense\\" to be used for basic apologetics, like trying to bring your close friends or relatives to the Catholic faith. Those are great, don't get me wrong, but maybe don't go straight to the point, and if I lend those books, people won't read them, or won't understand. So, what good is an apologetics book that doesn't do the job?This book does! And is based on good research, with lots of clever reasoning, good data, and historic insight. It uses more than bible interpretation, or Church teaching. It also has great logical interpretation, like when he quotes one of his debates with protestants. I do recommend this book to everyone.P.S. - sometimes I think people review books without placing them on their rightful place, the right category. They buy this small book of straight-talk apologetics, like it, but take stars out of the grading because it's not a thick scholarly book. Well, they new what they would get. If it delivered on its premise, so it deserves better grading. And this book delivers!"},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"As previous reviews stated, this book seems less offensive to non-Catholics, also it's a good book for Catholics to brush up on the Church's teachings.I gave this review only 4 stars, because although his answers are in accord with the Church's present day teachings, I would have preferred that the Bi-Partisan Cardinals, medling curia, and Pope John Paul II had continued on with Pope John XXIII's Vatican II.For an excellent read on this topic I would suggest the book \\"A Crisis Of Conscience by Hugh R.K. Barber, M.D."},{"Title":"Answer Me This!","review":"I read both Patrick Madrid's Where is That in the Bible? and Why is that in Tradition? While I have respect for Catholics and believe that many of them have true faith in Jesus, I do not agree with many of the Catholic beliefs and doctrines. I am a Christian but I am interested in what Catholics believe because I have many friends who are Catholics. Before reading this book I had, in my lifetime, read the entire Bible, the Vatican II documents, and studied the Catholic canons. That was enough to convince me that many of the Catholic teachings are not in the Bible, and even go against the teachings of the Bible. This book failed to convince me otherwise."},{"Title":"Le Hibou et La Poussiquette","review":"I have loved this book since I took conversational French many years ago and it was recommended by my teacher. It preserves the rhythm of the original poem by Edward Lear, yet it is French, very French. The boat is \\"canary yellow\\" instead of \\"pea-green\\", and it's a \\"letter of credit\\", not a \\"five pound note\\", yet amazingly it is almost word for word from the English. The illustrations are also beautiful.

The first was Hunter Thompson's autobiographical \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\\" That book, to me, was the scariest ever. Wolfe's, however, fascinated me. The difference I think is clear. Thompson was totally under the influence and control of drugs while covering a law-enforcement convention in Sin City. Wolfe is just an observer, not a user, as he follows Ken Kesey (respected author of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" \\"Sometimes a Great Notion,\\" and other books) and his band of Merry Pranksters on their cross-country drug-soaked bus journey, to their settlement in the hills of California, their deep association with the Hell's Angel's and Jerry Garcia's Grateful Dead, and concluding with their Electric Kool Aid Acid tests before Kesey's escape to Mexico and eventual return to the states and imprisonment. Where as Albert and Leary were interested in the scientific aspects of LSD, Kesey and his bunch were more involved with the fun of it. It's a long book covering over three years of the mid-1960s and is filled with repeated drug episodes. Yet, Wolfe's almost poetic style keeps the book from being repetitious and moving along with the speed of speed. Almost as fascinating as the story he tells is the style in which he tells it. It is filled with hundreds of various adjectives, most of which I had never seen or heard before, but the sounds of the words alone make their meanings clear. On top of language, Wolfe piles unusual punctuation and capitalization to add to the color and sense of his descriptions. And he thankfully adds an Epilogue at the end of his book to tell how he was able to get into the heads of the Pranksters to give a true accounting of what happened. The epilogue turns what could be construed as fiction into non-fiction. I'm glad I read the book. I'm glad I wasn't along on the trips."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"A psychedelic adventure into days long passed, the story of Ken Kesey and his merry pranksters is one not to miss. Tom wolfe the master story teller envelops the reader into a story of a revolution, of Acid, individuals and ideas taking place in the magical world of the 60's that we of the younger generation cannot understand. As a member of the younger generation who wasn't around to experience the world as it was then, it gladens me that Mr Wolfe has compiled a description of how others may have seen it when they were there. each character, each location is meticulously set out so the reader can truly understand the world as it twisted and turned around these people, how they didn't change for society, but society changed for them. Thank you Mr. Wolfe i enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Tom Wolfe is not a hippie. Through this book, however, he succesfully showed us what an ideal hippie life would be like, and the expierences hippies encounter. Be it a Day-Glo paint-splashed forest or an LSD addict who eventually leaves The Bus (the mode of transportation Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters use which contains a water cooler laced with LSD), or a visit from the Hell's Angels, this book is intense and interesting. Do not start it on a busy day, you'll lose track of time while reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book is about how LSD can essentially take a person into the beyond and how Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters did just that.

The book has the ability to make a long plane trip a lot less plain and much more trip. Essentially a peek into the realm of Ken Kesey during the 60's but his experiences....you wouldn't believe. Crashing a Unitarian Church conference, staging Kesey's death, partying with the Hell's Angels. It doesn't get much better than this.

This was the beginning of the 60's drug culture and the cast of characters aboard the bus are fascinating. An entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Trying to sum up The Electric Kool-Acid Test. By Tom Wolfe, in one word is impossible. So I won't try. This enticing piece of literary journalism dives into the counter-cultural upheavals that were the 60's. It follows Ken Kesey and his merry band of pranksters as they travel across the United States, and parts of Mexico, spreading self-awareness, as well as a good deal of hallucinogenic drugs. Their efforts were aimed to shake the roots of conformist, consumerist society to its core and understand the purpose of human existence along the way. In effect \\"transcending the bull****\\", that is a stereotypical existence. They were a group devoted to the \\"here and now\\" and. Along the path they meet with the likes of Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, Thomas Leary, and the police. This book details their journey, it drags you through the ocean of this decade and pulls you out, wet, but better informed about what lies at the bottom of the sea.Some contend that this is a muddled account of the era, one with too many characters and not enough plot, that the details are superfluous and that in the end it fails to convey the true spirit of the times. Sadly, they are wrong.This diary of history is outstanding not only in literary technique, but also because it recognizes an elemental theme of American culture; change. It is \\"our strange and haunting paradox in America- that we are fixed and certain only when we are in movement\\", as stated by Tom Wolfe. The Acid Test records these movements and sets them in stone for future generations to look back upon, and expand upon. His insight into sociological trends is wisdom for generations to come. It parallels the counter-cultural movements of the 60's: the Psychedelic movement, the Free love movement, the summer of love, the rebellion of youth against authority and conformity, the beat generation. Here is an essential key to understanding not only the past, but modern American culture as it exists today. The growing sense of independence and uniqueness is still felt by today's generations. Freedom of expression is still a controversial issue. Finding something more in existence and \\"transcending the bull****\\" is what so many still strive for today.The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, by Tom Wolfe is an essential read simply due to its interesting nature, but also because it shows the basis of American culture as well as its future, change."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I've savored just about every word this man's ever written.

He's always been our keenest observer of American culture, on subjects ranging from hippies, art snobs, wall street, the space race, to the Southern nouveau-riches.In terms of unadulterated reading enjoyment, however, this book is still my favorite. He captures the era perfectly. This was the period in the mid-sixties when the hippie philosophy and lifestyle was still genuine, before it had become commercially exploited by the mass media, before Manson and Altamont and the seeds of evil.

What is almost as amazing as the lengths to which the pranksters went to enjoy their existence on Earth, is the style that Wolfe has chosen to narrate the adventures. Brillliantly blending stream of consciousness writing and a journalistic sense of description, Wolfe immerses himself in Kesey's world in an attempt to understand the thoughts of a group of adults who would paint a school bus with day-glo colors and trek across the United States with pitchers full of acid and a video camera keeping an eye on it all. Who could resist a chance to find out what it was like to spend a quaint evening in the woods reaching altered states of consciousness with a group of Hell's Angels, or taking a peek inside the world of the budding hippie stars led by a youthful Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. Whether or not you approve of massive drug use will not impact your liking of this book, and for anyone who takes an interest in the counterculture movement this book is a must-read.

Tom Wolfe's masterpiece &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,&quot; is an absolutely amazing book written about a group of Hippies hell-bent on spreading they're organized chaos throughout the nation. Apart from the subject matter (which I'll get to) this book is as well written as you could imagine. Somehow, Wolfe captured the experiences of the Merry Pranksters with his writing style. His use of the elipses (...), run on sentances, and his insightful commentary actually puts the reader into this experience. The experience itself is a whirlwind journey accross the US, in a cloud of pot-smoke, a rush of speed and a series of mescaline and lsd induced hallucinations. All the while, this seemingly nonsensical journey is carefully laid out as only Wolfe could have done. To read a book about 15 men and women that travel the nation not knowing right from left, Wolfe explains everything in stunning imagery and intense detail. Whether or not you approve or liked the hippies movement, and even if your offended by drug related subject matter, you should read this book. As a purely literary work, it's easily top 10, and as a story of the acid movement and a historical look at the 60's, there's none better."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book probably gives the most detailed and essential guide to the sixties. Being a teenager now, i have no idea what the time period was like, but after reading Tom Wolfes book, i have a pretty good idea.The book delves into the heart of 60's America, giving (in as much detail as possible i think) a wierd and wonderful account of people, pranks and LSD. The book is written in a style i have never come across before, Wolfe using very inventive terms. The style itself is used mainly to re-create the feel of the time period, getting the feel of being 'On The Bus', and providing fantastic results.Kesey and the Merry Pranksters aren't given bias either. They aren't praised or put down and that gives the book an extra strength. Wolfe using a 3rd person account, simply tells a story (and what a story).Some parts of the book are somewhat longwinded, but on a whole its a masterpiece, quite simply a classic. Its certainly different, sometimes providing a somewhat LSD account of things, but wasn't that the sixties in a nut-shell? Probably. This is what Tom Wolfe set out to create, and how well he manages it.Reading it now you'll think, &quot;Wouldn't it be great to experiance the sixties for myself. Being on the bus, grooving with Kesey and the Pranksters, playing the cops and robbers game...&quot; and then you realise you only went and got born in the 80's!Still, opening the book again will transport there in the comfort of your own home. 'ELECTRIC' and 'KOOL', a must-read."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Regardless of one's ultimate attitudes about the permissive atmosphere that prevailed during the Pandora's Box that became the 1960's, Thomas Wolfe's detailed, passionate and fascinating portrait of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters makes for required reading.Whether for ill or well, Kesey and the Pranksters are responsible for creating much of what the popular masses call &quot;The 60's&quot;. While reading this book, that mere (and ironic) fact becomes ever so clear.When I recently visited Kesey at his ranch in Oregon, I asked him if Wolfe &quot;got it right&quot;. Kesey's response? &quot;Yes he did. But understand that he (Wolfe) gives a real East Coast version of what was essentially a West Coast phenomenon.&quot;What I think that means essentialy validates many of the other positive reviews of this book: Wolfe uncannily possesses the ability to be &quot;in the Pranster's world, but not of it&quot;.This means that while Wolfe is fully willing and able to passionately incorperate the unique linguistic acrobatics of Kesey and the Pranksters in relating the narrative, he maintains somehow a cool, objective distance from all the proceedings. Kesey might be saying that while Wolfe was certainly &quot;on the bus&quot;, he was never &quot;ON THE BUS!&quot;.This distance is communicated and maintained by Wolfe's refusal to judge the shennanigans. He never really says &quot;yay&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; to the invention of the &quot;counter culture&quot; (whatever in the hell that means). He relates the consequences both natural and man-made that befalls on such behavior, but never comes out from behind the page and says &quot;booh!&quot;He wisely leaves all moral judgement in the place where it rightly belongs: in the hearts and minds of the readers.It is not a book for the weak of back, heart or mind. It will challenge the reader as well as entertain for Wolfe pulls no punches and that is a treatment most appropriate for the Hemingway-esque machismo frat boy jock mentality that underlies all of Kesey's art.The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is a excellent example of brilliant reporting. It combines stunning writing with cool logic and impassioned empathetic distance. This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Two chapters in I'm heading to Wikipedia to see if this is fiction like other Wolfe novels I have enjoyed or a true story. This is the quisistential book of the 60s, the influence of LSD and how America drastically changed from the conservative 50s to the forgettable 70s. This is not a quick read, and frankly, I could have stood about 50 pages fewer. But it is so bizarre, so unbelievable, and so well documented that it is a must read.From a personal perspective, I list my minor LSD experiences of the early 70s as one of the top 10 most important experiences of my life. This book completes the story and shows the actual history of LSD and the glorious years before it was a crime and before the drug had been widely discovered. The crux of the book is that Ken Kesey, leader of the Merry Pranksters, chooses to turn on America including the Hells Angels, to an alternative lifestyle, the self discovery of LSD phase of mind enhancing. Such is the journey that Kesey attempts to introduce to his band and to America on a cross country journey aboard a 1939 International Harvester bus painted in neon colors. Yes, welcome back to the beginning of the hippie culture.While I do not consider the book in my Top 10 list as suggested by so many, this is a worthwhile read I recommend by anyone wanting to explore America culture and one of our greatest writers of the last 50 years."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Wow. I really did not realize the social, economical, and cultural importance of the drug acid. Tom Wolfe brilliantly explains how the once legal drug influenced a whole generation of \\"merry pranksters,\\" expanding their minds and consciousness. \\"Electric Kool-Aid\\" describes the travels of the Merry Pranksters (a group of \\"hippies\\" on a pilgrimage from Cali to New York) and the colorful characters that join them. From the Hell's Angels to Ginsberg, Wolfe informs the reader of various \\"acid tests\\" and how the life of Ken Kesey and Neal Cassady influenced this genre of living. Even the Grateful Dead are included (prior to reading this book, I did not realize that the drug acid also produced the genre of music titled \\"acid rock\\").I would reccommend this book to anyone seeking the thrill of an acid trip without the acid. Wolfe's formal writing aspects deliever a message that perhaps, yes, the 60s was indeed a horror show, mirroring such events as Vietnam and lousy political leaders such as Nixon. Despite all of the chaos, a group of intelligent and charasmatic patrons decided to expand their horizons and indeed imerse themselves in the \\"Electric Kool Aid Test.\\""},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Boy, where to begin. To start I must say Tom Wolfe is truly a gifted writer, this book works because is was written by a non-judgemental third party, in this case Wolfe, who told you how it was. Wolfe lets you form your own opinion, without his getting in the way, though on most points you would tend to agree with him. This is not just a story of Kesey and the Pranksters, Wolfe gets all of the little nuances,i.e the passages on Hesse, Nietzche etc. could they have fit the bill for a prankster? The book only has one major flaw, but it is not Tom Wolfe's or Ken Kesey's fault. The fault is the book came out in 1968, or it was published in a magazine I dont know I was not alive then, acid experimentation was pretty new and hardly anyone, at least no one in the book, experienced a flashback. So in turn the book seems like an add for acid use, which will turn off so more conservative readers, and it doesnt bring to light some of the possible detremental effects, but its no fault of Wolfe, so read this great piece of literature, not propganda."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"In a magic time and in a place far away from that we know today, evolutionary forces combined into a \\"perfect storm\\" that separated a generation of college youth from the rest of American culture, like none before it. America would change forever.The era of the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean and others with happy music faded with the emergence of rock, folk songs of protest and THE PILL. It was the magic era of sex, drugs and rock and roll. No city was more affected than San Francisco and the entire Bay Area.Conservative Stanford University was transformed into something unrecognizable to earlier graduates. Walls of the City were plastered with psychedelic poster art promoting nightly concerts and opposing the Vietnam war. Living in the park or on the bus became an acceptable lifestyle for college grads.The movement was of course not limited to San Francisco, but spread to colleges across the country. Cloistered engineering students suddenly marveled at their first sight of braless coeds bouncing across the campus, freed not only of their physical restraints but also of the threat of unplanned pregnancy and relieved of their home grown inhibitions thanks to magic brownies, a shared waterpipe and a culture which rejected anything attached to those over 30. Across the country at Harvard Learey was moving acid from the lab to the party. Soon the experiments were embraced by the San Francisco area culture.Wolfe was there to capture Keasey, the Pranksters and the magic of an era. The bus trip symbolized a revolution that swept the land. Although it may be difficult for the younger generation to understand this was a revolution, primarily fueled by the post war babies who had known only good times. The pill gave women what appeared to be, for the first time, the opportunity to have sex without physical consequences and the mood of the time removed any social consequences and for the first time TV was bringing war into the living room as it was happening.It was an era when most cities had only six or seven TV channels, phones were expensive, the internet was a generation away and music came on 33 rpm records. Most college rebellions were limited to swallowing goldfish, raiding the girl's dorms for panties and drinking limitless quantities of beer. Deans who a few years previously had expelled students for sneaking their sports cars under parking gates now hoped their younger brothers and sisters would not burn down the administration building, blow up the ROTC facility or at least refrain from running naked and having public sex during parent's weekend.Forty years later the book stirs memories of that magic era. For those who never knew the times the book may be difficult to understand. Perhaps this will help, take one bottle of good red wine, a Jan and Dean CD plus Jopplin, Baez, Grateful Dead, Hendrix and early Beetle CDs and start with Jan and Dean and a glass of wine. When the first cd ends and the Dead begin, start the book.Wolfe, like Clancey, Bach and other writers created early works that aged like fine wines while later works seem to have the mass produced taste of corporate vintages. Focused, concentrated, intensely flavorful and timeless - these early works are the best.. For those who focus more on the contents of their library than their garage, this is the time to find a first edition to keep as a gift to the next generation."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"My journalist heroes are usually the lefties who expose the horrible outcomes of greed. You know the type: Upton Sinclair, Michael Moore, and Amy Goodman. They pop the tinsel-draped myths of corporations and nations, and reveal the horrible outcomes of excessive power. It was hard, then, to read a conservative journalist's skewering of my own 1960s countercultural heroes. Ken Kesey and his band of experimental hippies get fully cynical treatment at the skilled hands of Wolfe. In Wolfe's hands the hippies are daft and nave, out of touch with the world they want to save, and out of touch with themselves.It's an extreme portrait of an exaggerated and unusual bunch of hippies, but an effective one nonetheless. You might even see in this book some of the reasons why the far fringes of the movement failed to win over a larger audience, and also why the Nixon/Reagan/Bush backlash had an easy target. Ah--but that is the problem with Wolfe's book: he's chosen a slow-moving and ripe piece of fruit. It's easy to lampoon the words of people who are high on marijuana or hallucinating on LSD. From the outside these little trips (as well as their greater voyage) might seem confused and pointless. But in the process of such dismissals, Wolfe misses what was indeed one of the most revolutionary and powerful movements to enter American culture.The book remains funny and well-written. It's also a key historical document. But here's my question: it is really about the hippies? Or does it instead foreshadow the rise of the conservative culture war?"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Of course historical content is rich and plentiful in this book. The Watt's Riot, the Berkley anti-war rally, the Beatles, Hell's Angels and the Trip's Festival and much more are mentioned. However, the writing style of Tom Wolfe made this book a bit difficult to delve into with continued motivation. It's understood that Wolfe was attempting to create the atmosphere for the book; however it really made the book less enjoyable and a bit confusing at times. Wolfe's writing style appeared to have no rhyme or reason, as was probably the point since those in the book were usually under the influence of drugs, but it was found to be hard to follow and frankly, quite annoying. His constant use of improper grammar and reference to artists and other historical figures with no explanation as to what he's referring to. I think this book would be most enjoyed by someone who can relate to the '60s and not someone who wants a better understanding. Or perhaps you have to be stoned, I'm not sure, I mostly found it annoying."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book is definitely a must read in the canon of American literature. Wolfe, as always, does an excellent job in his journalistic role, placing himself with Mailer and Capote in this area. However, the one unfortunate part of this book is that if you ARE reading it then you ARE NOT currently engaged in reading one of Kesey's own books, which is a shame. If you haven't read Kesey, you must. If you've read CUCKOOS NEST, you have to read SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION. If you haven't read SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION, you have my condolences."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"My first review; reader beware, it'll suck.This book, however, does not suck. Tom Wolfe's writing has always unnerved me, while also stimulating/invigorating many of my seldom-used brain pathways. Electric Kool-aid Acid Test is written in Wolfe's usual manic lots-of-words-but-every-word-means-something-explosive style...he explores drug trips better than anyone I've ever read before, his descriptions are packed with ever-expansive meaning and valuable details, etc. I picked up this book to learn a bit more about Ken Kesey, and ended up learning a lot more about a lot of other things.The mid-sixties seem like very extraordinary times to young people today, in part due to chronicles like this one. There are certainly people in this book that are larger-than-life, and were trying to make life larger.This is a book about pushing the boundaries, about mapping terra incognita, about vast underground movements that are still shaking the foundations...it's a trip, and ultimately, it's a reminder that even the most well-outfitted expeditions must end at some point, and the adventurers will grow older and must return to their nests."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Aside from the random incoherent blather throughout the book, Tom Wolfe delivers a liberal rendition of the life and times of famed author Ken Kesey and his Day-Glo cohorts-the Merry Pranksters.In 1964 let's paint a 1939 International Harvester school bus in bright, fluorescent colors...paint each other in lively primary pigments, drop LSD, smoke weed and travel across country. The world was not quite ready for this craze...but it was just a matter of time. Give it a couple years.We meet such characters as Mountain Girl, Gretchen Fetchin, June the Goon, Hermit, Stark Naked, Mary Microgram, Terry the Tramp, the Mad Chemist, LSD manufacturer Owsley, Marge the Barge, Doris Delay and of course Neal Cassady (from Kerouac days), Babbs, Kesey's wife Faye, the Grateful Dead and many others.Kesey and his pot busts, the various electric Kool-Aid acid tests, the Trips Festival, fugitive in Mexico, turning on the Hell's Angels and basically the entire sixties culture and musical world. Wow Ken! You sure started something...or at least brought it to the forefront.A fun and enlightening read, apart from the haphazard drivel...brings back memories."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I am so excited to get into this book.

I enjoyed reading about the epic adventure that Key Kesey, the main character who is suble and alegorical in his methode of comunication amongst the other characters. Unlike most modern central characters he is not a mook begging attention but quite the oppisite.

I heard so much about it and was surprised when I also found it in the library, multiple copies, under classics.I really like historical counts of the sixties counter culture but this never kept my interest to keep picking it up again. If you finally got interested in something, to follow along like a story or a sensible account, it just dropped it. I never found myself really caring about the people involved. Everything was just there, but the people were acting like everything they did had some great meaning, and it just seemed tired.I got thru 150 pages. I had to quit. I skimmed the rest of it really really quickly to get the jist of it. I looked up a summary of the book on the net, and I didn't miss anything in the plot. I wanted to like this book. But, no go.Maybe you just had to be there...or be \\"zonked\\"...."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"There is no plot or development. There is no structure.

Unfortunately, I feel as though I was misled. I made it about 160 some odd pages before I stopped reading in lieu of another novel.Although, to clarify, I do see how many view Wolfe as a revolutionary and a great philosopher of American culture. There were times in the novel where I saw glimpses of genius. However, Wolfe seemed to be his own worst enemy in my opinion. His train of thought was, well \\"elusive\\" at best and sporadic and fleeting at worst.I also would acknowledge that the book aims to capture a generation that rebelled against tradition, even in its writing style. Yet I do not feel it was done in a way that was able to also keep a fluidity to the novel.Someone suggested reading after a few glasses of wine... maybe I should have tried that."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The only possible explaination for this atrocious book is that Tom Wolfe himself was partaking of the mind altering chemicals.Tom Wolfe must have been under the influence when he wrote this atrocious book. It's just not enjoyable on ANY level. He rambles on for pages in what I assume is his attempt to convey the psychedelic experience to his readers and it just doesn't work. Perhaps if you have never taken these drugs you might find this kind of drivel persuasive but for me it was just silly.Tom Wolfe really comes of age in Bonfire and Simmons."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Though I think the sixties were an interesting time period in American history, I could just not get into this book whastoever. If you were there and understood what went on in San Fransisco in the 60s, you might love this book. But I think that it's the most nonsensical piece of crap I have ever come across. At first, the book is interesting, but you have to admit that 432 pages is a BIT too much for completely incoherent acid ramblings, right?The book is so unbelievably disjointed that I thought briefly that maybe \\"Tom Wolfe\\" was an alias for an experiment that involved a million monkeys on a million typewriters. But unfortunately it is the great journalist who wrote this, who by the way is responsible for a number of fascinating books like Bonfire of the Vanities. Say it isn't so.I hate to knock Wolfe, but I could write a better, more coherent book than this if I went up to a computer and typed completely random thoughts and words for an hour. Maybe this book is why so many people hate hippies. If you were there and have taken acid, you will love this book. Others will think, \\"God, no wonder acid is illegal now, since so-called books like this were actually written under the influence of it and printed to bore readers out of their minds!\\""},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Haven't had much time to read this yet.

If you like Hunter, dont expect much from this."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"An interesting review of the era of drugs and rock and roll that characterized the 1960s. However Tom Wolfe's writing style is not for me. Run on sentences that go on for half a page and restate the same point more than once. Ken Kesey's life and the antics of his followers is interesting but could have been told with 50% of the words used by Wolfe."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I've always been somewhat fascinated by hippies; the free spirit, the promotion of love and peace and the desire to move away from materialism. The problem for me was the drugs. I had some experiences with the books titular drug but only a handful of tries. I found it too stupefying particularly since I was in college and needed to keep some semblance of wits about me. I was born as the hippie movement was on the down swing and by the time I was in high school and college the movement was moribund. It's not a criticism to say that the book was not what I expected and the hippies seem less concerned about peace and love and more concerned about being high 24/7.The book follows Ken Kesey, author of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", and his merry band of Prankster as they drive around the U.S. in their day-glo school bus dropping acid and doing pretty much any drug they can get their hands on. What's interesting is that the book is basically written in the third person omniscient with the reader delving right into the very private thoughts of the Pranksters despite the writer not being present during a vast majority of the activities. Wolfe was helped immensely by the extreme narcissism of the merry pranksters who filmed almost everything they did and loved to talk about their experiences. The intention was to edit the film into a monumental movie but what seems AWESOME while tripping on acid may be far less so to a sober audience. I suspect it played out about as well as it would if I tried to splice my home movies into a theatrical release.The journey is less an acid trip and more an ego trip. My image of hippies advocating \\"flower power\\" and \\"ban the bomb\\" and putting flowers in gun barrels is completely absent here. This is all about hedonism, self indulgence and attracting as much attention to yourself as possible. It is essentially a group addiction dressed up as something revolutionary or evolutionary. Even when Kesey was being hunted by the Feds and the Mexican police down south of the border he would still drop acid and smoke weed at every opportunity. That isn't clear thinking, that's being out of control. The only thing they seemed really good at was throwing legendary parties but that's not exactly going to move a society.I knew a guy back in high school who dropped enough acid that he thought the world was coming to an end and stole a police car. He once told me that a large group of people were getting together on bicycles to ride downtown and cause \`maximum capacity' i.e. block traffic through sheer volume. I said, \`so you're basically going to be a jackass'. A few decades later and now he's a far right wing conservative, a transition that seems less uncommon than one might think. I did a little research on some of the Merry Pranksters and their lives today. Some are dead but most do seem consistent through the years and genuinely interested in making a positive difference but unless this book is painting an unfair picture of Ken Kesey his chief concern really does appear to be himself.Regardless of whether Kesey was a prophet or a goof this is an absolutely fascinating account. Wolfe writes in a stream of consciousness manner that almost feels like the book itself is an acid trip with :::weird:::punctuation::: and run on sentences that can extend the entire length of a page. In the finale Kesey and his pranksters move from being the center of the storm to being childish irritants which is sort of what they always were. The book isn't what I expected but it's a crazy journey that I highly recommend taking."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This is a fun book and you learn a lot.

But the genious Tom Wolfe has evinced in depicting the Kesey's Merry Pranksters and the acid experience is unmatched. Who needs drugs when you can see the experience through the words? One wonders how much was documentary, and how much was experience. Some readers have, and will, draw the conclusion that Kesey is some sort of hero or example of how to live. A perspicacious reader will see much more. I hope you'll draw your own conclusion"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I'm young. i was not alive in the 60's or the 70's. im seventeen.

Tom Wolfe writes most of the book seemingly from the view of the Merry Pranksters. However, his tone seems to become distanced and coldly objective as the book concludes. Ultimatly the reader may (if not deluded into thinking the lifestyle a virtual utopia) see flaws and ultimate failure of the lifestyle. I did not find the Merry Pranksters amusing, free, or admirable. I found much of their behaviour to be mindlessly hedonistic, self-destructive, and generally sheep-like in following the teachings of a raving loon. By the end of the book, I had a throbbing headache. However, I think the problem lies not in the writing of Tom Wolfe (for I enjoyed his other books tremendously) but in the subject matter. In conclusion, I am surprised that the scrambled, self-indulgent mind of Ken Kesey was capable of conceiving such a brilliant book as &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I had forgotten (successfully) how pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, self-absorbed, and self-righteous hippies were. Maybe, as a full-fledged member of the If-It-Feels-Good-Do-It Generation, I was subconsciously embarrassed by my own pretentiousness, pseudo-intellectuality, self-absorption, and self-righteousness in those days.But I recently restored my suppressed memory by hooking down Tom Wolfe's \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,\\" first published in 1968. The book I had avoided for thirty years despite glowing recommendations by assorted fellow travelers gave me a flashback that was, well, a bummer. But my reaction only testifies to the power of a work considered by many a nonfiction classic.In 1966 Wolfe, who later penned The Right Stuff and Bonfire of the Vanities, set out to capture in print the essence of the acid-dropping Californian hippie cult led by Ken Kesey, the Typhoid Mary of LSD and author of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" and \\"Sometimes a Great Notion.\\" To do so Wolfe employed the techniques of \\"new journalism\\" that he, along with Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, and others were then developing to produce nonfiction works that read like novels.Like a novel, \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" uses scene-by-scene construction, records full dialogue, provides the thoughts and emotions of the subjects, and describes in detail their behavior and possessions.And, like a novel, it puts you there, in the midst of Kesey and his Merry Pranksters: in their Day-Glo bus careening across America, at their acid-laced parties, in their drug-addled minds. Instead of telling you what happened via objective narrative like most journalists, Wolfe shows you, infesting you with all the atmospheric and sensual details. And it works, at least in my case, only too well.Through a rich, slangy, neologistic stream of consciousness, Wolfe compellingly portrays the insanity, duplicity (\\"Never trust a Prankster\\"), and manic, existential muddle of Prankster communal life: The glee in being weird and offensive, the pride in being \\"cosmic\\" and unintelligible; the cult-like worship of the charismatic Kesey, and the inevitable crackups, to which the remaining Pranksters remain strikingly callous.But Wolfe also ably renders the captivating transcendence of the hippie experience: the high energy, high spirits, humor, and creativity--which, for the Merry Pranksters, owed so much to Kesey's wit and inventiveness. For a brief moment it made me long for the days when you could be openly outrageous, say most anything you damned well pleased to anyone, and live free and wild. Maybe even for more than a brief moment.It made me wish I had been there when some shortsighted Berkeley anti-war-rally organizer invited the celebrated Kesey to speak. But instead of mimicking the militant tone of previous speakers, Kesey, in orange coat and Day-Glo World War I helmet, came to the microphone with a harmonica. Accompanied by the Pranksters' makeshift band, he played \\"Home on the Range,\\" likened the previous speaker to Mussolini, and chided the 20,000 ralliers:\\"Me! Me! Me!...That's the cry of the ego and the cry of this rally!...Me! Me! Me!...Yep, you're playing their game.\\"Ah, the good old days.Wolfe then goes on to encapsulate the scene and capture its spirit in his conversational prose:\\"--and the crowd starts going into a slump. It's as if the rally, the whole day, has been one long careful inflation of a helium balloon, preparing to take off--and suddenly somebody has pulled a plug. It's not what [Kesey] is saying, either. It's the sound and the freaking sight and that goddamn mournful harmonica and that stupid Chinese music by the freaks standing up behind him. It's the only thing the martial spirit can't stand--a put-on, a prank, a shuck, a goose in the anus.\\"No, not traditional, objective reportage, but something more, something that cuts to the heart of the moment and tells a deeper truth.Wolfe nonetheless manages to do all this full-immersion, colloquial reporting without taking sides, without preaching, advocating, or admonishing. Along with the pandemonium and celebrity and wild joyousness of the Merry Pranksters, he shows you the psychotic reactions, the Hell's Angels gang bangs, and the betrayals. And you believe every word of it, even when his minutely detailed reporting and at times overly rich prose become tedious.But, as in fiction, the details are everything. And the only way to get them right is to do your homework, which Wolfe did in spades. In addition to on-the-scene reporting and the usual documentary research, he conducted interviews with Kesey, various Pranksters, and others on the scene, such as writers Larry McMurtry, Hunter Thompson, and Robert Stone. He delved into Prankster archives--films, tapes, letters, diaries, photos--and into Prankster minds.In an author's note at the book's end, Wolfe writes: \\"I have tried not only to tell what the Pranksters did but to re-create the mental atmosphere or subjective reality of it. I don't think their adventure can be understood without that.\\"In \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" Wolfe succeeds in re-creating the megalomaniacal atmosphere of a movement that profoundly changed our culture. In it he reveals the roots of the mass drug-taking and mass permissiveness that linger yet today.Kesey's own story in the interim seems a sad microcosm of our culture: After his LSD experiences he never wrote another work that approached the verve and sweep of his first two novels. From his website, [...], he now sells Prankster memorabilia, films, and T-shirts reading \\"Never Trust a Prankster.\\""},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This is a benchmark of non fiction. From reading it, one can understand why. This book has an insane and inspiring stylistic prose, but that isn't to say it isn't flawed. I personally think it rambles a bit, repeats itself, but such is the nature of a hallucinogenic experience. This book is now over forty years old and still seems rather fresh. I can't think of a single non fiction article, or book for that matter I have read in my life time that is as wild as this one... maybe \\"Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas\\", but that would be the only book comparable.( Ironically, Hunter S. Thompson did lend some notes to Tom Wolfe for this book, as stated in the end.)Still, in the end, I do think this book has a bit of that \\"style over substance\\" thing. In the end, I'm not left with much besides the style. I read about a lot of hallucinogenic drug use, some of which was interesting( see \\"The Unspoken Thing\\" chapter) and some of it not. The story was funny at times, and it gave me quite a laugh. But I didn't experience many epiphanies while reading it.But these people, these Pranksters, sure did have a funky zest for life that is rather infectious. You can certainly feel that much in the space of these pages. This is a fun read, but unless you are a fan of the time and place in which it takes place, it is probably best sticking to alternate and condensed texts on the subject."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"For anyone interested in the hippie generation, the origins of public interest in LSD, the San Francisco scene of the mid to late 60's, the Psychedelic Rock music of that same era, or just an interesting story about counter-culture, here it is. Wolfe does an amazing job of writing this book as a story rather than an organization of events or facts. Once you get past the first 2 chapters, you can actually feel yourself being &quot;on the bus,&quot; that is to say, part of the story. I personally found it quite amazing how many roots were formed by Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters. You are able to experience the origins of the Grateful Dead, Haight-Ashbury, LSD use, anti drug laws, and even &quot;the Magical Mystery Tour.&quot; Throw in the Hell's Angels and a fugitive flight to Mexico and this makes for one great story!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"My favorite book. Wolfe's writing style reflects the irony, energy, and innocence of Kesey's gang. Also, it is a great Neal Cassady, post-Beat/Ginsberg/Kerouac, account for all of his followers."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The best book I've ever read about the 60s and the psycheedelic movement. As with all Wolfe nonfiction, this is true new journalism written with all the tools and powers of fiction. Incredible, insightful, funny and entertaining book about Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Tom Wolfe's version of how Ken and the other Merry Pranksters pulled off the Acid revolution is phenominal. Before the book was over I not only wanted to try Acid for myself but was pissed off because I wasn't even alive to experience the acid tests. The Grateful Dead is my favorite band, and knowing that they participated in, and helped progress, the Pranksters' movement just strengthened my respect for ALL of the bandmates. This movie is a great look at what really happened in the 60s and what all of the people my age missed out on!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book takes plase in the late 60's-70's during the psychedelic movement in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury. It is about a reporter, Tom Wolfe who hears about an author, Ken Kesey of the novel, One Flew Over The Cukoo's Nest(1962) and his arrest for drug possession. Tom wants to interview Kesey on his arrest for a story only to learn that Kesey's life story and those of his friends are more interesting then the arrest. He decides not to do the interview but to write a book about Kesey and his apostles, the Pranksters and their colorful life. When Kesey is released from prison he takes his Pranksters on a trip in a day-glow bus and as they travel across America they take mind expanding drugs such as LSD. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of eighteen due to the specifi drug context in the book because the author does not only specify the specific drugs but is explicit on the experience of the person's mental and emotional state who is under the influence. The book also contains a lot of factual historical information of the turbulent 60's-70's."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book is one of the coolest, weirdest, and hardest to understand books I have ever read. The topics it talks about are amazing in their awkward happenings. Wolfe talks about the Acid Reunion in great detail. The things Kesey went through in his early life such as writing books while druged up on acid is amazing. The titles of the chapters are a riot as well. Some titles are:The bladder totem, What do you think of my Buddha? and many others. I believe this book is great to read and every teenager should read this book for laughs and for the experience of what is was like to live like Ken Kesey did."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"What all of the previous reviews are trying to say::ask is............are you on the bus or off?

Being one who is 'experienced', I can say to you this book is truthful about the world of 'trippin'.Read it and learn how to open your mind and explore your horzions."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Wolfe's book, if read without the wonder lust of youth, is a very astute and slyly critical treatise on the whole 'On The Bus' geshtalt. If you've ever experienced LSD, I mean REAL LSD, you'll understand that the whole prankster trip was at it's core a very brutal Acid Test of one's personal strength of 'self'. Sandy's failure to fathom the mercilessness of the prankster social contruct is as inciteful an account as one can find to illustrate the point. Bob Weir of the Dead said in an interview about those times, that there was never alot of compassion around, you were free to Do Your Thing but you also had the full weight of taking ownership of ALL ramifications. There are wonderful and bang on descriptions of the LSD experiences, but this book is much more valuable as a guide to poke holes in the whole Peace, Love, FlowerPower mythology that surrounds much of the Acid Test saga."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"If you've ever experienced the alternative lifestyle, you'll revel in Tom Wolfe's account of the Merry Pranksters. Every page will make you see sounds and taste colors!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Don't listen to that guy from New York who said that Wolfe uses &quot;disgusting writing tricks.&quot; He reads the book but he doesn't feel it. Tom Wolfe's book is about LSD. His book is LSD. He describes LSD experiences greatly. This book made me feel like I was tripping."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The subject of this book is not so much drugs, counter-culture, or the 1960's as much as it is about Ken Kesey himself. Wolfe doesn't need to examine the hippie revolution from the angle of drugs, sex, and flower power. Time magazine and other journalists will tackle that later. Wolfe is more critical of 60's hippiedom with its false ideals and unrealistic expectations. There is an underlying conservative attitude to this book that only Wolfe can convey through cool irony and detached humor. The book opens, &quot;That's good thinking, Cool Breeze.&quot; Wolfe is mocking some spaced-out hippy, Cool Breeze, who's babbling incoherently in the back of a pick-up. Wolfe, however, has a certain admiration for Kesey, a counter-cultural figure who generates awe and enthusiasm from his followers. From this book, it is clear that Kesey was a pioneer of 60's hedonism and one who pushed the boundaries of the hipster world. Coming out of the 50's beatnik era, scamming LSD from part-time jobs at psychiatry wards, and originating &quot;freak-outs&quot; of the straight world, Kesey created his own legend and established his own cult, The Merry Pranksters. His hold over this cult was demonstrated though &quot;power games&quot; and pseudo-religous and philosophical mysticisms. Part of Kesey's appeal to Wolfe is the traditional qualities of a prophet or cult-leader, Budda-like in his ability to rouse enthusiasm and create an ideal image of self that others are wlling to conform to. Kesey expressions like &quot;On the bus, off the bus,&quot; or &quot; &quot;Nothing lasts&quot; become Merry Prankster mantras, which are intended to spread the hippie ideal. This is what Wolfe excavates--the power of a personality and how it contributes to a movement-- and does so with the classic, razor-wit style that only Tom Wolfe can put forth."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I have read the story of The merry Pranksters and they are now a part of my life. When ever I feel that I need a little excitement I pick up my very used copy and get lost in the same story and life I have known before. I wish to obtain The Movie and see for myself the wonderful pictures Tom Wolfe helped create in my mind."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Necessary reading to understand the United States of the 1960's, and especially its' counterculture. Wolfe approaches from the view of the neutral journalist, giving the book that much more authenticity.Presented here is the Haight Ashbury of San Francisco; Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters; The Warlocks(later the GD); Timothy Leary and the League for Spiritual Discovery; Neal Cassady; Jack Kerouac; Allen Ginsberg; Hunter S. Thompson; etc...."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book is a must read for those of youwho ever wondered where the hippie movementof the 60's in the Haight got its start. Asexcellently chronicled by a young Tom Wolfe,the beats of the 50's planted the seeds of whatwas to become the psychedelic movement. Thething I like about the beats was that they werea bunch of intelligentia who made no bones aboutthe fact that they totally rejected the Eisenhower50's mentality which held America under siege.Wolfe does a fine job of emphasizing the theatricsof the Merry Pranksters. These were more thana bunch of druged out drifters, these were peopleon a mission to spread awareness: to help awaken Americafrom it's post war slumber. &quot;Go with the flow&quot;: nowthere's a motto to live by!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Very interesting account of the birth of the Hippie Movement in America (if not the world). When Wolfe's words are flowing it's awesome. But his jumbling up of styles, though intended to reflect what he was experiencing, more often than not, is boring and a bit pretentious. Specifically, when he attempts Kerouacian spontaneous prose, it largely comes off, for me anyways, as gimmicky. I wish he would have stuck to a straight ahead style...I think the craziness and uniqueness of what he was witnessing would have still come through. Overall, though, worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"My first expression is, \\"Wow. What an awesome book.\\" Well, maybe this isn't an awesome book, but I found it to be awesome for me. I can't justify giving this 5 stars because it's not a 5 star book. Let me explain. Suppose there's a song on the radio, and you know it's not really the best song in the world. But you love it just the same. That's what I feel about this book. It's not the best book ever written. But it really works for me.I am saddened to see this book come to a close. This is because the Prankster story essentially dies at the end. Sure, they will always be Pranksters, and throughout this book, I felt like I was a Prankster too. The story is one of American history; one that defines something unique and heavily influential in its time. The book does a great job making me feel like I was there. I am there. I am a Prankster.I feel sad now because the Prankster movie is over. Cassady is dead. Kesey is dead. The Prankster movie is no more. With this book, Wolfe is able to draw me into the movie and drop me out again. Only minutes ago I read the final pages. Now I feel something I experienced is gone. A great wash of memories has rushed through my head in too short a time span.Wolfe does all of this in 400 pages. Granted, there are times when Wolfe is on another page than I am. These are moments when the words flow from him, but not *to* me. In these moments, I cannot say this is a 5 star book. If you read it, you'll be satisfied in allowing me to say that this is his movie. You might not know what I mean when I say it was his movie. But you can figure it out.This book is Tom Wolfe's movie. It is also his movie merged with the Prankster movie and how they saw it happen. I am greatly intrigued by the story of Neal Cassady. Cassady plays a central role in this, yet is always content to flip his sledge hammer, or drive whatever car he had, or do something that wasn't necessarily on the same page as anyone else. Cassady is a very interesting presence in 2 major cultural movements, namely the Beat Generation and the Probation Generation, as Wolfe so poignantly relays it.We're brought through the beginning, middle, and end of Ken Kesey's heavy run with LSD and the Merry Pranksters. We are in Perry Lane. La Honda. On the bus. In Mexico. And of course, furthur with each chapter. We experience all of these situations. We feel the reality in these words. We live it.On the cover of this book is the terse comment, \\"American Classic.\\" This quote is attributed to Newsweek. One only imagines when this comment was written. Really, who cares? The point is, I think it's accurate. For the majority of this book, I wasn't sure this was a fitting description. American Classic? Well, maybe that was a bit dramatic, I thought. After having gone through it, I have to agree. An American classic.I'm still wrapped up in the euphoria of having just finished the book. So let me come back to Earth. Who is this book for? I think those people interested in the history of the 60's LSD culture previous to the Summer of Love will enjoy this. Kesey helps blaze the LSD trail in the San Francisco area in the early to mid 60's. This is a great account of that blazing story.I have also recently read Storming Heaven, by Jay Stevens. That too is a great book which turned me on to this. While Stevens does not get very subjective with his words, he does a great job covering a myriad of topics. If you want to delve into one of the many topics he touches on, this is a great start. If you're looking for an unbiased history of the time period, this isn't the book for you.So why not 5 stars? I have to be honest in rating the book on it's own merit, as opposed to how it made me feel. Yes, I loved it. But I realize that it's not perfect. The poetic ramblings are harsh. Those interludes are hard to follow most of the time. Wolfe admits that he tries to put the reader in a state which will convey the mood or atmosphere of the text. At times he does a good job. Other times, I think he misses the mark and you are left wondering.Other than that, I heartily recommend this book. It's a fascinating read which pulls you into its movie. Well done indeed."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I do not lie; this book literally changed my life. It introduced me to the concept of serendipity and how there really are no such things as coincidences. Every time I read the book, events magically happen which only further reinforce my belief. Traveling intrepidly. On the bus. Going Furthur. It's all there--just pick up the book and read it."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I really didn't like the book, and had the hardest time to finish it because of my personal phobias of so many things the Merry Pranksters did.(gas station bathrooms, for example) Nevertheless, I think it is only fair to acknowledge the importance of this book as an important documentary of the modern American history that has had a huge influence in our culture, and Tom Wolfe who is definitely a valuable journalist who can document brilliantly and with such ease."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I found the book exciting and eye-opening. I lived through these times, but felt Wolfe was explaining my own generation to me so I saw it in a new way. This book was recommended to me by a 17-year-old high school student who also enjoyed it, so the appeal of the book crosses all age groups.Wolfe really captured all the sights, sounds, colors, and feelings of the 60s."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The electric kool-aid Acid Test is the saga of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. The Day-Glo band traverses the American continent and travels to the forefront of consciousness (kind of). Although the \\"shining psychedelic sea to shining psychedelic sea\\" journey was their manifest destiny and not that of the reader, the journey from shining psychedelic page to shining psychedelic page was less fun than taking part in it probably was.I am a youngster and the 60\\"s counterculture predates me by about 40 years, but I get a feeling that the imagery of the book is very accurate in a few places (like Wolfe's explanation of their journey aboard Furthur), and is as raw as the lifestyles he is describing. The essence of that place in time is as accurate a depiction as any I have read.Unfortunately like the era, along with all the vibrant colorful motifs, the writing itself was wonderfully written, descriptive areas that bring you into the experience, but his writing, like the era's other dark undertones, left me lost in the time line, confused and detached. In many places the stories are confusing and don't fit the plot; some of the important characters are scarcely described and personas are hard to grasp. I feel the frame of the story is hardly present and hard to pick up on by an un-stoned person (there were times where it was all so clear to me).The feeling of the summers of love and this book as a piece of literature leave you with the same feelings; you'll either want a time machine to read this book over and over (and re-live \`66 to '69), or you'll regret it and want to put it all behind you as fast as your failing short term memory (or the San Mateo county police) will let you. I am feeling the afterglow of both.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Tom Wolfe is one of the most engaging and genuinely original storytellers I've ever read.

He follows them through varied adventures and chronicle such activities as the meetings of the Pranksters and Leary's Harvard group. A glimpse of the early Wizards acid test concerts is given also. The Wizards continued on afterwards for years as the Grateful Dead. Encounters with the Hells Angels are visceral and brutal.This book is one way to get a glimpse of what was going down when people were turning on at the acid tests."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"There are trips and then there are the trips that Kesey and the Merry Pranksters made and took while on the bus Further back in the early 1960's. Wolfe was just launching his career and this/these trip(s) was the perfect vehicle (pardon pun) to do so. Kesey is striving to turn the world on to the wonders of LSD and the bus Further brings his group - the Merry Pranksters & the drug to America. Wolfe writes in a demanding style of the language of his subjects. It is in Hippie-jargonese that Wolfe accounts for Kesey's life after the success of the novel \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo Nest.\\" Wolfe picks up the story after Kesey is first released from prison only later to be hunted to Mexico.Encounters with the Hell's Angles and numerous law enforcement agencies are also accounted in this new-style of journalism. If the book has any short-comings it is precisely in the style that Wolfe presents. At times this style is entertaining, but too cumbersome at other times. It is unique approach and lays the foundation for some of his other better works (The Right Stuff, Bonfire of the Vanities)but doesn't entice the reader as it should. Good account of hippie life and one of the most influential writers of his generation."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book will provide you with a lot of knowledge about pop culture and the hippie movement origin, evolution and expansion worldwide. It must be an obligatory purchase if you are interested in psychedelia."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The drug-taking (psychedelic) hippies of the sixties, West Coast branch, are featured in this book. In particular, Ken Kesey and his people, who Wolfe is clearly taken with, perhaps too much so, since his approach is that of a journalist, and I sense he lost his head a bit here. But for the most part he does do a good job of laying out what happened and when, reporting as the outsider he generally is: which has the advantage of making Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test a \\"book of record,\\" and the disadvantage, to my taste, of staying on the surface of things.I Think, Therefore Who Am I?"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I recommend this book to anyone that want an inside look at the start of the hippie revolution."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"There are storybooks, there are psychedelic books, and then there is The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, by Tom Wolfe. It is the true story of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and their physical voyage across the United States, as well as their symbolic voyage through the universe. As much as this can be considered a book about drugs and hippies, it can more accurately be viewed as a spiritual journey that not only exemplifies a culture and a time period, but also an idyllic way of life. Read it. And read it again while taking notes. Then live it.[..]"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"If you want to understand today's drug culture, you must go back to the origins in the Sixties. Wolf's account of this era and its principal characters is a not to be missed read and a valuable reference for that period. In fact, if you want to understand society today, certain lifestyles and the associated values, read this book. From the painted buses to the flower children to Ken Kesey and more, it is all here in extraordinary detail. You won't put it down until you finish, once you start reading, so carve out a few hours one weekend and have food and beverage to hand. Pencil and paper, too, for you will want to get Wolf's other books for his social insights."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book is about the American born, hippie movement. The journalist Tom Wolfe infiltrates the Merry Prankster's before their Acid Graduation and tells the whole story. I liked this book because of the wild details of the tripped out life of acid heads. Wolfe takes us for a ride with the Pranksters, through their beginnings as intellectuals in Stanford, to the low days of living as outlaws in Mexico. In the end Ken Kesey, the leader of the Merry Pranksters, talks about another way other than LSD, DMT, Peptide, and Marijuana making the reader feel reassured. This is a great read and historical reference, so if you're looking for some info on the 60's or just need a laugh I would recommend, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Although I bought this book when it was first out in paperback, I didn't actually get around to reading it until 1993. I wondered at the time if I would have appreciated it more as a teenager or as someone in his 40's. I'm of the opinion that it works better as a retrospective on an indulgent generation rather than a &quot;how to&quot; book for on-going hedonism. I'm sure that there are other opinions on this, however. I must admit that it is really an enjoyable book and one wonders about the extent of detachment or involvement of Tom Wolfe. He obviously spent a great deal of time with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and hung with them long enough to see a beginning as well as an end. I think that the ability of the book to bring things to a conclusion was helpful. Nonetheless, the journey Wolfe takes us through is fast paced and exciting and we meet many familiar names along the way. Perhaps the most surprizing familiar name for me was Larry McMurtry whom I did not associate as one who might have followed that crowd. It was certainly a time of awakening although often in ways that may have been better to sleep off. There is an electricity to the book (as there was to the era) and Wolfe certainly helps keep it charged up. For those who don't know much about the 60's, this book is essential to understanding those times. To those who lived it, this book is a reminder of how much fun it was as well as how lucky most of us were to survive it. Things are different now. As evidence of that, consider our recent president who &quot;smoked but never inhaled&quot;. Tom Wolfe wrote something that many of can now read with a red-faced smile.

There are gang bangs, acid laced koolaid, arrests, faked deaths, and the beginning of one of the greatest novels in America.Written with less journalistic objectivity than most book, you can tell that Tom Wolfe is a fan of these guys even as he doesn't directly participate in their lifestyle as you imagine Hunter S. Thompson would do. Wolfe compiles thousands of interviews and experiences in order to bring people into the heads of these tripped out losers and in the process makes them into legends. The only problem is that sometimes WOlfe goes a little too far off the deep end and in creating dialogue and internal monologues for these characters he's more projecting his own biases. A later book of his (The Right Stuff) takes this method to extremes as he spends a good deal of time writing his narrative from a test monkey's perspective. While there is nothng so extreme in this book, it is more pervasive here.This is both a classic of the 60s counterculture and a great example of gonzo journalism (which is to real journalism like Herodotus is to history). At very least it is a great insight into the mind and work of Ken Kesey who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (partially on acid) and who became a celebrity in his own right.By the way, if you are going to buy this book you might as well buy One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

I liked how it was all about Ken Kesey because I did not suspect that it would be about him at all prior to reading the book. The book has intrigued me to read more books by Ken Kesey, even though this book was written by Tom Wolfe. I would recommend this book to people who are very open minded and are interested in reading into every single detail that is mentioned in the book. I did get a little bored sometimes with the book, and it was quite slow at some points. If I were to change anything in the story, I would just make it so that more exciting things happen. The whole book is written really well and the story is told well, it just almost seems that the same things are happening over and over. Even so, I think people should read this book just for the enlightenment of the 60's hippie movement.

Imagine test pilots from \\"The Right Stuff\\" on acid and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It's e.e. cummings meets Yoko Ono meets William Faulkner meets bathroom wall scribes at a rave with day-glo paint.An invented sub-culture needs an invented vocabulary. What exactly is \\"grock\\"? There is even some kind of invented punctuation mark that looks like a domino tile with a set of sixes. Sometimes the domino is on its side, sometimes standing up. Sometimes the domino is stacked on another domino. The only thing missing is multi-colored text, sound effects and scratch-and-sniff panels.So, is it worth reading? I'm certainly in no position to tell Tom Wolfe how to write, but I have to admit that I skimmed a lot. There's a reason why rational people avoid drug addicts - they don't make sense.

The events and &quot;stream of thought&quot; are not simply a tale but a model of how to move &quot;beyond&quot; socioties influence, and find the true natrue of the self. This is at the heart of what Leary, Alpbert, Ginsberg, and all the rest said. Wolfe, however presents this much more subtely. This is important to the nature of the lessons.

In fact unless you scrutinize very carefully, you won't even notice the effects that Wolfe's writing style has on your mind. Here's an example for the unread. \\"Babb's, saying, \`Yes, it's all so very obvious.' It's all so very obvious...\\" and it is. This excerpt was the part that really broke through to me. Actually IT wasn't obvious, IT was why the Vietnam war started. Everyone talking about IT was zonked out of their gourds and Ginsberg, acid head and sometimes eastern mystik had decided that all wars are started by misunderstandings which the stereo stypical burned out Vietnam vet, Babbs, answqrs with a: But of course! Yet this statement can be not true, yet Wolfe lets the part hang, like he's saying: it's obvious to them, it would be to you if you're acid-fried-jet-lagged. Wolfe's writing does something that most fiction writter's have been trained and culled and trained again not to do. Give away your personality through you're writing. Not only does he pull it off in a slick hipstercat sort of way, but manages to keep the unspoken rule among Literary non-fiction writters: \\"Never talk about yourself. Why your doing this story:fine:How are you doing this story:fine: but not who is doing this story :::definately not:::. Wolfe's Creativeenglish is at it's best in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. A story of the once acclaimed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest author Ken Kesey and his band of movie-filming-variable lag-acid hippies the Merry Pranksters, their history;their theory; and their Intrepid Trip through America's ShineyBlackShoe and WhiteCollar world. Much like the acid detailed in the story, this book is an experience. It would be impossible to explain the book in any terms that wouldn't be unwieldy psychological jargon. Wolfe's depth of character understanding shines the most through all of the story. He has synched his mind into the Prankster's psychedelic/low rent/communal living induced group mind without the need of the experience as Kesey calls the hallucinogenic state of being. The prankster's have no need for words. They know what they are talking about and can explain it to other pranksters with looks and gestures but never words. As Wolfe explains: \\"... that huge afternoon sun like a huge thousand-eyed thing pulsing explosions of sunlight in exact time to the weird Arab music -and in that moment Kesey, Mountain Girl, Sandy, Zonker, all of them-No one even had to look at another because they not only know that everyone else is seeing it at once, they feel, they feel it flowing through one brain, \\" Wolfe puts it in terms laymen can understand. He quantifies the experience for those who need quantification to understand. He puts words to Kesey's mind."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This should be read along with Hunter Thompson's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Many colorful characters are found in this book. Often I've been curious about what made the 60's \\"the 60's\\" and this book shines a light on a the roots of the American psychedelic movement. In terms of American literature, this book picks up where Kerouac's On The Road left off (Neal Cassady's in this one too).I've always been lukewarm to Tom Wolfe's writing style. Too often, the story suffers from unwanted intercessions of the writer. Having an author literally shout to his own characters \\"Run, you fool!\\" and \\"What do we learn from this?\\" is really an unwise writing trick. Very distracting and pointless, really.At its best, this book manages to capture a time period - peripherals and all.

There is some fine journalistic writing in the book, but it is buried under all the &quot;mental atmosphere&quot; writing, which probably only makes sense to those people who have taken acid (which does not include this reviewer) or who were part of the late-1960s counterculture in San Francisco (which again does not include this reviewer, who was born in the late 1960s).Anyone who is expecting a &quot;straight&quot; account of the Pranksters are advised to steer clear, but those with a taste for the surreal will probably find this book quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"What can be told about Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test? It's a reporting of the Merry Pranksters and their whacked-out, drug addled misadventures across the country with Ken Kesey as their assumed and humble leader. While overall, I was not a big fan of this book, I should not continue without saying that there are some truly entertaining stories to be told here (Kesey's first experience with acid and the \\"buddha\\", Kesey meeting Owsley, experiences with the Dead, etc.). In fact, I wouldn't even necessarily not recommend it. I say this because I don't think the problems that I have with this book would bother the average reader.Having said this, I think that I just see this book as being moot. It's a story told about acidheads, from a person who never actually tried any acid. Anyone who has tried this psychedelic drug will try to explain it's significance to you, but will ultimately admit that it transcends words and it must simply be experienced (unintentional nod to Hendrix). Now, this could potentially not matter (and who would want to read the ramblings of a tripper anyhow?), but a sort of US V THEM scenario is created as a result. The \\"us\\" being Wolfe and the reader, and the \\"them\\" being the subjects of the book. The author, therefore the reader, seemingly stick out like a sore thumb in a style of book in which the reader is supposed to feel immersed in the time and place. If you want to hear an account of a Phish concert, do you want to hear it from the parents who have brought their 16 year old son to his first concert whilst sitting in the back row covering their mouths with handkerchiefs as to avoid inhaling any marijuana smoke, or do you want to hear from the guy near the front who has created an open space for himself from the reeling of fellow concert goers as to avoid the flailing limbs of his frantic dance? I know my answer.However, the fatal flaw for me, which may not bother anyone else is that the appeal of the subject matter seemed to diminish as time went on. The book maintained a level of interest in me that was equal the number of pages I held in my right hand. I went from the wide-eyed curiosity of the examination of a group of people determined to change the world, to being bored and kind of angry that a group of drug-addled hedonists had garnered so much attention. They contributed nothing to society, other than proving that simply TALKING ABOUT changing the world won't amount to anything if you simply lie around and trip out and screw each other all day. My interest in this book was a perfect metaphor for the significance of the hippie revolution. In the end, it all went up in a puff of smoke. The admiration of hedonism in our culture hasn't died, but it has taken upon a different form. Thankfully at least taking baths has come back in a big way. If I need a lift in knowing that there are people out there trying to change the world I'll look to the Nelson Mandelas and the Gandhis of the world. And this book will remain as forgotten as a memory of Woodstock."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid TestThis is a documentary by a fabulous journalist and author Tom Wolfe. Wolfe got into the world of hippies from the sixties. In this documentary about Ken Kesey, the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it describes the actions and tribulations that these \\"merry Pranksters\\" endured and enjoyed. In the book, a small band of \\"free thinkers\\" soon become united into an everlasting bond, which is created by one thing, DRUGS. In the novel it tells the whole story of how acid got started amongst California and the United States and it pretty much started with the pranksters. And they soon learn that the law is a very difficult source to bypass. They suffer through the jail, the raids, and being on the run; all to come back together and hallucinate. For the pranksters it was all about the experience which all came from inside their heads and the acid that was fed to them. They go on many adventures, including trips across the country in the stereotypical hippie bus. It tells of their insane journeys through bad experiences while bending their mind with hallucinogenic drugs. And the parties in which are invited many different kind of people including the Hell's Angels. The pranksters also held what they liked to call \\"Acid Tests\\" in which they could spread the experience of LSD to all that were interested. It is an amazing story, especially how it is describing these young psyche expanders. The author Tom Wolfe did a great job describing the lives of these young hippies in their experience through the drug movement of America. He told the story from an almost documentary point of view in which he could partially become part of the pranksters. Wolfe could make you believe in their movement with the click of his typewriter. He got inside the mind of each of the prankster's in-order to properly explicate their lives correctly. He could use the proper language and communication to securely tell the story of these merry pranksters. His communication of the matter gave it a feeling that the book was alive, that this isn't only a documentary but pure vitality in form. Wolfe accomplished this book by a process in which he used past experiences of his own self and past experiences of others. He interviewed pranksters; and he spent much time interviewing people who were part of the prankster's lives' even if it was only for a night. And during the end of the Prankster career days he even spent time living with them. He took time out of his life to become part of this Day-Glo essence of life. This Day-Glo world full of colors, patterns, and mind trips; that's what Wolfe got himself into. Even if you disagree with the thoughts and views of the pranksters this is still a tale full of excitement, not to mention how well written it is. I do not know if Wolfe took part in the entertainment that enthralled the Pranksters; he could have stayed sober, I am unaware. This is a great book for any reader who enjoys hearing about something new. Because after you read this you will understand the hippies. -gnome"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Maybe I was born too late to really follow the works, maybe my distance from the Merry Prankster mentality prohibits my appreciation for what has been written. Sadly, this was one of the slowest reads I have ever had. I had a great deal of difficulty connecting with the Pranksters or what they were trying to accomplish. They seemed to go so far off the end of the spectrum that their message was lost on me. I suppose I'm not ready to drop out yet.That being said, the fact that anyone was there to document what happened is a saving grace.

They will teach those who wish to know what a carefree and spontaneous existence some Americans once had.The 1960's were a time of hope, and a time of dope. There was hope of a future with no war, hope of a future with lots of drugs, hope of a future with good music and better art, and most of all the hope that the bus would go on, and on, and on and the party would never stop.Perhaps the motto for this book should have been: Dope will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no dope. But I digress. There is much more to learn and read about than simply the \\"counter culture,\\" which enveloped parts of America like a thick fog back in the 60's and 70's.Actually, it's been so long since I read this book that I can't remember it very well (all that dope?), but I think its about a bunch of hippies, led by Ken Kesey (who himself gave us lots to read and think about such as the classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and including such luminaries as Neal Casady and Grateful Dead groupies and LSD chemists such as Owsley and beats like Ginsburg and more and armchair philosophers and all sorts of crazy characters and homespun folk, traveling in a bus across America, and living to tell the tale, as documented by perhaps the greatest living historian or our time, Tom Wolfe.Pass the lord and praise the drugs.

The story is of the \\"Intrepid Travelers,\\" Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters, a communal group of acid ingesters who were the progenitors of the acid consciousness in the California, in the US, in the world's consciousness of awareness . . . \\"your either on the bus or off the bus.\\"It was the influential chemists, Al Hubbard, Dr. Spaulding and the psychologists, Timothy Leary and Richard Albert, the Harvard psychology professors, who discovered for themselves psylobilin and with Michael Hollingshead and Albert Hoffman, LSD and subsequently held experiments using the right set and setting with experienced psychedelic guides. Yet to this the Merry Pranksters would say, \\"f**k that!\\" because they were from a different movie of living; in the now, the unserene and lurid art, your brain being your only guide, not some experienced taker and specific setting for a safe non-freak-out trip (and there were a lot of \\"freak-outs\\" from many young, emotionally inexperienced). And the acid influenced cultural movement they began in the early 1960's. It was Leary and Albert who endorsed the \\"set and setting,\\" the intellectual approach or non-organizational religious approach, the religious experience of the mystics, in their dialogue with acid and mushrooms. With Kesey and the Pranksters it was spontaneous, wild party kind of living in Day-Glow colors, in the multimedia sound and movie.The Pranksters account starts in North Beach on Perry Lane, which becomes a major hang out for all sorts and eventually ends up in a cottage near La Honda, where the loud party of outlandish, Day-Glo painted woods - rigged with microphones and massive sound equipment, in the communal life takes on a new meaning. The Hell's Angels befriend the Pranksters and there are stories of personalities, telepathic and psychic connections and synchronicity in new fields of human life, the overmind, the collective unspoken mind of the psychedelic group. The religious realm of mystical awareness as in the game of I-Ching and dream wars. The Jungian \\"synchronicity\\" seemed to occur uncanningly many times, as their bus out of gas in the middle of nowhere only to have a tanker pull up and fuel them from nowhere. The sign on their door welcoming the Hell's Angels to end up having them and succeeding in their prankster madness. The sign on their door welcoming the Beatles, did not synchronize them to appear, but what did was having Oswley appear, the famous acid maker, who in the ways of synchronistic noncausal effect, was responsible for the finest acid which spread to England, the acid that brought the Beatles to experience the unspoken mind which ended them up traveling by bus across the English countryside with cameras and microphones.Imagine a Day-Glo painted bus, the magic bus, with Day-Glo painted people and clothes, tripping on acid traveling from California to the New York World's Faire with music blasting, a freak show on wheels, all in the year 1964! And Neil Cassidy (Jack Kerouac's buddy and drive from On The Road) driving the bus!! And their trip to the legendary Millbrook, thinking it would be some historic meeting with Leary and the Pranksters, but instead it was the mystical religious and intellectuals verses the wild party, American flag draped, painted, loud blaring music, party animals of psychedelic madness. I think it relates to the age and the introvert and/or extrovert type personalities that played the large part.It was actually Stewart Brand who thought up the great Trip Festival of January 1966. The series of acid test parties held by Kesey and the Pranksters helped spawn the movement of higher consciousness, all held at the last minute, the same day notification was put, and the Pranksters playing their instruments, then finding a local band, the warlocks - later known as the Grateful Dead - to play and Roy Seburn's light shows at the acid tests. It was the acid test held in a Unitarian church where the Kool-Aid was spiked, unknowingly to those attending. It was not teachings in the stiff, reverent language and texts of scholarly limnings found in various religions being taught but instead an aura, a religious experience, an awareness that flashed deeper than cerebration, the tradition of the great prophets. People like the beats Allen Ginsberg and his entourage and Neil Cassidy were there. As this spread, so the acid tests, later without Kesey and Haight Ashbury became the scene.Later on Kesey gets busted twice for weed and is on the run from the law, to Mexico and back until caught - he was in their movie that time, fortunately most charges dropped. A lot to read of the characters and generally a great book to get an idea of a unique and special time and place in history where a much larger degree of freedom existed for the white middle class with the ability to gain other realms of consciousness available for the taking. A great pictorial book on this is \\"On The Bus\\" by Paul Perry, Michael Schwartz, Neil Ortenberg & Ken Babbs."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I'm a 24 year old guy who never got to live in the golden era of music, drugs and consensual sex. Although I did (and still do) my fair share of partying into the first half of my twenties, I always wondered what it was like back then. I got turned on to the sixties by the music first. My mom was a big Stones, Doors and Hendrix fan and I listened to that music a lot. Then I saw Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson. After I saw it I read every single book the man ever wrote. Especially Hell's Angels and Fear & Loathing fascinated me because the era in which it took place seemed so radically different from what I'm used to.This book follows a group of hippies who take a lot of acid and go on an adventure to find higher meaning in it all. That's basically the plot. There is a lot of craziness going on, funny situations involving out of control people and interesting revelations. Throughout the whole book there is the feeling of something hanging in the air, lifting everyone up, that's hard to describe. The thing I loved most about this book was the positive mentality and the love people had for one another. Sure, it's easy to be happy when you're on drugs, but still. My generation is one of individuality, to the point where people don't even talk to each other anymore. You can hear this in today's music too. It's digital, sterile, pitch perfect. The human element of it is pretty much stripped out. It is such a contrast compared to the raw, hissy recordings from the 60's and 70's. This book is like that. I wasn't around to see it myself, but I feel this is the best way to read up about what it must have been like.I loved it."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Does the caption paint a strong enough picture? It's five-thirty in the morning and i just finished the last page of one incredibly condescending, disingenuous look at 60's drug culture by an admitted conservative hanger-on with no tangible ties or affiliations to the scene whatsoever. This book did NOT define a generation, and frankly, fellow reviewers, its time to stop parroting phrases from the dust jackets and start developing actual opinions for yourself. I'm hardly a literary buff myself but it doesn't take a genius to realize that a certain degree of commercial success or select critical praise does not validate a book's quality.The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is basically an account of acclaimed author Ken Kesey's life circa 65-66, but unfortunately we never once get to know Kesey, or any of the other Merry Pranksters as any more than exaggerated stock stereotypes with no discernible personalities, character traits or range of emotion. We're supposed to believe Kesey bore an illegitimate child with the twenty-something \\"Mountain Girl\\" while fleeing from the police and no-one, certainly not his apparent mute-doormat of a wife, so much as bat an eyelash? No, Wolfe's angle was simply to capitalize on the media frenzy and fascination of the drug culture and subject us to page after page of god-awful faux-drug-induced, mock-Kerouc/Burroughs/Leary-imitation free form prose, simultaneously conforming to the same aesthetic he apparently had so much disdain for.If you need further convincing, may i direct you to the following quotes taken from Time Magazine's 10 questions for Tom Wolfe:Has the drug culture been stripped of its intellect? Max Stendahl, IPSWICH, MASS.Ha! That's assuming that it had an intellect. It inevitably leads to total lack of intellect--particularly in the case of LSD, which everyone assumed opened the doors of perception. We've since discovered that it does the opposite.Did you ever use LSD or marijuana? John Foster JEJU-DO, SOUTH KOREANo, I never did. LSD is too strong to take. I write about it in the book. They take it once, and for years afterward, they have these flashbacks. Just driving over a bump in the road on a motorcycle can do it. (??) I tried marijuana once.The culture was admittedly flawed, yes, but still possessed a strong vitality, a spirited iconoclasm and sense of personal freedom and desire for self-discovery worth of much more merit than this book has to offer."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Tom Wolfe's portrayal of Ken Kessey and his odd lot of LSD and psychedelic marketing afficionados is amazing. Traveling cross-country in their day-glow painted bus and throwing experimental light-show concerts throughout the Bay Area, this book not only describes a sub-culture, but a unique era of exploration, experimentation, and adventure in the free-spirited 1960s. Intersecting with this sub-culture are rock legends such as the Grateful Dead, beatnik revolutionary poets such as Ginsburg, and socio-political movements such as Anti-War, hippies based youth centered around Berkeley.If ever one wants to read a superb chronicle of a social movement from rational, even-kieled journalist reporter, as well as be greatly entertained, then this is the read for you!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I felt like I fell right into the acid scene circa 1960+ as I read through this delirious adventure. It seems too outrageous to be true at times, coming from the personal accounts of the Pranksters and the author, but mostly from the Prankster's written and video records. The great thing about the Merry Pranksters is that they took video and sound equipment everywhere with them and many were writers so the records of their adventures exist beyond the almost certainly hazy personal recollections.So the acid tests were really conducted, and the Merry Pranksters were a real group of crazy intellectuals. As many reviewers have said, this book has by far the best descriptions of acid trips than any I've ever read before. Yes, there is some gobbledy-gook and strange punctuation but it all adds to the overall uniquely dramatic effect of the book. You can't expect a High School English teacher's grammar in a book detailing acid adventures.This book is also an excellent insight into birth of the hippies' drug culture and the events that led up to the peak and eventual downfall of the hippy pandemonium in the sixties. What is special about this story is that it details and explains the events leading up to the mass consumption and popularity of acid, prior the late 60's and prior to it being made illegal in most states. Nobody even knew what the stuff was or that anything like it existed at the time the Merry Pranksters first got hold of it. I would venture to say most people would have no idea how the acid revolution started and this is the key to finding out, while having a great time reading a book about the spawning of a unique American culture, which reads pretty fast for 400+ pages."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I loved this one.I normally write long and detailed reviews (see my listmania lists) but, suffice it to say that almost anyone would much enjoy reading this well-organized and closely-documented lunacy.My highest recommendation! *.*"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"A highly recommended read about the rise of the West Coast drug culture in the 60's. Ken Kesey's windfall from his \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" book acts as the catalyst to the whole thing. From LSD laced kool-aid, through to the Prankster' all night parties - music provided by the new band \\"The Grateful Dead\\", to hanging out with the Hell's Angels, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, The Beatles (not quite), falling foul of the law and the resulting flee south of the border. Wolfe does an excellent job bringing it all together...well worth reading and I'm sure for some there will be moments of nostalgia. Newsweek rates it \\"An American Classic\\"...absolutely. Essential reading for any one interested in this chapter of American, and ultimately world, history."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Few people will question the abilities of Tom Wolfe to capture a time, a people, or a culture. This book is one of the reasons. Growing up in the Sixties, I saw most of the people Wolfe writes about in this book, reviled by the media and the public. And until I read this book, most of my perceptions of the Merry Pranksters was similar to that of the mainstream press.However, reading this book helped me to form my own ideas about the people who were really the bridge between the Beat generation and the Hippie generation. Both groups espoused many of the same ideas about American culture and America's sociological bent towards blindly following capitalist ideals.Both groups ultimately failed to make any real change.But thanks to Tom Wolfe, for a very brief moment like the Czech spring of '68, America saw a different 'perception' of how a society could operate.Bob Wayne, authorTroutman Penthouse 1975"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Well I was not of the 60's generation, that was my parents. But after reading this book, I found out a lot more of what the hippies were about and the whole \\"movement\\" that they went through in order to turn \\"beatniks\\" and \\"bohos\\" into the fun loving hippies that Kesey and the Merry Pranksters were. The book entails of the first mission of making the first acid based movie in order to show the people of San Francisco a movie to enjoy to get an LSD experience, even if your not on LSD. Their mission turned into much more than that when they discover that they can change the way people think...\\"Control\\". They develop more and more of a following, holding conventions and festivals in order to celebrate the acid tests that they were performing on their followers. Soon they have Hell's Angels by their side, The Grateful Dead to groove to, and the cops to evade and play games with. I have to admit, the book was rather difficult to understand at some parts due to my lack of knowledge of the times and the lack of knowledge of some of the important people of the era who contributed to the hippie movement. Before I read this book, Ken Kesey was just the man who wrote \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\", but after reading the book I saw that he played a much more important role to the 60's and many people who followed his movement."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"To the creative, hippy at heart, this book will open up doors,and Im not talking about drug use!

While it is in keeping with the spirit of &quot;rapping&quot;, I found myself skimming those parts just as I skim the token &quot;dream scenes&quot; written in italics in Stephen King novels.

A lot of history and background on Ken Kesey (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest), Timothy Leary, and other involved in the \\"new\\" drug, LSD."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"If you're interested in the nonpolitical side of the '60s counterculture, this is a great insider's account. Wolfe's warped, exuberant sense of style does a masterful job of recreating the wild, iconclastic feel of the time. Reading this book really gives you a feel of what it must have been like to live with Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. After a while, you feel like one of them, totally swept up by the heady mix of intellectualism, creativity, rebellion, and drugs. While this insider's view is the book's best attribute, it also hurts it. Wolfe's report of the times is half way between imitation beat literature and journalism. While he succeeds on the first front, his account is too biased to possibly be considered journalism. He ignores what could reasonably be seen as Kesey's dark side (introducing teenage runaways to powerful drugs and then initiating relationships with them). I found myself reading Helter Skelter (about the Charles Manson case) immediately after The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test in order to get both sides of the 60's communal living coin. Also, Wolfe knows his social history pretty well, but he should leave the music history to somebody else. He essentially calls The Beatles a rip off of The Grateful Dead, which is just laughable. Yes, the Beatles appropriated elements of psychedelia on their later albums, but they still sounded nothing like the Grateful Dead. Also, calling The Beatles' late 60's albums \\"acid rock\\" is simply wrong. \\"Rubber Soul\\" was above all else a folk-rock album and \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" and \\"Magic Mystery Tour\\" were psychedelic pop, and had little to do with the heavier, druggier sounds of acid rock. Wolfe also repeatedly overstates the importance of The Grateful Dead. Because of their association with Kesey, Wolfe claims that they single handedly pioneered psychedelic rock. Obviously, the writer has never heard of a little band from Texas known as The Thirteenth Floor Elevators...."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Tom Wolfe is beautiful. This book is beautiful. Kesey and the Pranksters were beautiful. They let it all go. They almost succeeded, too, but they were defeated by the most powerful enemy of all: time.Read this to learn about the 60s. Read this to learn about LSD. Read this to learn a powerful system of grassroots psychology. Read this to witness what could be the birth of the world's greatest religion. The Federal robots ate their holy communion before it could spread. And yet it's still spreading. America, eat your heart out from within and be free.This book is beautiful and it gives me hope.

Wolfe writes in a way that sort of makes you feel that you are on acid too. His writing style in this book is very unique and he has an incredible way of describing things which is one thing I really enjoyed. Now I can finally understand what many of those baby-boomers went through!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Recently I reviewed novelist Robert Stone's memoir about his 1960's experiences with author (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Sometimes a Great Notion, etc.) Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, a classic counter-cultural phenomenon of the period. That review sent me back to the shelves to scan over Tom Wolfe's journalistic narrative written about the adventures of that same group. Unlike Stone and even more so, unlike Hunter Thompson, who episodically crossed Kesey's path as he chronicled the California Hell's Angels, Wolfe stands in the tradition of classic objective journalism. But with a lot more style, literary flair and wit than most of its champions. As far as I know he never got down in the mud with the Pranksters like Stone and Thompson who were more than happy to be the participants in their own stories. That, in any case, was the genesis of Thompson's\`gonzo' journalism.Nevertheless Wolfe offers some important, if detached, observations about what the Pranksters and their obsession with drugs and dropping out meant about the nature of society in the Sixties. Some of the reportage seems dated but as I stated in the Stone review, hell, that was a fun time to be alive. As I also mentioned there out of that whole countercultural mix called the Sixties I went the political route. Let Wolfe tell you about this other route. He tells that story well."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Wolfe's prose sparkles and crackles with multicolored colored exuberance and life and energy. He perfectly captures the spirit, mentality, and consciousness of Ken Kesey--who seems more contrarian than psychedelic--and his Merry Pranksters, from their wild clothing to their psychedelic trips on acid. And it's funny, too, full of great episodes. Like when Kesey speaks at an anti-Vietnam War rally and shows up in militaristic regalia--and the whole rally just dissipates. Or the party with the Hell's Angels. Or when the Pranksters visit the estate where Timothy Leary is experimenting, meditating, and holding forth--Leary's group takes everything so seriously, they seem drab, gray, and mundane next to the neon-like Pranksters. If the mainstream was, as Wolfe writes, \\"poor old Formica polyethylene 1960s America,\\" then Kesey and the Pranksters represented \\"the neon of 1960s electro-pastel America.\\"It's also a hoot to try to picture straight-laced Wolfe mingling with these hippies and acid-freaks. Of course, he was younger then, but somehow, I think he fit in about as well as he must have when visiting colleges for his latest book. More power to him. For in interacting with and observing individuals and their groups, he writes masterpieces, of which this must be one of his best. It's a rollicking good read."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe was by far the best book that I have ever read. Tom Wolfe amazingly was able to capture a certain essance of the moment. In some cases that may not be so impressive, but have you ever seen the guy? He's a flatout dork... Anyway the book explains so many aspects of the time and the Merry Pranksters; it startled me to see how many things have since penetrated into our very culture--not just counter-culture. There are no words that I can find to explain why this book is so awesome, so just buy it, just read it and let the parallels between your life and the book surprise you. As I read the book so many things kept coming up,(I felt like I was \\"On the bus\\") I noticed strangers reading the book and discovered many alusions and found out why I dress the way that I do (I have neon orange tights with a little skirt, boots and a western style shirt on toda.) Reading this book has brought me to a new level, I love Wolfe's languange and the way the he lays it out like it is. Now when I write I write with the slang and the pase that the people I know set so that I can capture a particular sceene as did Wolfe when writing The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"The dandy and brilliant Tom Wolfe managed to understand what Kesey and his friends were up to and writes about it here in an exhausting style that conveys a mood as little other writing does. If you're interested in the 60's, here it is.It's easy to get carried away with this book and see it all as lost wonderland, but Wolfe gives us enough information to peek at the cult elements of the Pranksters and how Kesey encouraged that. It's amazing that Wolfe kept his own judgments and reactions out of the writing as well as he did.The book is thoroughly researched, although now that footage from the film taken by the Pranksters themselves is finally publicly available, certain inaccuraties--and possibilities for different interpretations--are evident. This isn't to fault the book; Wolfe did a remarkable job.Interactions with the Hells Angels are particularly interesting since one can read about those same episodes from more of an Angel perspective in Hunter Thompson's work.Some day, maybe the Kesey family will relent and donate the bus to the Smithsonian rather than continuing to let it rot in Oregon, but regardless of what happens to the bus Wolfe has perserved the early 60's with remarkable capacity."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This is an excellent work by T.W. about Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Wolfe's writing makes you feel you are right there, observing an important &amp; fun time in the sixties.I read this before Kesey's passing. He was a powerful figure and a great writer as well. I will always keep this as a time capsule of the California sub-culture in that turbulent and very experimental time. Also, the book is filled with colorful characters and is funny as heck.

There is A LOT going on in this book, which might discourage some people. But expanding your mind can be a confusing thing."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"This book is one of the coolest, weirdest, and hardest to understand book I have ever read. The topics it talks about are amazing in their awkward happenings. Wolfe talks about the Acid Reunion in great detail. The things Kesey went through in his early life such as writing books while druged up on acid is amazing. The titles of the chapters are a riot as well. Some titles are:The bladder totem, What do you think of my Buddha? and many others. I believe this book is great to read and every teenager should read this book for laughs and for the experience of what is was like to live like Ken Kesey did."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"After two attempts, 4 months, and lots of time forgotten by my bedside, I have finally been able to complete Wolfe's \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests.\\" This book is by no means an easy read and only after the first 250 pages was I able to get into the flow of the book. Wolfe has a notable talent for adapting his literary voice to match the subject of his work. Unfortunately in this case, the subject matter was a group of acid heads, which doesn't leave a very clear voice behind. The non-fiction novel was written in a non-stop stream of conscious writing style. Focus changes in a matter of words and paragraphs last for pages. Again, this was NOT an easy read. Going along with Wolfe's New Journalism, the piece was littered with noises and:::::::: interesting forms of punctuation.New journalism always brings a more entertaining light to subject matter, and Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters were funny enough to begin with. While the comedy comes blink-and-you'll-miss-it, the jokes are hearty. A fan of reading about the drug culture, this was definitely an interesting book for me to read. Once a reader can get past the dense language and difficult structure, and merry read is ahead.This book comes as a great follow up to anyone reading Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,\\" but if a reader was looking for an interesting read on the culture of the times, I'd recommend him or her to pick up some Hunter S. Thompson first. The subject matter remains the same while the writing has much more to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"I keep thinking I was born at the wrong time. I missed the expatriat scene of Fitzgerald and Hemingway, the Beats, and Kesey and his counterculture scene. Wolfe's book may not be as good as being there, but it does help those of us born far too late to understand and enjoy the scene. Wolfe writes sympathetically and pretty much from the point of view of the Pranksters, as if he had been there for all of it (he wasn't). Wolfe is a fine journalist, and he does a great job here. I think this is a very important book, and I recommend it along with: Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; Babbs' On the Bus (a nonfictional account of the bus trip); Burroughs' Junky; Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums; and Hunter Thompson's Hell's Angels (which I read right after Wolfe's book).

PS: I recently read a new book called &quot;The Leap&quot;, by Tom Ashbrook, which reminded me of Tom Wolfe's masterpiece - but in a completely updated setting.

Reading it creates a great idea of the culture and era of the 1960's hippies, it is filled with characters including the Grateful Dead, Hell's Angels, Beatniks, Timothy Leary, the Beatles, and the central characters... Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters.Ken Kesey (authour of the excellent book \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\") put together a group of adventurous people who took an infamous road trip through America, in a psychedelically painted bus and lots and lots and lots of LSD. They filmed the entire trip (which then influenced the Beatles \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" film), and met a lot of amazing people along the way.The book \\"Acid Dreams: the CIA, LSD and the Sixties\\" (also excellent) has a section on Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, which really nicely sums up what is so appealing about these self-proclaimed freaks. While lots of stuffy academics led by Timothy Leary were taking acid and walking around with clipboards, taking notes about their psychological states and writing relatively technical manuals on how to reach enlightenment... Kesey and his group gave a new dimension to acid tripping. They were \\"regular\\" people (i.e.- not stuffy academics) who had a lot of fun and approached acid and life without rules, regulations, or expectations and they took acid on the street rather than in clinical settings with clipboards. On the way they had a lot of fun, and Tom Wolfe does an amazing job spinning it into this book. Reading it gives an excellent look into who did what when and where, so it gives a great introduction to the many characters that lived in this period, but the book would be even more fun for people already familiar with the characters in the book. The great charm of this story is that it depicts real people, many of them underground anti-heroes, but the story reads like an excellent novel. Amazing!"},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Tom Wolfe follows Ken Kesey's magic bus across America in one of the best road books of the modern era. He captures the era in all its crazy, kinetic glory, from the acid tests in Haight-Ashbury to the final descent upon Timothy O'Leary's inner sanctum in New York. But, the Merry Pranksters were out of their element in the tightly controled world of the LSD guru. The Pranksters' world was a mad-cap adventure, following on the heels of Jack Kerouac with Neal Cassady at the wheel of the bus.The book gives you all the sordid details of the acid tests which launched the psychedelic world in San Francisco in the 60's. Wolfe provides wonderful word-images of these parties that revolved around the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. Kesey emerges as the leading figure of this counter culture, when LSD was still legal. However, his feel-good notion of this hallucinatory drug comes into sharp contrast with O'Leary's transcendental notions.Along the way, the Merry Pranksters meet Larry McMurtry and other interesting figures of the time, as the bus skirts the lower half of the United States before making its away north to New York. Kesey also has a brief visit with a down-and-out Jack Kerouac, whose On the Road had inspired this adventure, but Kerouac was having none of the Pranksters, much to their chagrin.Wolfe highlights the difference between the East Coast and the West Coast when it came to LSD.

My dad went to Berkeley during the sixties and he reccomended this book to me. I obviously appreciate the story and writing on another level than my dad because our lives are quite different. It was the perfect book for me to read this summer because I also read Stranger in a Strange Land AND One Flew Over... They both tie into this eye-opening, brain Mal-Functioning masterpiece. It reminded me of Tom Robbins' Another Roadside Attraction (...also a 4 star piece of writing...). However, it frustrated me. I want to live like that so much; it is so appealing. I want to be a boho. A beatnik. But that era has passed. Maybe I will start my own &quot;group&quot;. Want to join??? Kidding.

Wolfe writes in the typical Wolfian way, with plenty of obscure vocabulary, and endless clauses. Kesey is an interesting figure, and the period of time covered by Wolfe is fascinating (albeit started in media res). Particulary interesting is the coolness between Kesey and pointy-heads Timothy Leary and Rammed Ass, upon their intersection at Millbrook. Kesey had something going, something novel and unique. Of course, it was based solely on drugs, and Kesey tried, and failed, to surmount that. The world moved on, and the original spirit of the Pranksters dissipated. But it was a helluva ride while it lasted. Read five pages of the book. If you like it, keep going; if you don't, there's always The Da Vinci Code."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Ken Kesey took LSD in the early '60's while working in a California mental hospital. One result of that experience was the brilliant novel 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'; another was the decision to pursue drug experimentation as a new way of interpreting reality. With his novel's revenues supporting him Kesey became the west-coast guru of the emerging Psychedelic Movement, surrounding himself with a gang of hippies known as 'The Merry Pranksters' and leading a wild life partying with the Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady, Owsley, the Hell's Angels, Timothy Leary and assorted hangers-on, promoters and victims.In the late '60's Tom Wolfe, a leading exponent of 'the new journalism', paid Kesey a visit and sat in on the decline and eclipse of Kesey as a major player in the California counterculture. Wolfe's cool but funky irony seems like a perfect match for Kesey and co., but in fact there's a subtle mocking undercurrent to Wolfe's narrative. The whole point of the 'new journalism' was subjectivity, of course, so presumably the whole thing is MEANT to be suspect, but still... I've seen a Kesey-version of the Prankster's tale, a trade paperback that looked self-published, but don't see anything about it here at Amazon.The novel's ending is a neat skewer of Kesey and the Pranksters, and it's not giving the whole story away to describe it. The gang is scheduled to perform a psychedelic music gig at a local bar. After 'accidentally' ruining the preceding band's performance the Pranksters get their turn on stage... and can't get it together. But hey! Nothing lasts... Cassady is dead, the Psychedelic Movement was a bust, and some of the Pranksters aren't too merry anymore, and are leaving the bus... a dismal metaphor for the counter-culture."},{"Title":"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test","review":"Thinking about reading or re-reading this classic?

It's one of the miracles of 20th century fiction -- or a comment on the eternal childishness of America's national pastime -- that the bush leaguer's absurd confidences to a friend back home are still fresh and funny. &quot;I have not worked yet Al and I asked Callahan to-day what was the matter and he says I was waiting for you to get in shape. I says I am in shape now and I notice that when I was pitching in practice this A.M. they did not hit nothing out of the infield. He says That was because you are so spread out that they could not get nothing past you. He says The way you are now you cover more ground than the grand stand. I says Is that so? And he walked away.&quot; Yeah, this is clearly the same sport where the portly John Kruk turned aside a question a few years ago about conditioning with the Bartlett's-worthy, &quot;We're not athletes. We're ballplayers.&quot;Lardner does more than get laughs at the expense of his dense protagonist, though. He gives an intimate picture of baseball in its first classic era -- the busher comes face to face with Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker and Walter Johnson with interesting results. But it's not a sentimental depiction of the age: Among those with whom the busher crosses paths is the famously parsimonious and autocratic White Sox owner, Charles Comiskey. The book gives a hint of the resentments that led his players to agree to throw a World Series (as they did a few years after Lardner wrote &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;) and illustrates the indentured servitude that all but the best players endured before free agency arrived in the mid-'70s."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Ring Lardner was a newspaper sports writer in the early 1900s. He rode the trains with professional baseball players and joined in thier card games. &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; is a unique set of letters from a fictional rookie ball player to his friend Al back home. The book contains real teams and stats, but is a fast-reading fictional look at the lives of players. With everything from front office negotiations with Comiski to on-the-field trash talk, &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; is a must-read for baseball fans who miss the game of yesteryear."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"This book was a real hoot to read. Ive always loved the language that revolved around the game of baseball. Ring Lardner does a credible job of creating this youthful prospect trying to make big in The Show. The format of writing letters gives it a touch a realism. The language and grammar of this semiliterates lend it a charm that is slightly reminiscent of Huck Finn. His delusional arrogance is more humorous than offensive in the long run. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the literature and journalism that surrounds this great American game."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Not being much of a sports fan, but for many years standing close beside one, I knew nothing of Ring Lardner until I visited Niles, Michigan, pursuing a story of my own. In a quaint hometown treasures museum, we discovered the local author gone national, with a first edition of \\"You Know Me Al\\" under glass. Intrigued, I purchased a modern day copy soon after for my sports fan, but I had to read it first myself.In full agreement with Virginia Woolf in the book's Introduction, I can say you do not have to be a sports fan to enjoy Lardner's humorous portrayal of Jack Keefe, a bush-league pitcher who writes frequent letters to his best pal, Al, about his adventures on and off the baseball field. The letters are filled with hilarious misspellings, misunderstandings, and general bumblings. Jack may be a good athlete, but his mind, shall we say, is his least athletic muscle...All of which adds to the slim book's charm. Jack writes to Al about his fortunes and misfortunes in pitching, forever blaming others for his own obvious failures, never missing a chance to boast, thumping his manly chest with threats that he will beat up this guy or that for some imagined slight. His arrogance is in high form, but just about the time it approaches the point of no return, Jack charms with his naivete. One can't help but laugh at him again, much as one laughs at a child or a wildly bounding puppy.The letters are not just about baseball, however, but just as comically illustrate Jack's romantic flailings, as he imagines Violet is ever so smitten with him, then decides to marry another, only to drop her for another, only to long for the first again, only to marry Florrie. With whom the threat of divorce comes up again and again in similar cyclings. Jack waffles with all decisions in his life: team trips, moving from one city to another, borrowing and repaying funds to the silent and surely most patient and near saintly Al.It is the lack of hearing from the other side that keeps me from adding a fifth star to this review. We have only Jack's view of himself and his world, charming bumbler that he is, and I found myself often wishing for Al's side in response. Nonetheless, this is a classic that can obviously be enjoyed even over a great passage of time since its original writing some eighty years ago, and with or without a penchant for sports."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"I had not never heard of Ring Lardner until a visit to his home town in Niles Michigan right near outside of Kalamazoo. Born in Niles Michigan in 1885 Lardner was a sports writer for the Chicago Tribyoon but he is best well known for these busher letters that he rote as instalmints for The Satirday Eevning Post.The best letters were collected for this book You Know Me Al that were first published in 1914. It cronikles a bushers rise to the major league threw a serious of letters written to his pal Al in Bedford Illinoy. Jack Keefe is a right hander pitcher who has got some good stuf but he is offten his own worse enemy. He sees the baseball world round him threw child inocents seeing his skills as supeerier to every one. Think Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham. His qwik tempurr shows when he looses it is because he got no support from his team and so he blaims every one but him. And in these letters to his pal Al he shows how all too human he is even as he shows no skill with girls his team mates his manager or at writing. No atemped is made to kleen up miss-spelled words or fix up bad grammer. These letters show a glimpse into the great game of baseball threw the eyes of some one who played for Charles Comiskey, ohner of the White Sox and against Ty Cobb and Walter Johnson.You dont have to be a fan of the game to like this book. In fact I never knowed what a fadeaway fast ball was until I red this book. It is a fast ball that when the hitter hits it it fades away over the fence. And it can be red in a lot of ways.

These letters are written in a special colloquial style and include the spelling and grammatical errors of the young pitcher, and also his quite surprising startling and humorous language. This is what this classic work of American humor is largely about. And while it is filled with sarcasm and a kind of mockery at the arrogance and naievete of its main character it also presents a picture of the baseball world of those days in the terms and language of that world.A small American classic."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Athletes are much more educated & sophisticated today.

Talking baseball, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, that cheap owner, Charles Comiskey etc. Listening to the audio version as I drove along, I was smiling.

The story is told through a series of letters written by pitcher Jack Keefe of the Chicago White Sox to his buddy Al back home in Indiana. Keefe is a modestly talented pitcher finally getting his chance in the big leagues. Keefe is naive and immature, he has an excuse for every failure, and his childish emotions range greatly according to how his last game went. The author uses many real baseball figures in this story (Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, manager Nixie Callahan, etc.) and that lends an added layer of authenticity.

Only the names have changed. Talented pitcher Jack Keefe tells this story in the form of letters to his friend Al back in their hometown. Jack begins below the major leagues, but gets there with the White Sox. Jack shows his personality by his own descriptions of actions and events. Don't expect him to spell well or use the finest grammar, but frequently laugh at his choices and apparent delusion about who and what he really is. It may help if you know names like Cobb, Lajoie, Matthewson, and Comisky, and have some rudimentary knowledge of baseball, but this is an enjoyable book about Jack's life changing as his circumstances change. He faces baseball issues, management issues, women issues, and general life issues as a young man who shows himself to be nave and not completely honest with himself about who he is. Good fun, well written in a voice that seems genuine for Jack, and definitely standing the test of time."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"This is a classic.

That was a time that the name Ring Lardner was well known in sports writing and literary circles. The sports writing part was easy because that was his beat. The literary part is much harder to recognize but clearly the character of Jack Keefe has become an American classic. Does one need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this work? Hell, no. We all know, in sports or otherwise, this guy Keefe. Right? You know the guy with some talent who has no problem blaming the other guy for mistakes while he (or she) is pure as the driven snow. That is the concept that drives these stories told in the form of letters to Al, his buddy back home.The language, the malapropisms and the schemes all evoke an early more innocent time in sport and society. I do not believe that you could create such a character based on today's sport's ethic. They would all have a spokesperson \`spinning' their take on the matters of the day. The only one that might have come close is Nuke LaRouche in the movie Bull Durham but as that movie progressed Nuke was getting \`wise'. Read these stories. More than once."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"\\"You Know Me Al\\" consists of a series of rather detailed letters written by a bush-league ballplayer named Jack Keefe. Keefe has been called up from the Terre Haute team to join the Chicago White Sox. He is writing to one of his former bush-league teammates in Bedford, IN.Keefe is truly a country bumpkin, a rube, a bumbling fool who does not understand the more sophisticated world of the major leagues, but who still succeeds based on the strength of his pitching arm. The reader gets a kick out of seeing the world through his eyes but really understanding the situations he is in, similar to 'Forrest Gump', except that Jack does not have a disability - he is just ignorant.The audio version I heard (Book of the Road's version) is wonderfully performed by veteran Shakespearean actor Barry Kraft. Kraft captures his self-confidence, hoosier country-boy accent and innocence perfectly. To me, he will forever be the voice of Jack Keefe.Overall grade: B+"},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"The book profiles a talented fictitious baseball pitcher whose primary limitations are his shallowness, arrogance and bone-headedness.

Elements of the main character can be seen in many of today's sports stars. The book is an easy and amusing read."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Ring Lardner's place as one of the United States' most underrated fiction writers may be from producing almost exclusively short fiction. There, his gift for colloquialism, narrative voice, and an ironic distance between creator and character shines brightest.Even his one well-regarded novel, 1916's \\"You Know Me Al\\", speaks to Lardner's strengths as a short-distance writer. It's an engaging but thin first-person narrative about a headstrong rookie pitcher, Jack Keefe, who makes it to baseball's American League as a starter for the Chicago White Sox. Talented as he is, his selfish attitude puts him in several tight fixes which he wiggles out of with the blissful ignorance of Inspector Clouseau.It helps the busher is too dense to pick up on the ridicule he draws when getting off to a bad start, like in this sly, characteristic exchange with his manager:\\"I says Why don't you get a catcher? He says We don't need no catcher when you're pitching because you can't get nothing past their bats. Then he says You better leave your uniform in here when you go out next inning or Cobb will steal it off your back. I says My arm is sore. He says Use your other one and you'll do just as good.\\"Mention of Cobb, as in Tyrus Raymond, is important because it cues one of Lardner's most successful devices in \\"Al\\", as read at this remove in time. A number of real-life players, managers, coaches, and club owners put in appearances, sometimes in extended episodes. Keefe clashes with parsimonious owner Charles Comiskey over a couple hundred dollars and hangs his losses on teammates, including Buck Weaver, who ironically is blamed by Keefe for throwing a game for a friend. [The real Weaver would go down in history, three years after this was published, as the one \\"Black Sox\\" player who wouldn't do precisely that.]One wonders how Weaver, Comiskey, and the others reacted to \\"Al\\". They must have read it; it was the most popular thing Lardner, a famous writer, produced in his lifetime, first in magazine serial installments and then as a novel. Did they enjoy reading of themselves and get the joke was on Keefe?\\"Al's\\" format, as series of letters written by Keefe to a hometown buddy, allows for a good deal of hilarity in its deliberate unconsciousness, much of which holds together today. But as a story and a character study, it's quite thin. It boils down to this: Jack is a jerk, he's vain, and he's cheap. This last point gets pushed many times, especially during the book's creaky second half, where the now-established pitcher must share the wealth with a wife and son.Lardner's validity as a short-story writer includes the way he holds true to the voice of his central character, no matter how limited or blinkered. Here, it's a liability as the longer investment in Keefe doesn't pay off. I found myself tiring of this guy's company before long, and wishing that Lardner had traded him for Alibi Ike, not my favorite Lardner character either but a more interesting one, more amusing and sympathetic.Even reading this as a collection of short stories is unsatisfying, as the sections don't so much end as trail off. When we leave Keefe, he is getting ready to sail \\"a round the world and back\\" on a baseball tour. He is the same guy we met at the beginning, perhaps a realistic treatment of his fellow man by Lardner but not an arresting one."},{"Title":"War News from The Ranch","review":"Disclaimer: I've know the the author, and his dear, departed English-speaking golden retriever Memphis, for many years (Hi, Mike. Let Allsion read this first. She'll know best whether your ego can take it :-)It's tough reading the work of someone you know. If you don't like it, what are you supposed to say? And if you do like it, was it because of them or the book? Is one more or less critical of the work?So it was with some trepidation and anxiety that I set out upon my journey to the ranch, where the rich, eccentric arms dealer T. B. Wallace has gathered some equally eccentric characters for mysterious purposes. There's the hippie Sepanen, a draft dodger who obsesses about the Grateful Dead concerts he is missing; Bennet, a grizzled Vietnam vet who is constantly threatening to slit the throat of just about anyone who happens to disagree with him; Moon, a mentally challenged disabled Korean War vet; and Madame Hill, who may or may not be an ex-Nazi.But it's the arrival of McCreesh, a hard-drinking IRA bomber plucked down into this strange milieu by Wallace's \\"man in the field\\", that really sets things stirring. Bitingly funny, McCreesh seems intent on stirring up trouble for just about everyone, if for nothing other than his own amusement. And all the while, T. B. Wallace takes it in, waiting for his war to commence.The characters hand off the telling of the tale to each other, and the pieces of the puzzle start to come together through their different points of view. We find out how they all arrived at their present state of affairs, and wrestle with them as they try to divine Wallace's intentions.I couldn't help but think of some of Tom Robbins's novels from the 70s as I read this. There's a similar vein of absurdity throughout, sort of a Still Life With Woodpecker with guns and bombs. McCreesh, especially, is over the top. But that's hardly a bad thing, and the guy is insanely funny. There's also an element of Joseph Heller's Catch-22 at play. Maybe Wallace is a grown-up Milo Minderbender, playing both sides of the war. Only in this case, he's the syndicate.All that said, it took a while to get into the book. Upon reflection, I'd say it was due to a lack of understanding about what the heck was going on. It was also a bit difficult to get used to the \\"voices\\" of each of the characters as they told their stories. It seemed contrived at first, but became much more natural as the story went on. You've just got to let yourself go along for the ride, and by 50 pages into the trip you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"War News from The Ranch","review":"This novel dealing with the military industrial complex and how it impacts our lives is a must read.

But it does not get any further than skinned keyframe animation- which is freely described on many web sites such as nehe or flipcode. I hoped for at least some discussion beyond that basic level. It does have some value for individuals that have ignored DirectX or OpenGL to focus on the other rendering API- since it supports both rendering APIs one can learn the similar components between the two rendering solutions. But the OpenGL user interface looks pretty poor, so I question the care that the OpenGL logic has been given. All the code is in C, when one would expect C++ these days. Overall, this is a very basic text, once again devoting chapters to basic math issues like how to use points, vectors, matrices and quaternions. If you're a early high school kid itching to get an overview of programming character animation, and you've not already scoured the net reading and trying out the umpteen game programming tutorials out there, this is probably a pretty good book.

The rest of the book is very disappointing. While one could argue that the 2 chapters on matrices/quaternions is useful, this information could be found in any game/math book/website.Examples of useless stuff: chapter on User Interface(heh), chapter on initializing D3D/Opengl, chapter on macros, and worst of all, the stuff talking about what a linked-list is(wtf)I wish the author simply released this as a PDF online, because the little useful information here isn't worth a whole book."},{"Title":"Programming Dynamic Character Animation (With CD-ROM) (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"this Book is simply worth more than its price.

Jay is a former center for the LA Lakers and does not write from the viewpoint of a stuffy scholar. I encourage you to buy this book!"},{"Title":"A One on One Guide: Basic Training for Spiritual Combat: Taking Back the High Ground","review":"In Basic Training for Spiritual Combat by Jay Carty, readers learn to overcome areas in life where the devil has gained a foothold. It focuses on such specific struggles as controlling anger, resisting sexual temptation, and establishing God-honoring priorities. The author makes good use of humor, using it like seasoning in a dish, while still discerning when to be serious. There are plenty of illustrations, parables, examples, lessons from the Bible, and other helpful bits that make his major points easy to understand.What's unique about this book is that it's not passive reading. Readers will find numerous agreements to make between themselves and God. There is, for example, a chapter titled, \\"It's Time to Thump the Devil's Rump,\\" which contains prayers to pray that invoke the power of God, demolishing the strongholds the enemy has built in one's mind. Those uncomfortable using a prayer that someone else has written, can still use these prayers as guides for original prayers. Occasionally the author advises to stop, put down the book, and pray over a certain matter. The writer wants to make sure that readers don't just blitz through his book, all the while neglecting the One who has the power to make the changes in your life.Overall, the book was interesting and informative. Its only real weakness was the occasional use of innuendo and slang, which makes the book hard to understand in places. That said, anything significant is communicated clearly and with a bit of humor, making this a worthwhile book. The style is most appropriate for the ages of thirteen to thirty, but is still a great reading experience for anyone. -- Cameron Miller, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"A One on One Guide: Basic Training for Spiritual Combat: Taking Back the High Ground","review":"One of the greatest books on spiritual warfare I've read.

The lessons are presented in a logical order and fit together well so that what you've learned on Wednesday will be a building block for Friday's class. A person could probably buy this book and without too much difficulty learn Spanish without the formality of a classroom, if the desire to learn is strong. The only element I would change would be to add pictures/definitions (similar to a beginner's dictionary, for example), as I am a visual learner.

Mr. Futtrell did an excellent job telling this story from court transcripts and police reports as well as family interviews. Those familiar with the story cannot drive through Lewisburg today (42 years later) without being reminded of this horrendous crime. It is still unsolved, however I will always believe the police arrested the right \\"group\\" of perpetrators (they just couldn't single out which one was the actual killer). I doubt that it will ever be solved since the prosecution's star witness (who was actually with the killers) has since died.

I had keen interest because I knew the victims and lived in the small town where it occured. The author's intrepretation is documentary in style and easy to read. The murders happened in 1965 and it continues to make me wonder if this cold case could be solved. Mr. Harper and Mrs. Givens were abducted in 1965, their bodies found several months later and 3 persons were charged with their murders.

The return of His Son is truly worth knowing and a defense for the literal 2nd coming of Christ to a literal Israel is worth noting. Yes Jesus reigns in our hearts but He will also reign on his earth. Ryrie silences the critics with Historical truth. Historical figures, events and early beliefs which can not be altered. All we have to do is look back at History and see how the Spirit of God moved. I praise God for this book. Short but very informative."},{"Title":"The Basis of the Premillennial Faith","review":"For staunch defenders of premillennialism, there are few names as well-known as Charles Ryrie; this book provides reason enough for that stature and recognition. In The Basis of the Premillennial Faith, Dr. Ryrie brings a wide swath of argument and evidence to bear on the question of the millennial reign of Christ.He begins with a survey of the beliefs of the Church through the ages, moving from the ancient period, through medieval times, the Reformation, and ending in modern times. Here Dr. Ryrie considers various well known writers of each era, and what their beliefs about the millennial reign of Christ were by examining their writings. While the examination is not exhaustive in each case, the author builds a strong case that premillennialism, by various names, has been a vital part of the Christian Church since the beginning of the Church.His next section is an examination of the hermeneutical basis for reading the Scriptures that discuss a thousand year reign of Christ on the Earth in a literal way. Here he provides an overview of the way in which prophecy is read by the Premillennialists verses how it is read by the Amillennialist.\\"Prophecy is not a special case in that it demands special hermeneutics if such a system contradicts the basic principle of literal interpretation. There may be special outworkings of that principle but the principle must be consistent.\\" -page 36He next turns to the various covenants, starting with the Abrahamic, and moving through the Davidic, and finally into the New Covenant. For each of these, he shows how the covenant in question is related to Israel, rather than the Church, and how the Covenant is permanent, rather than temporary. There is one point on which I must disagree with Dr. Ryrie in this section: the complete separation of the Kingdom of God in Luke from the Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew. The case for premillennialism based on this separation isn't strong to begin with, however, so his argument wouldn't be weakened by overthrowing this particular line of reasoning.His discussion of the New Covenant is particularly interesting; the author puts forward the theory that there are actually two New Covenants, one with Israel, and one with the Church. The more traditional views have always left something to be desired in this area, but I'm not certain this is a solid answer, either.Following this discussion of the Covenants, Dr. Ryrie turns to a discussion of the formation and government of the Church. It's surprising how much material he finds in this area to support the premillennial reign of Christ. Finally, he considers the subject of eschatology, or last things; this is the shortest section of the book, and the one area where a reader will be able to find a good deal of material in other sources.A very well put together and argued case."},{"Title":"The Basis of the Premillennial Faith","review":"I have read Dr Ryrie's book- the basis of the premillenial faith -a great number of times. It is not a long read but it is a very accurate and clearly understandable explanation of the truth of God's word in regarding the subject of eschatology. Which is the study of end times. I would highly recommend this book for every Christian to read, and especially ones who have not yet done a study on this subject. This is a study based on the literal interpretation of God's word regarding the rapture of the church and the tribulation period, the 1000 year reign of our Lord on this earth and the final judgment of the wicked and eternal state of the righteous. All the prophecies regarding the first coming of Christ were literally fulfilled to the finest detail and this indicates the great truth which is clearly taught in God's word and believed by the early church that God's word regarding His second coming is to be taken literally as well! The premillennial position is the only one which stands squarely on this truth. I highly recommend this book! A student of scripture and a lover of solid books on scriptural teaching by men who follow the instructions of scripture and exalt Christ! Colossians 2:8-10 - Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empth deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ. For in Him dwells all the fullness of The Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him, Who is the head of all principality and power. II Timothy 2:15 and 3:15-17 gives clear instructions regarding rightly interpreting the truths of God's word. Dr. Ryrie does exactly that! I highly recommend this book!

From the transformation of the original glass pastel Jesus, to a darker Jesus figure, more representative of the real historical figures 'african and Egyptian' hue, to the inclusion of gospel music, and extension of the time of service to include more congregational interaction, Stroupe and Leach demonstrate how a deep theological 'listening' is as true a religious process, and 'revitalizing of the church body' as can be found in our time.The book does not make this process out to have been an easy one. It deals with struggle after struggle as whites and blacks worked to listen to each other, and arrived at compromises, coalitions, and evolving concensus, which has made Oakhurst Presbyterian one of the denomination's most exciting churches,and a hopeful demonstration of what 'real integration' promises.Stroupe quotes the African-American elder who said of gay folk, 'let all who want to come be welcome,' and settled anissue that still roils the larger, now united Presbyterian denomination. He quotes a young Spelman graduate who did her field research on the church, emphasizing its musical ministry, which is led by an American Methodist Episcopal choir director Ms.Price, while the church retains its more traditional but very flexible chancery choir under Nancy Buss, (both 'integrated' of course..yes, white folks sing gospel music, and the church is the location of an annual gospel choir 'singing event.')Since I have been attending for several years, I've witnessed a Reggae Christmas, as the President of the church is originally from Jamaica, and I've witnessed an 'Appalachian' emphasis Christmas, as Caroline Leach very much identifies with her Tennesee mountain heritage, and its musical tradition.At a recent youth Sunday, there was a young couple of Ghanian singers, as well as African dancers, and a young woman giving the sermon who was gifted with what I recognize as a British accent, whether from 'the islands' or Nigeria, I'm not sure.Week to week, Nibs Stroupe is the primary giver of sermons, although both pastors often do a dialogue sermon, and there is almost always an intern, a woman, or African American student intern, from nearby Columbia Seminary, and many visiting ministers, to vary the pulpit perspective. It is Stroupe's constant theme that the contemporary idols of race, sex, gender, money, power and violence, among others, that are the real threats to the rejuvenated Christianity that our civilization caught a glimpse of in the sixties, and which each week, finds new, and unique expression at this church, of which I am very proud to be a member.God loves diversity, say Stroupe and Lynch, or he wouldn't have made us so, diverse that is..and this church celebrates diversity."},{"Title":"Hermetica, Part 1: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings Which Contain Religious or Philosophic Teachings Ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus","review":"If you just want to read the Hermetica, read Brian Copenhaver's translations, which are much better than Scott's. And of course, these aren't by Sir Walter Scott (of Ivanhoe fame) anyway, if you're interested in him for some reason, but by a quite different Walter Scott.Scott's translations are still valuable for the specialist. You should be able to find used copies of the trade paperback edition (Hermes House, at one point), though, which are rather better bound than these Kessinger xeroxes.If you have Copenhaver, you'll probably want these, although I'd recommend a different printing."},{"Title":"Hermetica, Part 1: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings Which Contain Religious or Philosophic Teachings Ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus","review":"I like this book for a study on Hermetics...I read \\"The Kybalion\\" The Hermetica\\" and am also reading \\"Initiation into Hermetics \\" by Franz Bardon.

This is not the fault of the translator as far as I can tell and may just be this readers opinion.I have one other translation by Brian Copenhaver.

Their fathers did say that they could participate in helping the Patriot cause if something came up that they could do, but only with their mothers' permission. Both fathers and sons thought this could hardly occur, and all were surprised.Guy and Louis were living outside Yorktown, and were having fun at the river when a man in a British red uniform accosted them. Morgan was an American spy for the Patriot cause, having enlisted in the British army to gain information. He asked them to carry a message to their fathers concerning the plans of the British. After receiving permission from their mothers, the boys began on their adventure, which takes them right into the British lines in Yorktown. Their courage and character is tested in the danger that follows.I was pleased to read that although the boys were anxious to be involved in the war, respect and obedience to their parents ranked a higher authority. Many children's adventures involve escapades carried out in spite of not having their parents knowledge, approval or permission. This adventure is in no way less exciting because the boys honored their parents and their parents' wishes.Written for teens, this book provides an adventure along with plenty of information about both armies in Yorktown. More interesting and memorable than a simple history lesson, the story gives material that will stick with the reader. Some children younger than teens may enjoy the story if it is read aloud, and older ones will enjoy breezing through it. Those who read the works of G. A. Henty will find this an easier though not simplistic read, in the same vein as Henty's.Add this one to your history adventure shelf!"},{"Title":"Morgan, the Jersey spy: A story of the siege of Yorktown in 1781 (Young patriot series)","review":"Two young cousins, Luis and Guy, are determined to someday help their country by serving in the American army against the British Redcoats.

But when the cousins meet Morgan, a faithful American spy dressed as a Red Coat, their loyalty and bravery will be put to the test in the adventures they must face.___________________________________________________I honestly have no idea how anyone could truly enjoy this book. What could have been a fantastic story was too short (172 pages), unemotional, underdeveloped, unrealistic, and just plain stupid. Everything about it was boring. Nothing really happened. The cousins were sent on a journey to give some information to Morgan the Jersey spy, but I quickly forgot the information - and if I forgot the reason why they were going straight into the enemy's camp, how important was that information, really? So what did James Otis write about? Not much.As far as characters go... Louis and Guy did things that anyone would never do. Their actions were way overdrawn and most of the time, the conversations were cheesy and never progressed the story. Morgan was the only \\"good\\" character, and even he was just...ok.The story didn't even have the feel of the time period it was set in. It was as though James Otis had his own ideas of what he wanted the war to look/feel like. I am so disappointed because I was actually really, really excited to read this book.

The development of the submarine and the use of the Hunley in the sinking of the Housatonic covered two thirds of the book. The remaining third details the rediscovery of the lost submarine.Here is what I don't like about the book. It tells the story in very simple terms. The first two fatal accidents with the Hunley are very briefly described. The further development of Davids (advanced Confederate subs) was mentioned once. The sinking is covered in ten pages. The rediscovery of the sub is covered in over thirty pages. I want to know the history of the sub and what other developments occurred, but this is missing in this book.

In 23 mostly unrelated episodesDon Camillo squares off in passionate battles against: the equally irrascible Mayor, Peppone, as well as with stubborn peasants, gossipy villagers, his own church superiors and even himself. Yet in moments of anguish or crisis he pours out his heart to the Christ on the crucifix in his church, who listens with compasison, speaking so that only the burly priest hears and understands. Ah, but will he prove contrite or obedientto the wisdom of his Lord?Hot-tempered, robust and occasionally self-indulgent (cigars, hunting, his dog) this village priest is as often embroiled in public debates with the representative of temporal authority (the Communist mayor) as in private attacks of conscience. But don't be fooled by the apparent enmity between these two hard-headed leaders of opposingviews (the Reds vs the Whites); the two stongest men daily butt heads and seek to outdo or discredit each other--which is only to be expected. Fortunately though, when the chips are down, these two--no longer priest and mayor--demonstrate their true friendship and Christian charity, loyalty and respect. Though neither would ever admit such human weakness in public! Guareschi has created a gentle, amusing little world of his own--for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Don Camillo takes the Devil by the tail","review":"This Character is from my parents generation - I discovered him in the 1970's and am happy to see him back today.

In vivid detail and beautiful, simple, at times haunting, prose Ruth Elias describes the horrifically unimaginable: her day-to-day survival - body, mind and soul - at Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and the labor camps; as well as later on the many challenges she faced and overcame of starting a new life, first in Prague and then in Israel.Reading this book helped me understand for the first time that the Nazis not only sought to exterminate the Jewish people physically, but wanted to break their very minds, hearts, spirit, their very soul. But Ruth would not let them. Her great love for her fellow man, for life, and her sheer courage, presence of mind, and bravery is a testament to the human spirit even in the darkest, most cruelest of times. One of the most heartbreaking memories is her giving birth to a little baby girl at Auschwitz - only to become part of Mengele's sadistic experiment.Yet the book is also one of miracles, of unexpected acts of kindness, and of hope. Ruth Elias teaches all of us, that even in the darkest of times and under the direst of circumstances, you can express and find love, strength, ingenuity, and even sing and play the accordian.I cannot recommend \\"Triumph of Hope\\" highly enough."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"Holocaust statistics are both well known (although the story of \\"Bishop\\" Williamson reminds us that the fight against Holocaust denial is never over), and sometimes incapable of helping us understand in a deeper sense what happened. Personal stories, when well told, help us come at least somewhat closer to comprehending the incomprehensible. Ruth Elias has written her story, which even among such stories must rate as one of the worst, with a sober clarity and directness that make it all the more effective. We also get a good sense of how difficult the struggle afterward was. And yet she was able to build a strong, constructive family life in spite of, and even incorporating, her experiences. I am grateful to Ruth Elias for having shared this story.Guido Smit, Toronto"},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"This memoir goes to show that, despite what some people might say, it really is true that no two Shoah memoirs and experiences are exactly alike. Rutinko Huppner (now Ruth Elias) grew up in a rather wealthy family in the former Czechoslovakia, and after her young mother divorced her father when she was 6 years old, Rutinko and her older sister Edith were raised by a single father, with help from their uncle Hugo (their father's brother) and his wife Irma, along with a whole slew of grandparents and other aunts and uncles. Later on their father remarried, though Ruth and her sister, teenagers by then, really resented their stepmother and tried everything they could to make her life miserable. Being wealthy, Rutinko and Edith had access to things that their friends, neighbors, and classmates could only dream about, such as sausage for school lunch, a car, being driven to and from school, vacations in the mountains, musical instruments and music lessons, and a lot of other great stuff. They even had the money and connections to get permission and papers to leave Czechoslovakia for England after the Nazi takeover in 1939, though she and her sister decided not to go through with it due to their father's ill health and wanting the family to stay together through this difficult time.The family were able to go into hiding in a few different cities, where they enjoyed a relatively secure and happy life. Ruth and Edith even found the time to have romances and to be active in a secret Jewish youth group. However, there was eventually a raid on the area, and Ruth, Edith, their father and stepmother, and their aunt Irma were taken away to Theresienstadt (Terezin). Their uncle Hugo wasn't taken because he was very sick in the hospital and dying of cancer. Once in the large ghetto, they found themselves separated from their father, since men and women were quartered separately. However, shortly before they arrived, Ruth's boyfriend Koni and his own family had been deported, and this relationship ended up saving her life, since if Koni hadn't married her while she was sick in the hospital, she would have been deported along with the rest of her family when they were. From this point on out Ruth was along but for the friends she made, and she and Koni weren't even able to properly live together as husband and wife for some time. However, even in the ghetto love blossomed, and eventually Ruth discovered she was pregnant. After doing absolutely everything to try to find a doctor who would give her an abortion, she ended up being deported when she was two months pregnant, and was one of the few women who survived in that condition instead of being murdered on arrival. A lot of circumstances came together to save her life and to keep her alive even in spite of her condition, many of them decisions she had only a split second to make if she wanted to live. Eventually she had to make the most difficult and heartrending decision of all when her baby was born, so that the infamous \\"Dr.\\" Mengele wouldn't kill them both.Once she was no longer pregnant, Ruth was viewed as a healthy fit young worker, and was transferred, along with her friend Berta, who had also been pregnant, to Taucha, a subcamp of Buchenwald. In this camp, they were put into a special privileged work detail, which accounted for their eventual survival. After being liberated, their group of Czechs made their way home and found that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, their loved ones just were not coming home and that they'd had to start over again from scratch. I was surprised to learn that many young people like Ruth and her boyfriend Kurt just lived together after the war instead of getting married, since they had to wait two years before their missing spouses could legally be considered dead, even though everyone knew what had most likely befallen them. Ruth also had to make the difficult decision to divorce her husband, who had survived as well, because they'd just grown apart and she felt he hadn't acted very appropriately towards her when they were in the Family Camp at Auschwitz. A few relatives came back, but no one from her immediate family. It was with this new family of two that she left Czechoslovakia for Israel shortly after independence was declared, and just in the nick of time, before the Czech borders became closed.Mrs. Elias went through some of the worst things imaginable (a number of times she even writes about how hard it was to just almost matter-of-factly type such heavy words like \\"None survived\\" or \\"They were probably all gassed\\"), and yet she came through everything alive and determined to start again, to make a new life for herself in her own homeland, to make sure that no one ever looked down on her or abused her ever again. It just goes to show that the human spirit is an amazing thing."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"This book never lags and never loses your interest. It is very well written. It is an inspiring and insightful account of a woman's courage and determination to survive the Holocaust. I only wish the book continued because I wanted more. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"This book really opened my eyes to the living HELL these Jewish people went through. We learn about it in school, but the schoolbooks just scratch the surface of the emotional and physical turmoil these people went through. I wanted to learn more about this period. And when I did it explained why there are some people who think that the Holocaust never happened. I think that they don't want to believe that a human being could do that to another person! They go into denial. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to learn more and can handle the very disturbing REAL events that happened to REAL people. Ruth Elias is a heroic person and I would LOVE to have the oppurtunity to meet her."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"I found this book not only an unbelievable book to read but also a book which I learnt a lot from. As I am learning about the Holocaust in school now, it was good to hear a personal story from the horses mouth(so to speak) of what actually happened. Often when you hear stories they are changed each time they are retold, like the game broken telephone. But when you read a book which was written by the person who was the actual survivor, you know it isn't going to be all distorted and something you can actually learn from. I am still unable to comprehend exactly how it all happened but it did so now we should make sure that the story of the Holocaust is told to the future Jewish and non-Jewish generations to come, to make sure it is never forgotten. Also to make sure Holocaust deniers don't convince people that the Holocaust never happened as they are very persuasive with their stupid lies. Unfortunatley one day we won't have any survivors left and that is why we need to educate the future which is my generation and the generations that follow. So I recommend if you haven't read this book to read it and if you have or once you finish, recommend it to everyone to read. Ruth Elias is not only a fabulous author but a fabulous and heroic person. She is someone we should all look up to."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"Ruth Elias' moving memoir of surviving the Holocaust and then building a new life in Israel is a haunting reminder of how resilient the human spirit is. She survives Theresienstadt and Auschwitz after losing all her family to the Nazis. In her memoir's most unforgettable episode, she delivers a daughter in a dirty, makeshift bed at Auschwitz and becomes a subject in one of Joseph Mengele's most gruesome experiments. Her infant will satisfy Mengele's curiosity about the amount of time a newborn can survive without nourishment. Elias' breasts are bandaged so that she cannot breastfeed and the child she can't bear to name suffers horribly for six days. A fellow prisoner provides a morphine injection to put the baby out of its misery and Elias herself delivers the death dosage. This is powerful narrative from a woman who saw degradation and death and survived thanks to her will and her love of music. It's an interesting addition to the list of Holocaust memoirs and a remind! er that the dream of Eretz Israel helped people like Ruth Elias survive to tell the tale the Nazis wanted no one to hear. I only wish that Elias had added more about her early years in Israel to her narrative, but perhaps she's saving that for a sequel to her memoirs."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"Ruth's journey into the world of hell and horror leaves one feeling riveted and emotionally drained.

I literally had to stop reading and bawl my eyes out for a good 10 minutes. This woman endured so much, and with such grace, that you cannot help but be invested in her story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"Reading or seeing a documentary about the horrendous murders of six million Jews and five million other \\"undesirables\\" by the Nazis during WWII is shocking -- especially when we remember that all the victims were individuals who had their own unique history, a life of dreams and hopes. Every Holocaust survivor has a unique story to tell. This definitely includes Ruth Elias in her memoir \\"Triumph of Hope.\\"The reader gets a glimpse of life in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia where Ruth Elias, the daughter of divorced parents, grew up. Her family, the Huppets, were members of a vibrant Jewish community. Ruth was taken by horse and carriage to the Jewish grammar school. Every day a needy family ate lunch at their home. Anti-Semitism was quite prevalent in Moravia, part of Czechoslovakia, especially among the young ethnic Germans. The Sokol Athletic Association was notorious for its anti-Semitism.The Germans invaded Moravia in March 1939. Every day new decrees referring to the persecution of Jews were issued. Ruth's father and her only sister Edith were sent to Auschwitz, and perished there. Later on, Ruth was deported to Theresienstadt - a ghetto where about 60,000 Jews were crammed. It was set up by the German occupiers to be \\"the kingdom of deceit.\\" The Germans were so successful in their propaganda efforts that even the Red Cross came to believe that the place was a decent, and even ideal, place for its \\"residents.\\" In reality, the conditions were terrible; starvation and diseases flourished, and the inhabitants were merely languishing before being shipped off to Auschwitz for extermination. Out of 15,000 children only 100 -- less than one percent -- survived. Ruth got married there to Koni. Later on while pregnant, Ruth was sent to Auschwitz. Most pregnant women were gassed and cremated upon arrival. Ruth managed for a while to conceal her pregnancy. Eventually a midwife in a dirty makeshift bed cut Ruth's umbilical cord with unsterilized scissors and told Ruth, \\"You have given birth to a healthy, well developed girl.\\" Ruth's spontaneous response was, \\"What for? Why?\\" When infamous Joseph Mengele found out that Ruth was very close to giving birth, he decided to keep her around for sadistic medical experiments. He instructed a nurse to bind Ruth's breasts with bandages so she couldn't nurse the child. For seven days and nights she watched her firstborn disintegrate. The baby's cries became weaker, and then she became too weak even to cry. Ruth murmured to her child, to herself: \\"In the few days you have been on this earth, you have already had to endure so much torment. You haven't committed any sin, yet you are being punished so severely. Is there anything that I as your mother can do? Do I have the right to even think of ending both our lives? How can you and I live through this?\\" On the seventh day, Meca Steinberg, a Jewish prisoner, told Ruth: \\"I have brought you a hypodermic syringe containing morphine. Ruth protested, \\"I cannot be the murderer of my own child!\\" To which Meca responded: \\"Ruth, you are young, you must stay alive, your child will soon die anyway, inject it into your child.\\" Meca risked her life to steal the morphine. She gave it to Ruth, saying, \\"I, as a doctor, have sworn the Hippocratic Oath and it is my duty to save human life, your life. Ruth, you must save your own life.\\" Ruth injected the morphine into the baby and killed her painlessly. Thus, Mengele turned Ruth into the murderer of her own child.Ruth survived Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and other forced-labor camps. Back in Czechoslovakia, not many people could comprehend or show an interest in what she had gone through. The living hell she had survived gained few ears willing to listen to her travails, even in Israel, the country of her coreligionists, the land of her ancestry that she had been yearning for. As a Holocaust survivor myself, I grieve with her and feel her pain; the incomprehensible to many is very comprehensible to me.\\"Triumph of Hope\\" is a remarkable book. It is well-written, not by a professional author, but by an extraordinary person. The book is extensively descriptive and at times haunting as it describes in vivid detail, the many challenges the author had to face during the Holocaust and its aftermath, as she tried to start a new life in Czechoslovakia and eventually in Israel. This book was recommended to me by the author's relative in England. I am indeed grateful to him for recommending it to me, and I am sure that many readers will rave about the book, learn from it, and be appreciative of having all those things that Ruth and so many others, under the Nazi yoke, had been deprived of. This book is inspiring; it is insightful and highly recommendable."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"I have, through the miracle of google, just reconnected with my father's family. We always believed that they had all perished in the holocaust. Ruth Elias was my first cousin. This book is the greatest gift I have ever been given. It tells the wonders of the life my family had before the war and the horror of the Nazi's. My family lost everything to the Nazis. But there is a miracle in her survival. I cannot begin to comprehend how one would continue to wish to live. It is not just a triumph of hope but the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"I finished reading Triumph of Hope this morning, after starting it two days ago. I simply couldn't put it down. The author, Ruth Elias, is nothing less than extraordinary. The way that she expresses her memories, through her style of writing and description, helps us to get one step closer to understanding an experience, which we can never really comprehend, because we were not there. Mrs Elias's life is remarkable, and through reading her book I thoroughly believe that she is a genuinely lovely, kind and warm person. It is such a tragedy that the Jewish people of her generation went through turmoil and absolute hell. But through this book, Ruth's aims - to spread the message that the discrimination and racism they experienced should never be repeated - are being achieved when a single person reads her book. Her message is being spread over the world, and I am glad that i was able to read Triumph of Hope. I intend to share this book with my family and friends, so that they can read of such an incredible woman, and a generation of people who refused to give in. I sincerely recomend this book to anyone who is thinking of buying this, for themselves or for others."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"This book really opened my eyes to the living HELL these Jewish people went through.

But the pressing memory that I have of this book, is the decision that Mrs. Elias was forced to make in order to save the life of her beautiful baby girl."},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","review":"A better-than-average Holocaust memoir. Ruth Elias spent some time in Theresienstadt, married there, and arrived in Auschwitz pregnant. Most pregnant women are gassed immediately, but they missed her condition, and she became adept at hiding it. When they did find out, she was very close to giving birth. The infamous Mengele decided to keep Ruth around to experiment how long a newborn baby will live without being fed. So he bound Ruth's breasts up so she couldn't nurse the child, and left them together for seven terrible days and nights. Seven days, seven nights that she watched her firstborn disintegrate and die. Wailing loudly the first few days, then its cries became weaker, like those of a kitten, then it became too weak even to cry. On the seventh day, a compassionate Jewish doctor risked her life to steal some morphine. She gave it to Ruth, who injected it into the baby and killed it painlessly. I defy any reader to get through those few pages without getting tears in their eyes.That Ruth survived all that, and more, is a testimony to just how resilient and adaptable we humans are. It was a good book, very detailed, telling everything matter-of-fact and without self-pity. Ruth was the only survivor in her immediate family. Her husband survived, but she split with him and married another survivor who lost his wife and little daughter in Auschwitz."},{"Title":"What About Baptism?

It addresses so many pertinent issues...I'm so glad I was able to add it to my library."},{"Title":"Living With Brain Injury, (VHS Tape)","review":"While this book is excellent, it is ten years old. I prefer the much newer Mindstorms: The Complete Guide for Families Living with Traumatic Brain Injury (2009). Living with Brain Injury answers most of the questions asked by those new to brain injury. It's easy to read (with one exception) and can be digested in small portions. This is important because this book should be read by families as soon as possible after an injury. When I first picked up Living with a Brain Injury a few days after my wife's accident, I found much of Chapter 1, \\"An Anatomy Lesson,\\" rough going. I'm not sure any writer could explain the complex operations of the brain in a manner that is understood easily by traumatized family members. I quickly moved on to the other more accessible chapters. Chapters 2-4 describe what happens to the brain when it's injured and the types and degrees of brain injury. Chapter 5 introduces the diagnostic and predictive tools used by medical personnel. When Jessica's doctors told me she would be changed forever by her brain injury, I turned to Chapters 6-8, which describe, in lay language, the most common physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms suffered by survivors. Chapter 9, \\"How to Pick the Right Rehabilitation Hospital\\" lists the fifteen components every rehabilitation program should include. Chapters 10 and 11 describe the rehabilitation personnel and processes that will help your survivor recover as well as possible. Chapter 12 provides even more hope in its explanation of the amazing ability of the brain to rewire itself around damaged areas. Returning home from the hospital presents new challenges to both survivors and caregivers. The final two chapters address these issues. Throughout Living with Brain Injury, Senelick and Dougherty assure their readers that people can recover well from a brain injury, something that we all can't hear too often."},{"Title":"Living With Brain Injury, (VHS Tape)","review":"All the other books I've read on that subject (my husband has TBI) are too techical.

He then compares the methodology of Scholasticism (controversial, argumentative, apologetical, deductive and inductive) with the methodology of present day theology (open to dialogue, inductive, hermeneutical, empirical, interested not only in the content of the faith, but in its dynamics and socio-political applications). In the book the reader will also learn about ten approaches to Scriptures; Hans Kung's christological presuppositions; and the transformative power of beliefs."},{"Title":"The craft of theology: From symbol to system","review":"The Craft of Theology speaks to the theological method followed in order to arrive at a standard for ordering our daily lives.

Especially those problems that seem unbearable; but after reading this book, you will realize that your issues can be solved."},{"Title":"The Monkey Tree","review":"this book is a good book about a 14-year-old girl who has drawn a picture called the monkey tree telling us that we should help other people. like Susanna i also felt like her trying to help other people so that they can have better lives instead having a really bad one. So in the end i think that is a good book to read if your in the 7th or 8th grade."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"Why did I like this book?*Excellent adventure*Thrilling intrigue*Exciting military strategies*Extraordinary camaraderie*Vicious villainsI don't know pick one...I enjoyed Bernard Cornwell's \\"Sharpe's Sword\\". The year is 1812, the location is Salamanca Spain. It is here that General Wellington must battle the French forces for the Western portion of the peninsula. Wellington's goal is to defeat the French, Sharpe's goal is to survive and be with his men. Captain Sharpe finds himself surrounded by spies and treachery, friends become enemies and enemies become friends. Sharpe can only place his trust in his faithful chosen men or in the doughty Major Hogan. Everyone else is suspect. Unlike the other Sharpe books, \\"Sword\\" doesn't spend a lot of time with the battles. Sharpe is drawn into a different battle field... the battle field of palace intrigue. Before long Sharpe is sharing the company of the beautiful... and mysterious La Marquesa. He battles the evil Colonel Leroux. Leroux's claim to fame is his usage of torture and cruelty. Along the way Sharpe is shot, lied to and very nearly stabbed by the same sword he covets.I started with the PBS/BBS series, graduated to the audio tapes and now have read most of the novels. I wholeheartedly endorse the Sharpe series. It's great entertainment."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"I have been reading the Sharpe series \\"mostly in order\\". Sharpe's Sword, to my taste, was the best so far. Cornwell had really matured as a writer by this time. I would not have expected a description of a near-fatal wound and its effects on a character we absolutely KNOW is going to survive to be so riveting and stirring. As always, Cornwell's closing historical note is like dessert after a fine meal, or perhaps more correctly like the moment where a magician steps back to reveal his secrets -- and you're left more in awe than ever, wondering, \\"How does he do it?\\"I keep lists of the 20 to 40 books I read each year (anal, eh?), and this is the first in years I've given a full 5 stars. (I even forgive Mr. Cornwell now for the only regrettable book in the series so far, \\"Sharpe's Battle\\".) Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"In order of publication, this is the 5th book in the Richard Sharpe series , but the 11th in a &quot;timeline&quot;. As such , the author Bernard Cornwell has smoothed out his writing style to give Sharpe a lot more depth of character and a three dimensional aspect lacking in some of the earlier adventures.In addition to Richard Sharpe ,Major Hogan , Wellington , and Patrick Harper , there are many interesting new characters introduced--La Marquesa (Helena) , Lord Jack Spears , &quot;El Mirador&quot; , and of course a vile villian , Colonel Laroux. All of these characters are artfully blended to achieve an exciting military adventure in which our hero Sharpe is gravely wounded ,and is rescued by his friend Patrick Harper. After being nursed back to health , Sharpe seeks his vengance against the man who wounded him.The plot of this story involves a possible comprimise of the intelligence network of Major Michael Hogan and the possible exposure of his top agent , the mysterious El Mirador. Colonel Laroux , sent by Napoleon Bonaparte himself to destroy El Mirador , proves to be a ruthless enemy devoid of any honor. To reveal any more than this would indeed compromise the book's enjoyment for the reader , so I'll stop right here.This volume seems to have it all--excitement,intrigue,romance,and of course the inevitable battle action! Of the 11 volumes I have read in timeline order , this one is right at the top of &quot;my list&quot; along with &quot;Sharpe's Tiger&quot; and &quot;Sharpe's Triumph&quot; for sheer entertainment value and excitement! Five stars and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"I always thought this one of the better Sharpe novels. After reading it again after seeing both the battlefield and city of Salamanca I was confirmed in this belief. The descriptions of the city of Salamanca are accurate. This is a lovely place, and Cornwell no doubt was moved by its beauty to impart these feelings into the novel. Sharpe's confrontation with Leroux is your standard bit we have come to expect in these novels. The action is well paced and quite good. Even Sharpe's affair with the mysterious \\"Golden Whore\\" while predictable is nicely done. The wound that he receives from Leroux is dramatically done, although I doubt he could have recovered so well in such a short time. Sharpe's pain and suffering in the Dying Room are thoughfully done. One almost feels his delirium. The central piece in the novel is the battle of Salamanca itself, sadly lacking in the TV version of the novel unfortunatly. Here Cornwell writes what he does best, battle descriptions. The violent ebb and flow of this epic confrontation shows Cornwell at his best. This was truly the deciding battle of the Peninsular War, and probably was the most balanced in terms of forces and troop qaulity on both sides. After having visited the battlefield, Cornwell's description falls nicely into place. Of course Sharpe saves the day as usual, but its believeable. One of the better novels in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"This book in the Sharpe series is one of my all time favorites because it illustrates the reguard that Sgt Harper has for his commanding officer. Wounded by a sadistic enemy officer, Sharpe's only hope lays in his friend Harper and Harper's construction of a replacement sword for Sharpe. While such a relationship between an officer and sgt probably was unheard of, it still makes a facinating read. One sees a strong resemblance between the Sharpe/Harper relationship and the Frodo/Sam relationship in the Lord of the Rings Series by Tolkien. Cornwell does a good job humanizing his characters in this book and making them seem so real to the reader."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"For anyone who has seen the Sharpe series on TV, I would strongly recommend reading the books. They are very different from the TV version, but just similar enough that you can hear Sean Bean uttering Sharpe's sentences. A must-read for fans, and a great novel for people who've never seen the TV version."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"As always, I encourage you to read the books in this series in the order of the chronology they describe rather than by publication date. Mr. Cornwell has come back again and again to \\"fill in\\" between books with other books. You'll enjoy the series more in a logical order.At the current time, this is the 14th book in the chronological series.After the desperate battles to throw the French out of Portugal and to enter Spain by breaching two fortresses, the British and their Portuguese and Spanish allies are near Salamanca looking to set up a battle that they can win decisively against the larger French forces.As the book opens, the dangerous French Colonel Laroux has extracted some important information about a British spy ring through torture. But he's made a mistake and taken too long. He's at risk to be captured. Being a capable dissembler, Laroux soon has most of the British fooled . . . but not Sharpe. Laroux soon shows his true colors and the British realize it's essential that they contain Laroux's information before their spies are killed.In the process, Sharpe becomes fascinated by Laroux's sword and begins to wish it were his. You'll begin to wonder how that might occur.Next, Wellington has the relatively simple task of seizing three forts against far from extreme opposition after the main French army retreats. But it proves to be more difficult than expected. Someone has tipped off the French about when and where the attack will come.Sharpe meanwhile is drawn into the party life of the Spanish aristocracy, finding himself drawn to the alluring La Marquesa despite being a newly married man. Is she also interested?Sharpe is now asked to solely focus on Laroux, and a fascinating sequence of unexpected events ensues.In the second half of the book, you'll find many more surprises than most Sharpe novels contain. As the historical note at the end indicates, many of these surprises follow the facts of the real history pretty closely. Within that framework, Mr. Cornwell has added his magic touch to weave some imaginary plots involving fictional characters that work seamlessly together. It's very nice!Although the battle writing cannot be nearly as engaging as usual because the nature of the battles here provide a less interesting factual basis for the descriptions, there are still some pretty neat touches in giving us a sense of how Wellington won the day against the crafty and determined marshal Marmont."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe series is one of the most beloved collective works in the sub-genre of historical fiction. Spanning over twenty novels (and counting!), Cornwell has treated his readers with thrilling battlefield and bedroom exploits from Flanders to India to Spain and France. While the novels have a definitive formula, they never grow stale.\\"Sharpe's Sword\\" is among the best of the Sharpe novels. Sharpe is a captain of the 95th Rifles, attached to the South Essex regiment as a light company. As fans of the series know, Sharpe has made himself indispensable to the British army (including his patron, Lord Wellington) by being the most lethal rogue in an army full of cut-throats and vagabonds. But in \\"Sharpe's Sword,\\" Cornwell has created a foe worthy of Sharpe - the French spy-hunter Leroux, a lethal aristocrat whose charge from Napoleon is to topple the British spy network.Leroux is captured by Sharpe early in the novel, but takes advantage of a foolish British officer's notion of \\"parole\\" (in which a captured officer may keep his weapons and freedom if he gives his sworn statement that he will not try to escape). Acting quickly, Leroux murders his way back to freedom, but in doing so he earns Sharpe's undying hatred . . . and envy. Sharpe hates him for being a backstabbing liar, but Sharpe envies him because Leroux has the most magnificent sword Sharpe has ever seen, and Sharpe wants it.And so Sharpe and Leroux are caught in a duel to the death while the French and British armies slug it out in the gorgeous city of Salamanca and also on the plains of Spain. \\"Sharpe's Sword\\" has it all - humor, romance, intrigue, friendship, betrayal, and battles. And what battles! Nobody writes a better battle scene than Bernard Cornwell, and he tops himself when describing a suicidal, insane cavalry charge by Wellington's German heavy cavalry against formed French squares. The reader is flung into the wild madness that is Napoleonic warfare, and it is a glorious madness indeed.Well-researched and lovingly written, \\"Sharpe's Sword\\" exemplifies all that is good in the Sharpe series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"This is another entry on the Sharpe series. It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"This entry in Corwell's Napoleonic Wars series follows the further exploits of Cpt. Sharpe during the Salamanca Campaign of June and July, 1812. It brings the same ingredients to the tale that can be found in abundance throughout the series: action, intrigue, a beautiful woman, gory battle scenes, and a lethal villain. This time, the villain is a French spymaster keen to discover the identity of England's top spy, &quot;El Mirador,&quot; and destroy his network. Although captured at the very beginning, he later manages to escape and elude capture, almost killing Sharpe and Harper along the way. The following scenes of Sharpe's journal through the army medical corps is horrific. Cornwell follows the nastiness with some of the series most sentimental and tender moments, as he shows Harper's devotion in nursing Sharpe back to health. Interwoven is the now-married Sharpe's temptation by the lusciousness of &quot;La Marquessa,&quot; a French/Spanish aristocrat at the top of Salamanca's social ladder. Here, Cornwell does exceedingly well at portraying the opulence of the upper crust, and Sharpe's discomfort in mixing with them. Kudos are also due for his seamless insertion of two historically based Irishmen as important supporting characters. Less successful is his sleight of hand at concealing the identity of &quot;El Mirador,&quot; which somewhat weakens the enjoyment. The battle scenes take up somewhat less space than in some of the other books, but as always, are nicely done. Another fine entry in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"I've been reading through the entire series chronologically and up until now i've been hard pressed to pick a favorite. After reading Sharpe's Sword however i have a clear choice.In Sharpe's Sword, Cornwell gives the reader his true best - putting together a plot so interesting that one can even claim that in this novel it trumps his ability at \\"battlefield writing\\" where i believe Cornwell is the best living author- and that's saying something.If you want a good introduction to cornwell's writing ability and you don't mind starting most of the way through a series i highly recommend Sharpe's Sword."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"This novel was reprinted by Signet in 2004. The story is set before, during, and after the battle of Salmanca. Sharpe crosses paths with the evil French Colonel Leroux, a man who will kill his own followers if it suits his purpose, and is given orders from General Wellington to hunt him down. Events lead Sharpe into a relationship with yet another woman, and we find him cheating on his wife. Experience has never taught Sharpe never to trust a woman, and he gets what he deserves.Sharpe is given up for dead, but miraculously rebounds with the help of Sergeant Harper, and if able to rejoin his company during the battle. Enemy agents and misinformation play a role in the planning of the battle. Some secret identities become a bit transparent as the story progresses.

And, for my taste, \\"Sharpe's Sword\\" is a bit heavy on the spy angle and a hair light on the battles. But the book's action scenes, while failing to rival those in, say, \\"Sharpe's Rifles,\\" \\"Sharpe's Eagle\\" or \\"Sharpe's Company,\\" are still pretty satisfying. \\"Sharpe's Sword\\" is far from the weakest of the generally very strong Sharpe series (of the ones that I've read so far, I'd say that \\"Sharpe's Prey\\" my least favorite), but it doesn't quite rank among the very best, either."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"This book had me from the start.

I hope the well is far from dry!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"I am in the process of reading all of the Sharpe series and all of the books are great.The books are well written and bring your dictionary."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"Our Hero, Captain Richard Sharpe, has been a married man for a few months when this story opens and he meets the fabulous Marquesa Helena. She's beautiful, aristocratic , blonde and not quite what she seems, so you guessed it, Sharpe is a goner. And I suspect she has read several of the Bernard Cornwell books because she knows how to get him to do whatever she wants: while you are in bed with him, tell him someone is threatening to do awful things to you. Hey presto - he's yours.The situation in Sharpe's Sword is this: Our Hero and his cohorts are responsible for a prisoner, a French dragoon officer, whom we already know is a master spy and nasty guy named Leroux in disguise. He is under the direct command of Napoleon himself, entrusted with finding a list of all the agents helping the British in Europe and beyond, and thereafter killing each and every one his favorite way: flaying. Sharpe is hot, more or less, on his trail after he kills first Ensign Expendable and then their current and well-liked Colonel Windham. The prisoner has taken refuge somewhere in Salamanca, which is mostly in British hands now. There he meets Jack Spears, one of Major Hogan's \\"exploring officers\\", a jocular, inveterate gambler . Spears befriends him, introduces him to la Marquesa, who invites him up to her chambers and her bed. No one much sees our dear Richard for a few days after that.When our Married Man emerges from la Marquesa's bower, he has one more reason to kill Leroux. Besides the list of names, the fact that he killed the ensign and colonel and that he has the waycoolest sword ever and Sharpe wants it, Helena has told him the evil man plans to kill her. Bingo. Unfortunately when Sharpe tracks him down, the man manages to break Sharpe's own sword and stab him in the gut. He almost dies. In fact, Harper digs up the graves of all the dead soldiers from the battle, French, British, all of them, and does not find his body. That leads him and Hogan to look in the Death Room, where a quite historical alcoholic Irish sergeant is tending him. Though Sharpe is almost dead, they manage to revive him. All left to Our Hero is to rest and recover at the Marquesa's, where he learns the truth about her but finds it rather ameliorated by the fact that she has fallen in love with him. Oh, and there were some battles.If you saw the BBC television movie, it bears little or no resemblance to the novel. The novel is, as with all of them, better than the movie. You get Sharpe at his most susceptible to blondes who welcome him to their beds, hey wait.. I used to be a blonde! Hmmm. You get the reverses, the revelation of an ally or two, the faithful Harper, the precise battle scenes, and more insight into the Peninsular Wars.My husband Jim read the novel to me. We are already on to the next one, Sharpe's Enemy, complete with the odious Obadiah Hakeswell.From That's All She Read, by Nan Hawthorne, [...]"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"One of the great pleasures of the Rifleman Sharpe series, at least for me, is the attention the author gives to explaining -- always in context, never lecturing -- exactly what was going on in the Napoleonic world and what the relevant military strategies and tactics were, and why. This installment end with such a lesson. It was settled wisdom that cavalry could not defeat infantry formed in a square. A square could be broken by artillery (obviously) or by other infantry units, but not by a bunch of big guys on horseback, and Cornwell showed us exactly why that was the case in _Sharpe's Battle_ (written later but chronologically earlier). But war, like life generally, is full of surprises and his careful depiction of the German Legion's \\"impossible\\" victory at Garcia Hernandez is not only jaw-dropping but absolutely factual. The main plot this time, however, is less about the battlefield and more about the quiet little espionage war that went on behind the scenes between the agents of both sides. Here the conflict is set in Salamanca and, again, it's true to history. Sharpe, married or not, has one of his periodic love affairs and gets caught up in that quiet but very dirty war -- and nearly dies as a result. The Sharpe novels are frequently driven at least partly by revenge and this one is no exception. Pretty good, though. By the way, because Cornwell is so careful with his history and his descriptions, it's fun to go to Google Earth after finishing one of his books and examining what the towns and battle sites are like today."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"Cornwell really hit his stride with Sharpe's Sword. It has everything that has earned Cornwell his reputation as perhaps the top historical fiction writer today: a gripping plot, snappy dialogue, great characters, and, of course, a village that becomes \\"a killing ground ... spawned in a dark night of thunder, betrayal, and love.\\" (Sigh.) In this novel, Sharpe is caught in a web of intrigue. His mission is to find and capture Leroux, a sadistic French officer whose knowledge of the names of British spies puts Wellington's campaign against Napoleon in jeopardy. Sharpe's obsession with a stunningly beautiful Marquesa adds extra spice to this novel, as does the mystery of the true identity of \\"El Mirador,\\" Britain's top spy. High adventure, murder, obsession, betrayal ... it doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Sword (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #14)","review":"As much as I praised the television version of Sharpe's Sword, the 1983 novel from Bernard Cornwell hails an honest, superior story full of espionage and adultery.The television producers backed themselves into a corner when they filmed Sharpe's Honour before Sword. The written Sword comes before the written Honour, so the premature introduction of La Marquesa necessitated the role of the mute Lass. It's a charming role onscreen, but naturally one with little weight beyond bedding Sharpe. In the Sword novel, however, we are treated to the true and intriguing build up of La Marquesa. Her affair with Sharpe amid the cat and mouse games of Salamanca is full of twists and turns that are both weighed heavily and yet dismissed by the married Sharpe.Sharpe's recuperation in the Sword novel is also longer than the understandably contrived film. More dedication is given to Harper's care of Sharpe, and Patrick's woman in the novels-named Isabella not Ramona as in the TV series-gives as much love and care to Richard. It's a fascinating read to see Sharpe so tricked, deceived, and yes played by superior officers, the French, and La Marquesa. The Sword movie may have its ups and downs, but Sharpe always comes out on top. In the novel, the heroic end is not a foregone conclusion.Sharpe's Sword is a decent film full of adoration, fun, and action, but the novel gives much more depth to Salamanca, La Marquesa, and Richard Sharpe.I've noticed Cornwell's novels and their Hornblower precursors are often placed in a \`Men's novels' or \`action and adventure' section of stores and libraries. Fans of military fiction no doubt would love Sharpe's Sword- Cornwell's attention to detail and research for the Salamanca campaign is extensive. Of course, many ladies tune into the series for Sean Bean or have no interest in the written books. That's fine, but even if you read only the Sharpe novels that have been turned into films, the maturity and experience is so abundantly superior. I love the show, I really do. In fact, I appreciate it more now that I've read the excellent source material.

And they're losing. Marshal Marmont, commander of just one of five huge armies Napoleon has put in Spain, is pushing Wellington back. The English take Salamanca, but only because Marmont pulls out tactically, seeking a better place for the battle he knows will destroy the English. Marmont threatens to retake the city, but the major battle never materializes. Wellington chases him east, but then his army must retreat to avoid being cut off from its Portuguese redoubt by the French.Sharpe fights both the large war and a smaller, more private one. French assassin Colonel Leroux kills ruthlessly, hideously and often as he tries to break up an English spy ring and save his own hide. Caught by the British but escaping, he kills Sharpe's commanding and junior officers. Sharpe vows to catch him. Sharpe's pal, the intelligence chief Major Hogan, and Wellington both need him caught. Meanwhile they worry about intelligence leaks; the French have a spy too close to the high command.Sharpe and every other British officer swoons when meeting the dazzling Marquesa who dominates Salamanca society, and we all know which officer the Marquesa will take a shine to, despite his poverty and lack of polish.

From his humble upbringing he became a pioneer in auto racing and design, an American war hero and \\"ace of aces\\" in World War I, the driving force behind the most profitable airline in the US, and a very influential civilian consultant for the military. Along the way he also displayed an incredible penchant for surviving near-death experiences including car crashes, plane crashes, botched surgeries, and 24 days adrift at sea in a raft in the Pacific Ocean. For all his accomplishments, it is interesting to compare Captain Eddie's place in posterity with Charles Lindbergh, who is remembered far better for a single achievement.Author David Lewis's 15 years of research resulted in a very comprehensive and definitive biography of his subject. The clear organization and writing style make this book easier to digest than it's length may indicate. As the authoritative biography, there are times when the book gets into too much detail but these do not take much away from the quality of the book."},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"W. David Lewis' biography of Eddie Rickenbacker is a major contribution to the literature of flight. Well-known as a author of exceptionally fine histories, and a founder of the field of professional aviation history, Lewis has exceeded even his own remarkable record with this work. EDDIE RICKENBACKER: AN AMERICAN HERO IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY delves deeply into the history of this remarkable adventurer and businessman to tell us much of the development of military aviation, the commercial aviation and airline industry, and, finally, the role of the hero as exemplar of both a way of life and a pattern for others to follow--or not. Lewis has gone far beyond the usual sources one would expect to find in a biography of a fighter ace who was himself a prolific author, delving deeply into corporate, political, and governmental records, tracing the social, economic, and political history of the time and how Rickenbacker evolved from a mechanically inclined youngster to an aggressive and accomplished racing driver, to a fearsomely effective fighter pilot, and on to being a major personality in aviation and airline development from the era of the open cockpit biplane to the era of the jet. Unreservedly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"W. David Lewis has written a majestic biography of one of America's great personages of the twentieth century. Eddie Rickenbacker was a race car driver, fighter pilot, businessman and airline industry giant. He was also a survivor and a true fighter- often taking unpopular positions- particularly his controversial comments upon the passing of FDR- essentially saying that FDR got what he deserved. Lewis also finds Rickenbacker in the beginning of the early modern conservative movement during the beginnings of Barry Goldwaters rocket to prominence. Rickenbacker was xenophobic and found the welfare state to be a deeply anathema to the human spirit of self improvement and hard work.This work is so in-depth no brief Amazon review can give it justice. Whether you're interested in riveting war stories, early automobile racing, politics or the growth of the American airline industry this is a book that I highly recommend. The story of how an poor kid from immigrant family can rise to the pinnacle of American society is truly an interesting story. For author Lewis this book isn't mere hero worship it is an attempt to give Rickenbacker his due as events from the early twentieth century fader further and further out of our historical memory."},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"This is outstanding book is about one of the 20th century's most remarkable Americans.

This book will appeal to a wide readership, those who enjoy great biography, those interested in 20th century history. those curious about how America has changed, and those who wonder how the amazing world of modern air travel came about. It is the ideal gift for readers of all generations. It is based on meticulous research over more than fifteen years but is fresh, exciting and a pleasure to read. One cannot avoid seeing parallels with the effects of today's technology upon every phase of life.The story of Eddie Rickenbacker deserves to be told and shared.

Davie Lewis's book. I was also priviledged to hear Dr. Lewis speak on his book prior to reading it. I found many things in the book that I already knew and somethings that I was unaware of. I thought when I first started reading it would be a book to pick up and read occassionally, but after the first chapter I was hooked and finished all 551 pages in record time. I would recommend Dr. Lewis' book to other Eastern employees who knew Eddie when we worked for him or just form a history point of view."},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"I urge people to discover the incredible life of Eddie Rickenbacker. I previously knew he was a famous fighter pilot from WWI, but I did not realize just how amazing his life was in so many aspects. A pioneer in the automotive field (including being one of the greatest early auto racers and owning the Indy 500 speedway), a pioneer in commercial aviation (heading Eastern Airlines for several decades), but above all one of the great patriots in US history. Hi WWI exploits are well known (including winning the Medal of Honor), but what he did in WWII is, if anything, even more astonishing--serving tirelessly as a special envoy, and most incredibly, surviving a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean along with 21 days on a raft. He was 50+ years of age at the time of the raft incident AND it was shorlty after he spent four months in the hospital after surviving a plane crash! He came to have strong religious faith--and it is easy to understand why; in one memorable phrase, he said that no one had ever cheated the grim reaper more than he had during his life (and I found no reason to argue with this conclusion). I believe that he was the living embodiment of a most powerful message, i.e., DO NOT GIVE UP--EVER! Just an amazing man! The book reveals that he had a rough temper, sometimes drank too much, and often said inappropriately harsh things at the wrong times--but I came away with nearly UNBOUNDED regard for this man despite his flaws. In short, I believe that Eddie Rickenbacker is completely undervalued by history--and he is long overdue for a resurgence of interest."},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"\\"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century\\" is a comprehensive autobiographical study. The man and his life are fairly presented, and the book is written in Dr. Lewis' impeccable and very readable narrative style.Undoubtedly this is and, I am confident, will remain the definitive study of Eddie Rickenbacker, not only for the author's depth of research, but because, as one reviewer wrote, \\"Dr. Lewis has painted a balanced, complete picture of an extremely complex man.\\"In my opinion the book is also very timely in another respect. In addition to historians of aviation and technology, it is also of value to political scientists/historians. Very conservative politically, Rickenbacker is seen as the harbinger of the conservative movement - well before Barry Goldwater and the 1964 presidential contest."},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"EDDIE RICKENBACKER: AN AMERICAN HERO IN THE 20TH CENTURY outlines the life and many achievements of a pilot who flew in both war and peace, defying death many times to drive cars in the heyday of the first autos, then planes during the first world war. He returned from war a hero and was decorated for his achievements, but failed as an auto maker after the war and returned to the aviation world in 1934, working for Eastern Airlines until World War II's start brought him new missions. His journey from war hero to peacetime conflicts within the new competitive airline industry makes for an avid story not just of Rickenbacker and his world, but of an evolving transportation industry.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"Don't get me wrong, because this is a fine book, but I just don't get why we Americans are so excited about Eddie Rickenbacker. Compared to WWI fighter pilots from other countries, he was simply nothing to write home about. Consider the words of historian Dan McCaffery: \\"By the [First World] war's end, Canada, with a population of only eight million people, had produced four super aces with fifty or more kills each. Germany, by contrast, had three and France and England just two each. The United States had none at all, and the leading American flyer, the much-celebrated Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, wouldn't have made the top ten on the Canadian list.\\" If you think Rickenbacker was still the \\"Ace of aces,\\" then I suggest you read about Captain Fred McCall, a Canadian in the RFC who, with 37 confirmed kills, was far more successful than Rickenbacker, in Shirlee Smith Matheson's superb bookMaverick in the Sky: The Aerial Adventures of World War I Flying Ace Freddie McCall. After you read her book, and put aside our American nationalism, you'll realize that our Rickenbacker was not a big deal in the great scheme of things."},{"Title":"Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century","review":"I don't mean any disrespect to the author or to Eddie Rickenbacker, but this book is much to long and so overloaded with details that it becomes a very dry read very quickly. Not to downplay Rickenbacker's role as a WWI ace, but spending 50 pages on dogfights wasn't very interesting to me. There is no doubt these were exciting and dangerous times, but as a reader it offered very little excitement to me. If you are looking for the details of Rickenbacker's life, you have found the right book. The reason I bought this book is because I saw his name in many other books on Billy Mitchell, Pershing, and F.D.R. and I wanted to learn more about him. I definitely learned alot reading this book. But I was also interested in Eddie becoming an apologist for conservatism. Unfortunately, the author picked out a catch phrase out of speeches and statements Eddie made; that I never really got to read his entire thought process on conservatism. This is a thorough book but also flawed in my opinion."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"I disagree that a person could become a &quot;master&quot; data modeler if the contents of this book are the complete set of skills in their arsenal. While the book outlines some good techniques for interviewing end users and basic data modeling skills, there is alot more involved in data modeling than what is covered here.As an experienced data modeler who works with large, complex data models in a constantly changing business, I find I do not refer to this book at all. The book excludes common data modeling constructs that I have found very useful, including subtypes and supertypes. The book does not explain the difference between conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling. (It covers techniques used to capture conceptual/logical level data, but nowhere does it explain that or the difference between this type of model and a physical model, and why and when you'd need one or the other.)The book does not cover normalization, which, once one leaves the interview with end users, one will need to understand. The book does not mention data integration with other systems or databases, how this topic is important and could (and often should) arise in interviews with end users.Some of the topics covered I found shallow and incomplete, for example, how to name things in a data model. The authors take a parochial view by ignoring real world issues such as using consistent names across database and organizations, and avoiding naming things for what they are used for, not what they are.As a practicing data modeler, I find my users aren't as naieve about data models as Carlis and Maguire assume them to be. I often am asked why I am modeling data in a given way. In my view, this book does not address the &quot;why&quot; - why do you model the data in the way suggested, and what happens if you don't. When I can answer these questions well for my customers, I earn approval, and this book doesn't equip one to do so.In sum, my belief is that this book contains about 1/4 of the information a person needs to know to become a &quot;master&quot; data modeler. It's a good starter book if you are a novice data modeler or are having trouble gathering information from business subject matter experts, but if you really want to become an expert data modeler, I'd recommend continuing beyong this book. I prefer 'Data Modeling Essentials 2nd Edition' by Graeme Simsion"},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"The book describes a method to structure any given sets of data according to generic rules. Eventhough my background does not allow me to judge the theoretical validity of the method, the book is easy to read and all the concepts are easy to understand and described in details. I have applied the Carlis and Maguire method for modeling data in a small research group and it is brilliant. The method allows users to discuss their data in their own language and the modeler can build a logical representation which is understood and well accepted by the users. I will certainly use this book and the method for any future database design."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"The secret is out!I've been using the techniques described in this book for years because one of the authors taught me. I've used them to model data about research science, business, and topology. Now others can learn it too.Carlis cured me of normalization. There's a difference between normalization and &quot;normal forms&quot;. A goal of modeling is to produce databases in high normal forms - Boyce-Codd Normal Form, fifth normal form, etc... Most modelers think the only way to do this is through normalization, a specific process that step-by-step improves to a draft model. This book shows how to avoid that process completely. I used to do normalization. Now I use the conversational techniques of this book to reach high normal forms sooner. One thing I always hated about Normalization was that I usually did it after talking to users, which means I was making decisions that the users should have been making. I have not performed normalization in at least ten years. Yet I still produce databases in high normal form. This book does include a chapter about normalization, with normal forms up to fifth, so you can see for yourself how the technique produces high-normal-form databases. If you learned that normalization was essential part of data modeling, this chapter will help you learn this different way of working. If you are new to data modeling, you should start with this book to avoid learning normalization altogether. The principles of high normal forms are important, but the process of normalization is ludicrous.This is a book about data modeling, not physical database design. It concentrates on the modeling in users' language. The naming conventions it recommends are based on guidelines of language and categories. If you follow these naming guidelines, you will not need to learn a huge list of more specific, special-case naming rules.I also like what Carlis and MaGuire say about constraints. By following their constraint advice, I have become a much faster data modeler, and my team mates (programmers, DBAs) do not have to wait so long for me to finish my work. It also helps me keep my data models flexible, good for a changing business environment.This book has more examples than any book on modeling I have ever seen. I stopped counting sample data models when I got to 300.The hardest part of application design is understanding the user's data. This book concentrates on solving that problem, leaving the technical details of database design to other books."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"This book will be on my table always. It cuts through the computer science's obsession for esoteric notations and undue rigor (that scares the end users even before the analyst has had a chance to begin!) and puts the user needs at their right place: right in the center. I have used this methed several times now with exciting results. Users are more forthcoming, there are lesser I-thought-this-when-you-said-that instances. Two thumbs up for the excellent work!!!"},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"Messrs. Carlis and Maguire take the long overdue postition that data models should be tools for communicating an analyst's understanding of a business with the people in that business BEFORE communicating with technical designers. This means that models should not be overly complex, should be described in plain language, and should be organized for presentation. Their notation is a simplified version of information engineering that removes pieces that are confusing and actually of no consequence. It is a refreshing change from the likes of the UML and IDEF1x."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"I just finished a semester-long graduate course that used this book as one of three textbooks. I am an experienced, mid-career data modeler and developer of database-centered applications and I have used entity-relationship diagrams for years, so I was initially a little concerned that this text would not have much new for me. I was also suspicious of the author's notation because it leaves out a number of syntactical elements I was accustomed to using in UML and other data modeling languages. However, I was very pleased and surprised with the amount of valuable and original content in this book, and I have significantly altered my modeling practices as a result.This book is written in a quirky but very readable style, and I recommend it for both experienced data modelers who want to improve the quality and efficiency of their work, and for anyone who wants to start learning about data modeling.Beginning data modelers will especially benefit from1) the emphasis on logical data modeling and user communication,2) the explanation of how to choose good names and identifiers, and3) the examination of common patterns that appear in almost every data model, how to recognize them, and how to interpret them.Experienced data modelers who have already grappled with those issues on past projects will gain further insight from the authors' coherent systemization of those topics, but should also appreciate and benefit from1) the content-neutral process laid out for iteratively evolving a diagram through controlled interactions with users,2) the investigation of the underlying principles and forces that shape a data model, with many illustrating examples drawn from real-world projects, and3) the intellectually rigorous analysis of the notation and syntax used to represent a data model, and the semantic interpretation of each structure.If I had to identify one set of people who would get the most out of this book, I would select software developers who learned data modeling on the job, or who are starting to learn it, and who would like a cohesive intellectual foundation for what they are doing. This book can help you go from being a \\"pretty good\\" data modeler who can handle modeling familiar data to being an expert data modeler with a strong theoretical basis for your work who can quickly develop high-quality data models regardless of your personal level of understanding of the underlying subject area."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"The book itself is not as easy to follow as others I have read. This book is aimed more for someone with a bit of previous knowledge of data modeling. The approaches in data modeling is similar to other computer technology, it outdates relatively quickly. Time has changed the way we operate in all fields of technology and data modeling is no exception"},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"This book was required reading for a class, or I would not have purchased it.The content itself was OK, but it spent too much time going into detail on areas that were obvious, and then introduced new topics with a casual comment and then never explained those any further.On a more practical note, the book was bound on the wrong side, with the cover upside down. You had to hold the book upside down, and then read from the back to the front. I would have had it replaced, however being required for a class I did not have the time to exchange it. On one occasion I actually had a teacher for small children comment on my holding the book upside down. On other occsions small children looked at me very strangely when I was reading."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"This book describes how to perform data modeling. It will help you a lot if you are working as a system analyst. It tells you how to get information from the users. Also it discusses the data modeling in deep and teaches you how to identify common mistakes very early.Though the good is very good for modeling, $35 is somehow high for this book.Another point is that is uses a diagram called LDS. This type of diagram is not well known. You'll suffer to find tools that draw this kind of diagrams and to find other professionals who use it."},{"Title":"Mastering Data Modeling: A User-Driven Approach","review":"I am lucky to have had the opportunity to be a student of John Carlis, so the readability and quality of this book was no surprise. Anyone who has even discussed computer science with him would assure you that his focus is not simply on amassing tools, but on mastering them. This book was loaned to me on the job, and served as an excellent introduction, and as a wonderful reference.The simplicity and power of LDS makes it an excellent tool for software developers. In a discussion with Carlis, he explained to me the appeal that LDS had to him. He said its simple, limited set of components allows you to use data modeling not as a reference to understand software, but as a way to plan it, and think about the consequences of each decision you make.Buy this because it's a great read, a great introduction, and an invaluable reference. No software developer's desk should be without it."},{"Title":"Silk and The Ragpicker's Grandson (Short Works Series)","review":"This small but powerful book of poems constructs the poet's genealogy out of parts of his and his wife's ancestry. Drawing first on an ancestor of his wife who had been a silk merchant in China in the nineteenth century, Bert Stern writes from the merchant's perspective in an epistolary manner that captures both the exotic aspects of a place strange to him at first and his down-to-earth clarity. The second sequence of poems also borrows voices from the past, this time from the author's Jewish past in Moldavia. This is a story of emigration from the terrors of the pogrom and immigration through Ellis Island to America. Between the two parts, we are given an almost mythic conjunction of two prominent &quot;Americas.&quot; The author's ability to inhabit the minds of these pasts is a gift not often found among poets, and the poems are lit with a gentleness his characters must have passed on but did not often know. The third section, made up of two poems in Stern's own voice, are perhaps a culmination of these histories. Certainly they contain some of the best poetry in this book and more than suggest a powerful future for this generous-hearted poet."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Medical Folklore","review":"First published in 1979, Carol Ann Rinzler's &quot;Dictionary of Medical Folklore&quot; provides a nearly complete collection of our medical myths, beliefs, and delusions, from acne to zinc oxide.

For instance, most people have read a mystery in which a corpse's nails keep growing after death; according to Rinzler, that's absolutely false: the cuticles shrink, making the nails merely look longer. I was also pleased to learn that chocolate does not cause acne, which would have made my adolescence a little less argumentative.

While his work may be admittedly misogynistic, Beck's accurate portrayals of his fellow criminals, drug addicts, and conniving prostitutes is sure to entertain.

There is a real pathological hatred of women that plays out in Slim's foul treatment of his prostitutes. Homo-eroticism abounds in Slim's relationships with other, especially more senior pimps. Slim rots in confinement for some time, and guess what, he doesn't enjoy it. This story is good antidote to the pervasive and unambiguous sexuality that gets portrayed on the rap videos (at least, it was when I last watched one in the mid 90's), which ignore the truly aberrent aspects to the lifestyle that gets shamelessly glorified."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Instead of going into a long critique of the book.

Immortilized in current rap songs and popular clothing, the hip hop nation is clueless to where this name &quot;Iceberg&quot; originated. Robert Beck was the prototype midwestern &quot;super pimp&quot; in the 40's and 50's who's gorilla tatics along with no nonsense pimping is legendary. His uncanny ability to transform his true life experience into a well balanced memoir is worthy of five stars. His storytelling is well detailed and we grow to know and understand the main character. Maybe not understand, but given a better idea of what occurs in the life of a pimp. Who, by the way is mostly portrayed as a despicable, vicous character. Pimp shows the underside of the pimp and depicts a confused individual who is usually suffering from huge internal demons.

Clearly, the reader has to step back and relaize that reading a life-story about a pimp is not the same as supporting prostitution..."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Pimp by Iceberg Slim is a savagely honest autobiographical story by a man who was fully immersed in the cut-throat world of pimping. Iceberg lays bare the disgusting world of prostitution in all its ugliness and allure in his own words. He begins the story of his life in the 1920's when America was radically different from now. It was a time when the race divisions cut deep into the social flesh of this country. Iceberg grows up fast to the realities of racism, destitution, drug abuse, and crime. By his late teens, Iceberg is out on the streets turning out young girls into prostitutes.This book is dripping with the sleaziness of the streets. It's a deeply psychological and graphic account of how the pimping game works behind the scenes. You can feel his mind at work, scheming on how to get the most money, how to break the most hoes, and keep it all together in his head. His words cut the reader's brain like a switchblade that had been used to chop a line of cocaine. Iceberg doesn't tell his story asking for forgiveness. It's not a plea for help. He tells it because he lived it, and it's a story that should not fall into obscurity. Pimp isn't just his story; it's a part of American history that will always be shamefully brushed under the rug.Pimp is the book on American pimping. This book is perfect for anyone who enjoys biographies, crime literature, noir, minority literature, and radical American history. While this book gets plenty of readerships in select circles, Iceberg slim is a bit of an underground writer. He is an amazing writer who creates fire out of printed words. Still, because of his back ground, style, and subject matter, the literary world has denied him access into its pristine halls. It's alright, this book, like its writer, is rough enough to survive outside in the cold streets."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"You can buy that your eyes closed, you wont regret it.The voice is good, the &#34;well-known&#34; story take an another dimension when carry hite narrate it..."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"my pal antar forced me to read that iceberg slim book and i'll tell you it was pretty educational. it was like art of war of pimping. some of the techniques are outdated but the principles are still invaluable."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This book gives an amazingly accurate view of a true pimp's life.

From multitudes of 18 year old white boy \\"pimps\\" on Myspace, to several HBO documentaries about pimps, to grown white men saying things like \\"keep your pimp hand strong\\" and dressing up as parody pimps trying to be funny (this has to be the most tired joke on the planet at this point) to Uncle Toms like Snoop Dogg and 50 Cent doing their modern day minstrel show on Mtv, to those who have \\"game\\", the con artists, deceivers, and criminals being the heroes to a good portion of the black community. Those enlightened social engineers and producers of our pop culture sure do enrich our society don't they!?!?I also notice there are multiple books about pimps and \\"how to be a pimp\\" type books on Amazon which at casual look seem so ridiculous that they almost seem to be comedic parodies reminding me of those books written for losers that tell you how to bed beautiful women. If you want a good laugh just read some of the Amazon reviews of the pimp books.Excluding Magic Don Juans book which is somewhat entertaining Iceberg Slims book is probably the only one worth reading and is head and shoulders above any other books by or about pimps. He doesn't try to glorify himself or being a pimp and while he does give glimpses in the life of being a pimp, drug addict, criminal and eventual prison inmate this book is just as much a self analysis for him as a look into that lifestyle. He states most of the stuff that he experienced and did matter of factly but you get a feeling that writing this book served as therapeutic introspective for Robert \\"Iceberg Slim\\" Beck. He does a good job of showing what a scumbag he was but he doesn't get preachy or come off as an attention seeker. Its like he took a step back and made an appraisal of what he once was and put it down on paper. He does a good job of painting a picture of the times in which all this occured and situations he was in. I have to be fair and give the guy credit he really was a good writer."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This is a classic in the same way Mobe Dick or Siddhartha is. I mean Slim accepted his hand in life without complaint, and masterfully played the cards in it -- which is saying a lot given the times of his Pimpdom.No,I'm not glamozing his life-style (as much of the content is highly disturbing), but merely pointing out the context of the times and how they might have impacted (if not criminalized) what appears to be an otherwise brilliant businessman. Instead of apologizing for his position in society, he presents a compelling and comprehensive perspective on many of the psycho-social and historical factors that lead him -- and doubtlessly many other African Ameericans -- down this dismal path. At the same time, Slim demonstrates an impressive command of the English language, intellectual prowress, philisophical breadth and tenacity. This story made me wonder how much African genuius was denied opportunity by the inherent cruelty of Jim Crow.An African American Psychologist"},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This book is like nothing I've read.

Then a friend mentioned he had the book and offered it to me to borrow. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down.Iceberg Slim's description of the gritty street life pre- and post-World War II brought me to an almost unimaginable world. A world that's a far cry from the MTV-style, pseudo-pimp posturing portrayed in today's mainstream media. It was a world of hard drugs and hard living where Darwin's survival of the fittest (and baddest) reigned. Slim tells it like it is; there's absolutely no political correctness. Then again, his environment was not one which could support any false pretenses like suburban PC life does these days.Some may say, 'but isn't he promoting this type of behavior?' Quite on the contrary: it's every man for himself in Slim's world; he has his highs and lows, both literally and figuratively. The mere fact that he survived to tell the tale, (unlike many others in &quot;the game&quot; who went early to their graves), and went from abusing and exploiting women to wedded life and fatherhood is testament enough to NOT follow his lead. Those who aspire to be where he is now know that the road he chose is not one dotted with success stories: the fleeting glamour and glory of the pimp lifestyle leads not to greater things, but often to nothing. Slim, although an exception, makes this abundantly clear without stooping to the level of an apologist."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Mr. Beck showed us in his book exactly how his terrible transformed him into the greatest pimp of all time.

Pimp's best feature is how Beck ingeniously interlocks social commentary into vivid storytelling. The main character, Iceberg Slim, is unapologetic when he recounts his brutality towards women and his rampant drug use. Beck's gritty portrayal of both evokes admiration and disgust of Iceberg's ability to retain and recruit prostitutes. The adventures of Iceberg Slim provides thought provoking theories about the psyche of women; do they really like to be treated like trash? He certainly thinks so, and makes a convincing arguement to back his thesis. There are some sentences in this book that makes the reader want to say aloud; THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE, WHY DIDN'T I THiNK OF THAT. By the end of the book readers respect and admire Iceberg Slim for not only how he built his pimp empire, but also how his views on relationships and race relations propelled him into his position of power.

One of the most visceral pieces of literature that I have ever read, at times you are subjected to such scenes of brutality and cynicism that you can barely believe that it is non-fiction.

Full stop. Why?Ooozing with atmoshpere, it's cleverley written, ultra exciting and very sad at the same time, deep, it bares the soul of the author as you journey through the Chicago streets, bars, the prisons, the penthouses with him. There's a glossary at the back, because he uses street slang from the 1930s Chicago scene as he would speak. Which adds to the rich atmosphere immensley, but takes some getting used to. This is a book that can be enjoyed at a plethora of emotional and intellectual levels.The skill with which this book is written is matched by it's contents. A monumental classic that contains such a range of depth and content it is bound to appeal enormously to anyone except a conservative, easily shocked reader. Over the years I have read this book countless times since I discovered it. I'm on my 3rd copy because I wear it out!This book contains truth and fiction: Beck had to make an exciting book. He drew on his experiences and wisley made things dramatically bold.I agree with the other reviewer, Paradise's Space Age Pimping book is also hot. But Iceberg is in a league of his own.

Iceberg Slim's 'Pimp', has been an inspiration to young, poor people the world over. It tells the story of one man's obsession with the pimp game, and how such a life can be at once as rewarding as it is darkly terrible and destructive. Iceberg's characteristic writing style puts the reader on the street so that he can feel, hear and smell the corruption and violence. It shows the stark, unromanticised reality of street life and how, if you've got the strength, you can pull yourself out of it. This is a truly rivetting read."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"I read this once for a book club but I had to go back and revisit. The language is very engaging. the words and slang used during the time period are interesting enough, but to think of this whole book written from a street perspective, one of the pimp, a story very seldom told outside of blaxploitation flixs of the 60s and 70s. Iceberg's story is very important, i consider it to be as much a part of black culture as any of our other struggles. whats draws me to this is that I know it is real. i know that it has happened, the psychology behind what makes women turn to this lifestyle is what attracts me, especially when you compare that to our modern day gold diggers- you may not seem so eager to cast stones at these outcasts described by 'Berg. As i said before, there is alot of game in this book, quotables such as 'pimp em for long scratch quick' and 'cop and blow is that name of the game' it may seem cool to pimp but once you finish the book you realize that it really is tragic. please read!!!"},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"I had heard about this book for years but had never read it, so I grabbed it when I saw it at the library.

It is interesting, also, to imagine that all this was taking place in the 1940s and 1950s!The literary style was interesting as well. The author seemed to be much more interested in inserting a lot of slang than on the actual writing. For the first half of the book nearly ever sentence began with \\"I\\" or \\"She\\" or \\"He\\" - almost like it was written by a child; but as the book progressed the sentence structure began to vary a bit so it appeared that the author actually was learning to write as he wrote this book.The adventures and incidents in the book were fascinating, shocking, horrifying and even sometimes hilarious.

It is very admirable that he reveals the true character of his heart in this book and I therefore will not criticize him in that respect.

Though it is a fictitious piece of work, Iceberg Slim gives us a vivid picture of ghetto life as seen through the eyes of a true to life pimp. We must understand that the ills of society such as racism and unemployment forced many blacks into this lifestyle during that era.

The subtle and not-so subtle (to me anyway) psychology between the pimp and his whores and between pimps was exposed marvellously. His life of con artistry, dope shooting (he was most \\"Icey\\" when banging coke), pimping high-life, doing time and living large was quite amazing. He was blessed with an extraordinarily high IQ, and is a powerful writer, even in the colloquialisms of his day (fortunately, the editor highlighted the slang so dumb white folks like me could look up the words in the index). My alltime favorite passage was his buddy \\"Party Time\\" recounting how it was necessary to drive his \\"number one whore\\" insane afgter a while. The \\"number one whore\\" was the whore in a stable who would recruit, organize and sexually abuse the lower level whores. Apparently they would gradually, after a few years of service, learn to passionately hate the pimp, and plot to ruin his life and career. This is apparently an inevitable occurrence when a number one whore felt her charms fading. To avoid this occupational hazard, a pimp must get rid of her somehow, when she has outlived her usefulness. Murder, fear, abandonment (iceberg's preferred, and rather ineffective method), palming them off on pimps you don't like were all used. \\"Party Time\\" had his own unique \\"drive them nuts\\" solution. He would get them addicted to junk. Occasionally slip them a knock out drop into their injection, and have them wake up in a bunch of pigs blood. His (and my) favorite example was hanging an unconcious whore out the window by her feet, then rudely waking her up with a cocaine shot. She apparently screamed until the men in white came to take her away. Perhaps I am a bad person for finding this outrageously funny, as we're apparently talking about real people, but, well, color me bad. It amazes me that this wonderful cultural object survived because of a literate, intelligent man who lived the life."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"the book comes in as described, and it came on time. it was good purches"},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"the book &quot;Pimp&quot; has truely changed my life as well as the life of friend of mine.

Eyes were aching by the time I finished. To be sure, some of the material here is hard to take, but Slim had such a raw way of telling his tale and it makes so many other so-called writers (the slick, smooth darlings of the East Coast publishing houses) tame by comparison--and all by a guy who was self-taught and \\"educated\\" by the streets.

Iceberg Slim is a good writer and really get's you immersed. This is alternately described as fiction and non-fiction. After reading it, I can see why. I'm sure it is the author's real story of his life, and a view into his world. On the other hand, as a pimp, he has a pension for exaggeration. In some passages, you start to question if what he's saying is really possible. I think that's the reason the book contains the little disclaimer about it being a work of fiction. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of pimps and prostitutes and surprisingly informative. The slang is from the 20's and 30's and kind of hard to understand sometimes, but the book includes a handy glossary. Pimp is both a page turner, and a significant work. I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This man is a genius. He depicts the minority state of mind that the caucasion members of this society has placed them in. Prostitution is an age old profession. The art and skill to control and munipulate people into submitting themselves for financial gains, by iceburg, needs to be applauded. In our day we do not call it pimpology, but corporate politics. There is no difference other than one is considered legal exploitation of people, and the other is morally unacceptable. Furthermore, I admire the ability to gain this knowledge of munipulating people, by life's experiences, without being on a corporations payroll, most interesting. I do not agree with the methods used, however, I respect the knowledge and wisdom that this man has. If you think about it, Iceburg is actuallly giving us an insight of real life American living of the impoverished minority. The prostitutes he is able to munipulate might be someone in your family? Think about it, and learn!"},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Robert Beck is an open author that wrote exactly what was on his mind. He tells his story of how he became the greatest pimp ever with the help of Sweats. And if you are wondering who Sweats is then you need to order the book now and brush up on yo pimping skills. Pimping ain't dead, it just has been taken to a new level that's all."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"i had heard so much about this book i decided to finally read it. it is a must read. at 1st i was confused about some of the words used then i realized there was a 'slang' dictionary in the back."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Reading some of the other reviews, you would think that this book is some sort of pimping manual. While Slim does go into the specifics of how he was pimping, this is done to show what distasteful work it was and why he left that life. That being said, this is one of the best books I have ever read. It is fast paced and the way Iceberg writes, you almost feel as if you are there, with him on the corner, in the bar. I finished this in 2 days, and I'm a pretty slow reader, so that should tell you something."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"not for the faint of heart.very real and solid in it's delievery.it's a must read and is very captivating."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"I think this book was one of the best books i read in mylifetime . it covered all angles of the pimp game, from the drivingaround in a caddie to having one hoe in ya stable who to lazy to get out and &quot;hump up some scratch&quot; . To the wrong individual this might seem like no more than a book that teaches you how to pimp, but its really a good book. Robert Beck is a great author he touches all angles and paints a vivid picture of this lifestyle. He makes you feel like your watching a movie.

I think the publisher made one mistake by putting the glossary at the end of the book, wherein it should have been at the very beginning. It wasn't until I got into the flow of the story did I truly understand the meaning to the lingo inside the pages.Iceberg was born during the roaring 20s--a time when speakeasies were all the rave. I loved the dialogue of this era in the African-American communities. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe it was a good idea to put the glossary at the end, because I enjoyed figuring out what he was talking about.Make no mistake, Ice didn't sugarcoat one damn thing in this beautifully told memoir. And I loved the fact that he turned his life completely around. It took several times in prison for him to finally figure out he was truly tired of the game.At the end of the book, he talks about finally joining the squares in a real job. And what better job for him to have than being a salesman. After all, who best understands how to sell than a pimp? I really enjoyed reading his life story. I continually passed this book up, and something said just go ahead and read the damn thing, and I'm really glad I did. I learned a great deal of the underworld of pimping. Thankful to God I've never had to venture into that world, but I feel more enriched for having read it. Iceberg is a pretty damn good writer too.

This book spends a lot of time in the muck and filth of the street.

This is another one of those reads that should be for adults only.It was a very insightful read. But it just wasn't something I would read again. I'm just not feeling the story.

I forget how. I read some of the reviews of this book and researched Iceberg Slim and decided this is a book I had to read. I am glad I did.I like works of history. Iceberg's pimping career starts pre-WWII and ends just at the end of the 1950s. To read about how the Underground life was at that time by someone who lived it and strived to succeed in it is brilliant.Iceberg Slim's writing style and use of slang adds to the dimension of this book which to me reads as a lesson in success. His relentless pursuit to be the number one pimp and the steps he took in doing so, such as learning lessons in the joint from pimps he was locked up with, willing to humble himself and apprentice under a more seasoned successful pimp, all building the base to learning what it takes to be number one. Don't get me wrong I do not recommend taking away a desire to be a pimp from this book. Take away some lessons on the value of learning from experienced pros in your field and how it can benefit you but realize that, no matter what level you are at in your profession, there are always those trying to take from you so stay sharp.I highly recommend this book. While it gave me insight in to a life and time that I will never know I also found it as a well written novel that contains an example of what hard work and desire to learn and succeed can take you to success no matter what the environment."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"One of the most entertaining reads I have been lucky enough to pick up. This story brings you inside the core of an underground world, as seen through the eyes of an ambitious pimp who has lived to tell the tale. A must read for the hip, and a potential life-changer for the square."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Growing up I would hear people talk about Iceberg Slim. I would also hear people raving about his book Pimp. While out shopping I noticed a vintage book in a glass display that immediately caught my attention. It was Pimp. First edition copy, and absolutely beautiful. The book was old but a classic and made a bold statement immediately. I purchased the book and from the moment I opened it and started reading, I was hooked. Iceberg Slim tells the gritty truth about his life growing up and his burning desire to become a pimp. His candid memory and vivid details of the pimp lifestyle were a delight, and his ability to tell a story about his life as a black man struggling in society and the consequences that comes with living a criminal life, keeps you drawn in. I didn't want the book to end and this classic is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Don't be fooled by the first pages in this book. Yes, there is a very graphic description of violence towards women, but that's not what this is about....don't be so surface. This is not a glorification of the \\"PIMP\\" lifestyle as one might imagine, but a very real and sad story of racial relations and social conditions in America, given to us from the perception of someone who grew up in an especially horrific time for prejudice and social damnation. If ever there was an argument for being a product of your own environment this would win the Oscar for it. Every sociology major should be required to read this and see all of the steps that led this man to this lifestyle. I'll give a hint(and this might surprise some)......it wasn't his first choice."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This is a good book. Its written from the (hipsters) point of view. You take what you can from it."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"I think this Iceberg Slim's writing debut alongside with his &quot;Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim&quot; are monument classics to the extreme. Iceberg Slim, all BS aside tells the bitter truth about the pimp life during the 40's and 50's in the Black concrete reservation called Harlem. It shows the candid realities of the ghetto life and about the struggles of a man, frustrated with the setbacks and oppressions of a prodominately white society and despairingly turns to pimping and drug pushing as a way out. Now, I must further comment to some of the youngbloods out there that read Iceberg is dead in his grave, but if he were alive today, and read some of the entries here, he would not be flattered but pissed, to put it bluntly. When 'Berg meant for people (particularly young African-American males to read &quot;Pimp&quot;, he intended to give you insight on the pimp game in order for you to see just what a hellish life he really lead as a pimp. It was not meant as a rule book, but a discouragement from the game.Oh, sure, there was the easy money, the power over women, and the false sense of respect as you ride down the street in that Cadillac. But what about the other dangers, like having to look over your shoulders for the police, f--king up your mind with that powder (although today we have crack, even worse). And the women, when they get older and more resentful, they'll cross you and set you up one day, so you have to constantly make sure that they stay mostly ignorant of your weaknesses as not just a player, but a man. If Ice were alive, he would tell you that the pimp life ain't so f--king glamourous, but it's hell, that's why he later settled down with his wife and kid and turned straight. So, brothers, as a former player myself, I'm telling you, don't diss your sisters, talking about pimping, because it's not a beautiful lifestyle. You want money, you want girls to dig you? Get an education, Get a f--king job, save some money and get some f--cking business. Because I tell you bro's you might say it's the &quot;White Man's Fault&quot; we're in the shape were in, but in truth, we've got nobody to blame but our own nappy head selves. Yeah, we were bad, cool, and slick back then, but in reality, we were stupid as hell. We were only to steps from the County Jail and that's where you'll end up if you don't check your mind. Stay your a--es in school, and keep your f--king a--es out of jail. Or else, just be another profit to the man. That's what I have to say and I know Ice would agree. Peace! END"},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"If Mark Twain were a Black street pimp, he would have been Iceberg Slim. Pimp is one of the most captivating books I have ever read. Slim effectively uses his eye for detail and dry humor to bring the hard streets of the Chicago's South Side to life. The characters are well constructed, and the author's protrayal of himself is colorful and honest. Slim does not look for the reader to forgive him for his actions, nor does he try to justify his past deeds with rationalizing rhetoric. Instead, he just tells it like it was, using street slang that can be hard to follow at times, documenting his rise and fall, and how the latter brought him around to &quot;square&quot; life. This book is a true masterpiece of American literature."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This is the autobiography of a pimp. There's nothing apologetic in it. The author regrets the line of work he chose, but you never get the impression that he's overplaying or underplaying any story in this book. It doesn't judge. It doesn't glamorize. It is nothing but honest. You get the impression that he's is telling this to you, or wrote it as it came to him and never went back to edit. Even the typos and misspellings added to the authenticity.As a look into an unknown world, this book is fascinating. As a piece of writing, it certainly expanded my vocabulary. There's a glossary in the back for all the slang, but I found that I didn't even know a lot of the words that weren't included in the glossary, presumably because their meaning is well-known. And for all the sex and brutality in the book, the writing is well-crafted-you know enough, but it's never graphic for the sake of it.The story itself is basically the life of this pimp, nicknamed Iceberg Slim. He tells you upfront that he was very lucky he didn't end up dead or in jail, as most people of his profession do. The story follows him from a young nave kid to a wise old pimp at the top of his game. The book was written in the late 60s, but the story runs mostly from the '30s-'50s. From different cities to different jails, from whore to whore, the entire book oozes seediness and grit. It makes very clear that there is nothing glamorous in the life of a pimp."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"I've got two completely different opinions about _Pimp_ and Robert Beck himself. One is glowing, the other terrible. Maybe that's what makes Beck and his books so interesting. First, the glowing opinion. Beck's style is like nothing I've ever read before. He claims to have a 175 I.Q. I don't doubt it. No one less brilliant could conjure up the metaphors and images he casually slings as if they were off the top of his head. The book is written in a loose, story-telling style, as if it was never revised, typos and all. Beck makes you feel as if you were standing on a street corner listening to a &quot;fast track pimp&quot; weave his life's yarn. Many times, I would read a sentence several times simply to admire the unique vision Beck gave to an action as simple as getting in or out of a car (a &quot;hog&quot;) or thinking about his mother. The terminology is another, brilliantly colorful language (complete with glossary in the back!).Although the story dotes on his early years and then cruises through a couple of decades in a matter of pages, Beck's tale was never slow or anything less than gleaming. That is the glowing opinion. Now the terrible one. I'll try not to seem sanctimonious. To me, Robert Beck is (was) an alarmingly vicious hypocrite and psychopathic criminal. The book begins and ends with his tepid claims that he has seen the error of his ways and regrets his former life. These meager claims are ridiculous when you read the pride, nostalgia, and admiration with which Beck recounts his former life. In one passage in particular, his role model and mentor teaches him an unbelievable method to keep his whores in line. Whip them bloody with a wire coathanger. Beck eagerly tests the method. You can sense the satisfaction with which he regards the successful results. Beck tells us about breaking women's jaws and pummelling them senseless in the same manner he might use to recount old football victories. This is not a repentant ex-pimp. This is a retired pimp who is smart enough to realize that if he pays lipservice to reform and enlightenment, he will sell his books to a much larger audience. He certainly did make a nice pile of &quot;scratch&quot; off the stories he wrote glorifying his former lifestyle (&quot;Long White Con&quot; is the other Beck book I've read-- much more mediocre in style and plot). In the end, I recommend _Pimp_ as a refreshingly unique voice in modern literature. I certainly don't admire Beck's life, nor endorse the lifestyle (as so many other reviewers alarmingly seem to!)."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"In &quot;PIMP: The Story of My Life&quot;, Robert Beck (street-named Iceberg Slim) describes a Midwestern pimp's life during the 1940's and 1950's. &quot;PIMP...&quot; includes excellent dialogue combined with a vivid description of prostitution.Mr. Beck outlines the methods pimps use to control the whores in their &quot;families&quot;: drugs; and promises of physical protection, bail money, and comfortable retirement. Mr. Beck describes another way pimps control whores: physical and mental abuse. The author repeatedly describes kickings and beatings. Mr. Beck describes one method of driving worn-out whores from the family: on pp. 158-159 he describes a pimp stressing and drugging a whore into a nervous breakdown.Mr. Beck writes that a pimp's life is not without difficulties. A pimp must maintain a glamorous and strong image while dealing with unmotivated whores, competing pimps, thieves, and both corrupt and honest police officers. A pimp also must deal with jail and aging.Mr. Beck shows simultaneously the affluence, the harshness, and the brutality of prostitution."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Pimp is a unique look into a dark world that not many people get to see and much less relate to. Robert Beck takes the reader on a journey to witness his captivating transgression from an abused and emotionally scarred child into a misogynistic money hungry beast.Poverty, prison, a missing role model, and the general feeling of hopelessness commonplace in the ghetto made Beck a product of his environment. One which surrounded him by nefarious individuals who also contributed in molding this young man into the now infamous, Iceberg Slim. These factors result into a sad and disturbing premise for Beck's story. Although I must say that once you read it for yourself, you will no longer be surprised that he ended up the way he did. What will surprise you was the way he somehow managed to muster the strength to rise above this squalid lifestyle.Beck has a knack for graphic detail and uses ample doses of it throughout. He is apparently a brutally honest person who was no objections telling you about the pimp game from his uncensored perspective. Not necessarily to glamorize this sort of life; he just refuses to pull punches. And personally, I can appreciate this sort of 'realness.'The dialogue and descriptions are peppered with pimp slang that sometimes is confusing and gives the impression that he is writing in a different language. Thankfully, Beck includes a glossary (which is quite amusing in itself) for some of these more obscure terms. But this did very little to detract from the message Beck was conveying. Overall I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would recommend it to nearly anybody."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Slim's books could not have been written by anyone else. the genius of them derives from two things, slim's own lengthy and painfull experiance of the ills and games of the ghetto in his era and the poetry and downtrodden virtue of his sole. this is the story of his life and its a story worth telling, many have lived longer and not gone through half as much, the story weaves from an abuzed childhood through life as mean young adolescant and into his early days as an ambitious young pimp keen to hit the &quot;fast track&quot; in Chicago. from here on in it's a tale of abuse, drugs, degradation and manipulation as well as in it's own strange way love. However the story is only half the book and it's through the poetic telling of that story that we really get to meet the engrossing character,enigma and genius of iceberg slim. Slim remoulds street slang and lingo into a rich and textured prose which stands comparison with the very greatest writers, it's a pleasure to read (if a little hard to understand at first), it's also very cool and any young man who reads this book will find slim's slang slipping into his speech in no time. This story is engrossing from start to finish, Slim makes it out of the game in the end and became a writer - be thankfull."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"\\"Pimp\\" is a dark, ugly book. It's author Robert Beck, aka Iceberg Slim spent much of his life as a pimp. It's written to leave a bad taste in your mouth. That is the intent of the author. This is a chronicle of how he wasted twenty-five years of his life.Maya Angelou's brother told her a pimp is one of two kinds of men. Either he hates women or he fears women. The process of encouraging, enforcing a woman to sell her body is neither sexy or romantic. The life of a hooker, especially one working the streets is harsh and degrading. A \`good' pimp only cares about using his women until they have no more left to give. Only someone who hates or feels the need to control women would make a \`good' pimp.Iceberg Slim hated women.His father deserted them while he was a baby. Bobby and his mother lead a hand-to-mouth existence for his early years. Early on he is sexually abused by his babysitter. Stability came into his life when his mother marries an older man who was a successful businessman. Young Bobby loved his stepfather. They lead a comfortable upper middle-class existence until his mother runs off with another man.The image of his stepfather crying in the street begging his mother to stay is repeated throughout the book. He took his hatred of his mother out on women - as a pimp.Of course things go down hill for his mother. Eventually she gets her act together. But even though stability is restored in his life, Robert wants to be a pimp. Possessing a superior I.Q. (175), he was a straight-A student. In a time of blatant racial discrimination (the 1920s, 30s, 40s) he is given a college scholarship. But his path is set, the seeds of hatred planted years before take root and flourish.For more details about his descent into depravity and his redemption - read the book.His writing style is not polished. His language is not refined. But his imagery is stunning. He induces mood and feeling brilliantly. Mood and feeling are enhanced by his lack of polish.The reader may have trouble with his slang. It's been out of style for 80 years. For example, \\"vines\\" means clothes. A woman \\"georgias\\" a man when she uses him for sexual gratification without paying. A \\"square\\" is a cigarette, etc.I have noticed a disturbing trend. The black pimp is a role-model for some segments of society. Performers such as Ice-T extol the pimp lifestyle. Iceberg Slim is 'the man'. Whenever this book is discussed as a movie project, the gangsta rappers start lobbying for the part. These guys want to be like him. But not the man he became but the man he was - a depraved parasite. Some of them talk about this book as though it's the Bible.While this is an excellent book, it is ugly. Richard Beck wanted it that way. He wanted to send a message against pimping and it's lifestyle.Sometimes I wonder if these pimp wannbes can read."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Too often these days we hear all these people goin around callin themselves pimps, and hoes and say they pimpin it!! How would I ever know that real pimpin took place almost 50 yrs ago. Iceberg Slim delivered his most heartfelt novel. Even more Heartfelt than his \\"Naked Soul\\" because these are real experiences, real people, and real pimping. It starts off with him as a child and his loving mother. His father treated him like crap, so they left, him and his mother met a man that would soon become Iceberg's role-model, Henry. But later his mother tricked Henry and she and Iceberg meet his dead beat dad Steve in Minneapolis. From there Robert (Iceberg) gets in a lot of trouble. His first taste of the street. Throughout the book Rob is in contact with characters that sometimes overshadow him. His mother, father Steve, stepfather Henry, 1st botton-whore Phyllis (the runt), Sweet-Top, Party-Time, Flat-Top, Chris, Rachel, and Leroy. The book shows his rise from a pimp dream to a pimp fantasy to a pimp hell! One of the hardest parts for me in the book was understanding the slang, this is slang used during the 1930's 40's and 50's! I found myself flipping back and forth between the glossary. Phyllis was his first cop and probably the most explored character in the book besides Iceberg himself. Even though she later bailed on him she was his first true ride or die chick. Chris (whom he had stolen from a crazed-Leroy who he later met in jail at the end of the book) was the only one to stand by his side when his stable was falling apart while he was in jail. Rachel was also the only one on his side while he was in jail his final time for breaking out of jail. Flat Top and Party Time introduced him to the Chicago pimping game. Although they later on destroyed their lives through pimping they opened the door for Iceberg. Sweet probably the most powerful character in the book was just so powerful and strong that I could just envision his live pad and his lavish dwellings. But as always the stress of the street was just too much and he ended up shooting himself in the head. Only for short periods of time was Iceberg on top of his game, he was trading his old hog for a new hog every year and was pickin up the scratch night after night from his stable (see that pimp vocab is with me now.) and for a short time after he broke out of jail he was the pimp's pimp! But besides that he was pullin somebody's mind or travelin from city to city to get some yellow or H (u gotta read this book to kno what I am talkin about :)) It's just a shame that he had to visit jail multiple times, pimp, beat, and brutalize many woman, and see his mother pass away before he could realize the wrongdoings of his life over the past 20 yrs. I think him sitting in the confined cell over those past 10 mos were a real wake up signal to him, Iceberg Slim. I did not read this book to become a pimp by any means. I read this book because Robert Beck is a celebrated black author of classic ghetto stories not to entertain but to intimidate. Robert Beck knows the pimp game, he knows what its all about, but he also knows the stress, the pain, the heartache, and the paranoia that comes along with it. And he knows that he never wants to see any brother or sister have to go thru it. So while his stories may be heart-wrenching, captivating, and entertaining remember that his stories are warnings and testaments of a life that is cold and always leads to a life full of drugs, sex, death, and sadness. Robert Beck is a ghetto lyrical genius that reminds US that our lives don't have to end or begin like this, get your education and have respect for yourself. No amount of money is worth the hell he put himself through. Listen....read......remember....Robert \\"Iceberg Slim\\" Beck is the real truth!!!"},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This is the 'realest' book you will ever read. Of course its attitude toward women is ridiculous, of course its attitude that the only way African Americans could get power in the fifties/sixties (to pimp) strikes us as anachronistic. That aside, you just about feel you are PIMP as you hustle the streets, take care of your stable, delude yourself that you're living the dream life. The writing style is original, compelling, so involving you can smell the sweat, you are there in the dingy rooms, watching the transactions, you are voyeur, you are involved in the sex stuff, all the time you can't tear your eyes away from the horror and beauty of Pimp's life."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Wanted to like this book better than I did. I was hoping for something great but instead found the tale merely lurid.Iceberg Slim's tale of pimping in and around Chicago in the 40s is raw and vivid. His life is twisted and he revels in showing us its brutality.If there is moral clarity anywhere here it must be at the end. I ground to a halt after 75 pages of beatings, betrayals, kinky sex and drug use. The 40s ghetto slang is almost impenetrable at places, a fact acknowledged by the publisher's placement of an (inadequate) dictionary at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This is a very entertaining, fairly informative novel that is worth the read, particularly if you have a novice interest in the subject matter. The problem I have is that some important aspects of Slim's \\"life story\\" are too sketchily described. He writes in sufficient detail about the lessons he learned on how to pimp (from Macks he befriended). He effectively pulls you into the story with his vivid anecdotes of the drug abuse, crosses and petty crime that plague urban street life. He goes into the life of a prison convict. Although it's set in the early 20th century, it doesn't read back as dated even with some of its old-fashion slang. It has a contemporary, almost timeless feel which I appreciated. It also has its fair-share of humor and I found myself laughing several times.But as stated before, it's glaringly underwritten in many places. All of the female characters lack clear personalities traits; this is even true for women he had for many years like \\"The Runt\\", Chris, and Rachel. They should've been made more dimensional and distinct from each other if only to provide a more beneficial read. It also would've been intriguing if Slim had depicted the daily life of his stable, to show what being a part of that group was like and how they interacted and co-existed. I realize that the book is entitled \\"Pimp\\" but the lives of his ASSETS, on the streets and off, were never described. It almost leads me to believe that Beck had no clue about that part of the life, and that raises my misgivings.It's also just a little too convenient that he never turns out a normal but troubled, fresh square with finesse and true manipulation. Every woman he cops is a brainless nymphomaniac who's already in the game to begin with (or headed there anyway) and all too happy to work for him after a weak rap or a nasty reproach. To me this is just uninspired and not wholly credible.While his youth in the first half is painstakingly detailed at a steady pace, some parts of his life in the second half were rushed that shouldn't have been, like his endeavor to get off of heroin. That takes up only about a page. The circumstance of a love-struck girl bent on murdering him is almost mentioned in passing. I would've rather read about these things than about his Tuskegee years or his Georgia affair with the cop's mistress. I saw a lot of wasted potential with this book. As good as it was, it could've been even better- a definitive masterpiece.All that being said, it's recommended for being intelligently written, somewhat informative, and above all entertaining. Read if you are curious about the subject matter and like hard-boiled, unapologetic fiction."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"This is a very entertaining book about the life of \\"Iceberg Slim\\", aka Robert Beck. It gives the reader an inside look at the underworld of hustling. Also, the book gives the reader a chance to see the \\"human side\\", (or just like everyone else side) of someone who had become a pimp. The book does this by telling the story of Robert Beck's childhood and how he was an excellent student, although he really never applied himself, for long, to anything that could be considered \\"constructive\\". The interesting thing to me is how often he liked to read. The vernacular of \\"The Life\\", was interesting along with the relationship of the pimp and the whore. There was sort of a sense that a hustler had to be alert at all times, even though they are often abusing a drug to controll their anxiety. This was a very entertaining book. Robert Beck was fortunate to live long enough to tell his story before it claimed him as it has claimed so many others."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"ATTENTION: Editors, Directors movie makers, get to work on this book as a film. It's your duty to put this book on the silver screen, and if you do it, do it right. Don't leave out anything. This is real-life Pimpin' at it's greatest. No one man has been through as much as Iceberg Slim in the Pimp Game. In, 2006 would be the best time to have it out. But, mark my words this will make people open thier eyes to how trife life can be. THIS WILL BE THE BEST PIMP MOVIE EVER MADE."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"The author is quite descriptive. He paints not only the story but the enviroment and feelings in a manner that puts you there with him as he's telling the story. Someone told me that they learned a lot about women from reading this book. I'll agree! Some negative but some positive. It did reflect various types of women, their different reactions to the same situations, and his mind set and persuasive tactics toward women.

I am telling you: the category of this work is Fiction. Can I say it any plainer...? Yes, I am telling you that of all of those reviews stating what Iceberg &quot;knows&quot;, and what he &quot;overcame&quot;, honestly, not one of them knows how to read a book... that's what I thought when I recieved my copy and opened the cover, turned to page one, then page two, then page three... and there on the inside of page three were these words:&quot;This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, andincidents are either the product of the author's imagination orused fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locals orpersons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.&quot;To be honest, I was flabberghasted, and the book just dropped in my hands as I shook my head and thought to myself &quot;not ONE of those people who wrote reviews of this book knows how to read a book...&quot; I just sat there incredulous for a few minutes...but after a few minutes I resolved to read it anyway, heck, I paid for the dang thing, I expected to get something out of it (for personal reasons), but the english is so bad, and the attitude so preposterous, I lost total interest by about the 4th page of the story... a total waste of my time and money...Amazon has a gargantuan selection of Fiction far better than this, unless of course your reading level is fairly low and you agree with the view that women are to be used, and abused, and feel no woman can or will ever see anything beneath a facade you conciously erect and go around showing everyone... If you still want to purchase this book on the long-shot that it will help you in your relationships, teach you to be in control, teach you to not be affected by women, or teach you how to control women... think again...and remember when you get the book in your hands, to turn to page 3 and read the words above for yourself... and then after you've read it, when you try to put anything you think you've &quot;learned&quot; into practice and find it doesn't work and causes you all kinds of problems that may take you years to figure out... it's because, dear reader, in a fictional world anything can happen, it's the authors playground, and he creates all the characters and all their dialog, settings and all of their reactions... he chooses the reactions that move his story forward according to the plot he has in mind...and that's something that you'll just never be able to do in real life... it's fiction, folks... not a whit of it ever did happen... and it's unlikely it ever will..."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Top notch, nothing more to say.

It taught me that most woman do not want to be in control over nothing, even their money. They do not want a man they can control, con, take advantage of or manipulate. They want a man to put his foot up their behinds and be the boss! All the other games are just to throw you off from this sad truth. Their only happiness should come from your pleasure. Even if they have to suffer pain for you to be happy. Iceburg slim describes this lifestyle vividly through this book. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 ONLY because there were too many slang terms.

Iceberg Slim was a Chicago pimp in the 1950s and 60s.He was also an excellent writer who ,in the tradition of Piri Thomas,chronicled the harrowing day-by-day experiences of being a hustler and outlaw in the urban jungle.His clear,sparse prose and keen observational skills pulls the reader into the netherworld he inhabited,exposing them to the raw reality of sexual play-for-pay and the men and women who were both victims and victimizers in the game.Uncompromising,and unflinching in its depictions,Beck's stories are the original reality series.Beck served as the writing inspiration for scribes such as Donald Goines,and he was the sole voice of the black urban experience for Holloway House for years.One step into his world,and you'll never leave,for his journey is one from which there is no escape."},{"Title":"Pimp - the Story of My Life","review":"Robert Beck's astounding knowledge, and wisdom precedes him.

What better way than conforming to his surroundings? African Americans were only given one chance to survive in his time, and he took a hold of his chance with authority in this book.

Iceberg's story is very important, i consider it to be as much a part of black culture as any of our other struggles. whats draws me to this is that I know it is real. i know that it has happened, the psychology behind what makes women turn to this lifestyle is what attracts me, especially when you compare that to our modern day gold diggers- you may not seem so eager to cast stones at these outcasts described by 'Berg.

The book serves to constantly remind us that the key to increasing our chances of becoming wealthy requires the willingness to the pay the price. Discussing all the get rich schemes, such as game shows or playing the lottery, Kiyosaki writes, \\"There are better ways to become rich, with much better odds, but most people are not willing to pay the price\\" (x). The price to pay is the time and money you spend investing in your financial intelligence.Kiyosaki recalls a truism once observed by Rich Dad, \\"The only people who think life should be easy are lazy people\\" (3). Kiyosaki rejects frugality as the best way toward becoming rich. Instead he recommends paying the price for higher financial intelligence, \\"...another way to become a millionaire is to improve your financial literacy, your financial intelligence, and be willing to be accountable to yourself, your results, your continuing education, and your personal development in becoming a better human being...that was a price I was willing to pay to become a millionaire\\" (81). Adopting such a mindset becomes tantamount to swimming against the current. Possessing faith and the fortitude to dedicate your life to accumulating wealth in this manner is crucial to overcome such naysayers as friends and family.Rich Dad also observed, \\"One difference between a successful person and an average person is how much criticism they can take...Most people feel safer in the herd of the average\\" (150). Criticism tests one's resolve. You must be willing to make mistakes and to learn from them. Kiyosaki writes, \\"...the price of becoming rich is the willingness to make mistakes, to admit you made a mistake without blaming or justifying, and to learn\\" (18). A person who has risked little in life has also gained little.The book states clearly that the path to wealth is not to cut up your credit cards and decrease your means, but to work to increase your financial intelligence so that you can increase your means by acquiring income-generating assets. This strategy holds the greatest potential for accumulating wealth, but it also requires the heaviest investment in yourself."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"...unless you've never read any of his other books. Don't get me wrong, I can't say enough good things about Robert Kiyosaki's books. If you haven't read them (Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant, etc.), I highly recomemd that you do. But there's nothing new in this book. It just a retread of ideas already presented in his other books, and not as well. If fact, reading it felt like a advertisment for his other books and products."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"This is the second book I've read by Robert Kiyosaki. (Rich Dad, Poor Dad was the other book I've read). The ideas in the book are so valuable that it amazes me when people saw me read the book they would make comments on how the author is scamming people, making money on false hopes. I asked these people, and there were quite a few, if they read any of the author's books. Of course the answer was always a 'no'. I got the book out of the library, in hopes to build ideas. How are you going to learn becoming rich if you blame the rich for several of the world problems? This kind of generalization seems quite popular and creates a stop of the potential growth people have in ever attaining financial education. Am I rich, from reading this book? Not as much as I would like to be; however, the insight I've obtained is invaluable and is worth the price of the book. I also recommend: 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napolean Hill, 'The Secret of the Rich' by Ken Roberts and 'The 7 most Important Areas of Your Life' by Dr. Erwin Jay."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"Powerful!

Unfortunately, this one isn't one of them. If this book was a set of new ideas or even just compilation of other works it would have been pretty good.Sadly, this book just serves as one big advertisement of all of his other products, such as his board game, which he dedicates almost a full chapter for advertising it. There are glimmers of good information, but most of it is very vague.To summarize, I wasn't very happy buying and reading a paperback commercial.

I once believed the critics too and it cost me at leat 2 years and untold thoudands, probably tens of thousands of dollars had I not listened to the basher. Like many people, I thought this was all \\"too good to be true\\" untill I talked to a few Kiyosaki students and tried it myself.I also did some investigating myself and found that the basher is tied in with websites, other products and financial authors and attempts to hawk his own books via the self-publishing route. Get the picture?The cash flow game is another powerful tool. Comparing it to monopoly is like comparing a used dodge compact to a dodge viper. (By the way, I really enjoyed playing monopoly as a kid)One person told me that the reason some people attack this game is because they try to use a \\"college mentality\\" to win and it doesn't work. I failed miserably the first time I tried it. Made me realize how much I need to know.

He discussed timeless principles of making change in life (paying the price, change pyramid, etc.), concept of good and bad debt, and ways to eliminate bad debt.He offers almost a complete system of getting financially educated, upgrading your mindset, and building wealth. But as he said that all the right answers you got from books or schools will not change you unless you are willing to change and pay the price - the price is to take personal accountability, act on what you learned, make mistakes, fail, learn from it and do it again...Following a similar debt reduction plan in this book I have paid off all my debt including my mortgages. Now I am debt free and save up 20k per year to invest by myself in addition to my 401k.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling financially, so you could review it often during your transition, and you can also use it as a reference to teach your children about financial matters and help them acquire a wealth mindset."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"This book shows how Robert has been lying all along.

This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"Rich Dad Poor Dad has become one of the single most successful-best selling financial help books ever---and for a good reason; the advice works. Right now in this recession there are so many opportunities - that it's time to take a second look and re-double your efforts - so read it again! What does it say? It tells people not what they want to hear, but they need to hear. Also recommend is Rich Dad's Guide to Investing which offers better investing strategies than just blindly buying mutual funds or listening to your broker without rhyme or reason - we all know where that got us - when the market is hot, brokers take credit, when it's down, they claim it's not their fault.Most of us know that the real secret to making money and reaching financial success is not staying an employee, but starting a business and making it work. But what if you are stuck in debt? Debt can be good or bad, some people borrow their way to trouble - like GM others like Trump borrow their way to success. Then you need to read this book and not make the mistakes GM and others - big and small can make. This should not be your first Kiyosaki book, however, if you have decided to take advantage of this wonderful recession to make your millions, then this book should be read after reading his main books.What is interesting to me is what Kiyosaki has in common with Horatio Alger, as Alger's books - novels of rags to riches - were very much like the effect one has reading a RDPD book. Not only uplifting, (all Alger's books are uplifting and very powerful in that way), but Alger always explained in his novels HOW a person was successful, (even down to the math), and these were more than principles, but examples that someone could duplicate in a different business and move forward, succeed and prosper. Kiyosaki does the same in his books, and I would recommend you read all the books by all of these authors.I just found a very nice set of great reprinted Alger books, (I'll leave you with a few). All in all, Kiyosaki, Alder, they are all great, inspiring, and what we need to read in this recession, negative, and cynical world.Young Captain Jack: The Son of a SoldierThe Young Bank Messenger: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Slow and Sure: The Story of Paul Hoffman the Young Street-MerchantRandy of the River: The Adventures of a Young DeckhandPhil the Fiddler: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Paul the Peddler: The Fortunes of a Young Street MerchantPaul Prescott's Charge: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!"},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"The way the author explains money makes cents!

It will require sacrifice and diligence, but without these you won't get anywhere anyways!"},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"In his book, Robert Kiyosaki is supposedly going to tell you how to get rich. I know that because the book is titled \\"Guide to becoming rich\\" though it is a lot less a guide than it is a casual/disorganized conversation. The author brings up a few good points in his book, such as, replace bad debt with good debt. Good debt is something someone else pays off for you (like a mortgage loan) bad debt is like credit card debt. Pay off your credit cards one card at a time (as appose to splitting your payments), budget and find a way to save $150-$200 per month, save up the money to place it towards the down payment on your first investment property. If you have read what I have just listed, then there is nothing else left for you to learn from this book. That's it! you're done! The rest is fluff and some aimless conversation about his time in Vietnam and conversations with his friends or about his friends, and how genuinely sorry he feels for them. It is a case where the author wants to talk about these things so he creates the rationale for them to be in the book. For example he talks about some television and radio interviews in which he didn't get the last word. So to get the last word and explain how the show host got it wrong, he makes a reference to it in his book and makes the leap that they are somehow crucial for this \\"Guide\\". Furthermore, the story behind how he learned these principles from his rich dad sounds over the top sensationalized and made up. He seems to remember conversations down to the gestures and body reactions of the participants. This fascinates me since some of these conversations happened 50 years ago (if you factor in his age) I am disappointed in this book. I feel the author did no homework at all to write this. I think he sat down wrote this thing in a couple of days and thought to himself: \\"man I still got it! And I even managed to do it while thanking my wife repeatedly in the book, referencing the board game that we are trying to sell, referencing my other books -which you need after reading this book- and I didn't have to do any research at all past casual browsing on Google\\".

Better to use that credit as leverage to buy investments that will create passive income as Kiyosaki explains in this book. Go easy on buying gifts. Be generous...but be careful."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"Having read the other books that tell you to cut up your credit cards, what a breath of fresh air this book was in that it showed how to get out of debt quickly and keep my credit cards at the same time.After a divorce I was left with huge debts. My spouse charged the heck out of our joint cards and left me with the tab. her idea of a joint account was she spent it and I pay for it. Thanks to Robt. Kiyosaki, I was able to 86 all of those debts and in record time.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get out of debt the most effective way."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"Being a big fan of Robert Kiyosaki's books, I had to scoop up his latest, especially after reading the subtitle: Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards. Why? I've attended two of his seminars and he always makes it a point to tell the audience that he doesn't advocate cutting up your credit cards and that he loves his credit cards. I think it's a dangerous statement since the majority of the audience members love them too...the difference is that RK pays them off each month and he's financially independent. The rest of the group isn't and telling them it's okay to love credit cards is dangerous...if not irresponsible. So I couldn't wait to see how we could all get rich while still charging up a storm and enjoying life.I was waiting for the payoff pitch: the exact instructions on HOW to get rich without cutting up my credit cards. It never came. Instead, on page 59, this is what RK advocates:&quot;Tip #1: If you have credit cards with outstanding balances...#1. Cut up all your credit cards, except for one or two.&quot;So step #1 in his plan to &quot;Take Control of Your Cash Flow&quot; is to cut up your credit cards. I'm not trying to embarrass RK here or pick him apart, but to me that's false advertising in my book.The rest of the process of taking control of your cash flow comes from his book The Cashflow Quadrant (almost word for word), so if you don't want to shell out the money for the book, just open CFQ and you'll learn how to get out of debt.Actually, there really isn't anything new in this book, but if you believe that repetition is the mother of all skill, then this book is for you. The book is under $10 and at only 81 pages, it's a quick read (no, I didn't read the ebook. The 288 pages listed above must be a mistake). I just wish he had spent more time telling us HOW to get rich.If you're an RK fan, then pick up the book and add it to your shelf like I did. If you're not and are struggling to get out of debt or take control of your finances, skip this one and buy Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace Revisited or check out my book...The Secrets of Wealth."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards","review":"This was a quick yet powerful read, particularly for those who, like me are trying to increase financial literacy when you come from a background where that it has not really been taught or seen as a priority.

He cuts through all the rhetoric and crap and goes straight to the bottom line. For someone who failed English in 8th grade, he does an excellent job of communicating a life skill that is sorely lacking today. Robert shows the importance of financial education, which we do not get in our schools or universities.

I am really from Chicago, not Bedford, OH Mr. Mentzer! (more on this later).I just want to say after the disappointing &quot;Success Stories&quot; (I wanted more business based stories, not real estate business stories), I needed Kiyosaki to come back to me with a better product, and I am glad that he did. This book is pretty much a refresher of his previous works, but it gives a nice overview to the Rich Dad philosophy. I plan on buying quite a few of these books as Christmas gifts to my family. The one thing I really liked out of &quot;Guide to Becoming Rich&quot;, Kiyosaki mentions that people need to work to be rich. In other words, they need to work more on their financial education to become wealthy and be willing to fail more. This is something I have tried to convey to my friends and family and it is still an uphill battle, but I will keep trying.Now on to Mentzer and Company. These are the individuals who have been bashing me about my comments on &quot;Success Stories&quot;. Mr. Mentzer has people believing that I and a reviewer in Bedford OH are the same person! What a genius...NOT! For the record, I gave &quot;Success Stories&quot; 3 stars, the reviewer from Bedford, OH gave it 1 star. Although I was dissappointed in &quot;Success Stories&quot;, I do not think it should be rated 1 star, but the reviewer in Bedford has a right to his opinion as we all do Mr. Mentzer and Company.And another thing, to prove that I was right about the many real estate stories in &quot;Success Stories&quot;, on page 51 in &quot;Guide to Becoming Rich&quot;, Kiyosaki talks about &quot;Success Stories&quot; and writes on the first sentence and second paragraph, &quot;Many of those success stories are built upon real estate investing.&quot; Well there you have it, right from the horses mouth! This proves I was right about &quot;Success Stories&quot; having to many real estate stories. But other idiotic reviewers were slamming me saying there were a lot of business stories (only 3 to 4 from what I remembered)!!! Well, knowing Mr. Mentzer and Company they will still probably slam me again because I am right again; and if they do, they are even bigger knuckleheads than before.

This volume shows that he also had a fascinating inner life -- of the mind, the soul, the spirit. Edited by Alan G. Thomas, it contains letters and articles along with excerpts from early works that show the writer had lots of star quality even as a young man, even if the world didn't come to know about it till The Alexandria Quartet.Durrel seems to have been capable of a very wide range of emotions and feelings. Mostly he had a childlike (but not childish) sense of wonder at the world and the great diversity to be found among people of various nations and climates. Also central to his emotional life is his sense of compassion...this becomes clear in the short memoir about J. Gawsworth.The letters -- to such figures as Freya Stark, Theoldore Stephamides, his agent Anne Ridler, and even T.S. Eliot, among others, are written from a variety of locales and offer insightful comments, especially comparative observations, on places and people. He tries to get to the heart of the notion of identity, what it means to a Frenchman, say, to be French, or Greekness to a Greek. He himself was not exactly taken with Argentina and he had no love at all for its people, whom he rightly describes as zombies. Of course he loved Greece above all nations and is proud to speak Greek fluently. He probably would have had many good things to say about Yugoslavia but the blight of Communist dictatorship colors his reaction to life in that sad country.Like most persons of high and genuine refinement, he is hopelessly enamored of French culture and civilization. Some of the finest pieces in this book deal with French writers and artists (Stendhal is the preferred novelist and gets a lot of attention here). But Durrell is also interested in more mundane, everyday pursuits like wine production, studies at a university, and political allegiances.Still, Durrells strongest, most enduring love is reserved for Greece and the Greek people among whom he lived for so many years. Especially touching is the piece where he describes his return to the Island of Corfu as an acclaimed writer after a twenty year absence only to discover that his old friends and neighbors, whose lives he had described so beautifully in his writings, have now become infected with materialism, commercialism and the profit motive, and they even want to capitalize on his fame. They suggest he come back to the village and live in his former house so they can get more money from the tourists by showing him off to them.Yet the timeless beauty of the Greek people and the earthly paradise they inhabit comes shining forth in very many pages of this splendid book, which was editied and published during the writer's lifetime."},{"Title":"Spirit of Place","review":"The book is a collection of letters, short works, and excerpts from larger works by Durrell. Of particular interest is 'Asylum in the Snow' &amp; 'Zero', which were written around the time Durrell visited Henry Miller &amp; An&auml;is Nin in Paris. The two short stories are remarkable for such a young writer, and give ample reason for T.S. Eliot's extremely high praise for Durrell. Feel free to email me to discuss this book."},{"Title":"Spirit of Place","review":"Just as partial as Durrell's all books.

While some of the combinations ran anywhere between yummy to interesting, very few of them were in the healthy category.The occasional use of orange juice is fine with me in smoothies, but I find that there is way too much use of special juices, nectars, sherbet, and sorbets loaded with sugar. Some of the items like passion fruit sorbet, papaya nectar, and guava nectar are harder to find. I didn't like the use of special raspberry yogurt, lemon yogurt, or banana yogurt. I would rather stick to the basic vanilla or plain yogurt and just add fresh fruit or a squeeze of lemon.While I can see how some people may like this book, it just didn't fit my needs. I wanted a book with the use of more whole ingredients and the option of adding my own sweetener or substitute instead of relying on sugary juices and sorbets.

If I understand correctly what the person is trying to say, those of us who focus entirely on the race aren't even concerned with our heavenly rewards, much less our earthly rewards. So I don't know why people are so upset. What's the big issue? And besides, many of us who marvel at our earthly rewards wouldn't go and sell everything we had anyway, and vow to a life of poverty. I seriously doubt Bruce Wilkinson would follow in the footsteps of Mother Teresa, clear his bank account, move to India or Asia (or even the inner city), and pour the rest of his life into ministering to the poor and afflicted. The difference between Mother Teresa and us is that she did a lot of &quot;walking&quot; for Christ, whereas we just do a lot of talking and look to an eternal reward. As someone with a child-like heart once told us in Bible class, &quot;What difference does it make what you get in heaven?&quot; The key to the answer is in your heart. That is, search your &quot;true&quot; heart and see what matters to you. Think about those words for a while. That is wisdom at its VERY best. I did."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"No one is arguing whether it's ok to accept God's rewards. That's a moot point. C.S. Lewis' needed to get a reality check. We're merely stating that you need to take the focus off of the \\"me\\" and place the absolute focus back on God, period! This is the real world with Christian struggles, not a Christian fantasy land of verbose semantics and philosophy. So here is THE BEST real-world illustration I have: When I worked at EMC Corporation in \\"the real world\\", I had a lunchtime conversation with a Christian brethren in which he praised God greatly--greatly--for his dad's $10,000 gift. He stated that God was good to his family and that he felt immensely blessed. [Does this sound familiar, in your particular life?] He was so tickled. I rejoiced with him. The following day, during lunchtime, he told me that he became infuriated when he found out that his \\"non-Christian\\" brother also received a $10,000 gift from his father. With his anger boiling over (literally, beet-red face) he emphatically stated, \\"That [reward] belongs to me!!!\\" I would never forget that moment, the voraciousness of the anger that came from a Christian. It was a subtle reality check, as I realized then that we've all become desensitized in our Christian walk...I leave you with a couple of thoughts. In Hebrew, when the phrase \\"kingdom of heaven\\" is used, it is a phrase that has been transformed into an idiom that most often means \\"people of God.\\" In the beattitudes, when Jesus said, \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\" Jesus meant that of those whose hearts yearn for their Lord and Savior, they shall be called the \\"people of God\\". You see, God sets those people aside to become His bride. You don't inherit the kingdom of Heaven. Interestingly enough, as human beings by nature, we seek rewards. God seeks us, His kingdom. Learn to be godly. Lastly, in the real world, when Christians pray for God to bless their finances, how many of them would prefer to hear the words \\"Ka Ching! Ka Ching!\\" over their spiritual well-being? It's a rhetorical question, that can be answered if authors would more often reference Jesus in their discussion instead of someone like C.S. Lewis. Here we go, Jesus said, \\"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\\" Jesus was referring to the rich man's selfish attitude, not the status of the rich man. After all, your mind is a \\"Civil War Battlefield\\" in which Satan attacks (picture a Civil War Battlefield). I'd like to ask a rhetorical question to all of those who think that talking about rewards in heaven is a good thing. So, here it is: As you stand before God, and He gives you a choice between collecting the rewards you've amass throughout your Christian walk, or to give them up and refocus your entire life on bringing others to Christ, which would you choose? If you pray that God would guide your life towards the latter selection, then lose yourself COMPLETELY. How your Lord chooses to pay you (method, plan, or criteria) for your day's work in the hot field is ENTIRELY up to Him, so why are people writing books about this? My father and mother are non-Christians. I am a first generation Christian. My only desire is for them to know and accept Christ as their Lord and Savior, not to lose their souls to Islam or Buddhism, in the real world. That said, if my Father rejoices in heaven to give my parents a greater reward in the end, as the angels shout with joy over their salvation, it is His will."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"By the &quot;equation&quot; set out in the author's two books, someone like John the Baptistshould have been more blessed than King David. But, God chose to bless eachof us according to &quot;His Plan&quot;. After all, Paul was chosen to carry forth theGospel with many other brethrens. According to the standards set &quot;by men&quot;today, Paul, a predator who hunted down early Christians wouldn't have had achance of being elected as a major contributor for the New Testament. Wouldyou anoint a serial killer with wisdom, and cleanse his sins with the sacrificeof your only Son? No, because our society cannot even forgive an adulterer ora serial rapist. But God chose to bless Paul according to His Plan. I am gladJesus did not pray in the Garden of Gethsemane, &quot;God, give me your entire'warehouse' of blessings now!&quot; Rather, our Lord said, &quot;Your will be done.&quot; Doyou know of any Christians today who would be willing to follow in the footstepsof Jesus and give up his/her possessions, or better yet, John the Baptist, liveout in the desert and eat locust? Think about that: That is an even greaterblessing than Jabez experienced, and yet nothing is written about it.

The author also came across as noting clearly more than once that his ministry would be delighted to be the recipient of your giving.The book would have done better by instead inspiring a spirit of \\"love\\", as in \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\", as the motive for giving.

One implies 'a process of learning' the other 'work hard or else you're going to be rejected'. What is it about Christians that they are not happy unless they are beating themselves up over some failure to please God?

That's what I felt after finishing this quick read. I found the theology very solid and eye-opening. (As a matter-of-fact, I've found that this message is nothing new. Spurgeon preached this, Calvin preached this, Wesley (really) preached this, St Augustine preached this, D.L. Moody preached this, Martin Luther preached this. Somehow it's just been lost under the dust of neglect). Wilkinson elegantly brings these ancient truths to light once again. And they are life-changing truths, if we just believe what Jesus said. That God wants to further pour his manifold blessings upon us at every opportunity is a further indication of the breadth of His grace. I guess some people assume Heaven will be kind of a communist state, the same for everyone, that it doesn't really matter what we do here. I understand now why that is so wrong. We have painted God, as we would like Him to be, rather than letting Him reveal His character to us. I also understand how tainted our western aspect of theology has become. This is a message that will especially ring true for all the believers around the world that are suffering, are being persecuted, and are in great distress. God will reward them greatly. Much more I fear than most of the milk-toast Christians who in their hearts really don't believe that what we do here on earth really matters. This book has not only encouraged me to work hard at the race of life, with the finish line always in sight, but to relish the day of that victory when all I have done will count for something, and I see Him face to face and in deep humility and awe find His Grace further lavished upon me for who I am and what I have accomplished with the time He has given me upon this Earth.

There is also much insight given into the many parables of Jesus, which is most helpful.In Chapter # 1, &quot;Keyhole to the Stars&quot;, the first subjects mentioned are the two keys that indicate the &quot;where and how&quot; of our Final Destination; the first is belief, and the second is behavior.The following five chapters deal with the behavior part, and are about the purpose of life, and how our choices and &quot;works&quot; are so important, what is meant by &quot;repayment&quot; for works done, those opportunities for good actions that we might have passed by, and much more. Also discussed are our motives, and how well we steward what God has given us.Chapter 7 brings us back to the essential key of belief, and the final chapter ends with a pledge of allegiance as a &quot;citizen of heaven&quot;; the last six pages have quotes from Christian leaders, from Augustine to John Wesley, on the subject of eternal rewards.Dr. Wilkinson gives us all a challenge, &quot;...to see your true calling today and to seize the opportunity that is right in front of you. Don't waste another day living for less&quot;."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"In the back of this cogent little book, C.S. Lewis is quoted:&quot;If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and earnestly to hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I submit that this notion has crept in from Kant and the Stoics and is not part of the Christian faith. Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak.&quot;Through sound exposition, Wilkinson demonstrates, in a gentle yet rigorous way, the radical nature of God's grace:Our limited minds struggle grasp the simple but awesome truth that we are true heirs to the Kingdom and we should act accordingly. That is, we should act with the freedom and confidence that comes from knowing that we live according to God's will, with unconditional love and sacrifice of self, even for our enemies, yet joyously accepting his undeserved favor now and in eternity.I'll be giving this book to many of my friends."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"Now I know why it matters what I do here on Earth. It's slowly starting to come together and this book (as well as his other 3 and Philip Yancey's books) have really dialed me into forming a cohesive picture of who God is and what He wants to accomplish in my life. If there is any weakness, it would be that it was too short. It's such a huge subject, but I think Wilkinson handles the material deftly."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"In A Life God Rewards, Bruce Wilkinson brings together the New Testament teaching on a significant topic. No isolated \\"build-a-doctrine-on-a-shaky-interpretation-of-half-a-verse\\" here! His treatment of the subject is sound and based on legitimate principles of scripture interpretation. Really, not much interpretation is needed, because the scriptures, especially the words of Jesus, are pretty plain on the subject of eternal rewards. Wilkinson's book may SEEM extreme because it's a relatively neglected topic. Somehow this truth bothers us, perhaps because it seems like a selfish motivation, which we don't feel is worthy of our inflated self-concepts. That's not a sufficient reason for railing against the very teaching of our Lord! No, Wilkinson's teaching is NOT legalism, as the rewards of which he writes are kept distinct from salvation which he specifically stresses is due solely to faith, not works. This was one of the criticisms unjustly made against this book, and NOT the most grievous. Reviewers, I am far more concerned about those of us who took Wilkinson to task for what were actually the offenses of Jesus and the scriptures. How awful it is, some said, that we should seek rewards! But that is exactly what Jesus told his followers to do in such places as Matthew 6:3-6, Luke 6:36, Mark 9:41, and especially Matthew 6:19-21.No, eternal rewards are not the only motivation for our good works, not even the greatest motivation. I believe the greatest motivation is Christ's love (II Corinthians 5:14-15). Wilkinson's book isn't a comprehensive theology text, however, but a small book focused mostly on one important though not central truth.Show a little respect and restraint, reviewers, a little reverence for God's revealed truth!"},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"Bruce Wilkinson connects the dots, showing how our actions on earth impact life in heaven for eternity. It is both sobering and exhiliarating! It reminds me of an interesting explanation of the connection between heaven and earth that I read in a powerful novel every parent should read called The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin: &quot;heaven and hell are merely eternal extensions of what you have experienced on earth. If you have a relationship with God here, that will continue into eternity.&quot; Both books reinforce the fact that eternity does not begin at some later date, it begins now! I emailed the author at thegraveldrive.com and even received a personal response saying that he hopes the book can be used as a tool for evangelism. I would recommend both of these books and ordered five copies of The Gravel Drive to give to my unchurched friends - what a powerful way to put into practice what Bruce Wilkinson teaches in sharing your faith."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I was excited to get this book. If you are a Christian, just getting by ... read this book! It will challenge you, and make you re-think about your walk with Jesus. It is top notch, and lists many verses to study on the bible.Get it, read it, and get closer to Christ!"},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"It's all about Him and the privileges we will have to rule with Him and serve Him in heaven. It's about using wisely what He's entrusted us with temporarily in order to enjoy forever what He so graciously wants to give us: opportunities to rule with Him and serve Him forever. The returns - the rewards that we will experience in heaven are far out of proportion to what we give to His purposes and for His kingdom...His more is so much more than our more.. This book will cause you to fall deeper in love with a gracious , awesome God and on top of that it's evangelistic. The last couple of chapters describe an encounter Bruce had with a seeker and the simple Gospel presentation that resulted in the seeker's salvation.

The difference is the rewards received in heaven! Now it all makes more sense!"},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"People in these negative comments are so annoying sometimes, they are too quick to criticize and they read too much into everything. Of course we're supposed to serve GOD out of Love and help others out of Love, but it also said in Hebrews we must believe that GOD is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him. Jesus spoke of rewards, and the bible also says that GOD wants us to have all of our rewards, so it's not like GOD is going to sneer at us for doing good things and racking up rewards. We are saved by grace and because of that GOD wants us to go out and help others as he has helped us, and Jesus told us we would be given it all back at the resurrection. People try to make a big deal out of it saying we shouldn't help just for presents, that's true and that's why GOD judges our heart; he knows if we helped reluctantly or not, we're supposed to be cheerful givers. People in these comments need to stop being so critical, this book is a good helpful reminder that we're supposed to not care about stuff and tangible \\"rewards\\" here on earth and instead part with those things because we'll have something better eventually anyway. This is a great book. It changes the way you think and reminds us of our mission here on earth. We obey the law of Christ when we offer a helping hand to others and GOD would never allow for us to not be rewarded for that. That's just a fact that Wilkinson was stating. I liked this book very much and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"After reading Bruce Wilkinson's book on Rewards, I have found myself re-evaluating my motives and living more for eternity than for the present. This little book can easily be read in an hour or two. As you read it, you will be surprised how much Jesus talked about rewards in Heaven. I appreciate the fact that the author makes it clear that we do not earn Heaven, but we earn our rewards in Heaven by what we do for the Lord here and what we give to Him. It is clearly pointed out that we can lose our rewards if our motives are not right or if we do not stay faithful to the finish. You will enjoy and benefit greatly from reading this little book."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I believe every person on this planet should read this book series authored by Bruce Wilkinson.

I am quite happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I have finished checking out \\"A Life God Rewards\\". There are several issues. I will summarize all the feedback I received....According to \\"A Life God Rewards\\" you are not working for your salvation but for how big your mansion will be in heaven. It is just another form of legalism that Paul fought in his day. It is an invention of law not a work of God's grace.One reader gave an example of his two sisters. One was more interested in getting \\"rewards\\" from her parents, and the other could care less, as she was only there to love her parents. Which one of these sisters found favor? He made a point that the \\"Jones\\" do not live in the Kingdom of Heaven, so that you won't have the keep up with them.True Christian focus is love, and the joy of being in His presence; not getting His \\"presents\\". We are not out to serve ourselves but to help others come to the same saving faith and future we have in the Savior. Our help is motivated by love not rewards. We \\"so love\\" because God \\"so loved\\". Judas's green eyed, out-to-help-himself attitude about Jesus' mission led him to betray the Savior for a foolish reward. He cared about the purse strings... JN 12:6 He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.The Bible teaches to \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" not \\"love your neighbor to reward yourself\\". The Bible teaches we \\"ought to lay down our lives for our brothers\\" not for our benefit. A life God rewards fosters a spirit of greed instead of a spirit of love and giving, and knowing God's grace. If refocuses on the selfish instead of selfless; a merit system about what I can achieve to better my eternity instead of how many people I can reach for Christ.Satan encourages us to think \\"who is the greatest\\" when God's word says \\"we have all fallen short\\". When the Twelve argued about this point Jesus said MK 9:35... \\"If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.\\"We must remember that our Lord and God alone is worthy to receive glory and honor and power and worship, and the \\"crowns\\" we possess will be laid before His throne because He gave us our very being in first place... REV 4:9-11 Paul shows us that these crowns are our glory and joy in the presence of our Lord Jesus. They are the very brothers and sisters whom we shared the gospel, witnessed, and had played part in leading to the Lord! Can you really think of anything more wonderful then to have someone in heaven come up to you and thank you for planting a seed that helped them down the path to salvation!?!? 1TH 2:19 For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you? 20 Indeed, you are our glory and joy. (PHP 4:1)... The Philippians were Paul's present joy as he received favorable reports of their spiritual growth, and their presence with Christ at his return would be his future crown when Christ comes to reward his servants.God alone is worthy because all our righteous acts are like filthy rags...ISA 64:6 All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.God alone is worthy because every inclination of our heart is evil from childhood....GE 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. 21 The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: \\"Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood.Those lulled into a rewards mentality must consider the parable of the laborers. (MT 20:9-15) Those hired at the end of the day received the same pay as those who started at the beginning of the day. Jesus has the right to do what He wants, it is not unfair, \\"or are you envious because God is so generous?\\" (MT 20:15).The \\"Johnny-come-lately\\" thief on the cross will not be in a lesser place in heaven... He will be with Jesus! LK 23:43 Jesus answered him, \\"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.\\" His gratitude for inheriting what he did not deserve will be the same gratitude of all the saints for what they did not deserve.The opportunity to reign with Christ was given through Christ's death not our works. The Lamb has made the ransomed into a \\"kingdom\\" and made them \\"priests\\". Christians \\"will reign on the earth\\" because they have been given \\"kingly authority\\" through his death. REV 5:9-10 And they sang a new song: \\"You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation. REV 5:10 You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.\\"The point of these next verses is to set your heart attitude on things above that will last forever and not on the earth that will fade away. It is not a rewards / works doctrine but rather the only smart thing to focus on are things that will last..PHP 1:21-24 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 22 If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 23 I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 24 but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.MT 6:19 \\"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.COL 3:1 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.His Grace expressed in kindness through all eternity to \\"all\\" the saints... not some more than others! We were created to do good works God prepared in advance! EPH 2:7 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.Someone should write a book on prayer or submission and see how popular these titles will be in todays society. A Life God Rewards is nothing more than a catchy title with a twisted theme. God commands us to be noble and test everything with the Scriptures to see if it is true.. Acts 17:11 Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.This one does not check out."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"WOW!!! I feel that Bruce Wilkinson has really hit the nail on the head. I remember being taught about the Christians in Rome who persevered in their faith, despite harsh persecution, for the rewards they would receive for their faithfulness. It wasn't the rewards here! As a matter-of-fact, the crowds were stunned as Christian yelled to be thrown to the Lions. They wanted their reward, now! Wilkinson has written a tidy little book that ties all the strings together."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"We were disappointed with the topic of this book and wasn't really sure why the author decided to write about it--actually, was turned off. In our walk with the Lord, we've realized that many Christians don't care about what God gives them in heaven. The issue of &quot;heavenly rewards&quot; is about as IRRELEVENT as someone writing a book on what the Kingdom of Heaven is like, don't you think? Will one of your mansions in heaven have burgundy or gold-accented drapes? Will your floor tile be made out of diamonds or saphire? What is the cut, clarity, color, and carat of each stone? Will you have a large Italian marble fireplace in the great hall? It's all pretty irrelevent. As well, please leave the reward issue up to Him. Jesus' disciples missed the mark COMPLETELY in their walk with God when they bickered among themselves as to who would be greater in the Kingdom of Heaven. And that is exactly what Satan anticipates that we will do, and even ENCOURAGES us to do so, to think about our greatness--our rewards that we each can or did earn--on an occasional basis. After all, Lucifer did. Has anyone thought perhaps that thinking about this is a sin? Asking God who will sit next to Him at the table is equivalent to asking Him who He favors, and shall shower with a multitude of blessings and rewards. Like many sequels in Hollywood, this one turned out to be a poor one. The author's first book was much better. There's no comparison and it's certainly not in the same ballpark. We were actually looking forward to this book, but were greatly disappointed. Part of the vision for our church this year is to be a Christian family that makes a difference by bringing nonbelievers or people who have wavered back to Christ. As our pastor said in his beautiful sermon last week, &quot;I don't care if I get a reward, just as long as I can bring one person to Christ, towards salvation.&quot; Picture God looking down and saying to His children, &quot;Well said AND well done, my good and faithful servant.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"Rewards Matter ...

Not sure if I was refunded or not."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was given to me by a friend and I was excited to read it. However, once I read it, it was clear that the enemy was at work here. This book should serve as a reminder that the enemy can and will infiltrate if allowed. We serve God because we love Him. We follow Jesus because we love Him. If we continue to serve because we love, the rewards are incidental and will take care of themselves. This book encourages one to take their focus off of God and re-focus on themselves. THAT is not from God. This book creates doubt and confusion. THAT is not from God. It emulates the secular mindset of &quot;it's all about me and what I can achieve&quot;. It touts a merit system in heaven. Scripture has been taken out of context and the subtle twists and turns are not hard to see once you look closely. We need to be ever vigilant of the tactics of the enemy. This is one."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"Having read Wilkinson's previous two books, I thought it might be beneficial to read this newest one. The book has a few bright moments, but is a general disappointment containing some confused theology, especially in the area of what the Bible teaches about death and resurrection. His logic often leaves you thinking, \\"Huh?\\"One example of the confused theology is when he quotes Luke 14:13-14 on page 30. He is trying to make a point about eternal rewards that believers supposedly receive immediately after death, yet in the text Jesus says believers will be repaid \\"at the resurrection of the just.\\" The Bible plainly teaches that the resurrection occurs at the Second Coming of Jesus which is the end of the world. (Job 19:25-27; Daniel 12:2-4; John 14:1-4; 1Corinthians 15:50-55; 1Thessalonians 4:13-18; Titus 2:11-14). At His coming Jesus brings His rewards with Him. (Revelation 22:12). They are not received before that time.Though a part of the \\"Breakthrough Series\\" I kept waiting for the breakthrough to break through in each chapter only to be let down. The book may have been intended for readers with a basic knowledge of the Bible, but anyone seeking to deepen their spiritual walk with God would do better spending more time in the Bible itself.Many will eagerly purchase this book due to the popularity and \\"frenzy\\" over the \\"Prayer of Jabez,\\" though Wilkinson's book, \\"Secrets of the Vine\\" is the most valuable/accurate of the three in terms of practical faith and Biblical theology. He might have done better by leaving this newest topic alone. Save your money on this one."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I got my copy of this book as a freebee from &quot;Crossings Book Club&quot;. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it because in a nutshell, this book is totally wrong. If you listen to Bruce Wilkerson, your heavenly reward is based on your works. Nothing in scripture supports this.I always refer people who are lulled into this kind of thinking to the parable of the laborers. Those who were hired at the end of the day received the same pay as those who started at six o'clock.. And didn't Jesus promise the thief on the cross that he would be with him in paradise? He didn't tell the thief that since he was a &quot;Johnny-come-lately&quot; that he would be in a lesser place in heaven. He said &quot;you will be WITH ME.&quot;Once we have committed ourselves to Christ, the Holy Spirit will guide our works. We don't have to keep our own scorecard. We just have to be obedient to the Spirit and he will show us what our work is to be."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I found this book difficult to be enthusiastic about. It is definitely the most controversial of Wilkinson's books so far. Wilkinson maintains that in order to be rewarded in Heaven we must have good works. It seems like he is saying that we must have rewards in Heaven in order to be satisfied. This is off the mark. We should be striving for God's will and do as He would have us to, but not only to get rewards. The books reasonings seem selfish. There is little information about faith. I expected much better."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I've been to a few Promise Keeper Conventions where &quot;many&quot; men (not all) pour forth their hearts to God. If you've never had the awesome experience of listening to 48,000+ people worship and sing songs such as &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy&quot; to their Lord, you won't understand. It's truly awesome and unique, very different from worshipping with a group of 30 or 700 people in church. That said, if you're not &quot;satisfied&quot; with what heaven has to offer and you have to think about rewards during a Promise Keeper Convention, then your life is meaningless. In the presence of God, you're there to do only one thing: worship Him. That's what the Promise Keeper Convention is all about, worshipping Him and losing your old self and desires. I have two siblings. Much like that one reviewer said, one of my sisters is more interested in getting &quot;rewards&quot; from my parents whenever she meets up with them. They always anticipate this. The other could care less, as she's only there to love them. Which one of these is found with favor? My heart bled with love for God at the Promise Keeper Convention because my entire focus was on my Father. My heart will bleed when I can bow down in Heaven and worship in His presence, amongst an infinite sea of love. At that point, &quot;who gives a rip about the rewards.&quot; &quot;The Jones&quot; do not live in the Kingdom of Heaven, so you won't have to keep up with them."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"Bruce hits it hard with this book about the little things we do or don't do every day...at the office, at home, on the road. Does God really see the small things we do? If we believe he only cares about our final decisions concerning eternity (you know, &quot;Smoking or Non?&quot;), we're wrong! A Life God Rewards explains some of the easily missed verses in the Bible about how we'll be rewarded in Heaven for each thing we do on earth. And how the opposite is true as well. Is Heaven going to be the same for me as for Mother Teresa? Not on your life! (I better start looking for elderly ladies who need help crossing the street...) Excellent book, meaty teaching, and if you think there's a God watching over us, as I do, this will affect your daily life!"},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I was very pleased to see Wilkinson address the topic of rewards from God. One of my Sunday School teachers asked me for a book on this very topic just before this book was published. At that time, I could find nothing on God's rewards for Christian service. Now, Wilkinson has given us his take on the topic.To be honest, I wasn't grabbed by this book in the opening pages like I had been with the previous two in this series. However, from about page 30 on I really wanted to keep going.The book is not, as some have suggested in other reviews, a claim that salvation is by works. Wilkinson makes very clear in this book that faith determines your eternal destination, works determines what you do once you get there. So many people think we'll just throw our crowns at Jesus' feet and then all be equal in heaven. Wilkinson shows this is not even close to what the Bible teaches.He deals well with the passages that speak of rewards in heaven for our works on earth. I had never heard anyone discuss the possibility of suffering loss in heaven based on one's works. He explains the idea well and defends it ably, though the reader is not told what suffering loss in heaven is like.The very best part of the book comes between pages 60-70. Every Christian should read those ten pages if they read nothing else this year. The whole point is that we are judged based on how we did compared to how we could have done. The section is excellent!While this little book does not cover everything I wish it covered (nor does it say everything I wish it said), I am very thankful that Wilkinson has brought this topic back to the forefront. I hope several more authors will follow his lead on expounding this topic for us. I encourage you to read this book."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I think this book addresses the subject very well. Wilkinson covers it as thoroughly as possible while staying within the boundaries of the Bible. It is very direct to the point, which is my favorite part, since all I'd heard about rewards had been wishy-washy like good intentions, good works, good faith etc. This book totally changed my thinking about what it is that God actually rewards. This book has made it so crystal clear to me the distinction between works and faith that I realized I'd never used the first key - accepting Christ as my Savior and Lord. This book changed me from years of \\"pretending\\" to be a Christian to becoming an actual follower of Jesus. Everyone has a choice to either accept Christ or continue relying on themselves. Do you know how many people in our life are still confused about this subject of works vs. faith, just like I was?! Thanks to this book, I was able to use Wilkinson's explanation to help some friends understand.If you didn't like this book, it's probably because you expected it to fulfill YOU, but I think it can be a great tool to reach to the minds of our not-yet-Christian friends for God's glory."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I remember when I first learned that good works would not get me into heaven -- that the only way to heaven was accepting Jesus as my Lord and Savior. Immediately a question popped into my head. If accepting Jesus is the only way into heaven, and I have that taken care of, why not just coast for the rest of my life? After all, if good works won't get me into heaven, then how important could they really be? This book has the answer -- very!Backing everything up with scripture and quotes from the likes of Martin Luther, John Wesley, John Calvin, C.S. Lewis, Charles Swindoll, Charles Stanley and Billy Graham, Wilkinson explains that our behavior doesn't determine where we will spend eternity, but it definitely determines how we will spend eternity. He assembles a solid case to show that our eternal reward is determined by how well we manage our lives.Would you approach life differently if you knew that everything you did ultimately mattered? Would you live a richer life as a result? Would you be a blessing to more people? If you are looking to live a life worthy of reward, pick up this book and get excited about the possibilities. Life will take on a whole new meaning.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"A Life God Rewards explains a simple concept---God really is planning to reward His children for their good works. Although many Christians, including me, feel somewhat apprehensive about thinking that there are consequences in heaven for what we do or not do here, this should be good news---it should fill us with anticipation, vision, & perseverance: \\"Live with an unshakable certainty that everything I do today matters forever.\\" In the end he faces the reader with 2 questions: What treasure has God given me?

It's shown me how God's Grace extends beyond who we are to what we do. I've also come to understand an important aspect of the character of God. God as a perfect parent. A Life God Rewards has also given me a fresh perspective of how I relate to my own kids and pour righteousness and grace into their lives.

I know that God is gracious and merciful so I want to reflect that in my life as I go along. Now I see that these things will count for eternity. I no longer need to be concerned with recognition here. It is far better to be recognized by my heavenly Father. This book is so encouraging for now and future. I don't ever have to look back.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the answer to \\"where\\" we spend eternity, but Bruce Wilkinson talks more in this book about how that life will be and how we can improve our time there.Wilkinson takes us through how our choices here on earth will affect the rewards we are given. It also goes on to say that many people who believe they have great rewards stored up for them will be mistaken because their intentions aren't right.This book is a very easy read and quite short. I'm not impressed with the price for such a short book and some of the text was repetitive when he should have been giving more examples or practical advice.However I still think this book is worth the read. It will definitely help set your heart on service and get you thinking about how you want to live your life in eternity. 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"This book just focuses on what Jesus focused on....Eternity. We are not living for this world but for the next. A Life God Rewards helps you understand that Jesus so often spoke of not only what to do but why you should do it.Rewards are not the only reason, but they are a completely valid reason to live for Christ. As a matter of fact, Christ commands us to Store Up Treasures in Heaven, so that Rust and Moths will not destroy.Why do so many Christians have a problem with Jesus saying this? Why do they take shots at Bruce Wilkinson for repeating it and getting us to think more about Christ and Eternity? Not sure. But, I did read one negative review that said Bruce should follow in the footsteps of Mother Theresa and move to Asia or India....well FYI, he is working to save Africa, feed Africa and help rid the nation of Aids..all for Christ's Glory. I would be very careful in judging this man of God.

Let's just not deal with our eternal rewards! Thankfully Wilkinson provides necessary balance to a subject as wide as Christian rewards. It's not an \\"either/or\\" proposition....it's both! Understanding the author in the context of his writings, he clearly points out that attention to the race brings blessings/rewards both in this life and the eternal life. In \\"A Life God Rewards\\" he astutely points out that rewards which are eternal far outlast anything obtainable on this earth. Isn't that worth racing for? ...and yes, concentrating on?I might have an occasional issue with Dr. Wilkinson's theology, but I still rate this book a \\"4\\". It is definitely worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"WOW!!! I feel that Bruce Wilkinson has really hit the nail on the head. I remember being taught about the Christians in Rome who persevered in their faith, despite harsh persecution, for the rewards they would receive for their faithfulness. It wasn't the rewards here! As a matter-of-fact, the crowds were stunned as Christian yelled to be thrown to the Lions. They wanted their reward, now! Wilkinson has written a tidy little book that ties all the strings together."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I'm really enjoyed this book. It's has huge implications for my life and the life of anyone, especially those who claim to be Christians. As a long-distance runner, I appreciate the analogy of running the race of life. I run for enjoyment when the weather is good and I persevere at running when the weather is miserable, because I know that I have to if I want to run races successfully. When I am in a race I'm running a race. I'm no longer training. I love the exhilaration of hitting the tape first (or even finishing well). I love the feeling that comes with knowing that I have done my very best. I love the congratulations and plaudits that come only by persevering months and years before with hard training.This book has shown me that life is not a jog. It is a race. That there will be rewards for all time based on how we do in this race. Who would want to be a spiritual couch potato and miss out on the great blessings God has for us.People choose how they will spend their time here. God desires to bless us. How and when He decides to bless us is His sovereignty. We are responsible for responding to the knowledge and calling He has placed on our lives. If there is one danger to this book, it is reading it! Now we must take responsibility for what we know."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"While \\"A Life That God Rewards\\" contains some good insights, I liked \\"Prayer of Jabez\\" and \\"Secrets of the Vine\\" better.Among Wilkinson's more insightful comments include:1) page 74 - \\"Ruling in heaven will have nothing in common withe corruption and manipulation we're so used to seeing in displays of power on earth!\\" (to that I can say \\"amen\\" because I'm so sick and tired of seeing flesh on parade both in the world and in the church!).2) page 85 - \\"Do you want to store up treasures in the heavens that does not fail? Then surrender it to God's priorities here. That is the only way. (again, amen! we must adjust our priorities and lives around God and let Him have the power to do what He wants to do in and through us).While the two comments above encouraged me, there seemed to be more like comments in the other two books.All in all, a good read that lacks the substance of the first two books in the series."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"It has been over a decade now since Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez became the hot Christian product that everyone in the church was talking about. Since then, Wilkinson has published several more books, which are not as well known. In many ways, though, A Life God Rewards should be at least as controversial as The Prayer of Jabez, weighing in with a different perspective on the age-old question of faith versus works.Are there only two monolithically uniform states of the afterlife, a Heaven which is exactly the same for all believers and a Hell which is exactly the same for all non-believers? Or do our actions while in this world affect the extent of our reward in Heaven, if we have accepted Christ, or the extent of our suffering in Hell, if we have not?While holding firmly to the position that faith alone is what decides whether our afterlife is in Heaven or in Hell, Wilkinson adds that our behavior during this life does affect our afterlife. Believers will be rewarded differently based on how they lived their lives, and non-believers will be punished differently based on how they lived theirs.From a human perspective on the often distressing question of God's justice, this is a somewhat comforting approach. While it does not totally satisfy the \\"how could God send Gandhi to Hell\\" type of question, it does reflect a belief that God is fundamentally fair and reasonable, and will not completely disregard everything else that a person has done in life other than the single choice of accepting Christ or not.Is this position actually correct? There are some scriptures which do appear to support it, and Wilkinson quotes a number of them. There are others which can be interpreted in the opposite way. The appearance of inconsistency in scripture is not a new problem, and everyone who wrestles with it tends to go with the interpretation which feels most consistent with the moral and ethical values which that person already holds.Since I want to believe in a God who is fair and just, I would like to believe that Wilkinson is right, not only about receiving a reward in the afterlife for good behavior in this life, but also about a different punishment in the afterlife for non-believers based on the seriousness of their sins. I expect that each reader will react to Wilkinson's theory based upon what he or she believes God should be like."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I read it, shared it and think it makes good sense to approach every thought and action with pure and loving motives."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"This book frankly amazed me. I was amazed at the price for such a small book; and even more surprised by Wilkinson's central thesis, that what we do here on Earth affects how we are rewarded in Heaven. The book seems to have basked in nothing but positive reviews - which are simply misleading. I know this is popular teaching in the US - less so in the UK. Why write a theological book when you can get to the top of the NY Times Bestsellers list with this?Wilkinson organises the book around two \\"keys\\" to eternal reward. The first key is belief (chapters seven onwards), and the second is how our works affect our repayment in Heaven (chapters one to six).The author presents a number of interesting concepts - such as the idea of property ownership in Heaven:\\"What is surprising is what Jesus promises a faithful steward of His treasure. It is not, as you might expect, that you'll steward more treasure in Heaven, but that you will own it.\\" (p. 86)Wilkinson's argument rests upon the verse in Matthew 6: 19-20:\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal...\\"The problem some might have with this verse is Wilkinson's literal interpretation of it. Surely the treasure in Heaven is to be able to worship God continually. Without evangelism...?There are a number of other ideas, which are cause for concern.For example, in \`Hell by Degrees' (p.97), the author \`demonstrates' how eternal punishment is related to how bad we have been on Earth. However, I think for me, Wilkinson's understanding of Hell is woefully inadequate. How would his argument stand up if we begin to conceptualise hell as simply being the eternal absence of God? What worse punishment could there be than that? Would Wilkinson modify his argument along the lines of Very bad=No access to God, Just a bit bad=some access to God? It is submitted that that just does not hold water.Tough questions such as: \\"will directing your giving to a high-profile civic fund please Him as much as giving it top your church's missions fund?\\" (p.88), miss the mark, and do little to encourage social action.But then, not completely unexpectedly, Wilkinson seems to spot the problem with his argument, and adds that belief fills the gaps that our good works miss. A bit like Tort fills the gaps in contract. Since, \\"no amount of good works can save us\\" (p.97).So where are we left at the end of the book? Well, I was confused by Wilkinson's contradictions. I understand the points he sought to make, but the Bible verses and other quotations were shoehorned in, as if to prove his points. God's grace is almost completely overlooked - something find rather odd. This book comes in no less than seven different English-language editions. Why? It's more of a door wedge than a doorstop.Wilkinson's focus is on Heaven being the goal: but I would argue that God's glory is the goal - Heaven's the bonus."},{"Title":"A Life God Rewards: Why Everything You Do Today Matters Forever","review":"I would rather focus on the race than the &quot;rewards&quot;. I would rather be the disciple that pours his heart towards Christ and His ministry than the Christian who is constantly thinking about his/her eternal gain.

My love and joy will be in His presence, not His &quot;presents&quot;.

The others I've come across are Pasta, Soups and Salads, and Herbs and Spices. There may be more out there and they are well worth trying to find. The recipes are simple, have fairly short lists of ingredients and require minimal fuss and preparation time. I've made many of them and there have been no real disappointments so far and several have made it into regular rotation. Most of the recipes are fairly basic takes on standard dishes but there is an effort to make them all satisfying, interesting, and nutritionally balanced. It can be difficult to put a decent meal on the table every night of the week, especially when you are, say, 8 months pregnant and only want to eat crackers and strawberries for dinner. As good as \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" or other such big cookbooks are, plowing through them for ideas isn't always a joy. This series has been an inspiration on those nights when I just don't have any idea what to make for dinner.

Most importantly, the book reflects and articulates Dick and Emily's learnings over many, many years of thoughtful practice. The book itself is designed very well, with provocative imagery and helpful questions for reflection.I can easily use many of the recommendations in this book for my own practice experience, and I certainly recommend it to others seeking to improve their own practice.At the same time, as an academic, I can see disconnects from academic research in management that make evident how much practice-based and scholarly literature have diverged over several decades. For example, Andy Van de Ven, a professor at the University of Minnesota, recently won an award for his book \\"Engaged Scholarship, A Guide for Organizational and Social Research\\" (Oxford, 2007). In \\"theory\\" there are generative links between notions of engagement in both books, but neither Andy nor Dick is likely to know of the other's work.Ah well, this issue is unlikely to be resolved soon. Nevertheless, the Axelrod book is excellent on its own terms."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"Terms of Engagement is a dramatic departure from most leadership books. It doesn't provide yet another book about 50 characteristics that a top leaders needs to have, or how to be charismatic, or how to drive change from the top forcefully and efficiently. Rather, it provides a set of solid, clear principles - backed up by extensive field research -- on how to achieve extraordinary results by mobilizing people's energy.Though talked about now for a couple of decades, the decline of the command-and-control model is now truly gaining momentum. And the final holdouts who still cling to this centuries-old model are starting to feel the pain. They're feeling this pain, first, because the old model of leader-driven change does a poor job of motivating people to do better work in their lean, hollowed-out organizations, still cautious-and-skeletal from the recent economic crises. Second, the old leadership model, with its multiple layers of bureaucracy has a hard time reacting quickly enough to rapid changes in technology and global markets. And finally, the old leadership model certainly doesn't meet the immediate needs to be heard, valued, and collaborated with that are emerging with the mass entrance of Gen Y into the workforce. The time is ripe for a new way to look at what leaders need to do to make things happen, and this book provides an excellent succinct reference for how to do it.Engagement makes a huge difference in the successful implementation of a change, primarily because people tend to own what they create. And people then typically go after what they own with considerable energy to implement. Much research over the past 15 years has focused on group methods that are templates for how to get people productive quickly, and great organizational gains have been made in using such methods (like Future Search, Open Space, Appreciative Inquiry, Search Conference, World Caf&eacute;, and Axelrod's own Conference Model method). Unfortunately, the critical steps for success on how to run the business in a high-engagement fashion between these high visibility, successful events were often ignored in the leadership literature. Until now. Terms of Engagement gives today's leaders the high-leverage principles with which to lead before, during, and after such large group events.Dick Axelrod's four fundamental principles for successful engagement - widen the circle of involvement, connect people to each other, create communities for action, and promote fairness - each have a chapter on their own, and are made accessible to leaders at all levels through examples and stories. At the end of each chapter there are key point summaries and questions for reflection that help aspiring high-engagement leaders internalize these principles for their own personal use. At the end of the book there's also a great chapter that summarizes the key points of all the chapters in one place. And for additional ease of personal application of these principles there's a chapter on how to start from where you are.This book is a terrific reference, that I believe belongs on every leader's bookshelf.Tom DevaneCo-author,The Change Handbook: The Definitive Resource on Today's Best Methods for Engaging Whole SystemsAuthor,Integrating Lean Six Sigma and High-Performance Organizations: Leading the Charge Toward Dramatic, Rapid, and Sustainable Improvement"},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"If you have been wandering Amazon's cyber-shelves in search of the one best book about organization change: You have found it!

Buy it, then do the work."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"I first experienced this change model as a young management consultant in the late 1960s, and was overwhelmed by its effectiveness then. Over the years, I have made this approach a central tenet of how I work with client organizations and our own. Richard Axelrod's book is the best description I have seen to date of the key elements of this model and the reasons why they work. I heartily endorse that you become familiar with this book, which will undoubtedly be a standard reference for many years to come. I was particularly pleased to see how well he has combined the perspectives of many other business and nonbusiness thinkers in this area.The key challenge to successful change is in communication. Everyone agrees on that from Axelrod to Bob Kaplan to John Kotter. The four-aspect model here is particularly well designed to overcome communication stalls and miscommunications. These aspects are widening the circle of involvement to get more ideas from more people (this is a corollary to the key observations of complexity science for self-organizing order at the boundaries of systems), connecting people to each other (in order to drop barriers to communication), creating communities for action (by establishing a mutual purpose and direction), and embracing our social concepts of democratic treatment of all (to overcome skepticism about the authenticity of engagement potential).By way of analogy consider the writing of the original Constitution of the United States. How would this have worked out if George Washington had simply dictated what he wanted? As you can imagine, there is no way that George Washington could have come up with that document by himself. Well, that's the way most organizations try to make changes. The leader dreams up what she or he wants and tell or sells everyone else. Next, what if George had called in four of his buddies from Virginia and hired two consultants from New York? Would they have developed the Constitution we have? Probably not. It mostly would have reflected the perspectives of Virginia and New York. Even if they had, no one would have been very committed to it. The process the Constitutional Convention actually used is very similar to the one that Mr. Axelrod espouses.The book's material is clear, the examples compelling, the warnings are timely, and the directions are appropriate.What are the limitations then of this book? I see them in five areas: First, you have to experience this process to appreciate its power. So you can read this book all you want, and you may not &quot;get it.&quot; My advice is to put yourself in a situation where you try out this model and find out how well it works. Second, there are a lot of other things that can go wrong that are not described here. Think about Russia. The country has gone a long way to create free markets but new enterprises are often floundering. Part of the reason is that people don't think and don't yet prefer to operate in entrepreneurial, participative terms. Many individuals and groups have that same problem. Third, the writing style of the book is too intellectual relative to its emotional intensity to engage many people in its message. Fourth, you may need a guide for the first few times you try this. Those with expertise are in relatively short supply. Fifth, if the people involved in the process do not develop their understanding of how to analyze systems-related issues and devise ideal solutions, you will still be missing a lot of potential for improvement.You can think of this book as complementary to the ideas presented in the other superb new book on overcoming the communications stall, The Strategy-Focused Organization. I suggest that you read that book as well. The on-going measurements of the Balanced Scorecard process can be quite helpful in establishing all four aspects of the change model. If, independent of these perspectives, you also create a superior business model and strategy, you can be further aided by having irresistible forces consistently favoring your progress. Tie together those three perspectives, and you should be unbeatable.After you have finished experiencing and applying this improved change model in your organization, I suggest that you consider how you can extend it into other organizations you care about, like the schools in your community, the charity you sit on the board of or volunteer for, and the local hospital.May you always work openly and successfully with all stakeholders to build better solutions and implement them rapidly!"},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"Have you ever been a part or a victim of a failed change initiative? Have you witnessed resentment or cynicism over change strategies where a new process was created by a privileged few and drilled down through the organization? Are you involved in or responsible for bringing about organizational change and afraid of making mistakes that may alienate other employees or cause needed improvements to be rejected? If so, this is the book to read!The book provides clear and practical guidelines for changing organizations. The examples and case studies concentrate on methods to utilize the wealth of knowledge in an organization to accomplish change. The guiding principles are &quot;Widening the Circle of Involvement, Connecting People to Each Other, Creating Communities for Action and Embracing Democratic Principles&quot;.Examples of tools are well described and illustrated with case studies for each of the guiding principles. Examples of other popular change management strategies are also discussed, analyzed and illustrated. This book is a great field guide and reference for changing organizations responsibly. It is well written easy to read, and goes a long way towards demystifying where popular change methods fail and what to do about it."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"Organizational change advocate Richard Axelrod challenges the commonly accepted change management paradigm in Terms Of Engagement: Changing The Way We Change Organizations. Axelrod draws upon his research, experience, and expertise to offer a practical and effective approaches he calls the &quot;engagement paradigm&quot;, a system that will provide corporate leaders with a practical, principle-based strategy for creating successful change outcomes. Implementing the engagement paradigm will result in employees and managers grasping the big picture and align around a common purpose; fully distribute accountability; quickly identify performance gaps and thereby improving both productivity and customer satisfaction; spark creativity as employees, suppliers, and customers contribute their best ideas; create capacity for future changes to meet future challenges in the highly competitive and rapidly globalizing economies."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"Richard Axelrod has finally moved beyond the paradigm for change that has dominated this field for the last two decades. The inherent weaknesses of the current model are exposed. The four leadership challenges Axelrod defines if an organization is to cope with ongoing change: widening the circle of involvement, connecting people to each other and ideas, creating communities for action, and embracing democratic principles, are ideal for school communities. Through real life examples and clear writing he provides readers models of how they might contribute their multiple perspectives and skills to change in their schools.If readers can connect Axlerod's insights with Senge's new book, &quot;Schools that Learn,&quot; they will have superb guidance on how their schools might be redesigned to meet the needs of a new age.I am the Director of Faculty Development at a Jesuit high school in San Francisco. We are currently using Axlerod's model with great success."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"Richard H. Axelrod presents a model for creating more effective change in an organization by involving everyone in the change process from the beginning. He suggests setting up large conferences with cross-functional, multidisciplinary planning and implementation groups. As this implies, he advocates combining planning and implementation, rather than creating parallel processes. He argues that the top-down approach of having a leader who sells a vision to the organization doesn't work, although the leader should be involved in the conference process. It seems shortsighted to dismiss visionary leadership, with its successful track record in various settings, yet Axelrod has organized his ideas clearly. He provides tools for using his approach, including anecdotal success stories, how-to inserts, and guidelines for following this process. His model shares some characteristics of other conference planning approaches, including \\"Future Search.\\" However, we [...] recommend this engagingly written book for its appeal to executives and top managers who seek intriguing planning and change strategies."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"It's very seldom I find a professional development book I can't put down. Terms of Engagement is such a book. Dick's straightforward analysis of why change efforts fall short makes clear the reasoning behind his innovative recommendations. The theory is sound; the stories bring it to life. The how-to's provide clear direction for implementing his ideas. Each principle, example and suggestion made me eager for more.Having been privileged to work closely with Dick over the years, I have come to appreciate his keen perception and creative, collaborative solutions. He brings all of his wisdom and compassion to this writing. I believe anyone dealing with organizational change--from within the organzation or as an external consultant--will recognize familiar situations, pitfalls and opportunities, and find new ideas to spark their efforts in this book."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"In his Foreword, Axelrod asserts that his \\"is the first book to challenge the widely accepted change management paradigm. It provides leaders at all levels of the organization -- all those who initiate, design,, and implement change -- with a set of principles for bringing about change in a turbulent world. It is not a methodology, nor is it a set of techniques; rather, it is a set of principles that everyone can fall back on when faced with new and different situations.\\" In Part One, Axelrod identifies the problems with the current change management paradigm. In effect, he demythologizes conventional thinking on this subject. In Part Two, he examines four principles for producing an engaged organization, devoting a separate chapter to each. It is important to keep in mind that the nature and extent of production (or results) will be determined almost entirely by the nature and extent of engagement throughout an organization.In Part Three, Axelrod shares his insights and suggestions which will assist his reader during the \\"Getting Started\\" phase of the process. Also, Axelrod discusses what he calls the \\"minefields\\" on the \\"road to [organization-wide] engagement.\\" He concludes with a brief, especially valuable analysis of \\"eight specific issues the engagement paradigm can help you tackle, including the introduction of new technology, the increase in mergers, acquisitions, and alliances, and growing dissociation from communities.\\"If you are now involved in any of this or are about to become involved, I recommend this book highly. Carefully select those strategies which are most appropriate to your own organization's needs and interests. Axelrod can then help you to chart or to reformulate a proper course to implement those strategies."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"This is the best book and process I've ever seen for creating positive, effective change. The principles are very simple, and are all about engaging those who know best in the change that will affect them. The process is simple too - bring people together and let them define the issue or opportunity, create a better vision, and plan out the steps to make it happen. The sad thing is that most change is done in such a disengaging way. It usually goes like this - someone has a \\"brilliant idea\\" (this is usually a top executive), they charter a small trusted team to come up with a plan to make it happen (never asking for any help is important here), and then they roll out the brave new world to all, and spend a couple of years trying without success to ram it down their throats. Sound familiar? Did it work?Unlike the very high failure rate of the traditional change model, the Axelrod model is highly successful. I've used it personally on large scale changes involving thousands of people, and it has never failed. Not only does it not fail, it consistently leads to even better ideas and improvements than we had in mind when we started. Best of all when you are done, it creates an appetite for even more change because people trust in you, each other, and the process to make more positive changes happen.So, if you are faced with the need or desire to make change, this is the Rosetta Stone."},{"Title":"Terms of Engagement: Changing the Way We Change Organizations","review":"Is change failing? Are multiple leaders' initiatives foundering? Is vast energy being expended on change projects by roving teams of the best and the brightest? Maybe the approach is all wrong. Maybe you need ... more people.So argues Richard Axelrod, democrat and change consultant. Believing that current change practices are too slow and bureaucratic, Axelrod asserts that there simply isn't enough engagement. In other words, after forty years in the business world - a world in which \\"it sometimes seems as if everything is changing at the speed of light\\" - the author has concluded that change efforts fail when people don't feel involved.Whether this is a brilliant insight or a beacon of the trite and obvious is for the reader to determine. In the meantime, consider Axelrod's \\"engagement paradigm\\": widen involvement, connect people, create communities, and embrace democracy. All laudable in theory, and the author goes to great lengths to prove that such an approach doesn't cost or waste or confuse as much as a skeptic might imagine. But what does it mean? Larger meetings, fine, open-ended questions, certainly, flip charts and round tables, marvelous, but do these a paradigm make? When you look for details here you find yourself grasping at shadows. Ask for a specific action and Axelrod recommends \\"creating a compelling purpose.\\" Some might find this a little vague.Yet lying beneath the misty surface are basic assumptions, assumptions about pluralism and democracy all the more intriguing for remaining untested. Axelrod asserts for example that in large group change meetings, individuals frequently set aside their self-interest for the benefit of the organization. Perhaps, but couldn't we look to our founding fathers for another explanation? Examine the Federalist Papers and their hallowed brethren among American documents, and you'll find that democracy's strength grows not in spite of individual self-interest, but because of it. The negotiated settlement, the win-win solution, the efficient organization: people support such a \\"democratic\\" achievement because there's something in it for them._Terms of Engagement_ is unsubtle boosterism: of democracy, of Theory Y, and of the Axelrod Group and its Conference Model, which the book more promotes than describes. (Similarly treated are the Group's \\"walkthrus,\\" a curious colloquialism from an author who eschews contractions.) If you too believe that change happens best in multitudes, pick up a copy of the book today. If not, consider why this nation is not a democracy. It's a republic."},{"Title":"Mystic Medusa's Sun Signs and Soul Mating: What Your Friends Won't Tell You, Your Sun Sign Will","review":"I always say that Mystic Medusa \\"tells it like it is\\".

Her reviews of the 12 sun signs are frighteningly accurate, yet written in such a delightfully droll, contempary way you can't be offended by even the worst aspects of your sign. It's always fun getting a friend to read up on their sign, and watch them gasp and say \\"OMG that's ME!\\"Her work on soul mating is intriguing, and even more scarily accurate than her sun signs. The best thing is that you don't need to have \\"someone special\\" in your life to get insight and amusement out of Mystic's soulmating; I found reading about myself and my friends to be endlessly entertaining all on its own.This book is serious astrology, but at last we find an author who knows that taking their subject seriously and having a sense of humour aren't mutually exclusive.

I remember being horrified: the line I recall was something like \\"I am Aries, hear me bleat\\" and was a complete dissection of the Ram ego.The writer was Mystic Medusa, and I've been a fan ever since as are lots of filmmaker/artist/writer/academic-types. Now we have this book which is actaully a compendium of Mystic's first two cult books. Anyone who likes arch, bitchy, funny and seeringly accurate Sun sign writing is going to love this book. Especially if - like me - you're an urban Bo-Bo.The book is divided into two parts: Sun signs at the front; soulmating (via your Venus & Mars aspects) at the back.

I've not heard of the concept of using the psyche and eros signs for compatibility before; I never knew that there were eros and psyche signs before, so this is an ENTIRELY NEW CONCEPT not written about before (as far as I know).This book is very comprehensive. There's an introduction on who Psyche and Eros are. It goes into compatibility, and then what EROS/PSYCHE mean to your specific sun sign. I especially like both charts for compatibility.

Many also posit a clash of cultures, generally hidebound traditionalists versus egalitarian liberators. Janda's approach is different. Personalities, as such, play little role in his book. In fact, many of the female cadets on whom he focuses are not named in the text at all (although every female graduate in the USMA Class of 1980 is listed in an appendix). This allows him to quote freely from anonymous interviews with them, as well as with contemporary male cadets, faculty, and staff, and allows them, in turn, to speak openly without fear of repercussions. As a result, this book is more comprehensive, more in-depth, and -- paradoxically, perhaps -- both more objective and more personal than many of the other books. This is certainly one of the better portrayals I've yet read of the daily experience of cadet life at the USMA.Books on this topic inevitably include sociological analysis of the traditionally male-dominated military culture, and here too, Janda does a fine job. He neither demonizes opponents of \\"assimilation\\" nor denigrates the military as an institution. At the same time, he makes it clear that West Point, both in its own terms and as a subset of the American military, was (and is) self-consciously, deliberately, and proudly out of step with much of the \\"mainstream\\" of American culture. This has its advantages as well as its severe disadvantages, and Janda doesn't pull his punches when they're appropriate.His analysis raises a number of interesting points of comparison between West Point's admission of women in 1976 and the similar actions of VMI and The Citadel a generation later. His historical review of politicans' use of the military, generally ahead of the culture as a whole, for \\"social engineering\\" is revealing. His frequent refrain that the changes at West Point \\"weren't the women's fault\\" makes his detailing of the hazing, harassment, and -- sometimes -- downright abuse the female cadets suffered all the more shocking.Ultimately, though, the story comes down to the female cadets themselves, and also to their male comrades in the late 1970s and early '80s. They *could* handle West Point, Janda argues, without destroying it as an institution (some Old Grads may still not agree). The author concludes that \\"the profound consequences of sex integration are worth the cost\\" (p. 190). Agree or not, students of military education and of women in the armed services would do well to add this title to their collection."},{"Title":"Stronger than Custom: West Point and the Admission of Women","review":"Lance Janda has sorted through the mass of literature that is and isn't available to write a superb account of the trials and tribulations of the first class of women to enter West Point in 1976. By the use of both already available material and by interviews with many of the leading characters, Lance has written a non partial and highly entertaining account of the women who literally broke down the glass ceiling at West Point, leading the way for other women both inside and outside the military. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in military history and can't wait for a sequel!"},{"Title":"Stronger than Custom: West Point and the Admission of Women","review":"As a non-traditional grad student at the University of Arkansas, all my research is in gender studies. I grew up in a military town but had never cross-referenced these two parts of my life. In reading this book, I found I was totally absorbed in the historical context because these women entering the Citadel were only a few years older than I was at the time; their culture was my culture and I was riveted by their experiences. The research was accurate, in fact, flawless. There were enough footnotes to make a podiatrists' convention happy. The book was enlightening because of the balance between tradition, the male pov, and the entrance of females, their pov. I could not put it down. Janda does a wonderful job of presenting not both sides, not just the male and female perspective, but all sides. History had a side, the new soldiers, the old, the pc, the establishment. It was a thoroughly balanced look at a very complex set of circumstances. Janda kept me oriented and informed throughout. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in gender, the military, late 20th century history, anyone who has a daughter, a son, a thinking brain."},{"Title":"Stronger than Custom: West Point and the Admission of Women","review":"I received the book as a gift from a woman of the USMA Class of 1980, and I was very close to their experience.

I have used this book extensively while I was in transition and \\"fell in love with it\\" since I found it so thorough, resourceful and helpful.

Kudos to Dr. Tullier for her on-the-mark advice and insight."},{"Title":"Networking for Job Search and Career Success","review":"This is a fantastic, well-written book that outlines the fundamentals of networking and job search communications. It's like a \\"What Color Is Your Parachute?\\" for networking, with a little less gloss.

This book is for them, both now and once they are again employed. Dr. Tullier doesn't spend much time on the why of networking, which is fine, since we have all seen the light. Her book is the penultimate source on the how of networking, truly everything you need to know to integrate effective networking into your life, and many useful tools and examples to guide you. Two chapters in particular make this book worth owning: Ch. 10: Dealing with Difficult People and Surviving Sticky Situations (she tells it like it is) and Ch. 11: Networking for Introverts: 25 Painless Tips (the author is a self-avowed introvert, so she speaks from the heart). That all said, this book, the 2nd edition released in 2004, screams for an update. For one, the multitude of internet links suggested in the various appendices could be refreshed by adding the many new useful and relevant sites which have emerged while checking the validity of those published five years ago. But more important is the huge revolution in social networking that has occurred since 2004, and the profound effect this development has had on networking. LinkedIn, for example, is barely mentioned in the book. But the basic networking principles offered are still sound, and should become part of every professional's permanent skill set."},{"Title":"The Silver-Plated Age","review":"As the title indicates, second-century Rome was not a sterling place. It was burdened with poseurs, pompous educators, bureaucrats, and others who \\"stultified the intellect.\\" That world is described in this delightful little book (which a lifelong classicist recently described as his \\"all-time model work of scholarship\\"). The author is a serious scholar who is blessed with a sense of humor, an understanding of the universality of human foibles, and an ability to write simply and flowingly. Although it was written 47 years ago, it remains timely and pertinent to our world - for example, Jones argues that second-century practices such as standardized education resulted in a decline of creativity, which marked the end of Roman civilization. Both novice and expert on Ancient Rome will find this book gripping, illuminating, and fun."},{"Title":"What Then Is Love","review":"This is labeled #2 in the Loring canon, and it helps to define both the author and her fans.

If you are looking for steamy stuff, go elsewhere. If you still dream occasionally of a world where nice things happen to nice people who behave nicely, you'll like it here. One suspects that quite a few of the later numbers attributed to her were written by flacks hired to satisfy the fans her name attracted, but this is authentic Loring."},{"Title":"Daughter of Eve","review":"Of the Bible's great military leaders, few are less known than Joab, the kinsman of King David. Yet it was Joab who brilliantly led Israel's armies, it was he who was the king's confidant; only he had the courage to go against David's express commands and carry out the terrible killings of public figures so necessary to the kingdom's safety. Joab anticipated his cousin at every turn, often earning public reprimand in return; for David, Joab even sacrificed his beloved Reba, and his own son. Why? Because David was the anointed of the Lord.Sweeping in scope and conception, The Unanointed introduces an extraordinary writing talent. Towering even above the skill with which laurene Chinn has blended careful scholarship with drama is the magnificence of her central theme and the stature with which she has invested those who devoted their lives to the Lord by serving His anointed."},{"Title":"Can Men and Women Be Just Friends","review":"I read this book with the expectation that the answer would be 'yes', but I also found out why it is 'no' most of the time. It helped me to discover that although I tend to avoid romantic relationships with the opposite sex in favor of non physical friendships, my actions show that I really am desiring an romantic realationship. It tells how to avoid sending mixed messages via actions or body language and how to not substitute 'need' for real friendship. I am disappointed that I will have to most likely forgo the possibility of having many male friends, but the truth that I found in this book has set me free from those false expectations."},{"Title":"Can Men and Women Be Just Friends","review":"This book is an excellent find.

A year ago while on a mission he saw the helicopter of his best friend, Rick Cassidy, explode. Now, Rick's wife, Suzanne, is back and needs his help. Hart was very attracted to her and still is, but isn't sure he trusts her. His relationships with women, his mother, ex-wife, etc, have not been very good. They always leave him. Suzanne has returned because she is afraid. Military plans have been stolen and the FBI think that Rick is alive and that she and her husband are involved in the theft. She wants Hart's help to stay out of jail, but even though she is attracted to him, she isn't sure she trusts him. As they work together to find out who stole the plans their attraction grows. The premise of this story is why I purchased the book. However, it failed to live up to my expectations. The writing is very flowery and takes pages to say little. The distrust between the two characters is fine in the beginning, but nothing in the story seems to actually resolve it. It just seems to disappear near the end. The ending also appears weak and just occurs without much of a build up. The mystery of who stole the plans and the two characters solving it is secondary to the pages of language on how much each character is attracted to the other. This might seem as if it would have a strong sensuality rating, but it isn't there either because it takes most of the book for them to get together and you wonder why. Nice light reading because I liked the characters, but not a book I would keep."},{"Title":"Thank You","review":"My daughter bought this book to thank her Dad and me for everything we have ever done for her.

I just found I was skipping pages after awhile as it really never held my attention like his other books do."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Petroski has been a favorite author for many years. 'The Evolution of Useful Things' repeats a familiar Petroski theme: behind even the simplest of mass-produced products is a design and production process of complex trials-and-errors. This 'evolution' is driven by the need to maximize 'usefulness'. Design, test, improve by re-design, lower cost by streamlining manufacturing -- this is the 'evolution' of nearly all of mass-produced industrial products of modern life. Throughout his historical narrative, there are interesting anecdotes and little-known facts.Petroski has a design engineer's concern for technical detail. This can make his writing dry at points, but the reader may always skip to the next 'step'. I suspect his audience is more 'geekish' than the pretty coffee-table book crowd. But Petroski has established his own niche in popular science writing. He is a historian of the processes behind mass-produced everyday 'useful things', things that we all take for granted.Note: I was once inspired after reading Petroski's 'Pencil' to design (on paper) a 'museum of familiar things'-- it was a simple little rancher with little windows cut through the walls exposing electrical wiring & J-boxes, insulation, plumbing supply piping & vents, structural details, roofing, etc. Each had a little scientific explanation plaque next to its 'display window' commemorating the inventor(s)with a brief history of the device. Many we now recognize as brands like Carrier. All of the furniture, kitchen gadgets, bath fixtures, THE ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES, etc. were the show-pieces of the exhibit. You can imagine the garage exhibit!In fact, some of Petroski's stories would be livelier if they were multimedia."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Interesting book- lots of history on various everyday items.

Fun source book."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Petroski's field is design, but his take on it is the history of design rather than the &quot;science&quot; of design as Donald Norman (of The Design of Everyday Things fame). Although their approach is different, the two men share some of the same insights into how and why objects are the way they were. But where Norman's philosophy is that an object can be designed to be &quot;better,&quot; Petroski feels that an object will always be less than perfect. His theory, in part, is that because most objects have multiple purposes, the object can not perform any single task perfectly. This idea of the competition of purposes is best illustrated from the book by Petroski's examination of eating utensils. The perfect utensil would be one that could cut and lift food to the mouth for eating. But knifes that cut have difficulty in lifting, forks are almost useless with a soup, and a spoon doesn't cut well. By showing us the evolution of the flatware selection (which remains imperfect), Petroski gives weight to his theory.But I'm not wholly convinced. Perhaps it's because I read Norman first that I want to defend him. I want to believe that objects can be bettered--an interface can be easier to use, etc. The difference between Norman and Petroski is also one of style. Norman's prose is almost light weight compared to the dense, multi-syllabic approach used by Petroski, and Norman wasn't afraid to use terms and ideas that were not in lay usage. It could be that Norman's short columnar structure breaks up the duty of trying to convey so much information that his is more readable prose. It could also be that Petroski likes the language of academia, even when it begins to obfuscate. From the design standpoint, both authors are worthwhile. It is important to see specific examples of real world solutions to design problems to come up with ideas for our own designs, be it a fork, a building, or software."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Ideal for anyone who harbours a casual interest in forks, pins, paper clips and zippers.

Poorly written and hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"On the face of it, the Evolution of Useful Things simply lists fun trivia about familiar objects. Why does a fork have four tines and not two or three? What's a perfect paperclip? Is there such a thing? Who invented the zipper? How many things can you see on your desk right now?However the book gives us much more. Petroski uses a large number of concrete facts to present general laws of human thought and activity. The paper clip appeared because pins used to hold papers together made holes in them and could injure someone looking through files, but it took a while for it to reach the form we know today. We invent new things because we are dissatisfied when we find problems. Form follows not function, but failure.While small objects play the center role here, large machines such as locomotives and large projects such as bridges also come up. Petroski argues that for his concepts to be valid, they must apply to the great as well as the small and he shows that engineers design new bridges or tunnels by solving problems observed found while building other bridges and tunnels.The book's title is especially good. The evolution of man-made things differs fundamentally from the evolution of living things. Natural selection follows a mindless process of sifting through countless minute _random_ changes. Things, however, evolve through a different process of sifting through countless _intended_ changes (sometimes small, somtimes large) until something arises that works better than before.Petroski's writing does annoy me a little; he's got some really bad puns. For example he follows two different quotations of how to manufacture a needle with the phrase \\"there's more than one way to make a point.\\" Another problem is that he repeats himself. For instance, he twice mentions Karl Marx's astonishment at finding 500 different kinds of hammers in a Birmingham factory.But the originality of his thesis far outweighs these minor flaws. Henry Petroski is a philosopher of engineering examining the question of why we invent things. He asks why we are always perfecting our inventions, why we are never satisfied with our tools as they are. His proposed answers in no small way explain much of the history of our rich living environment with its tens of thousands of useful things.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"If you like to read the fine print in contracts, you'll find this book interesting.

Henry Petroski is a Professor of Civil Engineering at Duke and has written several books of this genre. The book is well written, has many footnotes, and an eight page bibliography. While the book is not technical per se, it would probably be most enjoyable by other engineers and fans of technological history.The author tracks the engineering and development of several common devices of everyday life. Two that he spends a lot of time on are the fork and the paper clip. There are several full chapters examining issues such as the first historical records of use, patents, and the development of companies and industries as these items became incredibly popular. Other items receiving lesser treatment include wheelbarrows, tin cans, and McDonalds hamburger containers.This book will give you an appreciation of the time frame that great inventions occupy. Most of the items discussed here are developed over several lifetimes, or at least several working lifetimes. This alone should be very instructive to anyone trying to get a feel for the history of invention. The histories given are very detailed with names, dates, addresses, patent numbers and drawings, and the economic data (manufacturing costs, prices, etc.).

Does form follow function? What are some common mistakes in patent writing? The Evolution of Everyday Objects, explores the hidden history of axes, spoons, paperclips, garbage bags,tin cans, and zippers for a general audience. Henry Petroski, a professor of industrial design at Duke University, also introduces unlikely heroes like Walter Hunt (the safety pin) Richard Drew (Scotch tape), and Jacob Rabinow (pick-proof lock) while celebrating the marvels of engineering and industrial design.This lucid primer weaves a weird and wonderful tale of techincal evolution and expanding consumerism. Petroski argues that disappointment with available choices inspires inventors, engineers, and industrial designers to continually expand our consumer choices. Form, contrary to rumors, follows failure. Edison's edict seems more apt than ever.Petroski focuses on the telling details behind both familiar success stories and the far more frequent failures of consumer objects and modern artifacts. Although this 288-page paperback lacks illustrations and might seem a bit repeative and/or simplistic to specialists, Petroski's book should appeal to aspiring inventors, engineering students, and curious readers seeking a better understanding of our modern consumer culture.

He thesis, which he rarely tires of repeating, is that the form of an object follows its failure. He rejects the saying \\"form follows function\\" as being quaint and incomplete. He uses numerous examples of the evolution of the paperclip, fork, scotch tape and other common items to illustrate that objects change not due to far sighted design, but instead to users finding fault with how the object does its job and trying to improve it.

In fact, this book is almost a stake in the ground on how the manufacturing process, invention, and branding created the artifacts in our environment. Better than the Industrial Desig books I read 10 years ago. I think we would call these \\"case studies\\" and \\"use cases\\" in modern terminology. I mention all the fields above because every single one of them have an exact doppelganger in the past.This book is a brilliant look at process and can be used as a research tool when looking at why something like the iPod caught on and why almost everything that has been developed at MIT in recent history (except eInk) has never gained a foothold in popular American culture. In the face of the rise of \\"everyware\\" computing, it's adoption in places like Korea and Japan, and only limited use by the rich for personal security in the US, I would say this is a must read for contemporary designers, no matter what depth of complexity their task at hand. This book predates the web, making it very enlightening in light of user-centered design in recent years.This book looks at the relationship of genius design, corporate R+D, pop culture, the feedback loop for product innovation, and the adoption of standards around SIMPLE things. This means these case studies can be used to analyse the failures (and how failure breeds innovation, not \\"form follows function\\") of our complex information economy and embedded systems.

The author keeps on circling back to the same points, over and over and over again. The worst is the discussion of forks. I'm still not sure how I slogged through that section, talking about the number of tines and the length of the tines and the width of the individual tines and the handle.

Henry Petroski thinks he knows, and his history of the inventions you use everyday arrives at a fairly radical conclusion. Necessity is not the mother of invention: annoyance is. And -- to topple another shibboleth of modern design theory -- form does not follow function. Need proof? Compare chopsticks and forks. Starting from tableware, Petroski launches into the world of tools, tools that make tools, and the way tools are fashioned by those who use them. The air of secrecy which surrounded many of the \\"trades\\" until quite recently (and to some degree continues yet, see below), has had the result that there are numerous specialized tools only decades old whose purpose we don't know. Many of us remember the rapid evolution of the pop-top, but the author has pulled together the whole story from its invention in 1959 by Ermal Fraze (it came to him in a dream) until the emergence of the non-removable version we know today, in 1980. All of which fits into the bigger picture of sealing and reopening containers, an historical duet, since canning begat the can opener. The author's discussion of secrecy in the manual arts reminds me of a friend and fellow mason who plied his trade in New England in the 1970s. When working for someone whose willingness to pay was in question, my friend would install a pane of glass between two of the flue tiles about halfway up a chimney. If the contractor didn't deliver payment in full, the chimney didn't work, and no one looking up or down the stack could figure out why. Once the bill was satisfied, the mason would go up on the roof and drop a brick down the chimney. (How this particular use of a \\"useful thing\\" evolved is not addressed in the book.) Most telling of all, perhaps, is Petroski's look at some of the unintended consequences of invention. For example, the plastic garbage bag was introduced as a solution to the sticky dirtiness which often accrued to unlined garbage containers. His discussion of the downside of this solution is enough to start you wrapping trash in paper once again, and long for the good old days.

The only merit to the book is that the author provides some interesting information about the history of Post-It notes, paperclips, tableware and such--THAT'S ALL! The style of writing is rambling and redundant. The level of detail in places is enough to bore the most die-hard fan of this topic. At times, I wondered if this book was even proofread by anyone before being published. The author does not do a very good job of making a case for his theories about design--and it is simplistic case to begin with. I normally find merits to almost every book I read and with this one it was difficult. This is the only 1 star review I've ever submitted. Only buy this book if you are an absolutely die hard fan of the topic of design or the history of everyday items. If you do buy it then don't even think about reading it before going to bed--unless you have insomnia. The tragedy is that the topic could have been very interesting and entertaining. The author obviously has the necessary subject matter expertise."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"This book is an extended essay about the process of invention. In it, Petroski takes the viewpoint that the form of manufactured items is the result of an evolutionary-like process. He stresses that for any specific item, the form it has is only an arbitrary choice from many possible solutions that the inventor could have come up with. And the driving force behind invention, according to Petroski is failure- -each change in form that an invention takes is the result of trying to address some failure in what was done previously.Petroski introduces the book with an item that very aptly demonstrates his thesis: the fork. He details the history of the development of the fork, starting with the table manners of the Middle Ages, when people were in the habit of using knives to both spear bits of food and convey them to their mouths. But in order to chop off bits of food from larger pieces, it was handy to have a second knife to hold the larger piece steady. Of course, the second knife was also like to put a hole in the larger piece, and wasn't well adapted to holding things, not until someone had the brilliant idea of making a stabilizing knife with two prongs instead of one. Eventually, this stabilizing knife began to be used for conveying food to the mouth instead of just holding food steady while cutting, and it was found that four prongs were much better suited for this task than two. Each step of the way through the history of the fork, Petroski points out how when the implement of the time failed to accomplish its intended task satisfactorily, its form was modified, until the fork took its present customary form. At the same time, however, Petroski also stresses that the current form of the fork is only one possible solution to the food conveyance problem. He compares its development to that of chopsticks, which are equally well suited to the same task, but take a very different form.Other objects given a detailed examination in this book include paper clips, zippers, and cans for food, as well as openers for cans. In this last topic, Petroski brings out the point that objects are often developed and brought into use long before their supporting technology is even conceived of. Although tin cans came into general use during the first half of the Nineteenth Century, it was to be another 50 years before the first can opener was finally developed. Until then, producers of canned foods expected their customers to open their cans by stabbing them with hammer and chisel and (miraculously) come back for more!Overall, I found the book somewhat interesting, and certainly illuminating. While I agree that form does follow failure in many cases, I think that Petroski is too quick to dismiss aesthetic influences in the evolution of form. He notes that some forks in modern tableware sets have only 3 tines out of a desire to look different or special, even though they aren't as efficient at conveying food as 4-tined forks. But he dismisses this as being a minor factor, unimportant for the general evolution of the fork. Perhaps he is right in the case of forks, but there are a number of other items where fashion plays a larger role. High-heeled shoes, for instance, are certainly an evolutionary wrong-turn in foot attire, but not a dead end. Colored cars are wasteful in the mass production process, as Henry Ford was quick to point out, but he learned that color options are also a selling point. Indeed, many times a better solution for achieving a task can be invented, but then never brought to market because of economics. Or the form that finally does become standard is a less than optimal solution for the task, but cheaper to manufacture than a better one. Petroski points to tableware sets with over 200 individual items, each with a separate task. He argues that each item was developed in response to some perceived failure of another form at doing the stated task, and dismisses the idea that it was simply manufacturers trying to develop new things for consumers to buy so that they would have a complete set. Personally, I'm not so sure that the manufacturers really depended entirely on failure to develop the forms of their tableware. I find it easy to imagine an artist being asked to come up with some more fancy designs that could be created in silver so that customers would have more items to purchase. Perhaps some of these new silver utensils received their titles only after they were actually created and tested to see what they might be good at. In short, I think that economics may have a stronger influence on the form of things than Petroski seems willing to grant in this book. But in any case, the book is very well researched and documented. It is amply illustrated with black-and-white photos and drawings. The text itself flows smoothly and is quite clear for general and technical readers alike although it can be a bit dry at times."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Henry Petroski uses many examples to drive home REPEATEDLY his points that Irritation is the Mother of Invention, and that function doesn't dictate form. His presentation is convincing, and I enjoyed his discussion of the evolution of the paperclip. By the time he got to the trials of inventing the zipper it had begun to drag.Of course it does take multiple examples to prove a point. But my real objection to the book isn't what it includes, but what it leaves out. Irritation may be the reason many inventions get started, but Mr. Petroski leaves out all mention of why they get finished, the sublime joy of coming up with something new and actually seeing it work."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Although the subject is fascinating, I did not like this book very much at all. First of all, it contains far too few illustrations. Not like I need a picture book, but the book is *about* how things look. In fact, at one point the author mentions that a device is clearly depicted in a (presumably famous) painting, but then fails to show it to us! To compensate, he attempts to use highly descriptive language. However, the word choices are often obscure and the sentences difficult to parse. In any case, variations on the saw (for example) are easier to show than tell. He also exaggerates the properties of inventions to bolster his arguments. For example, although weaker than tin cans, modern aluminum cans are hardly &quot;collapsible cream puffs&quot; (p.190), while the chapter on the evolution of silverware would have you believe that eating something without its dedicated fork variant is practicallyimpossible.The &quot;message&quot; of this book is that the statement &quot;Form follows function&quot; is false, and that it should be, &quot;Form follows failure&quot;. He means that the current form of an object is determined by analysis of the failures of previous forms. Yet the revised form is determined by the function of the object, so this seems to be merely a rewording of the original saying. As he elaborates, it becomes increasingly clear that the issue is semantics, not the process of engineering.This book would be greatly improved if the author had left out the weak &quot;moral&quot;, stuck to the history of the inventions, and replaced many of the long descriptions with diagrams."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Things get improved because in their current form, they do not work properly. Henry Petroski's book, The Evolution of Useful Things, traces the development of objects in our everyday life, including detailed histories of the development of the staple, the zipper, silverware, and hand tools. The book is interesting, although Petroski does tend to shy away from offering a theory of development, and instead offers a conjectures about how things might have developed. He explains, but he does not offer a theory or an argument that explains everything. Overall, though, a goos book, well researched, well illustrated, and interesting on many levels."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"I enjoy books about inventions. However, this book is an exception to that hard-and-fast rule.It's obvious that Petroski knows his stuff. This book is well researched. My issue has to do with the tone, structure, and repetitiveness of _The Evolution of Useful Things_.I think it would have made more sense to name the chapters by invention. For example, &quot;Fork&quot; and &quot;Paperclip&quot; may have been more fitting. Since the chapters were not named this way, the book was difficult to follow. I kept asking myself, &quot;When did he change the subject?&quot; and &quot;How did he make this transition?&quot; Over and over again, Petroski kept repeating himself. At first this was acceptable (Maybe he's worried that his readership won't follow his line of scientific thought.). By the end, though, it was downright annoying!Also, I would have liked the book to have a slightly different tone. The cover art and jacket summary gave me the feeling that this was to be a quirky, educational reading romp. Upon reading the book, though, I found its tone to be flat and &quot;text book-y.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Petroski often does a fine job of relating the facts surrounding everyday inventions, occasionally even stumbling across compelling stories, but always seems to come back to forks for some reason. And the conclusions he draws from his explorations seem trite. He mistakenly believes that 'form follows function' is generally held to be a law of design--and laboriously disproves it again and again--when in fact it is generally understood to be merely an aid toward good design."},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad, 79 years young. Finding anything for him, that he hasn't seen, heard or done is very difficult.

Both are super-duper gifts!"},{"Title":"The Evolution Of Useful Things - How Everyday Artifacts - From Forks And Pins To Paper Clips & Zippers - Came To Be As They Are","review":"Mr. Petroski labors at too much length to describe how several common items became what they are today as a result of the design process and subsequent evolution as a result of engineers' continual desires for improvment. This exercise is less successful than earlier works which focused on the engineering process and used infrastructure projects such as buildings and bridges for examples.Lay readers, and even engineers, would be better served by reading &quot;Remaking the World&quot; or &quot;To Engineer Is Human&quot; which provide more insight into the engineering process and which are more relevant and connected to the common structures and objects that we take for granted every day."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes Sir Gawain and The Green Knight","review":"While Sir Gawain wears the green girdle as a sign of his humility and wrong doing, the people in the court see it as a sign of his honor and chivalrous manner. Sir Gawain takes the green girdle from the host's wife because as the time when he will face the Green Knight approaches he is more and more fearing for his life. Sir Gawain defies the rules of the game being played with the host and does not present this girdle to him at the third nights end.When the Green Knight identifies himself as the husband of the women who was courting him Sir Gawain realizes that he has been tricked and not upheld the honor of the Round Table. The castle that Gawain had run upon in the woods was actually an illusion, which was part of the game that was being played on Gawain. Througout the poem there is a contrast between what seems to be real and what is actually real."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"One of the least useful textbooks I've ever read; I learned next to nothing from it. It's very poorly written, in very confusing style. Samples are placed several pages away from where they are referred to. As another reviewer stated, the authors don't explain much of anything -- it's like watching an expert accountant quickly burn through his work, then ask you if you understood everything you saw him do. The problems aren't very enlightening, either: instead of focusing on building up the basics, they seem to prefer to focus on special cases, so you're thoroughly confused about what to do in the normal case.Yes, there are good reviews, but notice that two are commenting only on shipping speed, and the other was from a guy trying to sell his copy. I won't inflict my copy on anyone else, because I'd rather destroy it."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"This was the first accounting book I've ever read when I took my very first accounting class at my graduate business school. For those who are new to accounting, this is not at all a good introduction. The authors simply inundate the reader with a plethora of information which is way too wordy and unnecessary at the beginning level. The authors seem more concerned about leaving nothing out in their writing as opposed to teaching the readers about the basics of the balance sheet, income statement, cash flows, inventory valuations, etc. It almost gets to the point in which I suspect the authors are simply showing off what they know as opposed to genuinely understanding that a reader like me has no previous accounting background. The chapter contents are not too logically organized and the explanation of concepts are excessive and unnecessarily complex. The authors seems to forget that when it comes to teaching accounting to someone who has never took accounting before, they should keep the concepts as basic as possible before going onto more in-detail discussions. The authors does the exact opposite and explains the accounting concepts from the intermediate point of view first, leaving the reader to come up with his own interpretation of what the basics should be. This is a complete waste of time for the reader, for all students would prefer that the authors get right to the point, directly and clearly, about how to construct a balance sheet, income statement, etc. The good thing about this book are the highlighted study problems presented in each chapter. The questions are useful and stimulate good application thinking, and the answers provided are an adequate explanation of how the questions should be answered. Unfortunately, the authors don't include enough of these study problems. If they had expanded upon these study problems and made them more comprehensive to the relevant chapter material, this book would have been a much more stronger teaching tool. Instead, we have an unnecessarily complex and not too organized textbook which is not really adequate for the beginning accounting student. Most of my fellow classmates did not enjoy reading this book and felt that it is an unsatisfactory way to be introduced to the world of accounting."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"This textbook is written terribly. Each chapter seems to refer to multiple concepts, with little to no explanation of the concepts besides \\"We will cover that concept in X chapter\\". Chapter 1 refers to nearly every other chapter, Chapter 2 refers to nearly every other chapter, (Including Chapter 1??) Chapter 3 refers to every other chapter, (Including chapters 1 and 2) etc etc. Each chapter seems to read like the introductory chapter. The content organization of the book makes me think the authors decided how to break each \\"topic\\" down, then wrote that topic while referring to the (not yet written) other \\"topic\\" sections. The \\"topics\\" then were assigned chapters based on how they thought information flow should go. The problem is, there is NO buildup of knowledge as every chapter reads like it *should* be the last chapter in the book since it assumes you know all of the other concepts it refers to in every other chapter. (Which of course you do not)The book also, despite saying it will focus on only two companies in chapter 1, constantly jumps into different companies financial information. This seems to only confuse, not help understanding.As other reviewers stated, the book does very little explaining, and mostly stating. I found the review which mentioned watching an expert accountant fly through the work they do daily and expecting you to understand it right on. To say this book is hard to pay attention to, and hard to comprehend is a drastic understatement.This book is one of the most terrible MBA textbooks I've had. If it didn't cost so much (and therefor be worth more to sell back) I'd burn it too."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"It is a very detail oriented book and you have to read every single sentence. Everything is stated, not much is explained. The reader gets lost in all the statements and tables. The probelms are annoying and like playing meaningless puzzles. One gets the feeling that the authors want to trick you rather than effectively teach the material.I wish the authors would have explained all the concepts step by step, but they go over the material again and again in a spiral fashion. I find this approach rather confusing and would have hoped for a more gradual approach of logically building up knowledge.If you are a detail oriented person you might like this book, but if you are a grand-picture thinker you get terribly lost. The storyline is missing.I find this book one of the hardest books to follow. I can read general relativity books and solve Einstein's equations, but the way the material is presented here makes Einstein's work sound really easy."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"Having never taken an accounting class before, I didn't know what to expect. This was the text assigned for my first accounting class in an MBA program at an elite Northeastern Business School. It is a pretty straight-forward read. Let's face it, accounting is a subject full of jargon that you MUST learn. It is just one of those subjects.The text had ample exercises and was fairly easy to read. However, you must be able to have an attention span greater than 5 minutes to be able to read this book."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"I'm using this book during my MBA, it is a required lecture. I will put it very simple:1.- It is confusing, the structure makes difficult to follow the examples which are located in several places.2.- Very congested; I'm a visual learner and all the examples and solutions are narrated, not graphically described. like a, b, c.3.- The solutions to the proposed excersices are not included in the book4.- The paper used is shiny which causes glare when reading it, I have to find a good position when reading for a long time.For me this was my first exposure to accounting, and I used this book only because my University charged the price and used it as the main text. I ended looking for other authors."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"If I could burn this book, I would. It is that bad. For an &quot;Introduction&quot; book used in an intro MBA class where most accounting types have already tested out of the class it is overly complex and confusing to the layman. Wordy beyond belief.

Keep it on the bed stand."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"This book is the worst accounting text book I have ever seen.

That being said, prepare for frustration. This book is poorly written and laid out. Rather than presenting subjects in their totality and building on previous knowledge as one progresses through the chapters, it attacks multiple subjects per chapter in a piecemeal fashion that ensures that you never actually grasp any of the subject matter. A classmate whose wife was taking an accounting course at another university using a different textbook took to just looking at the syllabus to see what the subject matter for the week was and reading about it in his wife's book. This was my first and, god willing, only accounting class, so you could certainly dismiss this review as the ignorant musings of an accounting neophyte, but my coworker, who is a CPA, had the exact same reaction I did, \\"How is anyone supposed to learn about a subject as detailed and technically complicated as accounting in this manner?\\" Again, no one is buying this book because they want to, but I wanted to give fair warning of how bad it is, regardless."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses","review":"I do not understand why instructors use this textbook.

As the other reviewers have stated, the chapters do not list step by step examples with calculations and there is very littlel explanation of even the most basic concepts. For those of us not in the accounting profession, we struggle to find meaning and solve our homework problems. The problems within the book are not comparable to what is in the chapter content so it gets EXTREMELY confusing and there is no answer key in the back to give the slightest bit of guidance. As mentioned it seems each chapter refers to multiple concepts and multiple chapters which send you on a wild goose chase, A TEXT BOOK SHOULD NOT REQUIRE SO MUCH EFFORT!It is a struggle to make sense of the mayhem contained in each chapter and there is not flow throughout the book. I think the authors assume the student already knows this material all too well, and let's face it this is not a class for the accounting professional.As other reviewers stated, the book does very little explaining leaving a lot for you to figure out on your own.

If you want if for some other reason, I would recommend a different text. The present critical reviews are all spot-on, and here are my two cents.The organization of the content is scattershot. You'll find yourself frequently turning forward and back several pages to reference a chart or table the text discusses. There is no shortage of examples as the book moves from concept to concept, though it frequently commits the sin of showing but not telling. Another reviewer described it as equivalent to watching an accountant zip through the work, then ask if you got it. That's it exactly. The rationale behind why certain mechanics work as they do is explained either five pages away from the examples, or sometimes explained only half way. Granted, basic accounting becomes intuitive once you grasp accounting logic and rationale, but this book seems to operate under the assumption that you can learn by deduction. I don't know that accounting is the best subject to learn by deduction.I have a particular beef with chapter two. Chapter two is new to this edition, and the reason why Schipper and Francis are up there on the cover. This is apparently the Duke University crash course in balance sheets and income statements. What should have been a simple two-part discussion - balance sheet and income statement - turned into a meandering analysis of the two at once. What the advantage of the Duke method may be is a mystery to me, as it seems nothing but a hot mess of poorly fleshed-out examples and a sloppy how-to guide on T-accounts.The professor I had who taught from this book spoke highly of previous editions, but even he had some creative things to say about Ed. 13, the Duke Chapter in particular.

However, Gray is stunned when Minerva fails to greet him with open arms. Minerva thought Gray was dead and went on with her life. She has devoted her time supporting causes that free women from male domination. She resents that Gray believes that she should just take him back and, in turn, reject her family. Minerva refuses to accept that her parents are shysters and believes Gray should look elsewhere for his enemy.As the pair tries to come to some sort of understanding, there are conspiracies within conspiracies that strive to keep the two lovers permanently apart.Stella Cameron treats readers to a fun to read novel even if the work is a bit of departure from her usual style.

Wright, along with photos and brief appreciations. The gatefolds are Wright's own presentation drawings. You can almost see the individual bits of texture in the colored drawing leads. These pastel colored drawings have some beauty in themselves--Wright was a man of many talents--and are valuable to show what the architect found the centers of interest in each project.The layout of the portfolio is ingenious: bound loose-leaf and prefaced by a page of appreciation, the gatefolds on medium stock will lay flat to the right for examination, or can be wholly removed. The reverse side of each contains another page of discussion, a small plan by William Storrer, and colored photos of interior as well as exterior views. I suppose one could cut off and frame the long drawings. All the text can be read without opening the gatefolds. Text and headings are set in a most attractive, 1930-ish Wrightian typeface (&quot;Eaglefeather,&quot; I believe).

It makes you marvel at Wright's ability to make detailed drawings.Each entry is 4 full folded paged beginning with a single page of text then folding out to the 3 other pages of drawing. On the back of that long fold out page is 4 pages of what you ordinarily find in large FLW picuture books, in this case, about 10 excellent color photos over the 4 pages with a descriptive sentence for each photo and a floor plan as well as one of the pages being more informational text along with a color photo.The author does a great service to FLW fans. Given that there have been so many books published regarding his works, one could have asked, what was not yet available. This was it, 3 page long full page drawings. An absolute delight. I'm generally stingy with 5 star ratings but this gives something that was missing that could only be presented with size and this book delivers."},{"Title":"Heal Your Heart: The New Rice Diet Program for Reversing Heart Disease Through Nutrition, Exercise, and Spiritual Renewal","review":"If you are interested in living and eating well, this book is for you. Kitty lays out a scrumptious feast of foods, nutritional facts, and updated research on mind, body, and spirit for us to observe, nibble on, or devour hungrily. Because of the Rice Diet Program about which Kitty writes, I have lost 100 pounds of killing weight. My cholesterol went from 257 to 190 in ten months. My triglycerides went from 193 to 86-118. My HDL was raised; my LDL,lowered. My blood pressure was 160 over 95 and now averages 90 over 55. Kitty Rosati is a wonderful, caring, credentialed woman who has written a book that will influence your thinking and may change your life"},{"Title":"Heal Your Heart: The New Rice Diet Program for Reversing Heart Disease Through Nutrition, Exercise, and Spiritual Renewal","review":"&quot;Heal Your Heart&quot; is not your ordinary nutrition book. THe nutrition information also addresses hypertension, kidney disease ( the reason for the original Rice Diet from Duke University Medical Center) obesity and diabetes in addition to heart disease. The technical information is presented in a readable non-technical fashion to help motivate the reader to want to try the excellent recipes provided. Very helpful is the appendix which lists anotated information about products and the addresses to contact the suppliers. As an alumna of the program, I can vouch for the fact that the menu plans and food choices can improve health conditions and in many cases reverse the condition to normal. To enhance the useability of the text, it is recommended by this user to have the book spiral bound at a printing services company.

The recipes are simply delicious--I never have been able to bake bread before and have it turn out, but the whole wheat recipe here comes out beautifully and it's delicious. Some of my favorite recipes are the banana barley loaf, the lentil loaf, the oat pancakes and topping (I used apples rather than pears for the topping), the corn bread, the lentil soup, the marina and pasta sauces, the Indian Subzi. There are too many to name them all! And too, I use the advice in this book to convert older favorite recipes with unhealthy ingredients to heart healthy yet delicious alternatives. I love the approach too, with a focus on not only nutrition and fitness but also emotional and spiritual health-- I found that once I was used to not adding salt to food, and consistently followed the advice in the book, I no longer craved foods as I used to, achieved my target weight, and felt better than I ever had in my life. I have never had heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, but all are very prevalent in my family. I wanted to do something to lose weight and to keep myself fit.

Helped me lower my high blood pressure without use of medication. I will highly recommended the book"},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"I think I can count on one hand the number of lesbian romances that deal with an interracial relationship, and this is one of them. I think the writer should be congratulated for an excellent depiction of the casual racism that Asians receive. Shay, who was born in the US, is told her English is excellent, for example. I have always thought that when reviewing a book, it's best to review the book you read, not the book you wished the author had written, and to rank that book for itself. I loved this book for what it delivered: a solid, intriguing romance between a closeted white accountant and a Japanese-American environmental biologist.Even rarer, this book deals with class differences. Shay is near penniless, though well-educated, and digs sampling wells on an oil refinery. Anthea is rolling in dough she inherited from distant parents. Each woman has real issues about money and it's dealt with in a complex way -- no easy fixes here.Last, I'd add that anyone wanting to see the totality of Kallmaker's ethnic diversity needs to read *all* of her books, including those written as Laura Adams. Night Vision and The Dawning have both black and native American characters who contribute vitally to the action. The Dawning's immersion in the Navajo culture was illuminating."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"I do wonder why people read books by writers they don't like. I enjoy all of Ms. Kallmaker's books. They are heartfelt romance novels, not Lesbian American studies. Car Pool was first and foremost a romance with a closeup focus on racism that one woman experiences on the job. They also have class differences. There's a little mystery thrown in and as always in a Kallmaker book, great sex. I was pulling for Shay and Anthea every step of the way, and for their gay male friends, Adrian and Harold. The scene in the bar where &quot;the difference between gay men and lesbians&quot; is discussed had me howling with laughter."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"This is one of the last of Karin Kallmaker's early books that I've been longing to read, and finally it has been reprinted. I never thought I would find a story set in part on an oil refinery in any way absorbing, but as usual I went along for the ride in Car Pool and the journey was well worth all the shifts in speed along the way.Anthea is wealthy but still working. Shay, on the other hand, like most of us, must work. She needs two jobs just to keep it together. Each of them treats the other like a stereotype, but that car pool means they slowly have to get to know more than what they see on the surface. That they are both lesbians comes as a surprise to each woman, because of the stereotypes they have been entertaining.Once Anthea sees outside the closet, and once Shay gets over some of the bitterness of her father's death, they find life a whole lot easier, and enjoying each other's company more and more. Their two gay male friends provide a wonderful counterpoint to the slow pace Anthea and Shay take.There is a mystery on the oil refinery - a setting that is wonderfully conveyed. I never want to see one for myself now! I like how the women work together to try to get all the dirt they can and how Shay is finally able to prove wrongdoing. The final work scene with Anthea and her racist, homophobic boss is incredibly SATISFYING.Readers who are just now discovering this early work should treat themselves to the follow up story in Frosting on the Cake about Anthea and Shay, Harold and Adrian, trying to become a very modern 21st century family. It's hilarious *and* heartwarming.My only regret in devouring this book the moment it arrived is that I am now have so few Karin Kallmaker books left to read!"},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"I read the author's Frosting on the Cake and found that a character in this book was an Asian American lesbian. It is so rare that I had to read the novel that inspired that short story. This was a great read and I think thatthe author, who I assume is white, did a good job portraying the struggles of an Asian American lesbian. I would love to meet this character sometime! But based on the short story it seems she's in a happy relationship. (grin) Some people might wish that the character was not Asian but I for one am glad that the author choose to do it."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"This book was really great. It was funny and light but there was some serious stuff too. Racism and class differences. There was a lot of reasons for the two women *not* to get together, but they work them out. It was also really terrific to have one woman be Asian American, realistically so. I really identified. I don't usually read romances because they don't touch me, but I'm glad a friend turned me on to this one."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"I enjoyed this book beginning toend. The author does a great job at bringing us right inside the characters' jobs and their hopes and dreams. They have whole lives. Friends to worry about, bills to pay and pasts that are painful to simply live with. Lovers have treated them badly, bosses are sometimes racist jerks and it's hard to quit smoking when you're commuting 3 hours a day. It was like I'd been there and both Anthea and Shay were friends I knew. I only wish I had their happy ending."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"This book is riddled with racial slurs, sexism, and homophobia. These attitudes are not a reflection on Kallmaker, but are necessary to tell this compelling story of interracial lesbian love.Anthea Rossignole works in the accounting department at an oil refinery. She comes from old money and is financially secure. However, she subjects herself daily to a sexist, condescending, homophobic boss who doesn't have a clue. The worst part is the entire company seems to be populated with men just like her boss. To top things off, Anthea's long-time live-in girlfriend has an affair with another woman in their car pool. Anthea breaks things off, kicks her lover out, and looks for a new car pool.Shay Sumoto, an Asian-American who has just lost her father to lung cancer, has also lost her only source of income as a geologist and is knee deep in debt from his hospital bills. She goes against everything she believes in and takes a job working for the refinery. It is there that she meets the seemingly-pretentious Anthea.After breaking through their barriers, these two women discover new love and begin to work through their painful pasts. In the meantime, Anthea helps Shay uncover and report illegal activities by their employer. They do this not out of revenge for their treatment, but because they want to do the right thing.This book was first published in 1993. It amazes me that these attitudes still existed then. It amazes me even more that they still exist today - although they generally are hidden and denied in polite society. Read this book, get angry, fall in love with Shay and Anthea, become a bigger Kallmaker fan."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"I am an avid reader of lesbian fiction ,book seller and writer.

I have always been a fan of Kallmaker's, and this particular novel ranks among those that I would pass along to my friends.

How about reading what is actually written rather than injecting some sort of political correctness? Like others have said, these two women could live next door. If they did you'd want to know them, you'd want to learn from them how to talk about tough issues and still laugh like children. The love scenes are steamy and the light mystery behind the story quite engrossing. I for one like detail when people have careers I know nothing about. There's an oil refinery not far from where I live and now I know lots more about it than I did before. A great read!"},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"Karin Kallmaker is one of the best lesbian authors on the market. Car Pool did not disappoint me at all.

Get it, it's fun."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"This was a pretty good book, but not the best I've read. It centers around an upper class woman and a lower-class woman who work at the same company. They fall for each other (of course) but find many obstacles in the way to their happiness. They find something important at work and prepare to be the whistle blowers. This was written in a different time, in the 90s, when people were just starting to come out en mass. The time period the book is written in is very important to the story line. Overall, it was a good book. It isn't something I'd buy again if given the choice, but it isn't something I'm going to get rid of, either."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"This novel was worth reading if only for the first chapter. By the end of the chapter you are totally invested in the two main characters and feel you want to meet them as real people. The scene where Anthea confronts Lois is simply and amazingly real. I really admire the characters and how they deal with the hardships and delights that life throws at them. It also has the best written gay males (friends of the two main characters) in any lesbian romance I have read.I love how the characters confront a workplace bigot - it was really well written (I just wish I was there to see it and hope other authors include a dose of such realism when appropriate).The love scenes are delectable and so well written you wish the novel was longer. They advance the story perfectly and illustrate the characters as dialogue never can. Liberally laced thoughout the novel is delightful humor. The scene illustrating the need for good kitchen hygiene will never be forgotten.This novel is a keeper you will read againI can't wait to read the short story sequel in the author's anthology 'Frosting On The Cake'"},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"This book is the one that hooked me on Karin Kallmaker.

I've never met my Anthea, but I'm looking under every rock for her!"},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"I agree with reviewer Jane's ire concerning Ms. Kallmaker'sliterary focus. Personally, I read Ms. Kallmaker's work because shedoes have a gift for prose. In Car Pool, she makes her characterstotally believable and their situations plausible. I have given herthe benefit of the doubt in the past; reading her stories voraciously;hoping her genre would become a bit more ethnically inclusive. Thelesbian character in Car Pool who is an Asian American is a fairstart. Unfortunately, black lesbians have (at worst) been absentor... at best, been marginalized in Ms.Kallmaker's writings. It isbeyond belief how such an obvious talent can also be so narrow andbackward in her thinking. I wonder if she has any black friends (gayor otherwise)."},{"Title":"Car Pool","review":"Carpool was disappointing. I am not thrilled with Ms. Kallmaker's character choices. Why? They offer no ethnic diversity. Why, what do you mean? One of the main characters is Asian...surely this is an effort at diversity in Karin's writing? True, but, frankly, she could just as well have been a Black lesbian...perhaps the HARDER choice for Ms. Kallmaker who is probably aware that a large percentage of her audience consists of white lesbians. It seems that the lives and the presences of black lesbians are never treated in any of Ms. Kallmaker's writings...except for a minor appearance by some big breasted, Mammie-type,women's shelter worker in Touchwood...whom the lead character, Rayanne Germaine, promptly wanted suckling or something from...okay? Plantation flash-back... Anyhoos, Carpool was a let-down."},{"Title":"Illustrator's Reference Manual: Children","review":"If you're an artist looking for a volume filled with photo references with kids but can't afford the rare and expensive Fairburn books, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Illustrator's Reference Manual: Children","review":"This book is filled with a lot of images, but I didn't give it five stars because of the definition of a lot of the images is difficult to make out. As an illustrator I don't just want body angles but need some definition in the lines. This would have been particularly helpful when it comes to the clothing. It seems like they tried to cram too much into one page.

The story picks up at the end of that era. A small group of \\"people\\", sheltered for thousands of years, exit their shelter at the end of the ice age to create a new world.Sounds great, but things really ground to a halt about 200 pages in. Is this a soap opera? A philosophical exploration? A \\"lost civilization\\" story? An adventure? The book is not sure. Had it chosen its course and stayed there, I would have loved the ride. Instead, I found myself wanting more from this book.Silverberg's premise is good enough, but the story didn't feel as if it actually went anywhere. Excellent and well done characters, good world-building, but no sense of urgency or movement to the story. Silverberg plays with some philosophical concepts, but he just doesn't do it very well. And the end was very anti-climactic and unsatisfactory. After reading several good Silverberg's, he may have just handed me my first dud (or semi-dud; the writing was very strong) in a long streak of pretty enjoyable books.I wanted to like this. I really did. The characters and concepts were simply brilliant; the world building fantastic. But in the end it was just, \\"eh.\\""},{"Title":"AT WINTER'S END.","review":"One my pet peeves (& yes, I am peevish) in a science fiction novel is when the book prefaces itself with a quotation from some kind of prophecy/historic text written from the future/news article which delivers the backstory that the reader is going to need to enjoy the book. It can be used well as a device-- mostly when it delivers atmosphere instead of information. But to my mind it generally represents sloppy plotting or an overly intrusive editor.Anyhow. At Winter's End begins with just such a preface, and it put me in the mind to be irritated. Also, while Silverberg is one of my long-term favorite authors in the genre, I'm well aware that his work can often be uneven. There were also a couple of seemingly predictable elements in the first part of the book-- tribes, rules, long history, dream dreamers-- bla bla bla. So I was kind of expecting not to like the book very much.But, you know, in the end I did. It grew on me by moments, until by the end I really had a difficult time to put it down. It starts off in one very typical way, and seems to end up as something else again. Silverberg doesn't give himself an easy way out-- no easy quests, no Great Lord of Darkness to slay. It becomes a little book about being human and about starting again. The world building is very good, and I liked it very much.I noticed with amusement that many of the reviewers of this book had exactly the opposite journey. They were very happy with the beginning when they thought it would be a more typical book, but became annoyed when it started to meander and became more philosophical. Consider both points of view if weighing this as a purchase."},{"Title":"AT WINTER'S END.","review":"At Winter's End, by Robert Silverberg, is a science fiction story about a tribe of apelike, but intelligent beings, who call themselves humans. After seven hundred thousand years, they leave the cocoon that their ancestors built in the depths of a vast mountainside for shelter from the great death stars and freezing winter. Their leader, Koshmar, leads them on a dangerous journey to a city called Vengiboneeza. While they are there, they discover many objects and clues to the past. They eventually follow, when ten of their tribe, led by the warrior Harruel, decide it is their destiny to start their own city. This is the beginning of a new life in a new place.The main characters of this book are Koshmar, the chief, Hresh, the young chronicler, Toryli, the offering woman, and the warriors, Harruel and Konya. Koshmar is a kind but stern leader who is adamant about leaving the cocoon when the time is correct. She leads them to Vengiboneeza. Hresh, a boy of nine years, becomes chronicler after the preceding old man, Thaggoran, died from a wolf attack. Toryli is the kind woman who gave the daily offering to the outside world back in the cocoon, and is like a mother to the growing tribe. She provides warmth and love to all who are in need. The warriors, Harruel and Konya aren't the only warriors, but they take part in most of the scenes. Harruel is a burly, massive, towering man who eventually turns away from the tribe with ten others to start his own city. His ferocious fighting spirt makes him the head of the warriors. Konya is Harruel's friend, and follows Harruel when he leads the tribe away. Unlike him, he has a lean, but strong figure, and has earned second rank in power.I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, and a little mystery and science fiction. It sets forth thought-provoking ideas, such as a second sight, gods, and contacting the spirit realm, to enhance the experience and make this book a must read for all adventure and science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"AT WINTER'S END.","review":"This fairly recent offering shows Silverberg's skill at combining a gripping plot and sympathetic characters, even if it does seem at first to be a re-run of Planet of the Apes. Excellent descriptive passages of a ruined city in an America following a 700,000 year long ice-age created by bombarding comets. The plot has many twists before the happy ending. Has echoes of the Gilgamesh novel which is better."},{"Title":"AT WINTER'S END.","review":"There are no humans in this. It is about enhanced apes who have been given the planet earth after 800,000 years of ecological collapse. The climate is about change and the natural curiosity of the protagonist, which almost earned him death in the face of conservatism, is suddenly found to be useful. How conservatism is transformed from a critical survival trait to a major impediment when times change is a key aspect of this book. So is the power of curiosity and the courage of conviction to find a place in the new \\"evolving world\\".

I read it many years ago, in junior high I believe, which seems not so long ago, but I haven't read it since. As soon as I find a copy to buy though, I plan on devouring the story word by word. Of all the books I have read, Silverberg's tale of a far-future earth has stuck with me, never fading as so many books and their plots often do. This is classic SF written by one of the masters in the genre. I recommend this to anyone searching for a great adventure and not wanting to be bogged down in a long drawn out series, i.e. Hubbard's Mission Earth, or Jordan's Wheel of Time, or perhaps to make the wait between installments not so agonizing, i.e. George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire or the Dune prequels by Kevin J. Anderson and David Herbert, two current obsessions of mine. Also try Silverberg's Lord Valentine books, those are classics as well, and worthy reads for any fantasist looking for someplace better to be, if only for a little while."},{"Title":"AT WINTER'S END.","review":"Let me say before I start this interview that I LOATH sci-fi or fantasy that involves talking monkies, apes, or animalistic humanoids in general. Silverberg, the literary master that he is, presents his characters in terms of who they are first, then much later their physicality. The entire book was fresh and innovative. After I was done it left me wanting much more. Not more from the story but more pages to devour.The other thing I LOATH about sci-fi or fantasy are when authors bury us in consonant heavy, made up names.

This is one of the best of his later works, a spellbinding and engrossing novel that transports to the reader to an alien world.

Pinto-Correia mixes a bit of humor with a pleasant writing style, lots of relevant history and geography, and a sad shake of her head about how rapacious humans are.It was a marvelously heady period in Europe's awakening after intellectual dark days and Pinto-Correia gives the reader a sense of that emergence. On one level the dodo is a symbol of an eden found and lost on three small islands along the way to spices and riches. In their rush to gather spices, riches and glory men plundered these islands and left them poorer - the islands' inhabitants were decimated and became fearful, the men did not realize what a treasure they had found.The reader can assign other levels to the story as Pinto-Correia unfolds it. Science came into its own during these centuries, and the dodo's discovery and extinction is a grand example of the days when alchemy gave way to chemistry and astrology became astronomy. Natural history developed as well, with taxonomy seemingly in the forefront. The dodo was classified and plunged into first one species then another, had little to prove that it even existed, finally was declared extinct - all in less than 100 years.Pinto-Correia packs information about the hapless bird and the European humans of the era into this book. The reader learns painlessly while realizing this is a learning experience.For this reader Return of the Crazy Bird is a grand vacation read, easy to pick up and put down without losing the thread of the story."},{"Title":"Return of the Crazy Bird: The Sad, Strange Tale of the Dodo","review":"This book pales having arrived just after E. Fuller's recent book \\"The Dodo from extinction to icon (UK)\\". From a scholarly vantage it fails utterly.Firstly the book is quite parochial dwelling at great length on issues very distant from the dodo such as Portuguese navigation and ignoring the fact that the dodo was painted in India completely. The book makes extraordinary claims like \\"Why do we know so much about what the dodo looked like?\\" when the text itself makes clear we know very little and makes tremendous claims on behalf of R. Savery, (a relatively poor artist of animals) in the context of his contribution to Western art - why. The best thing about Savery was he did several pictures of the dodo unlike many other artists though Savery's dodos cannot be trusted for accuracy.Most of the facts in the book such as the numbers of dodo's that arrived in Europe or how much contact R. Savery had with the dodo are either speculative or from doubtful sources. Though references are copious, some important references are not taken up and there is an over reliance on secondary sources. Much of the content it must be said is therefore presumptious.There are some new translations such as descriptions by Clusius on the dodo's head, but there is little primary material of relevance in a critical style on the dodo itself.As a celebration of the iconic place of the dodo and the history of the period and the Mascarenes this book has some claims, but you'd be better off reading Fuller. As there are so few good books on the Dodo I think this book is a reasonable start and the author has written it with enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Return of the Crazy Bird: The Sad, Strange Tale of the Dodo","review":"At a young age, the author Clara Pinto-Correia heard about the long extinct dodo and became fascinated by the bird's fate. The end result is a well-researched and well-written text that takes the reader from the shores of Europe to a small chain of islands where the dodo and it's genetic cousins made their homes.Sadly, the dodo and it's genetic cousins were doomed to extinction with the arrival of Europeans (starting with the Portuguese). The plump, flightless animals were slow breeders with a single offspring per mating season and no natural enemies. Add ravenous creatures (Homo sapiens included) into their safe mircosphere and diaster was assured.Pinto-Correia traces the few captive dodos in Euorpe and the fates of their remains. Now, the only things the modern world has of the dodo are a scattering of bones, some paintings and sketches and the cultural understanding that to be a dodo is to be doomed.A must read for the natural history reader or devotee."},{"Title":"Return of the Crazy Bird: The Sad, Strange Tale of the Dodo","review":"I have read a lot on the dodo, but I'm afraid this wasn't one of the better books. Half of the book is not actually about dodos but deals with Portugese and Dutch shipping and history - the dodo isn't really mentioned in depth until a few chapters in, and then it is faffed about with and dragged out on very little information. Sadly disappointing as there are so few resources on the topic, but perhaps of interest to people who aren't so keen on the dodo details. As above, I would recommend Fuller or even Strickland."},{"Title":"Ariadne's Web ( Book of the Gods, Vol. II )","review":"The beginning is a little slow and at times it seems it takes many pages for anything exciting to happen, but its still a good book overall.

But the 2nd installment was too confined for way too long and I found myself wondering if I was even reading the same author that I know and love for many years. But I hung in there and it got better but just not great. When he writes about a person changing into a god and mixing with all of the others, thats when he's at his best and its real interesting.

There are the derivatives guys (options sell side & risk hedgers), and the 'statistical arbitrage' guys. This is one of the best books for a larval 'statistical arbitrage' guy. 'Statistical arbitrage' is a term referring to the techniques used by sophisticated hedge funds and trading desks to provide 'risk free' returns. I stick in the scare quotes around these phrases, because they're not really arbitrage, though they can be pretty decoupled from market returns. The techniques go well beyond just trading pairs, so the phrase, 'stat arb' is probably with us for good, even though it is often neither stat nor arb. The mean reverting versions of these techniques were largely invented by Nunzio Tartaglia and company (primarily Gerry Bamberger according to Thorp) at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. Many of his underlings went on to found their own hedge funds, and the secret eventually became relatively common knowledge. Boesky was one of the more famous practitioners of merger arbitrage, which is an older, related technique.This book is a fun introduction to 'statistical arbitrage,' concentrating on the standard \\"mean reverting pairs\\" variety, and a decent explanation of merger arbitrage which he unifies with mean reverting stat arb in an interesting way. These two strategies still form the basis of a large number of high frequency techniques in one form or another. In fact, the book provides enough background material to be useful for all kinds of techniques for finding alpha; it has a very clear treatment of factor models, time series analysis (best low level one I have ever read, anywhere) and what market neutrality is and isn't. He provides a decent amount of discussion of the complexities surrounding tradeability and other practical issues that get swept under the rug in most books.Sure, there are a lot of specific 'stat arb' techniques he doesn't mention explicitly. He doesn't talk about basket trading plays, index arbitrage, volatility arbitrage or any of the other myriad clever (and often over my head) techniques used by sophisticated fund managers to vacuum up loose change that dumb people leave on the street. So what? Vidyamurthy gives you enough material you can go out and learn the practical details of real strategies on your own. If you're gifted enough, you can go figure them out (and more) for yourself once you understand the material in the book: they're mostly variations on these themes. Why should Vidyamurthy give away the keys to the kingdom for $100? Be happy he wrote the book at all. Presumably, he makes a living actually doing 'stat arb' type things, and his motivation was to have a book to give to his underlings so he didn't have to explain GARCH and cointegration to someone who breathes out of his mouth for the 9,000th time.Anyone who can't read this book simply doesn't have the intellectual horsepower or attention span to do this kind of trading. The book is almost excruciatingly clear, it is very short, and even does the MBA's the favor of tucking the scary mathematics involving matrices and standard deviations safely away in chapter appendices. I mean, it even has cartoons and funny anecdotes (which are actually very funny: I detect a Wodehouse fan in Vidyamurthy). You have to actually pay attention while you read, and some sections, you may have to read twice. The concepts will not leap off the page and embed themselves into your frontal lobes, but it really isn't that difficult for any intelligent person to understand. I can think of no better introduction to pairs trading, or general alpha quant type stuff than this book. It should probably be on every wannabe quant or trader's desk if it isn't already etched into the fiber of their being."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"I totally have to disagree with the first reviewer. I would rather say the opposite: the book is mathematically too simple in many places. But on the other hand it is not a statistics book. The book tries to explain complicated matters in a simple way. If you have no idea about stochastic processes, ARIMA-models, cointegration, stationarity,... then this book might not be the right one for you. But honestly: then pairs trading might not be the right thing for you either. Pairs trading is based on statistical concepts. This book only gives a brief idea of what statistical concepts are of use for pairs trading and how to apply them. If you really want to go into pairs trading, you will have to get much deeper into statistics then then this book does or can do. In my opinion the book does a brilliant job in giving you a link between statistical models, pairs trading and financial models (like the APT). I also bought the book \\"Trading Pairs\\" by Mark Whistler, and I must say i was rather disappointed, as, to my opinion, the book does not tell you what pairs trading is really about, but the book by Ganapathy Vidyamurthy does."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"This book is small and has around 200 pages with very large font. The math is very simple to follow compared with most of the other quantitative finance books out there. In the beggining of my masters program I thought that statistics was nothing more than mumbo jumbo (as I assumed that the way to succeed in finance was via probability theory, numerical analysis, stochastic calculus, and PDE's). Overall, this book changed my outlook on statistics and how analyzing time series accurately via statistics can help you put together a good trading strategy. Please note that this book is a short refresher and only provides the reader with new ideas. I don't think that if anyone had a succesful trading strategy they would be disclosing their recipes and algorithms in a book."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"I was looking for books on stat arb and risk arb and was surprised that not many titles showed up for my search on Amazon. I eventually bought this book (a used copy) and although the book covers exactly the kind of stuff you want to learn about pairs trading, the writing is very poor and there are way too many places where the sentences don't make any sense, regardless of your math/stat background. This book is not a how-to book. It's a general treatise and not a good one at that. I cannot recommend this book. You may want to check out Tsay's financial time series analysis book which, although not specifically for pairs trading, has all the essential materials."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"Opening the book on a random page (p. 14) and seeing it call Norbert Wiener \\"Nobert Weiner\\", then get wrong the covariance formula, was a bit in-your-face even for Wiley Finance. Some of my expectations were confirmed - a practitioner author with limited time and writing experience, and no editorial assistance; padding, confused/confusing language, etc. - nonetheless, I found \\"Pairs Trading\\" intelligent and thought-provoking.The core Part II, \\"Statistical Arbitrage Pairs\\" [sic] focuses on cointegration between logs of prices: according to the author, an arbitrage opportunity is present when ln(Px) - gamma*ln(Py), for some gamma, is stationary; or, loosely, when ln(Px) and ln(Py) share a common trend. In Chapter 6, (unobserved) innovations in that trend are identified (conflated? consider the required properties of the residual in the two decompositions) with returns predicted by a factor model, and a cointegration coefficient is obtained by regressing X's factor returns on Y's, or vice versa. (On p. 108, the author acknowledges the alternative of regressing ln(Px) on ln(Py), and, surprisingly, nods to measurement-error issues as a reason to pass on this option; I would have thought that working with *estimated* factor returns might face that problem too). To me, this suggests that unless estimated factor returns of X and Y happen to be uncorrelated, the author considers log prices of X and Y to be cointegrated; one searches in vain for discussion of cointegration tests. (Ditto unit-root tests. Leaving statistics aside, factor-model design and estimation looks like an important component of the approach - and is addressed with a half-page-long digest of something the author read in Grinold and Kahn). In Chapter 7, the author revisits the stationarity requirement, mis-identifies stationarity with mean reversion, holds out but never shares a relevant theoretical result (Rice formula?), instead shooting own credibility with a wrong argument/calculation. (I am eager to see code that follows the description on p. 120 and reproduces the plots on p. 121). Sensible points, poor follow-up.Reader beware. The author is normally saying sensible things, but you want to be careful checking his logic. Overall, an imperfect but worthwhile book.PS. Appropriately, Economist's Buffett Test (Google it) gives mixed results: it's \\"Buffet\\" in the text (p. 182) and \\"Buffett\\" in the index."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"This book is for the analytically inclined and only for the analytically inclined. It's perfectly suitable for wanna-be quants (possible engineering or science graduates) who want to familirize themselves with techniques of quantitative finance.The book contains excellent pointers to well known references and sources in this area, and can provide a suitable starting point (+ it provides very valuable intuitions on how to relate abstract math concepts to trading). I thought it's much more readable than a more established reference \\"Active Portfolio Management\\".The author does an admirable job of surveying scientific subjects relevant, and central, to pairs trading. But, it's hard to say he's an expert in all of them. He misses the mark a couple of times, notably in the section on Kalman filtering with regard to standard terminology in this area.The book almost shines as a quant/trading book---again only for those with sufficient math/signal processing/systems theory background and for those willing to learn deeper from references."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"It gives you a decent idea of the technical and mathematical issuesinvolved in pairs trading - statistical arbitrage and takeover arbitrage.Some of the math explanations are weak -- he doesn't tellthe whole story, sort of fuzzes it up.

The book provides very good introduction of statistical arbitrage and risk arbitrage. Easy to read and you can get useful information."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"Totally agree with Dr. Bruhn. The book keeps mathematics to a minimum, simply reviewing a collection of time series analysis techniques and putting those into a trading context. I can understand however that this might be a rather tedious read for someone who hasn't been exposed to statistics or time series analysis before.For someone who has the ambition to get on top of the material, I would recommend reading Chris Brooks's \\"Introductory econometrics for finance\\" first or as accompanying text. A quite easy and enjoyable read into time series analysis.I haven't looked into pairs trading before, but since I have taken a postgrad course in econometrics, all the concepts were familiar to me and partially covered in my course. I found the book to be a nice summary of what I had learned which might serve me well as a reference for the future.My conclusion is that this book is a nice, enjoyable read for someone with an econometric/ statistical background, but may be challenging (but certainly managable with good accompanying texts) for newbies."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"There are some interesting material in the book. Overall, I think it is worth the price (Kindle edition). However, there are some big holes in the book, and do not expect to start trading after reading the book! For example, I could not figure out what is the recommended number of samples to use for the algorithm that finds pairs? It prescribes using factor models to find pairs, but what is a good recommendation for factor parameters? After finding potential pairs, how long should you trade based on the cointegration relationship, i.e. how do you know the relation has broken down? How often should you re-calibrate the system? etc.There is no mention of the extensive statistical testing procedures already established for cointegration. There is not even a mention of the Johansen procedure for testing and identifying cointegration relationship. If those ideas do not apply to stocks, what is their shortcomings?There is a full chapter on Kalman filtering, but where is the application in the book?"},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"Very well written and easy to follow. The assumed background is that you have taken a statistics and linear algebra course. The book flows well from chapter to chapter, and a few cartoons never hurt in a technical book. Teaching inductively from simple examples to the most general case is highly underutilized by most authors in my opinion. This book does it well, and more books should follow that approach."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book: on the one hand it's a good overview of statistical and risk (merger) arbitrage. On the other, it is pretty shallow in terms of both practice and theory.It is certainly not possible to use it directly for trading (like any other published book, I guess). An example of a theoretical flaw is the dodgy usage of bootstrap methodology on pp 113-116. For the details, please see the \\"Research\\" section of my website (click on my name above).One more example when the idea itself is nice but the implementation is not: the author shows how to assess VaR for a pair of assets and doesn't seem to notice that the estimated probability of deal-break is risk-neutral, not physical probability and thus can not be directly used to estimate VaR which is tied to the physical probability distribution.There's a possibility, however, that these and other discrepancies are the result of the author's unwillingless to disclose too much. Indeed, they claim that Stat Arb died in 2004 or so, but there are still no books that disclose the trading strategy."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"This book covers only statistical methods, and only for two types of pairs trades:Merger \\"arbitrage\\" and spread \\"arbitrage\\". It gives an overview of some of the statistical methods which have emerged in various scientific areas in the last 40 years, but no discussion of why they would apply to the stock/options/futures markets, where the visible laws of physics and biology have been massively confounded by the overlay of human behavior and world events.If you are wondering how to pick a short list of industries or sectors or stocks as candidates for pairs trading, (Before you start measuring correlation, etc.), don't look here.On the other hand, if you are skimming for nuggets, there might well be enough to excuse the price and the time."},{"Title":"Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis (Wiley Finance)","review":"The reviewers up to this point have all made valid points.

I gave it three stars because eventhough I enjoyed it, I would not read it again or heartily recommend it.The setting:Captain Billy Port USMC is stationed in Shanghai China just prior to the outbreak of WW2. A Warning Of War is issued a week or so before Pearl Harbor is attacked, and the 4th Marines are withdrawn from diplomatic assignment in China. There is some difficulty though. Due to the vast size of China, and the short time period involved, detachments of Marines in North China cannot be quickly evacuated. So Capt. Port is assigned the almost impossible task of recovering these Marines.Capt. Port assembles his team of Marines and a few civilian hangers on and heads north as war with the japanese is declared. Now Capt. Port must locate and recover these detached Marines while evading the Japanese, mongol bandits and hostile warlords all the while surviving in an extremely cold and barren climate.Lots of good potential here!First off, the things I thought were really well done:I very much enjoyed James Brady's writing style. He was able to accurately potray Marines in violent decadent China without graphically overdoing the salacious details. This is a novel I would feel comfortable letting my early teenaged kids read. Mr. Brady also really imparts the feel of Mongolia and Northern China. The climate, terrain and people. The combat depictions were very well done also. All in all, excellent crafting of the written word.Historical time period. Being a former Marine who spent time in asia, I have been keenly interested in the China Marines. I was excited to find a novel using china as a backdrop for a story about Marines. There are few books that deal with pre war China. The only ones I have found are the first book of W.E.B. Griffin's The Corps series and McKenna's The Sand Pebbles. Unfortunatly, I was slightly disappointed. It seems Mr. Brady picked a few character pieces and plot lines from both works. A minor detail overall, but still detracts some from what could have been.Now to the stuff I wasn't crazy about:Characters. The main characters specifically. They were too formulaic and some really lacked developement. In some spots the author tries to develope other characters other than the main character Capt. Billy Port, but doesn't go far enough with it. My feeling is either develope them all, make a deeper story or just don't bother with it. Doing a halfway job of it just annoyed me.The role of a Top Sergeant....ughh. Mr.Brady flogged us about the head and shoulders with the duties and responsibilities of a First Sergeant. Nuff said on that...The story line. The story was very predictable. From the beginning it is apparent who is going to be pitted against who in the final ultimate showdown. Also, I thought the author missed out on some real potential for a great adventure type story because half of the book seemed to just be a lead up to the Marine's trek across China.Finally the ending. It was.....odd, I thought. I won't disclose any spoilers but it was not in character of the main character. I was disappointed by it. Left me with a \\"what the???\\" feeling.Overall, \\"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines\\" was a good fun read that missed a chance at being a great read.That's my review, worth every penny you paid for it."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"I really liked this novel as it covered another gray zone of our Military History.

It also gives the feeling & process about how a peacetime unit has to quickly convert to a war time mentality in order to survive & get the mission done. I just wish the Army would produce someone that could write as well.(With apologies to WEBB Griffin)"},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"While I would not call this the best book I ever read, it was certainly entertaining and kept my interest. A previous reviewer criticized inaccuracies which I did not find. First of all, the Flying Tigers did exist before the outbreak of the war (they were mercenaries--$500 a plane). Also, the book had ongoing updates via radio which were repeated to the Marines at the time. That is, the story provides information based on what was known at the time. Not corrected information provided 10 years after the war ended.Bottom line, I would recommend this book and have been happy with other Brady work in the past."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"The book is the story of a small group of Marines in China led by a young officer who escape through the &quot;back door&quot; just after Pearl Harbor.

Again, his book will probably disappoint military history buffs due to bad editing.Though I loved the story of Captain Port and his ad-hoc group struggling to get out of China, as a military history buff, I couldn't get past some of the glaring inaccuracies.Marine Officers' swords have never been strong enough to behead a man with one chop.Marine Infantry units didn't carry flamethrowers until well into 1943.Even fanatical 1st Sergeants will set aside uniform regulations to take care of their Marines.His intercepted radio reports talked about things happening in the weeks following Pearl Harbor that didn't really occur until well into 1942.Am I nitpicking? Probably. But if you're going to write a piece of historical fiction, then its crucial to get the facts straight. Even though its a great story, it lacks credibility because of these holes.

The story is of a detachment of Marines getting themselves and any other Marines they can get to join them out of China after war with Japan breaks out.Since there is nothing from the author about how much of this tale is true, I am assuming that much of it is fiction and thus the lower grade. Along with the Marines come fortuitous stragglers including a paleontologist who seemingly knows every inch of Mongolia - as well as the language There is also a White Russian prince who aids and abets the detachment when they get to Russia as well as teaching the Marines the handy dandy Molotov cocktail when it happens to be the perfect weapon.Thus the story seems contrived. Additionally, the star of the book, Captain Port, does something in the end of the book that does not fit the Marine's personality at all and truly seemed contrived.If I could believe more of this book were true, it would be much better in the truth stranger than fiction genre. As pure fiction, however, I found it lacking. There was some good background material about China and the times that made it more palatable and worth finishing. For those who, like me, loved Guns of Autumn, this was a major letdown."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"A novel, which challenges the reader to sift military fact from pure fiction. For instance, Captain Billy Port's \\"relentless pursuer\\" Colonel Jessie Irabu of the Imperial Japanese Marines lifted a .50 caliber machine gun from a downed Zero fighter, and mounted the gun on the hood of his scout car. The problem with that is the Japanese A6M Zero was not armed with .50 caliber machine guns, but two 20 MM cannons and two 7.7 MM machine guns. In contrast, the authors description of the 4th Marines marching out of Shanghai to leave China was well done."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"This is one of the worst examples of the war genre I have read. I spent almost 30 years in the military, and we were continuously taught to keep our writing at the 5th grade level so that everyone could understand. I think Mr. Brady took this to heart - repetition does not make good reading and the book seems to concentrate on making sure we understand what First Sergeant's do. The characters lack reality, and it appears the author is hoping to sell this work as a movie. I was completely disappointed, and find it hard to believe a senior Marine Corps General Officer endorsed this drivel."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"\\"Warning of War\\" which takes place pre-World War II, tells the story of a mission to round up all the Marines manning outposts in China. But is it \\"Fact, Fiction or Fantasy?\\" Brady does not answer this question leaving it for the reader to decide.FACT: Marines of the 4th Marines and the Legation Guard were stationed from Shanghai in the south to Peking in the north. Some shipped out to the Philippines, some were captured and spent the war as POWs and some may have been members of \\"Billy Port's Ride\\".FACT: The march of the 4th Marines through the streets of Shanghai, down Bubbling Well Road to the docks for boarding on the \\"Harrison\\" for transport to the Philippines happened.FACT: The actions of 2ndLT Huizanga and Chief Gunner William Lee also happened.FACT: LT. Huizanga, WO Lee, Col. Samuel Howard and Captain Jack White were \\"real\\" Marines stationed in China.FACT: There is no mention of this mission in any of the written histories of the Marine Corps nor is there any recording of this mission in the official records of the United States Marine Corps.FICTION: Is it within the realm of possibility that such a mission was formed to gather the far-flung pockets of Marines? Certainly. AND--FANTASY: Visions of being a part of an adventure such as this lives in the hearts of all who breathe adventure. So why not?James Brady weaves the mood and emotions of the times as did artist/author Col. John W. Thomason Jr.'s chronicles of the Chinaside Marines of the 1930s. Great tales recommended to readers of adventure. Brady uses words spiced with salty, macho language. Grand stuff used by those in positions of leadership in all walks of life.This story reads as a \\"National Geograhic\\" article with insightful, factual backgrond such as the detailed descriptions of the Legation at Peking, the Ritz Hotel in Boston, the gates of and The Great Wall with tour guide narration of the countryside for added flavor. The lesson in geography is worth the price of the book.As in his stories on the Hamptons the names of the famous (General \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, General Lewis \\"Chesty\\" Puller), the infamous (Pancho Villa, Rapputin), the rich (Prince Yusopov) and the ordinary (Dr. Han, Father Kean) appear throughout the story adding a degree of truth to the fantasy(?).\\"Warning of War\\" contains sidebars of love and romance which are related without the need for the micro details of sex crowding the litrature of today. Also four letter words are few and far between used only occasionally in the dialogues of these tough, salty and macho men. Col. Thomason also wrote in this antiseptic but welcome style.Approximately halfway into this fast-paced adventure tale the mood slows to a beautifully written scenario of Christmas as experienced by the members of \\"Billy Port's Ride\\". Carols, sincere holiday greetings, scenes of stars in the heavens pointing(?), all bringing a tug at the heart strings as good, or better, than any attempt at sentimentality written by the fantasy industry in California. This scenario brought pause to this reviewer's train of thought as he remmebered his Christmas in Korea, standing sentry duty, hearing Jo Stafford's rendition of \\"White Christmas\\" flow warmly over the newly fallen snow at his position. Memories, sad but mostly good.This \\"Smell the Roses\\" pace is quickly absorbed back into the rapid flow of the story.To those searching for history, read \\"Warning of War\\" for the love of adventure, not factual information. To all others, this fast-paced narrative may bring back memories and could provide you your own answer to the question presented by \\"Warning of War\\".Is it \\"Fact, Fiction, or Fantasy\\"? It could be nothing more than a reading of a great tale of high-spirited adventure.What more could you be looking for?"},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"James Brady has once again crafted a fine story and created some memorable characters based around little known historical events.Like his reluctant hero, Tom Verity, in the Marines of Autumn, Brady has conjured up another believable character in Billy Port. Captain Port's mission is to take a small detachment of Marines and some civilian hangers-on and make his way across the Gobi desert gathering up outlying Marine detachments. The War Warning is in the air and before they make their way to the Great Wall of China, their comrades of the 4th Marines have fallen captive to the Japanese war machine. Port and his men realize they are alone and cut off.This is a wonderfully paced story, with a lot of detail and insider descriptions. Brady really knows his stuff. You get the sense of the Chinese countryside, the interplay between all of the forces warring on each other \\"out there' on the other side of the Great Wall. But above all, you feel as if you are one of the \\"China Hands\\"; the feeling of total abandonment these guys must have felt, but above all the feeling to press on and continue in the Marine Corp way.There are quick flashes of Griffin's Killer McCoy and his exploits in China and a lot of parallels to McKenna's the Sand Pebbles. But ultimately this book stands on it's own as a great record of a little known time and place in the big picture of WWII.That is where I think Brady has excelled, he is able to personalize a small moment in history and surround it with momentous world events. He also highlights the professionalism and pride of the Marines that fall into this situations and as in The Marines of Autumn, shows the almost mystical relation between company grade officers and their NCO's.Semper Fi!"},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"James Brady has always struck me as a novelist who routinely hits stand up doubles or even triples, if not long-ball home runs. His latest \\"Warning of War\\" is no exception with compelling insight into the psyche of American Warrior Marines, and with more than enough accurate documentation to make the relatively few historical errors confusing.Did a Captain Billy Port and a platoon of China Marines really make a ride through North China and Mongolia towards an imagined Siberian sanctuary during the opening of WW2? Or is the book just an artful work of \\"alternative history?\\" Who knows? As Judge Roy Bean reportedly said, \\"If it didn't happen, then it should have.\\" Either way, it's a fine summer read, and I enjoyed every minute of it.For those of us former \\"Navy Pukes\\" who spent a few years attached to the Marines in the WESTPAC (even sometimes embraced as being \\"almost good enough to be a Marine\\"), the story rings true enough.Thanks, Mr. Brady, for another fine novel. Keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"There's a lot of Ken McCoy, if you're familiar with W.E.B. Griffin's \\"Semper Fi\\" series, in Captain Billy Port, U.S.M.C. They're are both 'China Marines,' underscoring the presence of an American Infantry force in China that in the summer and fall of 1941, had been in Asia since the turn of the 20th century. They both are encouraged by a strong sense of honor or fidelity, have expensive tastes, high intelligence, and have earned the respect of hard men. I am reminded of Orwell's comments that we who are bathed in the warmth of freedom, sleep well because there are 'hard men' who guard our gates. Billy Port, trapped behind enemy lines by the whims of the Japanese government having selected December 7 to bomb Pearl Harbor, doomed by his own sense of honor, recognizing that the only chance he has for himself and his men is to advance smartly in the opposite direction toward Russia, is one of those men.I thoroughly enjoyed the novel. It is a novel, we have to remember, although things like that surely happened. Perhaps there was a Billy Port. There certainly were White Russians, Jewish intellectuals, French dilettantes, beautiful courtesans, Mongolian bandits and the above mentioned Marines trying to get the heck out of Dodge when Pearl Harbor happened.Brady, who himself is not unfamiliar with winter in that part of the world, having spent a cold year in the Marine Corps in Korea 9 years after the events described in Warning of War, does an above average job in making the reader 'feel the cold.'You might want to pick up \\"The Coldest War,\\" Brady's auto-biographical account of his year in the infantry in Korea in 1950-51.Additionally, I believe the style of the infantry officer, his concern for men, his focus in times of battle, his remorse for losses, brief but heartfelt, is well reported. At one point Captain Port arises at 2 in the morning to walk the perimeter in 18 below zero weather. He stops and talks to the men on watch, saying a few words to each of them, spending a moment with them. He does that, he tells us, because 'that's what combat officers do. Let the men know that you're willing to spend time with them when it's damn cold.'Despite the tale revolving around the character of this infantry officer, this is really a tale of an event. Billy Port is the central piece of the puzzle, but it's a well crafted story of an escape from the great shadow of war by an odd crew of individuals cast, inadvertantly, behind enemy lines. Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"This novel surprised me from start to finish. Its rare that one finds so many elements of a great novel within the pages of a single book. Warning of War is well written and so detailed, it could easily pass for non-fiction if the reader wasn't aware that it was a novel.The characters are well developed, believable, and true-to-life. Federales is a great example of a 1940's era marine squad leader and 'Top,' the link between Port and the enlisted men, adds perspective, especially to the battle scenes. Another great character is the priest, dubbed 'padre' by the marines. There are many fine characters in this novel but they are all distinguishable and unique, a testament to the author's skill in writing.This novel is entertaining. It is poignant at times and violent at others. Readers will not be disappointed..."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"If as the author has said, that this is a true story, then we should Honor the men of this story. They are true heros.If Hollywood doesn't make a movie out of this one, they are even worse then nuts! History is full of stories of unknown heros, and thier fights, I love these stories, Keep em comming!"},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"If an author is going to write military fiction, it should be assumed that the readers who pick up their book have more than a passing interest in military history. And that's the problem here. Once again, I want to stress that I realize that this is a novel, but Brady insists on inserting real characters and locations and so it is jarring when inaccuracies occur.For example, he has Captain Billy Port, the derring-do hero, ask about air cover for his intrepid band of Marines as they embark on their mission. You guessed it. The Flying Tigers are mentioned (after all, the setting is China and everyone is familiar with Chennault's fliers) and their reputation for fighting discussed -- in spite of the fact that the Flying Tigers were not operational until after the outbreak of war. Further, having been stationed in Shanghai, Port should have known about the lack of available air cover. There are other errors too as he tries to broadbrush the early war in the Pacific. His mentioning other battlefronts like Singapore, the Phillipines and Wake Island is both gratuitous and frequently wrong as he misrepresents what happened there. Doesn't anyone edit for facts anymore?The story also plods in the middle. Oh, there are occasional fire fights, strafings and run-ins with bandit warlords. But there are far too many stock characters. This novel has the plot of a B-movie or a Saturday matinee serial, albeit a shambling one. I have to admit though, Port's unexpected decapitation of a warlord is a nice scene and good touch to highlight that, as Chesty Puller allegedly said of Port, he is a &quot;good killer.&quot;I have no doubt that this book will sell well and, who knows, might even become a movie. If it does, the script will need some doctoring up. Brady wrote an excellent Korean War memoir and I recommend it. However, he should leave fiction alone. Of course, the fault my be mine. I have a tremendous respect for the Marines and their exploits and to see them lackadaisically treated, even in fiction and by one of their own no less, offends me.One last issue. The book jacket contains a blurb by Dan Rather (yes, that Dan Rather), who compares the novel to something by Hemingway or Clancy. It is painfully clear that Rather has read neither of those authors! The only similarities that I can find is that printed words are used to tell the story and both of the aforementioned authors wrote novels too. Come to think of it, maybe that's what he meant... Surely he wasn't comparing style or pace."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"Warning of WarA Novel of the North China MarinesByJames BradyThere is a legend within the United States Marine Corps named \\" Billy Port's Ride\\". As many legends, it has the distinct ring of truth. There are some known facts. One, there was World War II, two, there were Marines stationed in Shanghai, China at the outbreak of the war. Third, there was a \\"Billy Port\\" who had served under the command of then Major Lewis B. \\"Chesty\\" Puller in Nicaragua. Billy's full name was Captain William Hamilton Thomas \\"Billy\\" Port. James Brady has written a novel around this story that leaves you believing this legend is more than a \\"story\\".Stationed in Shanghai, China leading up to WWII, Billy, apparently, was a colorful character, enjoying his status in Shanghai as an unmarried Marine, a commanding officer, and as someone from a Bostonian family of means. Billy enjoyed a lifestyle, supported by his civilian money and fostered by the pre-war atmosphere of Shanghai, the Imperial Hotel (a favorite hangout of Russian expatriates), and beautiful Chinese and Russian women.In November 1941 an official \\"War Warning\\" had been issued and the Marines in Shanghai were preparing to evacuate by sea. Billy, evidently, was ordered to take a small group of Marines and head out to the hinterlands of China. Their mission was to gather up the Marines who were on assignment outside of Shanghai (in northern China), thus out of communication and not aware of the \\"War Warning\\". Billy's party left Shanghai on or about December 1, 1941. From Shanghai, Billy and his small contingent sailed on a commercial freighter to Tsingtao, then on to Tientsin. From Tientsin they traveled by rail to Peking (modern day Beijing), then began traveling by truck. They headed North from Peking early the morning of December 7, 1941, hours before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Along the way they were able to gather up some of the Marines they were searching for and were making a beeline for Russia (an ally at the time) to escape the Japanese. Their trip took them through northern China, the Gobi desert in Mongolia and to the Russian border somewhere south or southeast of Lake Baikal in Russia. The overland journey from Beijing to the Russian border was approximately 700 miles, through desert, while being chased by the Japanese Imperial Army, through warlord country, in frigid weather and without the benefit of 7-11's, Starbucks and Holiday Inn Express. Brady does an amazing job of putting you right there during the grueling travel and firefights with the Japanese and the Mongolian warlords.Billy's group numbered about 2 dozen at its highest and arrived at the Russian border with about half that many (about half were lost to firefights). They actually crossed the Onon River (Russian border) under fire from the Japanese. They reached the Russians and were fed, housed and medically treated. From there it is a mystery. Billy and 2 of his group were picked up by the KGB and were never seen alive again. The rest of the group did make it back.There is more to the story, however, I'm not going to spoil Brady's excellent book by providing any more details. I do have to say that you can't read this without wondering if the story is more fact than fiction. This a very different WWII story that leaves you mulling over what our previous generations actually went through during a very extreme time."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"The premise for this WWII novel is excellent, however the execution is awful. This is just about the worst written historical novel I've ever read, and I've read a bunch. The story is based on a Marine Corps myth, which the author notes there is absolutely no record of, or any of the participants, in any USMC records. A number of readers seem to have totally missed this distinction, and think it really happened! Oh well... the story starts by establishing wartime Shanghai, the far eastern city of spies, where American soldiers mix with British administrators, exiled White Russians, and diplomats of all shades and stripes. When a warning of imminent war with Japan is sent out to all American forces in the weeks prior to Pearl Harbor, it becomes clear that the American units will need to retreat from China, which is largely under Japanese occupation. Although most of these troops are concentrated in various bases, there are a few isolated outposts. This is where Cpt. Billy Port, USMC comes in.The younger son of a prominent and somewhat notorious Boston family, Port is highly regarded in the Marine Corps for his works with Gen. &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller in Central America. The first part of the book establishes the lush life of Shanghai and his comfortable living, including an &quot;arrangement&quot; with a beautiful young White Russian exile woman, and weekly tennis matches with an American-born, UCLA educated, Japanese officer. No points for guessing that the latter part of the book will pit friend against friend... When the warning of war comes, Port is tasked with traveling across China to gather up the far-flung American units, and lead them to safety. To do so, he handpicks a small unit and sets up a convoy of four trucks and his Bentley convertible for the mission.The unit he assembles is part central casting, part improbable fancy. There's a Mexican sergeant who's gimmick is that he served with Pershing against Pancho Villa and talks about it incessently. Somehow this manages to be as equally irritating to the reader (because it's not funny), as it's meant to be to the other characters. There's &quot;Sparky&quot; the radio guy, the grease-monkey/mechanic, a big brave lummox carrying the heavy gun, a bunch of anonymous BAR grunts, a college-boy Naval reserve lieutenant, and (I'm not making this up!), his Chinese butler, a world-famous French race-car driver, and a White Russian alternately referred to as &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Count&quot;, and &quot;Prince&quot; Yusopov. Along the way, they pick up a female Chinese doctor, and a British Catholic priest/paleontologist. Now, an able writer (such as George MacDonald Fraser) could have had a lot of fun with this wild and wacky cast, but Brady just isn't up to it. These characters either seem to serve no discernable purpose (such as the Naval officer), or are very convenient devices (the Russian teaches the Marines how to make a Molotov cocktail and just happens to have a brother at a monastery where sanctuary is available at a critical time, the English priest just happens to know the whole country like the back of his hand and speaks the dialects, etc.).The bulk of the book is one extended chase scene, as this motley band of brothers makes its way across the Chinese country, skirmishing with bandits, ducking Japanese Zeros, suffering in the elements, and ultimately, racing for the Soviet border. The action sequences are far and away the strongest parts, from ambushing a pursing patrol, to facing down huge bandit hordes, it's good stuff (if somewhat predictable). Alas, the bulk of the book is riddled with cliche, repetition (for example, the term &quot;top sergeant&quot; is explained several times), and awkwardness (for example, every time Port meets with his &quot;staff&quot;, Brady feels compelled to run through the roll call of who is present). It's the kind of story that might work better as a film, where one is a little more forgiving of hokiness and the dialogue would be much tighter. In any event, Port's race across China is a promising idea for a story, but this book just doesn't deliver the goods."},{"Title":"Warning of War: A Novel of the North China Marines","review":"While I am sure that the United States had military personnel many places in the world on the eve of World War II certainly those in Shanghai would appear to be trapped when the United States was attacked and declared war on the Japanese Empire. The story of Captain Port and his trek to Siberia with the adventures on the way would make a really excellent motion picture both because of the story content but because it is timely. Vietnam, the Gulf War, Kosovo, 9/11 and Afghainistan are too much with us and are difficult to digest but this story can be digested with perspective and like Casablanca would be like any great book one has read impatiently waited for to see on the screen"},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars: The story of archaeology","review":"This book was first published in 1949 and then enlarged in 1967.

Podcasting isn't for dummies.\\" What the book does is strike a balanced middle ground to achieve the goal of helping the reader start making their own podcasts.To do this, the book is arranged in a logical progression, starting with what all the hype is surrounding the idea of audio on the web that can be automatically delivered to your computer or MP3 player (hence the name podcasting, derived from Apple's iPod). Before you take a stab at creating one of your own, though, it's a good idea to first listen to podcasts to test the waters, learn about the culture, and develop some knack for discriminating between good and bad podcasts. Besides, you can also learn about about it from the end user's perspective.Next, the book gives a very brief overview of podcasting how-to tips, essentially a framework for synthesizing the remainder of the book as a developer, creator, and syndicator of your own podcasts.The rest of the book delves into the nuts and bolts of podcasting - planning your podcast (coming up with a concept after answering the questions, \\"Who are you, and why would anybody want to listen to you?\\"); getting the right tools (can you say, \\"microphone\\"?); recording your podcast; editing it after recording to give it a professional sound; preparing the audio file before making it available to the world; serving it up so others can access it; what you can do to ensure your podcast is both heard and subscribed to by others; and finally (not surprisingly) how you can MAKE MONEY WITH YOUR PODCAST!!! (as if there are altruistic people in this world anymore).The book comes with a CD packed with a variety of software for both Windows and Macs (freeware, shareware, and demos) covering all aspects of podcasting, from recording, editing, tagging, creating the RSS feed, and subscribing to podcasts. Mac users will benefit from knowing that the book was written prior to the release of Apple's iLife '06, which for $79 includes all the tools you need to create professional podcasts from a single suite of integrated programs. Sure, there are a variety of free tools you can use to kluge together your podcast, but if you're serious about getting into podcasting, you might as well spend a little money upfront to save frustration over working through a fractured workflow.All in all, the book is written in clear, straightforward text, is amply illustrated with screenshots to augment the text, and can be read either front to back or as a reference for those topics you need to learn about right now."},{"Title":"Podcast Solutions: The Complete Guide to Podcasting","review":"A great how-to book on podcasting, written by some of the pioneers in the area.

Geoghegan and Dan Klass arrived in the mail the other day, and I'm ignorant no longer... at least about podcasting...Contents: Podcasting 101; Listening to Podcasts; Podcasting How-To; Planning Your Podcast; Podcasting Tools; Recording Your Podcast; Putting It All Together; Preparing Your File; Serving It Up; Getting Heard; Making Money with Podcasting; Conclusion; Glossary; Podcasting Resources at a Glance; IndexGeoghegan and Klass have taken a subject that can be a bit intimidating and made it extremely approachable. They don't target the techno-geek who understands all the technology. Instead, they assume that the reader is someone who is reasonably intelligent, just getting started in (or interested in) podcasting, and needs assistance to get up and running. They cover some of the more popular tools and techniques currently on the market without trying to cover every last option. Because of that, you get the benefit of their experience and can avoid the dead-ends that are so common when you get started with a new toy.I was impressed with the span of coverage they gave the subject. Everything from \\"what is a podcast\\" to \\"how to do preproduction\\" to \\"how to do postproduction\\". While you may not end up being an A-List podcaster, everything you absolutely need to know to start down that path is in here. I don't know that I'm personally ever going to produce a podcast, but after reading the book, I'm much more likely to check into listening and subscribing to a few. And who knows what will happen from there...Very good book, clear information, and great writing...

This is a very useful book, and it comes with a CD of demo software you can use for podcasting.Anyone who is thinking about podcasting should read this book BEFORE they start purchasing any equipment. One of the most valuable things I found in this book was information about the equipment you will need to get start. A large portion of this book is devoted to getting good quality recordings from your recording sessions so that it doesn't turn potential listeners off with popping, clicking, hissing, etc.One of the other great things I found in this book is podsafe music.

But let's look at it like this: I made that mistake so you don't have to.From the most basic explanation of creating your own (podcast) audio file, to the most obscure and geeky RSS feed posting rules, this book covers it all. Even better, it's written in a very readable and entertaining style. These guys, like Brownie, have done a heck of a job.The authors take you from the most basic concepts to your finished and posted show. In my case I had years of experience in creating clean audio files for various projects, but I knew next to nothing about posting an XML-based feed. Without that, you don't have a podcast.

One thing I really liked was they also dished ways to make money on your website (wow! is that possible?!) although it mainly talked about ways to get money through sponsorships of your webpage thru banner and/or Google ads. I would have liked to have seen information about dynamically placing ads into a podcast or even using couponing via a mention during the podcast or maybe even having it appear on the iPod's screen as artwork which is possible with the newer iPod's. Still these are newer forms of marketing your podcast and that's the one big problem with the book. This industry is changing ridiculously fast so no matter which book you buy it's already a bit outdated. Still you do get plenty of software and freeware on the CD-R and the information on creating your podcast and RSS feed is rock solid.

The authors go intogreat detail as to why they believe this to be the case.The book is well written, well concidered, but one sided. Now this isn\`t uncommon, matter of fact it\`s the norm. Few people, presentingany theory/idea/concept will give much play to an opposing point of veiw. Basic human nature.There is so little real hard info to go on at this point in time that exobiology is largely thought experiments, deductive reasoning(based on what may be false assumptions and definately incomplete info), and speculation. You can draw almost any conclusion you wantfrom that process. We are still very much fumbling in the dark. And theories, on either side of the issue, are little better thanmaking guesses. Still, that\`s how advances are made at early stages of anything. Throw out ideas and see how hard it is for peopleto shoot them full of holes.Many might remember a tv series called \\"Cosmos\\" with Carl Sagan. Sagan went to great lengths to try to present the idea that complexlife and intelligence is extremely common. Seems to me that the authors of this book have also gone to great lengths, but in the otherdirection. Often both sides of the debate seem to be grasping at straws. That should sound alram bells on both sides.Are there millions of planets with complex life in the galaxy, or just one? The truth? Who knows. At this point its anyone\`s guess.These just isn\`t enough info. Likely somewhere in the middle.I\`m pretty sceptical of the claims made by both sides of the debate.

While it contains much interesting science that is generally well presented, virually all of their main points rely very significantly on speculation well beyond what is well established science. Mankind's knowledge of processes such as the formation of Earth-like planets and especially the evolution of complex life forms is so poor that we can only observe what happened in our own system. Ward and Brownlee jump to the conclusion that complex life could only form in systems with histories very like out own, but in fact, they (as well as other scientists) really don't have any idea what is required for complex life to develop. Perhaps it would not sell so many books, but I would certainly rate the book more highly if the authors could be more honest about this."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The only reason I give this book a 3-star rating is that it is already becoming dated by the blinding speed at which exoplanetary science is developing. When this book was written (remember that books typically take at least a year to see the light of day from the time they're written), the science that was discovering exoplanets (planets outside our own solar system) was fairly recent and the number of planets discovered was very low, and they were all &quot;super-Jupiters&quot;.However, the methods used have improved greatly and the number of known exoplanets is now over 100. More recent discoveries of terrestrial plannets in addition to gas giants makes it increasingly likely that planetary systems are the rule, not the exception.The other criteria the authors state as necessary: large moon, Jupiter-type planet, etc., are also turning out to be common. This is not to slight their work; given the available information at the time they wrote the book, it was solid research. However, just as early mariners had to continuously redraw their maps as the world's oceans were explored, so will our self-important ideas uniquemess have to be abandoned.Simply put, the numbers are mounting to a simple but profound conclusion: It is very likely that we are not alone, which is no surprise given that there are 200 billion stars in our galaxy alone and there are over 400 quadrillon known galaxies, each with hundreds of millions of stars. Put in perspective, our galaxy is like a grain of sand among all the beaches of Earth. Statistically, uniqueness is a statistical impossibility."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I am a high school teacher of Astronomy and Earth and Space Science.

This book displays how precious and rare animal life on the Earth is and the significance of a large satellite in the early stages of evolution in the protoplanet hypothesis. Peter Ward's and Donald Brownlee's concepts will be insightful for any science teacher.

It is sad however, that the conclusions reached do not give glory to God, as creator of the Universe. This is not unusual for serious books based upon scientific evidence. But I have found that as science advances and new discoveries are made, the theories on the origin of life on Earth and in the Universe as a whole more and more agree with what can be found in the Bible. Scientists tend to not regard the Bible as relevant, or belief in God as important, but most of them appear to be awestruck by things like the rarity of life, and the apparently careful designs that are found in Nature. Carl Sagan always remarked on the beauty and awesomeness of the Universe, but went to his grave unmoved by the claims of Scripture, and at times openly hostile to any form of religion. What a shame! The Universe continually reveals its wonder to us, and I believe that wonder is intended to lead us to its creator. Have a look at Genesis as you read this book.

Good book!"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth provides as thorough a summary of the Earth's history as could possibly be contained in one small volume. It is somewhat on the \\"lite\\" side of science--there are some sweeping generalizations that deserve more nuance (e.g., an asteriod wiped out the dinosaurs) but on the whole it's a remarkable achievement. The authors' conclusion that although microbial life is likely very common in the universe, complex animal life is probably very rare is well documented and I have no disagreement with it.On page 282 of my edition (paperback, 2004) the authors say: \\"The greatest danger to our thesis . . . is that it is a product of our lack of imagination.\\" I think so. Of course Earth is just right for us--we evolved here. Four billion years of natural selection on Earth has produced us. It is not at all surprising that the Earth is just right for us. Rather, we are just right for Earth.The universe is so vast--hell, the galaxy is so vast, that I really don't think our puny imaginations are capable of surmising what complex life on other planets could be like. We are only now coming to grips with how limited our senses are. We know that the visible light spectrum is a small segment of possible wave lengths, and that our hearing encompasses a limited frequency. We know that dogs' sense of smell is orders of magnitude more sensitive than ours but I don't think we can really imagine what it would be like to have such an ability. And we are just learning that our day-to-day reality is very, very different from that of elementary particles. In the past century we have accomplished much in terms of coming to know what we don't know, and we know that there is still more out there that we don't know.I suppose that if complex life from elsewhere in the galaxy is so different from us that we can't communicate with it (say, it exists in another dimension) then as far as we are concerned it really doesn't exist. But the authors seem to have a Star-Trek notion of what other intelligent life would be like: just like us, even to the extent that they all speak English, but some have pretty severe complexion problems.But to say that unless the Klingon Home World is earth-like in every respect, there are no Klingons--is silly, especially if you are only looking for Klingons."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"These authors have struck on a perfect book idea -- based on no data whatsoever from Earth's (non-existent) interstellar expeditions, they've concluded that complex life resulted quite by accident from a large set of circumstances unique to Earth. This assumes that the Earth has had basically the same conditions, free of catastrophes, and that assumption is laughable at this point.I noticed that even in the multi-starred reviews scientific errors are cited. Considering that the authors' conclusions miraculously match their original assumptions, I'm not too surprised to read that, although the high ratings on this title do surprise.Fossil evidence shows that the Moon couldn't possibly have arisen from an impact on the proto-Earth. Nautilus shells today show about 30 daily growth lines per \\"month\\". 420 million years ago they had a mere nine days. The Moon's orbital period was nine days, its distance was less than half its present value, and Earth's rate of rotation was faster. [Larry Gedney, \\"When the Days Were Shorter\\", Alaska Science Forum]Since most of the distance between Earth and Moon has accumulated in the past 420 million years, it's impossible that the Moon was born of impact four billion years ago. That's the hard evidence. The alternatives include that the Earth has had a series of moons and lost the others (Hoerbiger), or that the current Moon is the only one Earth has had, but has lost it and recaptured it at least once, or that the Earth was formerly in proximity to a different larger body (i.e., not a satellite of the Sun).The simplest model is that the Moon must have been captured sometime during or shortly before the most recent 420 million year interval -- less than ten per cent of the age of the Earth. Microbial life on Earth is believed to be attested in microfossils at least 3 billion years old. Therefore, the Moon is irrelevant to the origin of life on Earth -- unless one wishes to assume repeated captures and losses of the Moon.Ward and Brownlee think that the Moon has always been around and has been one of the indispensible factors in the rise and evolution of life. It's hogwash. Even without the Moon, the Sun produces one third of the tides -- the tides being W&B;'s most important consequence of the existence of the Moon.Since a satellite in prograde orbit and rotation will enjoy a momentum transfer from the parent body, the Earth must have formed closer to the Sun, meaning that the tides (provided there were seas) from the Sun alone were larger four and a half billion years ago.The book is an elaborate apologia for Darwin. The gradualist drivel -- tides, glaciation, continental drift (oops, \\"plate tectonics\\"), axis wobble, etc -- are there as props, but are likewise there to be propped.While not a creationist or young-Earther myself, the hostility toward some of the better reviews which expressed such a view is pretty much what I'd expect. The similar high ratings for the title by reviewers of both stripes may betray the same level of credulity that could buy into this book's claims. Some creationists reject life on other worlds because the Bible sez humans were created by God. The secular fans of this title reject life on other worlds because that could open the door to UFOs, transluminal space flight, ETs, and other things that they claim to know are impossible.While this book may prop up a few different believers, it isn't scientific. Lovers of science fiction may enjoy it. Those interested in the sociology of belief may find it, uh, indispensible.No paperback version has come out (as of early January 2003). I'll also be surprised to see subsequent titles by these authors. Instead of this, read this one in its new edition:The Deep, Hot Biosphereby Thomas Goldforeword by Freeman Dyson[0387952535]Also, do a websearch for Louis Frank (comets).[revised my original review from late August 2001]"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The body of evidence drawn upon by this book is well known by now and was no surprise to me. What is a surprise to me is how these two writers could come up with such dramatic claims based on this evidence.Folks, the fact is that we have barely even begun to explore the habitablility of our Universe beyond planet Earth. Don't be mislead into thinking the task is finished. Despite much self-lauding on how much we've discovered, we've only been at it for 50 years! We know very little even of the other planets in our own solar system, and we are NOT sure that none of them harbor complex life.Outside our own Solar System our knowledge is even less complete. The best we can do at this point is look for fluffy, hot giant planets. While the technology to detect Earths around other stars is certainly coming along, it is not here yet. Ergo, we know nothing about the frequency of Earths orbiting other stars, let alone whether they are habitable.We are very special here--anyone who has walked in the rain, sung a song or been in love will agree. But whether we are ALONE is a whole other matter, one that neither Ward nor Brownlee is prepared to answer given the current body of knowledge. Therefore I find the argument of this book quite misleading to the general public and mildly insulting to the authors' colleagues."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This will not be a popular book. There has long been a sort of enforced silence masking the divide between cosmologists and biologists concerning the existence of intelligent life in the universe. Because Sagan was such a terrific spokesman and had vast media support his arguments have, until recently, carried the day. The fact that little green men are so much more interesting than bacteria may also have something to do with it. Perhaps the most notable achievement of this book is the clear elucidation of complex scientific themes for the layman and the wealth of information provided.The divide between the two groups is now apparent. Biologists have long cautioned against using sheer numbers of possible worlds as a predictor of other civilizations. The old numbers game - there are 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and at least 100 billion could have Earth-like planets and...well, there just HAS to be intelligence by the law of averages. That is not science but conjecture.Another interesting phenomenon is the increasing number of former true believers who have examined the evidence and concluded that they were viewing the galaxy throught rose-colored telescopes. The shift of opinion, by the way, is all one way. I am one of those who sadly concluded that the intelligence and particularly consciousness may be a singular event. (Roger Penrose addresses the uniqueness of consciousness in SHADOWS OF THE MIND - highly recommended.) Earth, as the author points out, is a unique place with all the conditions required for the evolution of life until consciousness appears. Saying that statement is NOT a call for creationism or ID but a summation of current scientific thought. We must remember a paradox - sentient life evolved only because of numerous mass extinctions that created new blank slates upon which life reformatted itself. This is rarely mentioned - as if the path from microbe to consciousness was one long uninterrupted line of continual evolution. If anything, this book will cause people to look past the marketing of SETI and explore the entire situation differently."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"After reading some of the other reviews I've noticed some problems in peoples' perceptions. Some feel that the book is too narrow without looking at other possibilities while others see it as a boon for creationalist. The thesis of the book, I feel, isn't really that there is only one way for life to evolve and therefore all planets must duplicate ours. Rather the thesis is that planets are extremely unstable environments and in order for long stretches of time for evolution to take place certain factors must be involved to provide some stability. Thus, they bring in factors against stability such as meteors, radiation, fluctuations in planetary tilt, comets, distance from the sun, age of the sun, and a host of other problems. Our own earth has experienced a great deal of catastrophes itself and it is safe to assume from looking at the other planets in our system that this is a rule in the universe. Could intelligent life evolve in some other way? Perhaps, but you have to have the stability to find the time. Wonderful book. It pretty much ruined science fiction for me."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The authors set out to explain that, while simple life may be abundant in the Universe, complex life -plants, animals- require so many &quot;coincidences&quot; that we may very well be unique out there. This is a very interesting book in the sense that it shows how knowledge from many different scientific disciplines can be brought together and can be used to theorize about such a complicated subject. Even though there is still much more we don't know about this subject than we do know about it, the authors, rather convincingly, argue their case. The only weaker point in the book is that the authors very much focus on &quot;intelligent&quot; life as we know it on earth, and restrict their search for life to earth-like conditions. It would have been interesting to read their views on the possibility of totally different life forms (based on completely different chemistry and able to develop in totally different conditions)."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"As a non-scientist, I found *Rare Earth* fascinating. I will leave it to scientists to debate the hypothesis, but I do have a minor quibble. The authors state: \\"During the Middle Ages, Earth was not only regarded as the center of the Universe but again was believed to be flat. St. Thomas Aquinas made Earth a sphere again but codified its place as the center of the Universe.\\" Ward and Browlee probably learned this myth in grade school and since then never questioned it.The truth is that in the Middle Ages all educated people (including Aquinas, of course) knew that Earth is a sphere. For example, the geography of Dante's *Divine Comedy* clearly assumes we are living on a globe. Also it should be noted that being at the center did not imply privilege. Satan was frozen at the very center of Dante's universe whereas the poet had to travel to the outer spheres of the heavens for the Beatific Vision of God.

It provides valuable insight into one end of the spectrum within the most current debate on the origin and evolution of life. Although it represents the standpoint of the pessimist end of the debate in which complex and/or intelligent life is basically a supremely rare event in the Universe, it takes the reader through highly valuable yet as well highly arguable thought processes to arrive at the author's conclusion. An essential read if you want to be well informed on the most current Astrobiological debates.

And it attempts to defend a controversial thesis, namely that while life may be prevalent in the Universe, intelligent life is rare.The claim that life itself is at least as common as many others suspect is based on the ability of many \\"extremophiles\\" (some of which may resemble the initial forms of life on Earth) to subsist well outside what many observers would previously have called a \\"habitable environment.\\" The authors also note the fact that unicellular life on Earth appears to have arisen fairly quickly.The claim that intelligent life is rare is based on the fact that multicellular animal life appears to require a large number of potentially difficult steps to evolve, and in fact took a relatively long time to develop on Earth. The authors argue that many aspects of the Earth's nature and history are relatively rare, and that these aspects significantly increased the chance that intelligent life would develop as fast as it did. In addition, the authors point out that the development of intelligent life requires being lucky at several key points. For example, intelligent life on Earth required an oxygen-rich atmosphere. This was provided by early unicellular life. But the production of oxygen wrecked much of the \\"greenhouse effect\\" that had made the Earth's surface relatively warm. The cooling of the Earth that resulted probably did not slow down the further evolution of life, if anything, the authors suspect that it speeded it up. But on other planets, such a reduction of temperature would have been more likely to destroy life than enhance it.This is a very readable and interesting book, and I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I both hate &amp; love this book. I think it is a must read. Like all reviewers here, I am one of those who hopes that it's a \\"Star Trek\\" universe out there but unlike other reviewers on this board, I do not think that this book will get outdated anytime soon.This book without trying, seems to partially reconcile the \`Creation' &amp; \`Evolution' hypothesis. It does this by sticking to the \`Evolution' script but listing powerful arguments as to why \`Life' as we know it may be unique or at least rare. In the face of mounting evidence, perhaps the church could support this hypothesis without losing legitimacy.The hypothesis is not built on one single argument &amp; therein lies its strength. The book starts by making a clear distinction between microbial &amp; animal life and concedes quickly that the former may be quite common around the universe. Animal life on the other hand, requires a fortuitous alignment of the stars and planets :)The first concept explored in this regard is that of a \`Habitable Zone'(HZ). Off the 3 types of galaxies, only large spiral galaxies are likely to host life. The other two types are either too dense (globular galaxies) or too old (elliptical galaxies &amp; small clusters), lacking the heavy elements necessary to sustain habitable conditions. The former is a problem of overcrowding, too much sun (literally), gravity, harmful radiation &amp; frequent cataclysmic events (supernovae, black holes etc.). The latter would mean a world without a heated core, mostly composed of hydrogen &amp; helium. Think of the Sun &amp; Jupiter, what are the odds of life in these two places.After eliminating all but spiral galaxies, the hypothesis also does the same to systems within spiral galaxies. Too close to the core and you have the same problems faced within globular galaxies, too far &amp; you have the environment similar to an elliptical galaxy, i.e., too few heavy metals. That leaves only the arms of spiral galaxies as likely habitats for complex life.Within the HZ of galaxies, planets also have to be formed within the HZ of their star. Too close &amp; they're toast (all water evaporates and escapes into space), too far and they are too cold to sustain anything but microbial life. Additionally it requires a star with certain properties, a certain size (only 5% of stars are the required size, most stars in the universe unlike our Sun are too small) and a high percentage of heavy metals (again a rare combination).Finally, the roles played by the Moon &amp; Jupiter in supporting life on earth. The Moon stabilizes the rotation of the Earth. Imagine a basketball rolling on a floor rotating in varying directions as opposed to a top, rotating on a fixed axis. Without the Moon, the poles &amp; equator would be constantly shifting. Our planet would be covered by water, temperatures &amp; seasons would be unpredictable. Without Jupiter (because of its size &amp; gravitational pull) attracting and capturing most celestial objects on a collision course with Earth, there would be many more large bodies crashing on earth and threatening life. You know what happened the last time this happened, ask Mr. T-Rex.Even assuming all these factors are duplicated, there is the additional factor of a time period. This ranges from the time the solar system has cooled down &amp; the planets settled into stable orbits to the end when the star runs out of fuel &amp; dies. Complex life has this time span to evolve, live &amp; likely perish.The Rare Earth hypothesis is exactly that, it is not a law. Ward &amp; Brownlee make a strong case, one whose implications I don't like but are nevertheless persuasive. If you are students of science, the origin and future of mankind, I would strongly recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I grew up in the Saganesque world of Star Trek, where every star had planets with at least one in a habitable zone and therefore a virtual certainty of developing complex life. The only question was how long intelligent life could last.That view has been fading for some time: it turns out we need Jupiter to keep the comets and asteroids away, we need a large moon to stabilize our rotation, and we need plate tectonics to engender variety.The new view is explained in detail in this excellent book, which covers the myriad areas in which the earth is special, and needs to be special, in order to provide a habitat for complex life. It is a carefully reasoned view, and, even if you don't agree with the conclusion, the book provides a clear, thorough layman's overview of the origin and development of life on earth. It's debatable whether the twists and turns of that development are necessary for complex life to evolve, but the evidence suggests that we've been fortunate.I would like the conclusion to be wrong, and in fact the authors point out that they've made one big assumption: that life elsewhere will be a lot like life here. If that's not the case, then perhaps all bets are off. But I'm afraid that's not the way it looks."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This volume is a wonderful compendium of information on earth history, covering most of the pertinent literature in basic geology, basic paleontology and basic astronomy in a readable, understandable fashion. It would be an especially good book for the interested nonprofessional to learn about these subjects or for a high school teacher wishing to teach earth history/geology without boring the student. The book is however slightly too derivative and therefore somewhat frustrating for anyone who has any kind of college background in these fields. What is new here and of interest to any reader is the use of the &quot;known,&quot; life on earth, to predict the liklihood of the &quot;unknown,&quot; life in the galaxy and the universe. After reading Sagan's &quot;Cosmos&quot; in the '70s with interest and enthusiasm and following the SETI investigation over the interum, I found the appearance of an opposing view refreshing and long overdue. It certainly provided a nice counterbalance to the almost overly optimistic notion that the universe is teaming with life--by which most of us mean intelligent life. Sagan and others who first proposed the abundance of life in the universe did so on the basis of guess-timate statistics that did not have the advantage of the more recent information on extremophiles or on existance of other planets. This book provides an overview of this new information and its impact on our ideas about life throughout the universe."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"In Rare Earth, Ward and Brownlee assert that complex life is uncommon in the universe and even offer the possibility that only the Earth harbors complex life. They rely on an interpretation of the history of life on Earth, geology, and astrophysics that supports their view. The authors' assertive style of presentation from start to finish has a hint of preordained certainty that might leave some readers with the impression that strong counter arguments and evidence do not exist, but indeed they do.There are many problems with the facts presented and their interpretation. Here are just a few examples: Ward and Brownlee start with a list of so-called \\"dead zones of the universe\\". Five of the first six entries (there are nine in all) cite the \\"problem\\" of metalicity. For example, the stars in globular clusters \\"are too metal poor to have inner planets as large as Earth.\\" And, the stars comprising elliptical galaxies are \\"too metal poor\\" as well. Low metalicity, they claim, also makes for a dead zone spanning the early universe, globular clusters, elliptical galaxies, small galaxies and the edges of galaxies. This seems to severely limit the number of exoEarths, and the possibility for complex life to form. However, recent studies show that metalicity is not a deal breaker. For example, Lars Buchhave (U. of Copenhagen) and others published in Nature 486, 375-377 (21 June 2012) the results of work that show that the formation of Earth-size planets does not require high metal content in their parent stars. Therefore, it seems that Ward and Brownlee must shorten their list of dead zones by five.Astronomers have found dozens of candidate exoEarths, and the search goes on. The Kepler mission has been extended through 2016. Here is an example of a \\"hiding place\\" for more exoEarths. Many of the Neptune-size and larger planets found by Kepler have orbits close to their parent stars. Some may be in the habitable zone. In addition, some of these might have satellites that are exoEarth candidates. Even if such a satellite were tidally locked to its giant planet, it would still experience day and night cycles, albeit somewhat longer than ours. (It would never be completely dark ... Try to figure out why this would be true.) Tides, climate, weather, and tectonics would produce plenty of change, challenge and opportunity for life and its evolution.The authors insist that the Moon, more specifically the tides produce by it, greatly enhance the prospects for complex life. Therefore, they say we need a moon like ours, just as big and just as close...in other words... just right. However, they ignore the fact that if the Earth had no moon, there would still be tides. The sun is responsible for roughly 30% of our tidal variation. And depending on coastal geography there would still be significant variations, with some relatively high tides in places. There would be more than enough tidal effects for the development and evolution of life, IF such effects are necessary.The authors assert that Jupiter acts as an absorber or deflector of most bombardments of the Earth. However, the presence of Jupiter is not as special as they claim. Remember that the Kepler project and other observations have found giant planets everywhere. It is reasonable to conclude that anywhere there is an exoEarth there is also at least one giant planet in the same system, serving the same guardian function.The authors go on to claim that the putative Cambrian explosion of diverse and complex life (or whatever caused it), as well as plate tectonics, mass extinctions, and other events in Earth's history are rare and possibly unique in the cosmos, but necessary for complex life. Such claims reveal less about why the Earth has complex life and more about the state of our knowledge at the time they wrote this book.I do recommend this book to readers who are reasonably current in the material it presents, because they will see the weak points in the authors' arguments and perhaps contribute to counter arguments. Ultimately it will serve as a case study of the pitfalls of basing assertions and a major conclusion upon incomplete and ongoing science.I am reminded of a thought by Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow): \\"Declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.\\""},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"A good book about the different \\"types\\" of life on earth and the necessary supporting ecosystems.

Therefore they contrast with Carl Sagan's views of a million (&quot;billions and billions&quot;) civilisations in this galaxy alone. The earth position is largely responsible for life's success on this planet. The earth by chance orbits a star not too close to the centre of the galaxy where cataclysmic events and dangerous and radiation would prove hostile to living be-ngs, but it is not too close to the 'ethereal' outer edge where heavy planet making elements are harder to find. It is lucky also that the sun is a solitary, stable star and the earth has stable orbit around it.The book draws on various discilines and is extremely interesting. As a result, the book provides a handy introduction to astrobiology-the emerging field that combines astronomy, biology and planetary science."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"In addition to arguing very convincingly for a surprising conclusion, it's one of the most lucid introductions to Astronomy, Geology, and Evolutionary Microbiology in existence.

As for the reviewer who tried to slip in the arguement 'life as we know it', read the book before you assume the conclusion is audatious. No scientists are saying that this is the absolute truth. But after you read the book, you realize that the rare earth hypothesis is simply the most likely situation. You can't live your life (or conduct government policy) on what we might not know about.

Instead of a plausible, scientific look at the size of the universe and the possibility for life to exist on other planets, this book and the course I took, took an almost steadfast inferential view towards extraterrestrial life based solely on conclusions drawn from far too little evidence. I disagreed with the content of this book, most specifically the fact that planets within a stars habitable zone are rare (what proof do the authors offer?) and that for life to evolve it requires the same conditions that we see here on earth.

The point is intelligent life is so fragile and there are so many factors that if they were otherwise, intelligent life wouldn't have been around in the earth. But primitive forms of life, as we know it, can be very common in the universe. However, a few of the arguments put forward by the authors might seem superficial, since any intelligent being would marvel at themselves and ask the same questions. Besides, the total number of stars in the universe is so huge that the tiny chances of the possibility of intelligent life become significant. But still the fragility should be appreciated. And the fact that the Rare Earth hypothesis should not be used as a rebuttal of the SETI program.

Rare Earth is fast paced, non boring and a page burner. I read it in 2 days. The reader wants to learn more. Very little math. The Drake equation is shown giving us an approximation of intelligent civilizations. Later the Rare Earth equation is shown with a very different approximation of intelligent civilizations. Much rarer.The authors show us other planets having microscopic life maybe common. Also why advanced animals on other planets maybe rare.We learn why its so difficult for a planet to support advanced animals. First a sun about the size of our sun rich in metals must be positioned away from too much activity in galactic centers, no binary or more star systems, away from black holes, pulsars, stars that could supernova blasting the planet with deadly gamma and x rays. Then why a planet must be in a habitable zone and not tidal locked around a star. Then why having a large moon like our moon is so important and why Plate Tectonics is needed for a magnetic field to protect the planet from outside lethal energy rays and to have vulcanism to release greenhouse gases and to have continental drift. Also why the planet may have near extinction events caused by comet and asteroid impacts. Also the role green houses gases play in keeping the planet warm and the balancing act of only having enough greenhouse gases and not too much to keep the planet in a temperature range for animals to live. Also it is shown the billions of years needed for a stable sun for evolution to occur.

By simple life, they mean something along the lines of bacteria or archaeans. However, complex life - such as animals - might be comparatively rare. (They don't discuss plants at any length.) The conditions necessary for the evolution of animals might be so unusual, that our own solar system could be the only one where such creatures have emerged. If so, that would make intelligent life even less likely. Perhaps humans really are alone in the universe.The authors discuss the unusual make-up of our solar system at some length: the sun isn't an average star, the presence of Jupiter tends to shield Earth from approaching comets, our unique moon has an important geological impact on conditions at Earth, plate tectonics are driven by very exotic mechanism, etc. Thus, complex life has evolved due to a long series of highly unlikely circumstances. If the preconditions for animals and thus humans are the results of pure chance, then perhaps it only happened once. Fermi's paradox has been solved: the reason why no aliens have ever visited our planet, is that the aliens don't exist!For rather obvious reasons, it's very difficult to prove or disprove the Rare Earth hypothesis at present. It remains a minority position within the scientific community. Personally, I also suspect that Ward and Brownlee are wrong, but I admit that my reasons for thinking so are largely philosophical. And no, I won't kill myself if somehow it turns out that the authors are right. I mean, who wants to be fried by the big UFOs in \\"Independence Day\\"?Still, it's interesting to speculate about why the Rare Earth hypothesis is so...well, rare. It's almost an article of faith in our culture that aliens simply *must* exist. Why? I don't think it's because the existence of other civilizations in other star systems would make us more humble and less Earth-centred. Please come on, our civilization is *not* humble, a few symbolic paeans to Copernicus and Freud notwithstanding.Paradoxically, I think it's a special kind of scientific thinking that fuels the pseudo-scientific alien-mania. If we can find an advanced race travelling the Galaxy in space ships, that would prove that science, high tech and AI actually works. Also, what better argument for funding the space programs than the chase for aliens? Perhaps atheists also need aliens to give the empty materialist universe some semblance of meaning? If you can find meaning in a non-existent sulphur-based life form at Beta Orionis, you have my sympathy. I can't. I like crows and geese, though.Incidentally, you might want to know that the book Amazon has paired \\"Rare Earth\\" with, \\"The Privileged Planet\\", is a creationist work. The creationists, of course, claim that all the facts enumerated by Ward and Brownlee can't be a co-incidence. It must be God who is behind it all! (God doesn't like sulphur-based life forms on Rigel. He's more into beetles!)\\"Rare Earth\\" is relatively easy to read, contains many interesting facts and interpretations, and gives you something to think about on a spring evening. I mean, what if we actually *are* alone...in the entire universe? The thought is staggering. I also find the theory expounded in this work hard to swallow, but it should be read with an open mind."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I call this an alternate view because it has become somewhat accepted to assume that the universe must be teeming with life. Obviously, the hypothesis forwarded by these authors is that complex life is relatively rare in the universe. Most of this idea is developed by looking at the history of the planet Earth and its neighbors in the solar system and how or why life did or didn't develop on these planets. In the end, the claim is that life on Earth is the result of a number of very rare coincidences that might not be very common across the universe. This is similar to one of Peter Ward's other books in that a very interesting and thought provoking history of the planet is covered. Readers will undoubtedly find something they hadn't heard or thought about. On the other hand, unlike some of Ward's other books, this one doesn't have a lot of personal anecdotes or stories about trips to interesting locales.

I beleive thier conclusions are sound."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee have written a very thought-provoking book in \\"Rare Earth.\\" They have, in fact, given voice to some thoughts that had occurred to me and to a lot of others quite some time ago - namely \\"Where is everybody?\\" Flying saucer enthusiasts and alien abduction aficionados aside, most of us who think about such things have wondered why no alien civilization's radio transmissions have not obviously reached planet earth by now if alien civilizations were so common. Also we are starting to wonder where life exists in our solar system outside of Earth.When I was in my teens I eagerly kept track of every launch of a spacecraft. I dreamed of even becoming an astronomer specializing in planetary geology. But my true love was biology and the thought of a possible alien biological system was fascinating. I was soon disillusioned. First the veil of Venus was lifted and where swamps and dinosaur-like creatures roamed in science fiction was a barren acid and heat scorched version of Dante's Inferno. Mars was also found to be a volcanic version of the earth's moon, except with weather (dust storms mostly), pole caps of carbon dioxide and water ice, and a very thin atmosphere. The temperature of close to 100 degrees F. below zero did not seem promising and still does not. Thus the civilizations of Mars envisioned by Lowell disappeared into the Martian dust (as they had started to even before the first space probes). Then the moons Titan (Saturn) and Europa (Jupiter) were proposed as abodes of life, however weird, and a Martian meteorite with strange \\"nano-bacteria\\" was brought out. The latter \\"nano-bacteria\\" have become dubious at best and the moons are looking less promising by the day. Titan may have such a smoggy atmosphere and be so cold as to be certainly questionable as an abode for life. In addition to this, recent reports indicate that Europa is covered with a layer of concentrated sulfuric acid (possibly from the neighboring moon Io, which has sulfur volcanoes on its surface) and hydrogen peroxide- not exactly a good place for living things! To top it off some scientists think that the ice on Europa may actually cover a sea of sulfuric acid with a pH close to 0!If we cannot find even \\"primitive\\" to relatively \\"primitive\\" living things (bacteria, lichens, fungi) on other planets in our system we may have to face the fact that life, while it may exist on numerous planets, is not nearly as common and as accessible as some would have it and that \\"civilizations\\" are even less common.Why is this? Ward and Brownlee have provided detailed answers, which, even if their formulae are somewhat flawed (as one reviewer suggested), are persuasive. We have to keep in mind that we do not know how long civilizations last or how often they occur but do not develop our type of technology. We are up against billion of years of time and trillions of cubic light years of space. Star Trek aside, we are not even sure that interstellar travel will ever be possible, so we may never know for sure what is out there.As Ward and Brownlee point out, to even have a planet with the possibility of life we have to have several conditions met. First planets revolving around multiple stars probably do not last long because of tidal effects and if they do life might have to cope with radical changes in surface temperature. Given that, we still have a number of candidate stars and have even found a number of such stars with planets (most of which are huge, some even by Jupiter standards). We also need planets within a star's habitable zone (assuming the star is not unstable and lasts long enough for the development of life). Then contingency has to allow for the development of living forms sometime during the life of the planet. To get more complex life than bacteria we need several billion years and perhaps a large moon. It gets even dicier if we want intelligent life, and even then we may have intelligent ocean-dwelling creatures who never develop radio and thus may not be detectable. Even if radio waves are produced by a civilization, we need to exist ourselves within that civilization's survival time frame (or actually light years later).Ward and Brownlee have provided, I think, some very good reasons why we are unlikely to find multicellular life on nearby planets or advanced technologies on planets even around distant stars. Even if life is fairly abundant in the universe (and I think it probably may be), planets with life (even at the bacterial level) may not be anywhere near as abundant as lifeless ones. This is not a reason to embrace creationism, as some would have it, but is simply a property of our universe. While I wish it were not so, I fear we cannot argue with the logic of this- especially with the little evidence we now possess. Of course one cannot completely rule out the possibility that Ward and Brownlee have missed something, but that is a present a meager hope.Read this book if you are interested in why complex life may be uncommon in the universe."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Chapter Two of this work: &quot;Habitable Zones of the Universe,&quot; was worth the price of the book just in itself.

What is the likelihood another world possesses all the factors needed to drive simple molecules along a track leading to a creature capable of thinking about communicating across vast stellar distances? In dealing with this question, Ward and Brownlee synthesized an immense amount of information, presenting it in a finely crafted style. In fact, the extraterrestrial aspects become relegated to short pieces at chapters' ends. Leaving no stone unturned, the authors deal with cosmology, physics, chemistry and, of course, biology, in easily absorbed prose. Given the wealth of information they needed to survey, no accolade can do sufficient justice to their presentation.Nearly twenty years ago, James Trefil and Robert Rood published &quot;Are We Alone?&quot;. From a list of then-known conditions needed to allow life to begin and evolve, the authors offered optimistic and pessimistic scenarios on whether alien civilizations were likely to exist. Ward and Brownlee have improved the resolution of this question, using the latest information. Sadly, but almost certainly correctly, the come down strongly on the pessimistic side.Paleontology has come far since Are We Alone? was published. Ward and Brownlee's account surveys utilizes the wealth of recent information derived from research studies done during the past few years. With life beginning over 3 thousand million years ago, their task is formidable. Yet they carry us through the stages life without bogging down in pedantic expression. They show how misleading simple pictures of life's progress can be, showing how even &quot;simple&quot; creatures are astonishingly complex.The studies and researchers they discuss offer a wealth of new information, including a few acute surprises. Evolution is fraught with disaster scenarios. Ward and Brownlee offer a good discussion of these, particularly the great Permian dying. Diversity loss from this extinction was severe. Was it the result of a reduction in available DNA patterns due to the loss of species? This is a new question for which the authors call for further research in its response.The most innovative chapter in the book deals with the impact of plate tectonics on evolution. More than simply the drifting of continental land masses, the authors describe how severely mobile continents impact ocean currents, air masses and climate generally. Little considered by paleontologists except as a dating and location device, Ward and Brownlee make continental drift a major factor in evolution. Since no other planet in the solar system exhibits tectonic activity, what is the likelihood this phenomenon occurs on planets circling distant stars? No tectonics, no stimulus to higher life forms and interplanetary communication.In short, this book covers an immense amount of territory in explaining how life starts and likely continues under the proper conditions. They present nicely balanced explanations and critiques of recent research findings. Even outlandish ideas are given a patient hearing. As they remind us, who would have thought life could dwell at the bottom of the ocean's depths? It's well worth investing in this view of life's history. While posing many questions, the authors show how innovative thinking may someday provide answers . Anyone considering entering a scientific field will discover countless areas of investigation.

Perhaps you might gain a place in a revised edition."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"_Rare Earth_ by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee is an excellent, thorough, and thought provoking work analyzing the possibility of life on other worlds. Ward, a noted paleontologist, and Brownlee, an astronomer, sought to challenge the widespread notion that complex, even intelligent, life is common in the universe. This bias towards believing in intelligent life elsewhere is partly thanks to wishful thinking (aided by works of science fiction) and partly from the famous Drake Equation put forth by astronomers Frank Drake and Carl Sagan. This equation, one designed to estimate the number of advanced civilizations present in our galaxy, was based on educated guesses on how many planets there were in our galaxy, how many of those might harbor life, and of those what percentage advanced to become homes of civilized life forms. Using the best estimates at the time, Drake and Sagan in 1974 postulated that a million civilizations may exist in the Milky Way galaxy alone, and as our galaxy is but one of hundreds of millions of galaxies, according to them the number of intelligent alien species must be staggering.Ward and Brownlee did not think that credible, and put forth an alternative theory, the Rare Earth Hypothesis, using information gathered over the years in paleontology, geology, climatology, and astronomy. In a nutshell, they believe that microbial life is very common in the universe, perhaps more common than even Drake and Sagan anticipated, while complex life - animals and higher plants - is quite rare.As evidence exists that life first appeared on Earth 3.8 billion years ago, almost simultaneously with the end of heavy bombardment from outer space and the lowering of surface temperatures below the boiling point of water, it is possible that life could form very early on a planet, that it can and quite possibly will evolve on any planet if conditions are at least just barely tolerable. Additionally, with evidence that on Earth there are microbes that can survive temperatures above boiling water, as much as 169 degrees Celsius (and maybe up to 200), deep in the Earth's crust or in hydrothermal deep sea vents (as well as life found living in sea ice and snow), it would appear that microorganisms have very wide tolerances for a range of planetary conditions. Given that many believe life may have first evolved deep underground or deep beneath the sea, the authors feel that microorganisms may be quite common, perhaps even present elsewhere in our own solar system.Conversely, the conditions that allow animal and advanced plant life to develop (the authors largely concentrate on animals) are \\"rare if not unique,\\" Earth being a \\"bastion of animals amid a sea of microbe-infested worlds.\\" Ward and Brownlee have composed a long list of \\"low-probability\\" events or conditions that are necessary for the formation of animal life.I had long been familiar with the concept that Earth was lucky to be at just the right distance from its star, in the habitable zone, a region where heat from the sun provides a planetary surface temperature at which water neither freezes nor boils (the authors later narrow this concept to the animal habitable zone, the range of distances where not only is it possible for an Earth-like planet to have liquid surface water but also to maintain average global temperatures of less than 50 degree Celsius, as that is believed the upper limit at which animal life can exist). What was new to me was the concept of the galactic habitable zone, the notion being that complex life can only develop (and survive) on a planet in the right neighborhood of the galaxy basically, and indeed the right type of galaxy period. Earth-life as we know it could not arise at all if the sun was in a globular cluster, an elliptical galaxy, or a small galaxy, as most if not all stars in these formations are too metal-poor and often are too hot for life on inner planets. In systems low in metals (elements other than hydrogen and helium), there would not be enough solid matter to form a planet the size of Earth and even if one formed it would lack the metals needed to produce either magnetic fields or the internal heat sources to drive plate tectonics.Even in suitable galaxies an Earth-like planet could not exist in its center, as that is a region with many energetic processes that could eliminate life altogether; the high density of stars in the center make the danger of supernovae significant (our sun and planet are protected simply by the relative scarcity of stars around us). Other stellar members, such as neutron stars called magnetars, are considerably more common in the center (which can emit vast amounts of lethal X-rays and gamma rays). Nor could Earth exist at the galactic edge, as that region is too metal poor.The authors argued that plate tectonics is vital to the development of animal life for a variety of reasons. It promotes high levels of biodiversity, a major defense against mass extinctions; it provides the planet with a global thermostat by recycling chemicals essential in keeping the volume of carbon dioxide relatively uniform (and thus enabling liquid water to remain on a planet's surface); it creates the continents (not only vital for biodiversity purposes but also in terms of weathering and as source of marine nutrients); and it provides a magnetic field, a defense against lethal cosmic radiation and the loss of an atmosphere.There are a number of other factors that the authors look at; among them the importance of the Moon (extremely vital but perhaps a very rare thing for one of that size to exist around a terrestrial planet), the importance of a stable Jupiter at the right distance from Earth, and several perhaps unique events in Earth's history, such as Snowball Earth episodes and the Cambrian Explosion, vital events in the evolution of life that might be very unlikely to occur on an alien planet."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"When human beings begin exploring planetary systems around other stars, will they find only barren worlds where life never had a chance to evolve? Or will they planets teeming with the equivalents of grass, trees, fish, birds, repiles, and mammals? According to Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee, the answer is neither. Such is their provocative and seemingly paradoxical Rare Earth Hypothesis as spelled out in their new book &quot;Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe&quot; -- that simple microbial life is common throughout the universe, but that complex animal life is not.The existence of life on other planets has been debated, sometimes hotly, by scientists, philosophers, and others. Ward and Brownlee break new ground in this debate by emphasizing the difference between microbial and complex multicellular life. The classic picture of the development of complex life is that -- somehow -- life arises from the chemical properties of certain molecules, andonce life gains a foothold evolutionary processes guide it towards higher and higher levels of complexity, culminating in the rich plant and animal life evident in earth today. What the Rare Earth Hypothesis argues is that the first step is fairly easy, hence life has probably arisen many times in many different places in the universe, but that the second step depends upon many special properties and lucky accidents that happened on earth and are very unlikely to happen elsewhere. Consider: life on earth arose some 3.8 billion years ago shortly after its surface cooled following the heavy bombardment of asteroids. By contrast, complex plant and animal life appeared less than 600 million years ago -- and human intelligence only 3 million years ago!What makes the Rare Earth Hypothesis so extraordinary is that it draws a new distinction in the debate about extraterrestrial life, a nuance that neither side in the debate will welcome. What makes &quot;Rare Earth&quot; an extraordinary book is the way it presents the Rare Earth Hypothesis, meticulously building the case by presenting one bit of evidence after another from many disparate branches of science. To study how life may form in other worlds, Ward and Brownlee survey relevant results from planetary science and the early history of earth and the solar system, geology, oceanography, and biology. Similarly, the unlikeliness of complex life follows from prevailing ideas in astronomy, paleontology, climatology, and statistics, in addition to geology, oceanography, and biology.To me, much of Rare Earth's appeal lies in its lucid exposition of ideas and facts from so many branches of science. Few books offer the opportunity to take as exciting a tour of the scientific landscape as &quot;Rare Earth&quot;. And the methodical presentation of the case for the Rare Earth Hypothesis brings a sense of excitement more common in a book of mystery than a book of science.&quot;Rare Earth&quot; does more than deal a blow to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; galaxy, one populated by dozens or hundreds of intelligent, mostly bipedal, species. It presents a clear, plausible scenario for the development of life on earth and other planets, and it explains why life on other planets is not likely to follow the same path towards complexity as it did on earth. It does all this by appealing to scientific results, and it does a good job of explaining the science involved. Moreover, since many of the results are new and some of them are of a speculative nature, &quot;Rare Earth&quot; takes the reader into the inner world of scientists, where ideas are first proposed and explored. We may not know whether the Rare Earth Hypothesis is true or false until humans finally do reach those alien planets orbiting other stars. Until then, whether you believe in the Rare Earth Hypothesis or not, if you are interested in the question of life in other planets, or if you are a general science enthusiast, do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"+++++This book, by Ward & Brownlee, considers if there are other extrasolar Earth-like planets (that is, Earth-like planets not of our sun). It is NOT saying that there are no extrasolar Earth-SIZE planets but only that extrasolar Earth-LIKE planets (that is, other planets that support carbon-based and DNA-based life as we know it) probably do not exist.In other words, this book (and the authors state this) is using PROVEN forms of life known to exist which is the carbon-based and DNA-based life found on one planet known to have life -- Earth.Also, this book is NOT saying that extrasolar planets that support life as we DO NOT know it (non-carbon based and non-DNA based life) do not exist. It's just that there is no hard evidence (but theoretically it's possible) for such life.This book has a number of good features:(1) REFERENCES. Over 25 pages that mainly consist of recent journal articles written by respected scientists.(2) SUMMARY INTRODUCTIONS. There are two, 2-page summary introductions. They are entitled \\"Dead Zones of the Universe\\" (nine zones where life as we know it is thought not to exist) and \\"Rare Earth Factors\\" (eighteen factors that may be unique to Earth and that thus collectively permit life as we know it). These summary introductions provide a roadmap for the first ten (of thirteen) chapters of this book.(3) THE FIRST TEN CHAPTERS. These chapters are very detailed and build-up (using both historical theories and data as well as recent new theories and data) the summary information mentioned in (2) above.(4) THE FINAL THREE CHAPTERS. These chapters are particularly interesting. Here we get more aquainted with Ward & Brownlee's Rare Earth Hypothesis (microbial life is common in the universe, but complex, multicellular life, such as human life, is rare) and introduced to the Rare Earth Equation. This hypothesis and equation are formulated from the information found in the first ten chapters mentioned in (3) above.Despite these good features, there is one obvious distraction with this book -- it contains some factual errors. Here are just four examples: (1) some of the terms of the famous Drake Equation (developed by the SETI Institute's Dr. Frank Drake in 1961) are not correctly defined (2) the number of stars in our Galaxy is on average 200 billion (not million) (3) Mercury and Venus do not always present the same face to the sun (4) and the human genome has less than 100 thousand (not millions of) genes.Normally, I would not nitpick like this but Ward & Brownlee are scientists and I feel that they should not have gotten these rather elementary facts wrong. However, it should be noted that these distractions do not undermine the main premise of the book.Since this book is dedicated to the late Dr. Carl Sagan (as well as another person), I feel I should explain Sagan's results (presented in his best-seller \\"Cosmos\\") based on using the Drake equation that indicates another reason we may be alone, at least, in the Galaxy. Sagan calculates that \\"the number of [advanced technical] civilizations [known as \\"N\\"] in the Galaxy [could be] in the millions\\" (thus satisfying those who state the simple argument that since there's billions of stars in the Galaxy, there must be many advanced civilizations).BUT Sagan also says that \\"The number N might be as small as 1 [just us].\\" Why does he say this? He explains: \\"If civilizations tend to destroy themselves soon after reaching a technological phase there might be no one for us to talk with but ourselves...Civilizations would take billions of years of tortuous evolution to arise [as Ward & Brownlee detail exquisitely], and then snuff themselves out in an instant [or some cosmic event snuffs them out as Ward & Brownlee, again, explain exquisitely].\\"Finally, for an opposite opinion of what Ward & Brownlee's book present, I recommend Frank Drake's \\"Is Anyone Out There?: The Scientific Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence\\" (paperback, 1994) and/or visting the SETI internet site.In conclusion, despite some factual distractions, this book has a number of good features that collectively give a challenging second opinion regarding life in the universe. If you like challenges, then I strongly recommend that you read this book!!**** 1/2+++++"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth provides some fairly strong (and not well known) arguments that animal life on earth has been very lucky, and that planetary surfaces are typically much more hostile to multicellular life than our experience leads us to expect.The most convincing parts of the book deal with geological and astronomical phenomena that suggest that earth-like conditions are unstable, and that it would have been normal for animal life to have been wiped out by disasters such as asteroids, extreme temperatures, supernovae, etc.The parts of the book that deal with biology and evolution are disappointing. The \\"enigma\\" of the Cambrian explosion seems to have been explained by Andrew Parker (see his book In the Blink of an Eye) in a way that undercuts Rare Earth's use of it (dramatic changes of this nature seem very likely when eyes first evolve). This theory was apparently first published in a technical journal in 1998 (i.e. before Rare Earth).They often assume that intelligence could only develop as it has in humans, even suggesting that it couldn't evolve in the ocean, which is rather odd given how close the octopus is to qualifying. But the various arguments in the book are independent enough that the weak parts don't have much affect on the rest of the arguments.I was surprised that they never mentioned the Fermi Paradox, which I consider to be the strongest single argument for their position. Apparently they don't give it much thought because they don't expect technological growth to produce effects that encompass more than our planet and are visible at galactic distances.Their concern over biodiversity seems rather misplaced. I can understand why people who overestimate mother nature's benevolence think that preserving the status quo is a safe strategy for humanity, but it seems to me that anyone sharing Rare Earth's belief that nature could wipe us out any time now should tend to prefer a strategy of putting more of our effort into creating technology that will allow us to survive natural disasters.I am disappointed that they rarely attempt to quantify the range of probabilities they would consider reasonable for the risks they discuss.Stephen Webb has written a book on roughly the same subject called Where is Everybody? that is more carefully argued, but less entertaining, than Rare Earth."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Excellent history of the development of life, complex and otherwise, on planet Earth including a listing of the variables involved in the development, e.g. the right star size, mass and composition, the animal habitable zone, formation of the moon, existence of the Jovian planets, etc., but still not enough to make a final conclusion on Earth's exclusivity.The Drake and Rare Earth equations mentioned cannot and should not be used, at least for the time being, to calculate the possible number a civilizations in our galaxy due to lack of required verifiable values.The whole Rare Earth idea is based on available information from a sample of one subject only, planet Earth, and on processes that we are just beginning to understand. Until we get additional empirical data, albeit at a distance, on the existence of other terrestrial planets, we might be able to come to a reasonable estimate of the abundance of Earth like planets. Also, we must keep in mind that there might be other conditions equally conducive to the development of complex life that we cannot even imagine. Case in point, the extra solar planets discovered have giving us an idea of the different possibilities for the formation of planets, in this case gas giants with highly elliptical orbits or orbits to close to the parent star, we never thought possible before. We must not assume that the structure of our solar system is the only possible configuration.One should not conclude that planet Earth might be unique in the galaxy, or the universe for that matter, or that the galaxy might be teeming with advanced civilizations. Both extremes should be avoided. It is probable that life exits out there due to the sheer number of stars in the universe, must probably carbon based, but then again the probability of finding out conclusively, or making contact at all, are also remote due to the vast distances involved.A strong case has been made for microbial life, extremophiles, but we still need more data by exploring Mars, Titan or Europa so we can get a definite confirmation. If microbial life is found on these harsh environments, then we will have a strong case for existence of life, at least microbial, in the universe.AC.CHB"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Absolutely stunning! This is exactly the book on extraterrestrial life that I had been waiting for years to read. Now finally it has been written! While some of the reviewers below may claim that the authors have failed to make their case that Earth is a unique planet, they miss the point entirely. Of course there is no way to prove conclusively that we are alone in the universe. Such proof will not be possible until we have been engaged in interstellar exploration for many centuries. What this book does illustrate are the many factors that went into making our planet and how it wasn't as easy or straightforward as the SETI astronomer crowd would have us believe. Like I said, the authors may not have proven conclusively that we are alone. But if you're a gambler, you'll agree that after reading Rare Earth that the odds are more favorable that we are one of a kind, rather than sharing the galaxy with 10,000 other civilizations.

Their arguments can be summarized as &quot;complex life is very fragile and the universe is very violent. Conditions must remain perfect over an extrodinarily long period of time for complex life to have the opportunity to form&quot; The authors simply examine the &quot;perfect&quot; conditions which have been in affect for us for 4 billion years and conclude that it is that very unlikly stability to which we owe our existence. The factors which provide for that stability are numerous and the probabilities of those factors all occuring simultaneously and remaining in affect for sufficiently lengthy periods of time can not be expected to be statistically common, but, indeed, very, very rare."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Promotes the idea that Earth-like environments are rare in the universe based on the multitude of things that had to go just right for our planet for us to be here."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The authors delve deeply into the eons geological and biological evoloution that brought life to Earth.

I don't know if I agree or not but I found this a fascinating read regardless.[...]."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"While I think that it would be fascinating if (hypothetically)we do someday discover evidence of another habitable planet around a distant star in the Universe, I think that the authors Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee raise important questions about what makes Earth a habitable planet. They bring up many considerations of habitability that one often doesn't think of (for example, the presence of a large moon, of Jupiter, of plate tectonics, and also the metal content of the Sun compared to other stars). Of course, I think we know too little about other solar systems to be able to say whether or not these factors are truly rare (even the book at times acknowledges this), so it is premature to draw any firm conclusions about whether there are other habitable planets. But I do think that, if we wish to do an honest assessment of whether extraterrestrial life (or for that matter, another habitable planet) is likely to exist, we need to at least ask these questions. It is very interesting to read about the factors making Earth habitable, whether or not you agree with the conclusion.Although this is a scientific (not a theological) book, I will also mention that I am a believing Catholic. So I believe that it is up to God whether Earth is the only inhabited world, or whether there are others (to my knowledge, the Church takes no official position on extraterrestrials). I believe that it is providential that the conditions on Earth are so favorable for life, and that the same would be true of other habitable planets (if they exist).I am inclined to support searches for other habitable planets, provided such searches are conducted as a legitimate scientific inquiry and search for the truth, and not for some other hidden agenda. But again, if the conclusions of this book are correct, it is likely that such planets would be rare (if they even exist) in the Universe, and thus, at best, hard to find.I recommend this book for helping to understand the factors that make a habitable planet, and also one can learn a lot of astronomy, biology, and geology in the process."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a fascinating topic and the authors did a good job of explaining their thesis. For the lay reader, however, some parts may be a bit technical and explained in too much detail. I almost think this could have been better presented to the non-scientist reader as a long magazine article rather than a full book.However, that is minor criticism; there were many intriguing ideas presented in this book. And I should really give it 5 stars -- the extra star awarded to the authors for debunking the ideas of that pompous populist, Carl Sagan (I can just hear him saying...&quot;Only one civilization in the galaxy? NO! Billions and billions and billions...&quot;)."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The authors Ward and Brownlee provide a necessary corrective to speculation that has for too long been accepted as fact. The efforts and beliefs of Carl Sagan and his ilk are not conclusively disputed, but an alternative interpretation of the available knowledge show them to be dream castles built on a very slight foundation. Although the authors make a strong claim of certainty about their conclusions, they admit toward the end that, until a great deal more information is available, everything said about extra-terrestrial life is only supposition. Their conclusions may in fact be unproveable or un-disprovable unless technology advances much further than the present day.The book itself may seem to the scientifically educated elementary in parts, but it's addressed to the non-specialist and the general reader. Outside of its purpose, the review of the state-of-the-art of various fields I found immensely helpful and informative. The writing is crisp and clear, and no one should have any trouble with it.

Badly. This exaggerated view of our uniqueness is as unwarranted as its opposite: that ET intelligent life resides around nearly every star waiting to enlighten us. Speculations about the rarity of extra-solar planets, plate tectonics, a large moon, and Jovian planets are all unnaturally forced to support the author's' glass-half-empty view. But the evidence cited consists largely of a highly selective smattering of theoretical speculations that are superficially understood and over-interpreted. And some facts are even downright wrong (The human genome has less than 100,000 genes, not &quot;millions&quot;). In the absence of clear evidence pro or con, these authors have simply opted for the anti view. Alas, their final conclusion is unlikely to be proven right or wrong anytime soon."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Finally, a book written by respected scientists that debunks the modern myth of a universe filled with cuddly, bug-eyed aliens who just happen to have a penchant for anal probing and cattle mutilation!

Then it goes on to explain, in convincing fashion, why &quot;maybe not&quot; may very well be the truth.I found the book to be very readable, even though there were a few obvious scientific mistakes (and in the introduction, the authors would have us believe that Copernicus was Danish, not Polish) but all in all, I think that I came away with a far better understanding of geophysics, the way the Earth was formed and the way plate tectonics works.There were many times I found myself reading an assertion and then thinking, &quot;well, maybe... we don't have enough evidence for such-and-such yet to know one way or the other.&quot; However, the book does make one extremely timely and, in my opinion, urgent point-- if there are planets out there with life on them, we need to start developing the tools with which to find them. Not to knock the efforts of SETI, but I think that we'd probably do a better job of finding life out there if we were to put extremely large telescopes into our orbit and start looking for Earthlike planets and, if we find some, look for the chemical signatures of life on these planets. We cannot start out from the assumption that there is intelligent life on other worlds and that these intelligent beings must have mastered the concept of communication via electromagnetic waves. I think it behooves us to first find out if any life exists anywhere else, then from there, we can better extrapolate how likely it is that life eventually becomes complex and intelligent in time.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of our solar system, astronomy, geology and evolution.

The problem with the Drake Equation advocates' position, which posits that intelligent life is common in our galaxy and others, is that it is based on a purely but faulty statistical argument. They say that because there are so many millions of billions of stars, that therefore there must be a great many cases of intelligent life. Frank Drake and Carl Sagan then tried to concoct a formula that would estimate their hypothetical position.
