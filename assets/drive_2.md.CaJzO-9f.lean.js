It is a reprint in the style of the original 1932 edition with the bonus of color plates. \\"I do not presume to explain how to paint, but only how to get enjoyment.\\" With unabashed openness he describes his awakening awareness of nature, the joy of fixing a mess quickly, planning and adjusting to the needs of the painting. \\"I think this heightened sense of observation of Nature is one of the chief delights that have come to me through trying to paint.\\" Anyone who paints beginner to professional will benefit as they get to know Winston Churchill at his leisure. A great gift for a painter friend."},{"Title":"Hi Bob!: A Self-Help Guide to the Bob Newhart Show","review":"The author pretty comprehensively looks at all of the major and minor characters in the classic series. Unfortunately, Bob Newhart himself chose not to cooperate with him, so he had to ask others about him and refer to magazine interviews with Newhart.The &quot;episode guide&quot;, in my opinion, could have included more detail about each episode. There's only a one- or two-sentence synopsis of the plot.For all of the inconsistencies Green points out about Bob's age and other details over the years, he omits a big one: in the episode in which Bob treats a Chicago Cub player, the plot calls for the Cubs to play a night game at Wrigley Field in the 70's."},{"Title":"Hi Bob!: A Self-Help Guide to the Bob Newhart Show","review":"at times a hilarious series.my favorites are those that take place in group sessions. the actors portraying bob's patients are perfectly assayed. the series deserves something - something better. it is all here but it is underwhelming. the problem with \\"hi bob!\\" is the lack of organization and dearth of flow. the text needed editing and was thin on photos. nice price, good condition for a paperback."},{"Title":"The Tarot","review":"Nancy Shavick's &quot;The Tarot&quot; is a clearly written guide for interpretting the tarot from an enlightened, spiritually based perspective. The card interpretations are positive, insightful and growth-focused. Nancy's interpretations, when put into practice can lead individuals to more fully understanding their life lessons, and how to create change to address both inner and worldly issues.&quot;The Tarot&quot; is written in such a way that it would be appropriate for both the novice as well as the experienced tarot reader. It provides the &quot;how-tos&quot; of conducting a reading which the novice would find easy to follow. Additionally, Nancy's unique interpretations would be appreciated by many experienced tarot practioners. The interpretations address topics that are of interest to most individuals (e.g. relationships, work, creativity, personal goals). Most notibly, the book is conscise and does not overwhelm the reader with excessive dialogue, spreads, or cumbersome techniques."},{"Title":"The Tarot","review":"As the other reviewer wrote, Nancy Shavick does have an excellent, spiritually oriented approach. She never stoops to fortune telling, but rather helps you uncover your path via the tarot. Her insight and relentlessly positive, enlightened/enlightening approach is awesome. By using her books I have become quite an intuitive tarot reader. I continue to use her books as references when I do layouts, because she offers so many different facets for each card. I use this book along with \\"The Tarot Reader\\" when I do readings, because I always get some more nuance by considering the many different points she makes. Those are the only two tarot books I will ever need."},{"Title":"Regulating Doctors (Civil Society)","review":"This is a very well written tract which explores the continued deterioration in the facade of professionalism of doctors which gained most exposure under Mrs. Thatcher's withering competitive stare.The quality of each of the papers is very high under the editorship of David Gladstone and is a useful contribution to the continuing debate over healthcare which dominates social policy thinking in the major western industrialised nations.Whithin the domestic British political system, at least to my knowledge within the Conservative party, one of the easiest ways to gain a voice was to denounce a conference motion as not going far enough. In the case of this tract it is an easy enough target. Whilst it is certainly true that consumers have made significant advances in exposing the doctor's closed shop to public view, albeit in the light of a series of tragedies which befell patients, the closed shop still exists. It is certainly an improvement that the professional body which governs doctors' performance has instituted reforms but that in itself is neither a necessary nor suffient condition for the changes that are required to occur.This is the only criticism I have of the book but I feel that it is a crucial one. The mission of the Institute for the Study of Civil Society is to examine the institutions and institutional structures compatible with balancing the role of the state such that politics does not dominate. Here I feel that more radical ideas need to be considered rather than gradualist reforms.The Thatcher governments introduced the notion of competition into healthcare provision which hitherto had been provided by the monolithic entity of the Nationalised Health Service. Rather than tinker, the contributors should think the unthinkable to break the stranglehold of doctor's monopoly power and introduce competitive elemnts into all aspects of medical provision. The effects of such competition would provide more realistic benchmarks of performance together with transparent processes by which the consumers of health, patients, hospitals, administrators etc could more accurately judge quality and cost of that provision.Not to be churlish, these papers are somewhat of a step in the right direction nut the authors ought not to be cowed by the medical establishment in serious consideration of badly needed radical reform in healthcare provision."},{"Title":"Twenty-Four Piano Studies for the Left Hand, Op. 718 (Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics, Vol. 60)","review":"Here's another forgotten book filled with juicy exercises guaranteed to improve your piano speed and fluency. Czerny's studies sound Scarlattian, and like Scarlatti, they're great for the Intermediate student who's run up against the wall of his ability and wants to play faster and with a more fluid tone.I was desperate to play Barber's \\"Excursions\\", #1, but I was tripping over my own left hand. I bought Czerny's Studies, practiced, and then, honest to goodness, my left hand began to outrun my right! It's a pleasant change from other Czerny, and I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"I am glad I found and purchased this book. The quality of the storytelling is pretty good, it kept me absorbed and turning the pages three nights in a row, up past my bedtime so I was tired at work the following mornings.There are two protagonists in the book, Stoney and Jarrat, officers in NARC. They are like futuristic sci-fi versions of the DEA. Keegan is obviously a sci-fi aficionado, the descriptions of the high-tech weaponry, armor and spaceships were very illustrative and added a lot to the story.The plot - and subplots - were well done. The main plot involves bringing down a drug-running crimelord, Mavvik. Jarrat starts the story out undercover, and of course everything that can go wrong goes wrong, and the heros have to help each other out of various scrapes. The other major plot is the relationship between Jarrat and Stone. The tension between the two was great for most of the book. It kept me waiting and excited about when they finally get together, and was one of the reasons I kept turning the pages. The payoff in that regard was good but not as climactic as I was hoping, although I'm not sure I can put my finger on why. Maybe it should have waited until book 2 (which I haven't read yet but fully intend to), just because it would have built anticipation even more, and in a way distracted from the plot.The most well done character was, in my opinion, Evelyn. She is a minor character who serves a critical role, and seemed to be the most realistic, well-drawn of the bunch. The most relatable, perhaps. The dynamic between her, her younger brother, and each of the characters she interacts with was tangible.The sex scenes were explicit, but did not overwhelm the story. The book is definitely sci-fi with a few erotic scenes, as opposed to erotica with a few sci-fi scenes.Anyhow, I will be reading book 2. I recommend this book to fans of gay sci-fi. I can't give it 5 stars, but it is a good read, and I am proud to add it to my collection."},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"Set in a high tech future this book reminded me of a japanese robot anime!We have two great, sexy characters, partners in the paramilitary force called NARC who fight against the vicious drug cartels who run whole planets.Jarrat &amp; Stone are a great pair of heroes, and the author has created a fantastic futuristic world of high tech gadgets and hardware.If you like pure escapist entertainment with a terrific story-line and non-stop action then this is the book for you. It also has lashings of great gaysex!"},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"The only other Mel Keegan I have read was The Deceivers which was WOW. This, NARC, etc, was well written probably because that's what the man does. But the long build up to the romance is only wonderful when the payoff is wonderful. I can't tell you how flat that fell. Also, you had both heroes traumatically trashed by bad guys and the revenge again was disappointing. Only the Big Baddie who orders the beating/rape is fought one on one (and he came off smarter than the good guys which doesn't help). But just because the Big Baddie behind it all is the root cause of your trouble doesn't mean that a man seeking revenge doesn't need to see the actual perprator pay--and not long distance either. That doesn't work for the rape victim in my opinion and I know it doesn't work for the reader who has gone through it w/him or in this case, w/them.I'm still very much looking forward to Keegan's historical novels/adventures, but I will skip the rest of this particular series."},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"I like sci-fi and fantasy novels with strong characterizations. After reading this book and the sequel &quot;Equinox&quot;, Jarrat and Stone seem like living, breathing characters. I am not sure how many people still read Chester Himes' Coffin Ed Johnson, Gravedigger Jones mysteries. If you overlook the obvious disimilarities, Jarrat and Stone remind me of Himes' heroic policemen. Each alone is good at what he does. Together, they are unstoppable. I would trust my life to either crime fighting duo."},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"The Narc series is chronicled over four novels and a novella (NARC 3 1/2), published over a wide span of years, from 1991 to 2007.The narrative style is uneven, but improves somewhat towards the end of the series - the author tends to forget that the reader is not inside his head and privy to his thoughts.The two narcotics agency enforcers and co-captains of space carrier 'NARC Athena', Kevin Jarrat and Jerry Stone, are lovers. In a high-tech, inter-galactic society they fight and crush 'Angel' cartels, Angel being a devastatingly lethal drug. Each of the books of the series deals with the eradication of a cartel on a colony world; the final book with a cartel on the home world. The books are written over a sort of template, which can become somewhat tedious and repetitive.There are interesting, even likeable, characters in the books and loads of action. There are too much emphasis on guns for my taste, but that could just be me.I like that the sex episodes are not over the top and fits naturally into the story line.I am in doubt whether to give three or four stars, but as I bought all five books and read them with some enjoyment, I think three stars would be a bit harsh, so four it is. Could I, like Mel Keegan, use 3 1/2 I'd do that.I have trouble reconciling myself with the fact that this is the author of 'Fortunes of War' (1995); 'Fortunes' being far the better book, in my opinion - I even included it in my listmania on Amazon.com. But Mel Keegan's authorship is very uneven, encompassing books that are downright annoying and amateurish, at least to me.NARC 1: Death's Head 1991NARC 2: Equinox 1993NARC 3: Scorpio 2004NARC 3 1/2: Stopover 2007NARC 4: Aphelion 2007This book is bought by me as paperbacks on Amazon.co.uk"},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"Once you start, you are in for an exciting roller coaster ride. I just could not put it down and finished it in a day. Death's Head definitely ranks with Fortunes of War as my favorite Keegan books. Both protagonists, Jarrat and Stone, are intriguing, sexy and alluring, the perfect heroes of a great and solid science fiction. Their devotion and love for one another makes the book shines. The plot itself is sophisticated and races along brilliantly to an exciting finish. Not really as the future of the lovers are to be continued in Equinox, the sequel which I am desperately trying to get my hands on. Simply a great book not to be missed"},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"This is a fast-paced, very sexy SF adventure set in the 23rd Century. Co-captains in the paramilitary force NARC, Kevin Jarrat and Jerry Stone hide their secret desire for each other while battling the drug syndicate that manufactures and distributes the lethal drug Angel. When Stony is kidnapped and forced onto Angel, his only hope is Jarrat--and a really unique cure. DEATH'S HEAD has it all: action, sex, romance, high-tech weapons, adventure.... the copy I have is the new print from dreamcraft and contains an extra 20,000 words not in the original http://www.dream-craft.com/melkeegan/ they even have stocks of Equinox and the 3rd book Scorpio (printed 2004)"},{"Title":"Death's Head","review":"I'm not quite sure just how old this book is (I never did check the date is was published). While there are a number of interesting characters and unique ideas, there are also many times where it reads like a bad action movie, where the main character does some needlessly masculine posturing in order to... to do what, I don't know. Most of the times he does it, it's really kinda just irritating and detracts from the flow of the story itself. There's also this big deal about this drug or something that maybe kills you slowly after you take it no matter what, and is more or less like a non-sexually transmitted AIDs. Having more than had my fill of reading gay stories that deal with some sort of killer disease it was something of a continual annoyance to keep reading about how this futuristic society with laser guns and empaths couldn't seem to find a cure for some reason or something. I don't mean to make my review sound negative or anything though, it's just that all the minor annoyances were pretty much equal to all the minor pleasures of the book, so it more or less just broke even.All that aside though it's passibly entertaining if you like the Space Exploration genre. If you dig games like Starcraft, the Dune books, or Star Trek, you'll probably be entertained by this for a while. I myself didn't find it particularly terrible, and I don't regret reading the book. It's just that afterwards, I just didn't feel the need to read either the first one in the series (if there is one, which I think there is) or the next one (if there is a next one). It was pretty alright."},{"Title":"We Belong to the Land: The Story of a Palestinian Israeli Who Lives for Peace and Reconciliation","review":"I have had the privilege of spending 10 days with Abuna Elias Chacour in Ibillin. This book tells of not only the struggle of the Palestinian people who have been robbed of their land and heritage, but also about the enduring faith and selflessness of Abuna Chacour. He has devoted his life to making a better life for Palestinians so that one day they may live side by side with the Jews. He does not preach a message of hate, but rather one of love. We are all God's children and should act like it. If one responds to violence with more violence then the ugly cycle will never end.... but, enough from me, Abuna is able to tell these messages so much better..."},{"Title":"We Belong to the Land: The Story of a Palestinian Israeli Who Lives for Peace and Reconciliation","review":"We Belong to the Land offers a perspective to the Palestinian situation that rarely is seen. Abuna Elias Chacour gives a first hand account of the occupation of Palestine by the Zionists from the Palestinian point of view. It was amazing to learn that the Jews were initially welcomed to Palestine by most Palestinians and were not rejected until Palestinian cities were distroyed and Palestinian communities eradicated. Chacour's personal story is the story of Biram, a small Palestinian village that was leveled by the Israeli Army. To this day (or atleast to the time of publication)the people of Biram are forced to live in exile, unable to return to there ancient home. The truely amaxing thing about this story, however, is not the way the Zionists treated the native people like Abuna Chacour, but the great work that he has done to reconcile the Jews and Palestinians. This is a truely uplifting story that shows there is hope for peace in Palestine despite the harsh rule of the Israeli government. A must read for anyone looking for the true story of the modern state of Israel."},{"Title":"We Belong to the Land: The Story of a Palestinian Israeli Who Lives for Peace and Reconciliation","review":"I bought this to support this peace maker in Israel.

That would be &quot;'Ulysses' Annotated.&quot; But, Ellmann's views on Joyce's masterpiece are extremely valuable to those who've read Joyce, and more than once. Like Lang in his &quot;Music of Western Civilization,&quot; Ellmann says much in little space. I'd say a top 10 book on &quot;Ulysses,&quot; all told."},{"Title":"Ulysses on the Liffey","review":"Certainly ULYSSES ON THE LIFFEY is a very close scrutiny of some of the lesser discussed aspects of Joyce's mammoth comic book. You can always depend on Richard Ellmann to give us the way-beneath-the-surface innuendoes and meanings of Joyce's writings. But because Ellmann is also so close to the life of the writer (he'd written the best biography of James Joyce) he, quite rightfully I believe, draws references from Joyce's experiences that went into the thinking and writing of ULYSSES.By no means is this intended to be an introduction to ULYSSES. This is meant for the serious student of arguably Ireland's greatest 20th century writer, and the 20th century's most influential novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses on the Liffey","review":"Contains detail on how Joyce developed Ulysses' structure based on Homer's Odyssey. It includes the types of revisions he made to his structure as he wrote, while undergoing his own \\"odyssey\\" through Italy. I didn't learn as much from this as from Ellmann's other books. I did find it parts of it intriguing: his connection with J.M. Synge; admiration for \\"Riders to the Sea\\" and relief that Synge wasn't interested in Aristotle's philosophy, leaving Joyce free to develop Aristotle's ideas in his own way. Joyce comes through this book as working consciously to define himself as unique, staking out terrain in \\"Ulysses\\" unclaimed by his Irish contemporaries."},{"Title":"Andre Citroen: The Man and the Motor Cars","review":"For those with even a passing interest in Citroen cars or the company's founder this book will prove educational and fascinating. The Citroen car, though scarce in the US, is always reverred by automotive journalists, when they are forced to write about the cars. For instance, Autoweek Magazine's inclusion of Citroens in their greatest cars of the century issue. Okay the book, it is well written unlike so many auto books; entertaining, full of interesting info about Andre Citroen's unlikely role as auto entrepreneur, and Paris and France. Mostly, you will be very impressed by the relatively unknown (in USA) Citroen company's major contributions to automotive engineering and efforts in World War II. If you consider yourself knowledgable of cars, include this book and you never refer to a Citroen as an ugly car again. I read this book at the library and probably will buy my own copy."},{"Title":"Larry Csonka (Superstars)","review":"Larry, your T.V. Outdoor shows are great.Eight years and still going strong.

The author mysteriously states that these are somehow attached to their shoulders, and that when released, it \\"would allow the parachute to drop down on its harness and become their seat cushion.\\" This, of course, is pure fantasy. Holding the parachute by its leg straps across one's shoulder was just a handy way to carry a seat-pack parachute prior to putting it on. The author's erroneous explanation is typical of many inaccuracies throughout the book. Another is his constant inaccurate reference to the \\"U.S. Army Air Corps\\" during World War Two. The Army Air Corps (AAC) ceased to exist in June of 1941, some six months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and our subsequent entry into World War Two. The Army Air Corps (AAC) was supplanted by the Army Air Forces (AAF) and the Army Air Forces (AAF) was the branch of service in which military personnel served during the entire war. There was no longer any \\"Army Air Corps.\\" The author even has the original P-80 as a plane used by \\"The U.S. Army Air Corps.\\" This, too, is a typical erroneous figment of his imagination.The book does present accurate information here and there. But, with so many inaccuracies also included, it's difficult to discern one from the other.Carl B. Jordan"},{"Title":"Eject!: The Complete History of U.S. Aircraft Escape Systems","review":"I had really mixed feelings about this book. On the plus side, it provides a comprehensive general description of all the major U.S. aircraft emergency escape systems. On the minus side, there are some factual errors pertaining to the aircraft information given, typographic errors, and little information on the more technical/engineering aspects of ejection seats themselves. Each major escape system described usually includes a short history of some of the aircraft that used it. This is where I found most of the factual errors. I would have liked to see less material about the aircraft and more about the ejection systems themselves.With that said, it is really hard to fault this book since it is one of the very few written about this somewhat obscure subject. It does deliver what is promised in the title; it presents a (general) HISTORY of U.S. aircraft escape systems. This history includes ejection seats, jettisonable noses, encapsuled seats, and ejectable crew modules.

Then the author made the experience plummet sooo deep. The book contains some pictures that one hasn't other places. ...but this guy brags about have being an engineer. But there is hardly anything about interesting mechanics/physics. Not too much about general engineering, except a little in the cases about encapsulated seats and crew escape modules where the end results became spectacular. There is a lot about who piloted which plane and which grade he had, even the details of the pilots in the chase planes! futile attention to the serial numbers of the planes. Almost endless unnecessary rows of adjectives in description of every plane that is mention, of the kind that everyone reading this book knows anyway. (\\"Yes we all know that the B-1 is blended between its fuselage and wings; Do you plan to make this a topic too, just trying to impress us??\\") And the there is all these attempts to try to impress by suddenly going into an unnecessary passive grammar. Or having visited to synonym list to se if there is a multisyllable word that can replace a shorter one, just to seem \\"wise\\".Please, someone: Rip out all the good stuff in this book, and put it into a new and better one: One with physics, general design. New stories. The Brits and Germans must have someone. Didn't the Germans eject all the time in the sixties, when they started to use the F-104 as fighter bombers? What about the French, the other Europeans, and perhaps former enemies? And didn't one of the companies Tuttle worked for make the seats for the first successful inverted ejection, near the surface and for real? Without Tuttle mentioning it at all.But it's amuzing to browse in, and it should be a nice book for the public library later today."},{"Title":"Are clowns hatched?","review":"I was a five-year-old in Kindergarten when I got to meet Chucko The Birthday Clown face-to-face.

I've read all the Thoroughbred Series, the Saddle Club books, Farley, etc., pretty much everything available;this beats 'em all! The character of Katie was so real and wonderful and strong without being a spoiled brat. Her relationship with her mother and friends and the trainer who encouraged her were all so warm and real. It just makes you feel good and hopeful but it's also exciting. More Chris Platt books, please!"},{"Title":"Willow King (Random House Riders) (No.1)","review":"This a awesome book that I absolutly have to reccomend. It is about a girl named Katie who saves a foal who is about to be put down because he has crooked legs. She feels a strong bond between her and the foal because she was born with one leg shorter than the other, similar to the foal. Katie trains Willow King, the foal, and straightens his legs. Along the way, ahe has to deal with her enemy, Cindy because Cindy is using Katie's beloved show horse, Jester so Katie can train Willow. She also has to deal with a boy named Jason, whom she befriends. I strongly recomend this book to anyone who would like a good read. Even if you are not a horse fanatic like me, I think you will like it."},{"Title":"Willow King (Random House Riders) (No.1)","review":"Willow King by Chris Platt is the most exciting and entertaining horse book I have yet read. Katie Durham's struggles in raising the crippled Willow King into a quality racehorse teaches the young girl something about herself as well. Gifted with such a strong spirit, King never gives up in the process of straightening his legs; Katie, possibly short on self-confidence in certain areas of her life, learns from her horse that one must never fall in the face of defeat. Dealing with a snobby neighbor girl and a handsome ninth-grader only adds to the excitement of the tale. Will Willow King be able to correct his crooked leg problem, and be able to go on and win such races as the Kentucky Derby as Katie dreams? Willow King is definitely a must-read, far outshining other novels in its class."},{"Title":"Willow King (Random House Riders) (No.1)","review":"Willow King will leave the reader breathless with anticipation!

When the owner decides he should be put down, Katie begs to be the one to own him. Finally, Willow King is hers! Together Katie feels that they will be able to reach the top.

Meanwhile she has problems with a snob, who is leasing her horse in order to pay for Willow King.

Explains complex networks and hierarchies of concepts, mental structures, and conceptual systems, and how conceptual systems develop so that a new conceptual system eventually provides greater explanatory coherence than the previous conceptual system. Covers conceptual hierarchy transformation and how concepts are recombined, added into, and deleted from large-scale conceptual systems. Brings Kuhn's theory to completion, resulting in a fully powerful way of thinking about conceptual revolution in any domain, thus intellectual conversion in general."},{"Title":"Conceptual Revolutions","review":"It's clear, logical, easily understandable and has a table that is extremely insightful, helpful and practical for anyone who wants to turn a situation, process or change into a multi-step plan.Yes, it builds on Kuhn. But it goes a bit further.

Using the Sabian Oracle will help you discover what's going on and why, leading to deeper self-awareness. You are able to make more informed choices and greatly enhance your life.\\" Lynda Hill, author of 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian OracleIn 1925, an extraordinary thing happened: two people--a clairvoyant medium and an astrologer--received messages from the spirit world for every degree of the Zodiac. Within each of the 12 constellations of the Zodiac, also known as Sun Signs, are 30 degrees--for a total of 360 degrees.Astrologer Marc Edmund Jones wanted to participate in an experiment with his spiritualist-medium friend Elsie Wheeler. A gifted clairvoyant, Miss Wheeler was afflicted with severe arthritis and confined to a wheelchair, making movement difficult and painful. Nevertheless, she agreed to participate in this experiment with Jones in a public park; he wanted to be surrounded by the vibrations of modern American life, but not be disturbed by passers-by. Thus, Balboa Park in San Diego was the birthplace of the Sabian Symbols.Jones made up a set of 360 index cards that were blank, save for a small notation of the Sign and degree number on one side (e.g. Aries 1, Scorpio 20--all the way up to Pisces 30). Jones shuffled the cards and placed the blank side up before Miss Wheeler. Neither of them knew the Sign or number on the card. Miss Wheeler would then report what she saw in her mind's eye...hurriedly noting the information on the card.Amazingly, Elsie's psychic visions formulated the entire Sabian Symbols at random--completing all 360 Symbols in one day! On average, Miss Wheeler would have had to visualize a Symbol every minute and half. Jones believed that Miss Wheeler was given information by an \\"unseen agency\\": a \\"Brother\\" from the Sabian Brotherhood who were an ancient Middle Eastern race of alchemists. The Sabian Symbols are a set of 360 phrases consisting of as little as two words (Virgo 2: \\"A Harem\\") to as many as 21 words (Taurus 5: \\"A Youthful Widow, Fresh and Soul-Cleansed from Grief, Kneels at an Open Grave to Receive the Secret of Eternal Life\\").Author Lynda Hill has a crafted an amazing book and oracle based on the Sabian Symbols: 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian Oracle. This book includes 42 cards to perform a reading: 12 red cards for the Signs, and 30 blue cards for each degree. Ask a question, pick a blue and red card, and then let the Symbols guide you to an answer. An entire page is dedicated to each Symbol, and features a commentary, oracle message, keywords, and a caution. In the page margins, Ms. Hill has included 5-9 quotations that reflect the message of each Symbol. At 363 pages, 360 Degrees of Wisdom also features Birthday Tables, which shows you the 3 degrees relevant to your birth date. She profiles several celebrities--such as Deepak Chopra, Michael Jackson, and Princess Diana--to demonstrate how the Sabian Symbols mirror the circumstances of your life.In addition to using the cards provided with the book, Ms. Hill also shows you how to use 2 decks of regular playing cards (one red, one blue) in case you lose the cards that came with the book. She also shows you how to open the book at random to receive your special message.I used the Sabian Oracle last night for insight into a back ailment that I've been dealing with. I picked a blue card and red card at random to get Scorpio: 20. Chillingly accurate, Scorpio: 20 A Woman Drawing Aside Two Dark Curtains That Closed The Entrance To A Sacred Pathway is not only the exact degree of Mercury in my natal chart (and one degree away from my Venus placement), but also this Sabian Symbol echoed the message I received from another oracle consulted a few days prior.More accessible than the Tarot and easier to use than the I Ching, 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian Oracle will help you discover a modern and fascinating branch of mysticism and symbolic readings. I highly recommend this insightful and comprehensive book!"},{"Title":"360 Degrees of Wisdom","review":"I own a variety of the Sabian Symbols books by various authors, which are all insightful. However, Lynda's book is brilliant and by far the best I've had the pleasure to read to date. I give it a solid ten for skill, precision and prompting the reader to perceive their own messages. Lynda is also very available to her public and has a website, where you can use her free Sabian Oracle, talk to others in a web forum and even email her if personally if you feel the desire to do so.

I am very happy with the depthof each symbol, and the images are interesting and beautifulto imagine - My only complaint is, I thought the Sabian symbolswould be illustrated in the book, but they are not. I will haveto keep looking for the visual component of the system, but afteryears with other divination-type cards - animals, angels,runes, tarot etc - this is differentand refreshingly appropriate for me at this time."},{"Title":"360 Degrees of Wisdom","review":"I was really looking forward to this book and I wasn't disappointed. Lynda has obviously worked very hard to illuminate our understanding of how the meanings of the Sabian Symbols can be applied to any branch of astrology, and her comments on each degree-symbol are well thought-out, comprehensive and very informative.The cards themselves are easily detachable at the back of the book and make a great conversation-opener when placed strategically on the coffee-table!The book opens with a brief history of the Sabian Symbols; how they were brought forward into the world via the clairvoyance of Elsie Wheeler and the astrological foresight of Marc Edmund Jones. It continues with advice on how to use the symbols in a birthchart, and this advice is straightforward and easy to follow.The bulk of the book is devoted to a comprehensive interpretation of each degree symbol using the format \\"Commentary\\", \\"Oracle\\", \\"Keywords\\" and \\"Caution\\", and what I particularly appreciate is the way Lynda says at the bottom of each page \\"What does this symbol say to you?\\". This leaves room for your own mind to work on the symbolism, so you're not left feeling as though you are being brainwashed with someone else's ideas.Finally, Lynda includes on each page a selection of quotations - some profound, some wise, some downright hilarious - that illustrate the core-meanings of each symbol and help you to \\"get\\" the heart of the message.Not only is this an excellent book, and one I would recommend to any serious student of astrology, but the oracle cards really do work, sometimes in a very literal fashion! I have used them several times and they have always amazed me...Well done, Lynda Hill! This is obviously a labour of love."},{"Title":"360 Degrees of Wisdom","review":"I am a professional astrologer and use this reference constantly. Lynda has taken the Sabian Symbols and made them extremely accessible. A full page for each degree with quotes and commentary to illuminate a functional interpretation of the symbol.

The psychological insights into his love life are fascinating. The possibility that Antonie Brentano, his secret lover, attended the premier of the Ninth Symphony is fascinating. The author's touches of humor are throughout: at the end, the mother of little Hosenknopft, who stayed away at night listening to the composers broadwood piano across the street, remarks, \\"I wish Herr Beethoven had composed lullabies.\\""},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"This fiction has the weight and authority of truth. Antonie was certainly his lover,and the reason why the two star-crossed lovers never made it permanent is convincingly stated by the author, who clearly is devoted to the composer and his lady-love. The narrative description of Beethoven dropping his britches and making love to this lovely woman is breathtaking-- not to be missed. And the author's insight into the music is stunning. Reading the book made me want to go back and listen to the \\"complete works\\" as if that could be done in an evening or two."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"This book took me from the infancy of a genius to his last days at his piano and in the arms of his immortal beloved. So convincing is it , that if you had any doubt that Antonie Brentano was Beethoven's secret lover, this book will remove all doubt-- entirely convincing. It is a fast moving narrative, not a study, but it is sound. Even where we know the author is improvising, he is convincing. I find it believable that Antonie heard the premier of the Ninth Symphony-- not a shred of evidence, but it is the right conclusion to the premise of the book and its logical momentum. This book stays in the library to be picked up again and again."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"As a retired music teacher in high schools and middle schools in New York and New Jersey, I remember my frustrations trying to inculcate a love for music in my students. They preferred pop music and rock, because sexuality was foremost on their minds. Well, if I had Mr. Gregory's book about Beethoven's love-life and the way his music is often a species of love music, like the Fourth Symphony, I would have made it assigned reading. Who knows? Maybe it would have brought a new convert into the fold of music lovers.

Bravo, and a house full of clapping hands for this."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"Anyone who loves music loves Beethoven,and anyone who loves Beethoven must love Antonie Brentano, and anyone who loves her must thank Carter Gregory, the author of My Angel Leonora. The book is a triumph of imagination, always consistent with scholarship. Where the author indulges in fiction, he tells us in the Introduction. The narrative is full of psychological themes, for example, Louis as a child is bathed by his mother when he comes down with smallpox. As an adult he stands out in the rain, as if he needed to be washed from some defilement. Near the end, he is bathed by Antonie. The descriptions of the miusic are fabulous. And what an original thought that the Seventh Symphony is his \\"pagan symphony, devoid of guilt.\\" A must read. Aidan"},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"How wonderful that the author of this book can relate Beethoven's childhood to his last days and to his last completed symphony. The song, \\"To An Infant,\\" contains a reference to an \\"occult giver.\\" These words must have resonated in the composer's psyche as an adult, wondering about his origin and the meaning of his life. In many ways, Mr. Gregory's penetrating look into the composer's development centers on this search for paternal origins. What a thrill it is, in light of this understanding, to read in the last chapters that Beethoven wrote his Ninth Symphony and in it celebrated the discovery of the mysterious father who dwells above. Mr. Gregory's book is spiritually and psychologically sound as well as being quite some love story.."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"I thgought we knew about this great man, but this new book has given me new insights into his spirituality, his relation to and love for nature, and how his music seems to have that\\"let down from heaven\\" quality that is so hard to define. This book focuses on the composer's inner life, his mind, his spriit, and his sexuality. The long awaited meeting of Louis and Antonie has the reader holding his breath, wondering why nothing happens-- until it does! The meaning of the (actual) thunderclap at the moment of Louis' death, is rendered with poetic valence. AN intoxicating read!"},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"This book took me on stage during a performance of Leonora: I felt the beat of Leonora's heart, the tremble in Florestan's voice, the fury in Pizzaro's madness; and the trumpet blast from the tower gave me goosebumps. Then, when Louis, seated at his fortepiano, turned and saw his whore nestled in the arms of a French grenadier, I understood the man at last. When Antonie came into his life, he was ready for her, and I was ready to accept her as well. The author conveys a sense of inevitable rightness about this relationship, just as the listener senses this about Beethoven's music. \\"What must be, must be.\\" A winner. Destiny DeShields, Berkeley California"},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"Leonora's descent into the dungeon to dig her husband's grave made my hairs stand up, so to speak. The furious dialogue between Pizarro and Florestan, interupted by Leonora's pistol, made for goosebumps. Then the captain on the rampart aims his spyglass down the road that leads from Seville; \\"A four horse carriage speeds toward the prison gate bearing outriders who wear helmets and bear arms... the captain lifts the trumpet to his lips.\\" (from page 106) Reading this scene from FIDELIO was more imaginative than seeing the opera performed. Then Beethoven dashes from the theater because he has spotted his whore in the audience, in the arms of a handsome member of the Guarde Imperiale, with his bearskin headress and red plume..."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"This novel explores B's enigmatic relationship with religion and women. B. needed to be rescued, Mr. Gregory says, from the notion of a wrathful god who laid on him the command to be a musician but robbed him of the instrument by which a musician lives-- his hearing. And B. needed to be rescued from his distorted images of sexuality-- female sexuality and his own--for a childhood trauma robbed him of normal development. The author, a psychotherapist and a theologian, gives much intelligent thought to these subjects, and his thoughts are rewarding. In the 6th syumphony, Gregory says, B. heard the thundering of the angry god (in the thunderstorm movement) and the stomping of peasant feet in flight (B's own feet, figuratively speaking). B's erotic impulses were thwarted by the thundering god. Appropriate, therefore, and consistent with this insight, Gregory describes the 7th symphony as B's \\"pagan\\" symphony, in which the stomping feet of the 6th can romp and play in festive innocence, and feel no guilt and fear no god. Thankfully, the mood of the 7th prevailed when he met Antponie. But the reader need not fear that this book is a dissertation; it is not; it is a love story, and a very moving story it is."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"The use of the thunderclap and the death watch is effective, and serves as a lietmotif for the whole narrative. The story begins with a storm and ends with a storm-- fitting enough for a stormy career. Brilliant writing. I have a few regrets, but fleeting. There is a melodramatic passage where Antonie almost swoons and says \\"My love, my love.\\" (But my wife thinks this is the heart of the story!) Otherwise the writing is forceful, and does not cloy or annoy the reader with romantic excess. Also I wonder about the tense back-and-forth sending and receiving of letters, and the probing eyes of Schindler. But it made for exciting reading, just the same, and accounts rather well for the fact that the letters were found in the composer's possession when he died-- and Antonie did read them! Bravo. In all, the author finds archetypical images and deploys them to illustrate the composer's spiritual growth. The writing is neither pedantic nor melodramatic (one passage excepted!!)"},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"When I saw the cover of this book, I was struck by the tilted candle by the music stand. Why didn't someone (the girl in the photo) straighten it? When I got to the last chapter of the book I caught on: the tilted candle is a symbol of Beethoven's fear of domesticity and his clumsiness: Antonie (represented by the cover girl) was tempted to straighten it, but didn't-- she was not supposed to domesticate him. The ending is poignant and memorable. As as whole the narrative moves forward with meaning and momentum-- nothing lumpy as in so many historical fictions. The author takes us on stage when Fidelio is first performed: the dungeon scene almost made my hairs stand on end. This book is quite a read!"},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"This book is full of suggestive thoughts: for example, the text in Schiller's poem about \\"Stern custom,\\" must have influenced Beethoven and Antonie when they both defied their parents and the law of the church. Mr. Gregory's writing is lyrical and insightful and convincing even where fictional. The scene by the river where the composer and his beloved lie down and gaze at each other (\\"in God's light,\\" says Antonie) is deeply touching. And the revelation that Ludwig is not the son of George Cressener, but the true son of his drunken father, is rendered with poetic impact. That Antonie attended the premier of the Ninth is probably fiction, but what fiction! I was ready to believe it, it was so logical. This is simply a must read."},{"Title":"My Angel Leonora: Beethoven's Love for Antonie Brentano","review":"This is a love-story, not a psychological treatise. But the author makes it both, as well as a study of Beethoven's music.And a thrilling novel. It was breathtaking to read about the composer seated in the dark theater watching his opera Leonore take place on stage. I got a chill when Florestan, about to be murdered, saw a shadowed figure staring at him from inside the dungeon, fearing the figure who in fact was his angel Leonora. This book is exciting!!

It also mentions medieval visions of the same type. Philip Wiebe is a Christian and probably believes in the visions at some level, but strives to be as objective as possible when discussing various explanations.I admit that I found the book too \\"scholarly\\" and strangely boring. It also has a tendency to jump back and forth between very different subject matters (a bit like a college lecture, I suppose).Wiebe discusses various explanations for Christic visions (his term), from frankly supernaturalist to strongly sceptical. I was struck by the fact that even Christian theologians have problems with modern visions of Jesus, and often attempt to explain them away. Thus, Karl Rahner seems to have suggested that not even \\"true\\" Christic visions are of Christ himself. Rather, angelic beings create sense-impressions of Christ in the minds of the percipients. It's not clear to me whether Rahner said this for \\"modernist\\" reasons, for reasons of Church authority, or both. (Churches sometimes have problems with free-wheeling visions or visionaries.) The silliest explanation discussed by Wiebe is psychoanalytic, and claim that visions of Jesus and Mary are...surprise...Oedipal-sexual fantasies. At the opposite side of the spectrum are charismatics, who have no problems whatsoever with supernatural appearances of Jesus. One charismatic church in Oakland claims to have taped a short movie sequence showing Jesus materializing in the congregation. Unfortunately, the original film got lost during a burglary... Wiebe has seen it, but implies that it might have shown a painting rather than a real person!The visions of Jesus recorded in the book are of several different types, and the author admits that a Christian believer in the supernatural would be hard-pressed to explain some of them. For instance, there are visions of Jesus as a child, or visions which show scenes from his life (usually the passion). These visions don't seem to be different in kind from regular apparitions of Jesus (sometimes Jesus even interacts with the percipient), but they obviously can't be \\"true\\" in the sense of being actual meetings with Baby Jesus or the crucified Christ. According to Christian theology, Jesus has ascended to his Father in Heaven! He is no longer a child, nor is he still crucified. This sounds trivial, but note that it's connected to the historical-temporal claims of Christianity. Hindus would presumably have no particular problem with Krishna showing himself as a child for the benefit of some devotee, despite not really being a child. From a Christian perspective, meetings with Jesus as a child could be more problematical, especially if the whole thing is seen as a clever illusion created by angels. (Note also that Jesus' childhood is mentioned mostly in passing in the canonical Gospels.)On the other hand, some other visions are of Jesus actually touching the percipient, as if he still had a physical body of some kind. These visions can't be illusions induced by angels, but they are also difficult to explain theologically: does Jesus occasionally leave the right hand of God and descend to Earth? Does he have a glorified body that one can touch? If he has, does that mean that the Second Person of the Trinity is somehow limited in space?The author also points out the strange fact that all percipients he interviewed immediately recognized the person in their visions as Jesus, despite nobody knowing how Jesus really looked like. Often, Jesus would have a \\"traditional\\" look (beard, long hair, sandals and so on), but there were nevertheless obvious differences in detail between the various testimonies. At other times, Jesus did *not* show his face nor tell his name, but the percipient somehow knew who he was anyway.The author is brave enough to point out that there doesn't seem to be an absolute difference between the post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus on the one hand, and the medieval or modern visions on the other. The post-Resurrection but pre-Ascension Jesus could appear and disappear at will, yet he also had a physical body and could be touched. He often appeared to several people at once, but that too has been reported in modern times. At the road to Emmaus, Jesus somehow changed his countenance, thereby keeping his identity secret. Some medieval reports are about mysterious beggars who later turn out to be Jesus. Wiebe also points out that a certain kind of ghosts have non-transparent bodies which look physical, sometimes complete with clothes!The above could be controversial for several reasons. Some Christians are cessationists, and would presumably deny that anyone after the death of the apostles had visions of Jesus. However, modern visions are more well-documented than ancient ones, and seem to be of the same kind as the original post-Resurrection appearances. Sceptics could point to the similarities between modern visions and NT-recorded visions as evidence in favour of none of them being true. If people today can hallucinate physical meetings with Jesus, perhaps Thomas was hallucinating, as well? Finally, New Age believers could make the opposite claim: all visions of Jesus are true, but so are apparitions of dead relatives, angels, gnomes, Hindu gurus etc. (Yogananda's book \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" records several purported resurrections in India.)Wiebe never reaches a firm conclusion, and as already mentioned, his book became tedious to read after a while. I admit that I didn't read literally every word of it...Since the descriptions of the actual visions are relatively short, the book probably isn't suited for the general reader. Rather, \\"Visions of Jesus\\" belongs to the library of a theology student, or perhaps a student of comparative religion or mythology."},{"Title":"Visions of Jesus: Direct Encounters from the New Testament to Today","review":"Stumbled onto this book at seminary while trying to make sense of some personal revelations from God. So glad the author took the time to talk to people who had similar encounters with the risen Christ.What I enjoyed most were the stories of their experiences. The author spends a lot of time on the scientific side of things... which I suppose is valuable and gives it more credibility, but what I was truly looking for was affirmation, and I received it.God does not always use the language of our experience to speak to us, and in this we see his creativity and sense of humor, and are reminded that his truth can be found in many faith traditions, whether they belong to us, or not."},{"Title":"Visions of Jesus: Direct Encounters from the New Testament to Today","review":"This is a scholarly book written by a Professor of Philosophy, so don't expect it to be always easy to read. But I found it worth the effort.It starts with accounts of a number of experiences, mostly by people Wiebe interviewed himself, who say they saw Jesus in some way. Many of them were apparently healed at the same time. In a few cases, more than one person saw the \\"vision\\". Wiebe's task is to find an explanation.He looks at three classes of explanation - supernatural explanations, natural psychological explanations, and natural neurophysiological explanations - with several different types of explanation within each class. He assumes that outright lies are unlikely in any case and impossible overall. I would have expected that some form of hallucination (which can be included under neurophysiological) could feasibly explain all cases, but he shows this isn't the case. He concludes that no single explanation can explain all cases.Drawing on recent developments in the analysis of near death experiences, Wiebe suggests how a methodology could be developed to analyse these visions, but that many more visionary experiences need to be documented before a better understanding will be possible. He suggests that further research might lead to these experiences being seen as a more \\"scientific\\" approach to the philosophical question of the existence of God."},{"Title":"100+ Activities for Houston Kids","review":"Megan Salch has assembled a great collection of activities in and around Houston for the whole family.

The theme is: The joy of duty. When thinking of duty, he is forced to think about his father, a police officer. During the Nazi Era, the so called &quot;forbidden art&quot; was removed by state forces. Jepsens father, in his urge to do his duty, whatever it may be, not asking about the consequences, does, whatever he has to do. Young Siggi Jepsen (10 years old) has another thinking of duty. He thinks, his duty is to preserve the paintings of the &quot;forbidden art&quot; of the artist Nansen and tries to conceil those sympathies from his father. This more or less silent conflict about duty is the intruiging part about the book.what is the duty of man? What is the reaction of a small countryside town of the northernmost germany to the cruel Nazi-era? What are &quot;normal people&quot; like in extreme situations? This is described in Lenz'book in a very silent, innerflecting way."},{"Title":"The German Lesson","review":"What can I say about this this book, apart from that it is an absolute must for anybody who is interested in Germany.

Everyone in the book has a duty to something. Siggi is a great character and seeing the world through his eyes makes one think about their own duties, makes one wonder when to face them and when to see that they are wrong.I really enjoyed this book because to me it wasn't so much about the Nazi time, but about censorship and the duty to do art.This is a book that if you like history, Germany, art or just a really good story you should read. It appeals to both sexes too."},{"Title":"The German Lesson","review":"I have read this book twice and am convinced it is one of the most artistic, profoundly conceived novels I have ever read, and I am a reader of Henry James, who I thought could not be beat.In examining art and censorship, Lenz mirrors his theme by painting with words - his writing mirrors painting in a way I have never seen. Subtle brushstrokes, shadows, foregrounds, background - I have never seen writing done this way. His handling of time, of art, of \\"invisible\\" paintings, of nature, of human nature, and the intricacies of memory is done so skillfully that I am spellbound the minute I pick the book up. Lenz doesn't slip up once; it's as if he is almost hypnotized by his own subject matter. In short, after 35 years of reading fine books, this one, to me, tops them all. I really wonder how many people have actually read this book and have seen it for what it is: a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The German Lesson","review":"Siggi Jepsen.

It gives a nice summary of the pagan wheel of the year and Ms. Galernon is careful to include historical information along with the standard suggestions of how to celebrate the various holidays.The rituals she provides sound innovative and fun, but I wish she supplied alternatives for solitaries, who don't have the luxury of other people to fill in the multiple roles and functions. This book is geared towards the beginner, and more often than not beginners practice their craft alone before venturing out to find a circle.I did like the personal touch she put in recounting her own experiences with animal totems, spells and the path she took in dedicating herself to a goddess. Her style is friendly and folksy, not unlike that of Trish Telesco, who is one of my favorite writers. I hope to see more work from her in the future."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Sun: Celebrating the Seasons of Life","review":"This book covers the Wheel of Year and other celebrations.

His book is excellent--those who remember him or followed sports during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s will especially enjoy the book. Nelson was not only a great broadcaster, but shows he is a terrific writer also. He actually started in the newspaper business as a youngster, and his flair for writing is evidenced throughout the book. He was the play-by-play voice of the Mets for 17 years and also for many years the voice of Notre Dame football highlights. His tales of his early, and later years at the University of Tennessee are outstanding.

It's basically the life of a sports announcer at the top of the profession. He also writes about his WW 2 experiences and getting started in radio in Knoxville, Tennessee. He also writes eloquently about his daughter who was born with a mental handicap, the early death of his wife and his love of travel...he once went to Timbuktu.

It's all set in three Scottish Highland estates, including the Royal one at Balmoral. The writer clearly knows his highlands, and poaching, and the hearts of men and women.

Ltd, as an entry in their recent Ancients in Action series of short incisive books which \\"introduces major figures of the ancient world to the general reader, including each subject's life, works, and significance for later western civilization.\\"A senior classics lecturer at University College Dublin who has previously been known for her works on the history of church and state under the late Roman Empire, Ms. Ubainczyk fills her publisher's prescription to a tee in this, her first work on slavery and slave rebellion under the late Republic. In it she offers an explanation of how a gladiator rebel against slavery from two thousand years ago who ultimately failed, was vilified by the establishment of his own time, and left no disciples or writings to carry on his ideas, still managed to become so influential in the modern era. She begins with a brief survey of the impact of Spartacus on such diverse historical phenomena as the French Revolution, the slave uprising under Toussant L'Overture in Haiti, the Italian Risorgimento under Garribaldi, the Marxist movement of the ninteenth century, the failed German revolution in 1918, and the communist regimes of the twentieth century. Stepping back into the Roman Republican period she leads the reader through the background of conquest, slavery, gladiatorial games, and previous slave rebellions that ultimately led to the great Italian servile war. What follows is an up-to-date account of the revolt of Spartacus, his rise, many victories, and final defeat by his arch enemy Marcus Licinius Crassus. Although writing for the general reader the author is not afraid to examine with a critical eye some of the heretofore accepted academic conclusions regarding Spartacus's aims, accomplishments, and potential for greater, more lasting success. The narrative section of the book concludes with a chapter on slaves and slave rebellions in the centuries following Spartacus's uprising which contains accounts of some little known episodes and even major military campaigns which are to be found in the surviving ancient historical texts.In the central chapter of the book the author illumines how despite the negative press Spartacus received from contemporary ancient historians, Plutarch, one of our main surviving sources on the slave rebellion, presented him in a positively heroic light in his Life of Crassus, thereby transforming him into a timeless hero. She presents an in-depth analysis of how Plutarch, in an attempt to express the anti-Roman and pro-Greek sentiments clearly evident in his accounts of other Greek and Roman lives, contrasted Spartacus's admirable moral and martial qualities with the far baser characteristic traits of his opponent, Crassus. While her arguments are certainly original and convincing, I would suggest that without the more sympathetic accounts of Plutarch's sources, the anti-establishment Roman historian Sallust, and perhaps the polymath genius and Stoic philosopher Posidonius, Plutarch's own near adulatory sketch of the career of Spartacus would not have been possible. But the brevity required for an introductory work for the general reader required that she dispense with the same kind of detailed treatment of their works that she accorded to Plutarch.The book then shifts to a consideration of the figure of Spartacus in the modern imagination, specifically of the three widely read English language novels about Spartacus published from 1930 to 1951 which are still in print, and of the Kirk Douglas film which stands today as the paradigm for Spartacus in the minds of people worldwide. In fairness to the reader, the author must confess that in her critical chapter on the film, Ms. Urbainczyk makes extensive use of the theme and content of his own essays on the dire role played by studio censorship in diluting the fundamental historical lesson which the filmmakers intended to convey: man's capacity in all ages to resist dehumanization. While gratified by her support of my own critique of the film in opposition to some professional historians who find nothing wrong with the image of the slave revolt which it offers, I would advise the reader judge her conclusions for himself.Overall this is a very accessible, interesting and eye-opening introduction to the subject that should leave the reader clamoring for more."},{"Title":"Alpha Tales Learning Library (Set)","review":"These books are wonderful, the stories are cute and fun to read and the illustrations are enjoyable.

After a year I succumbed to Amazon's marketing acumen and purchased the darn thing, mostly because it seemed like I had read every other piece of historical fiction dealing with the Roman legions that I could find. I put off purchasing this book for two reasons. One was that it was written quite a while back and the other is that it dealt with two Gauls and not with the legions themselves.I suspect many of you reading this are looking at this book for much the same reason as I have, so let me assure you that this is a truly good book and I enjoyed it. It was historically immersive, culturally accurate, and you get to tromp through ancient Rome environs, from Gaul to Scythia, with protagonists who are interesting, believable, and who tell a fascinating story. This was a winner and a fine addition to my collection and I recommend it. I will certainly be purchasing more novels from this author; it will help with the waiting for the next Simon Scarrow installment!

The book description above is fairly accurate. The story involves two Gauls, Acco and Camul, who join up with Ceasar's legions after they are forced to leave home due to a confrontation with \\"The Goddess\\". The story is told from Camul's point of view. The story opens with Camul on a Parthian border outpost. He then tells another warrior his tale, hence the story of Winter Quarters. Camul and Acco wind up attached to Crassus's son and wind up joining him on his invasion of Parthia. I look forward to reading Duggan's other novels. If you enjoy reading ancient historical fiction, I highly recommend Duggan."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"Winter Quarters tells a familiar tale from an unfamiliar point of view. With so much research and interpretations of late-Republic Rome, this book recalls the Rome of Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus, from the point of view of minor noble Gauls Acco and Camul. In their home village, Acco's love Grane is mauled to death by a bear in the woods, and Acco then kills the bear. From the warning of an old woman who witnessed it, he believes \\"The Goddess\\", whose name is almost never used, has cursed him for slaying her bear.To avoid her wrath, Acco and Camul go to join the Romans, with whom their tribe is at peace with, and join Caesar on his campaign against the other tribes. From there, they join Publius Licinius Crassus, and his father Marcus's campaign east to attack the Parthians.The text is very plain and humble, without Pressfield-esque literary richness, or McCullough-esque description of politics, people, and history. The narrator, Camul, is very optimistic, relatively untouched by traumas of hard marches and fierce battles, with only honor and pride in his head and heart.Despite this lack of lush writing or historical density, the book is far from dry, as the story holds enough interest to keep one reading through all its 234 pages, from the distant Gallic tribe bordering Iberia they come from, to the deserts of Syria and the battlefield of Carrhae, and to the barren Sea of Grass in the middle of Asia, where the narrator's story ends.Not a phenom of a novel, but an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"Ancient Rome is a very popular subject for fans of historical fiction. Witness the recent efforts by Conn Iggulden, Simon Scarrow and Michael Curtis Ford, to name a few, none of which are all that great, but all of which apparently sold pretty well. Lately, publishers have been looking to the past for something to reprint, such as Wallace Breem's Eagle in the Snow, and now this one, Winter Quarters. Neither of these are all that hot either.In Winter Quarters the twist is that the story is narrated by a Gaul. He joins the Roman army--at the time occupying his country--so that he can accompany a friend of his who is told to take a hike after offending a local earth goddess. They are taken under the wing of the scion of one of the Roman triumvirate, and subsequently get to visit Rome, Greece, and Syria before taking part in the historical, ill-fated campaign against Parthia in 54 B. C.It would seem to have all the ingredients but unfortunately the narration reads like a travelogue and the narrator is vanilla-bland with little style or wit. In his novels, Steven Pressfield has exhibited a problem with narration as well, but at least with him you get an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of ancient warfare and customs. With Mr. Duggan, you don't even get that.But it is not without some good stuff. The narrator and his friend have a fervent interest in religion so we get a lot of discussion about religious practices, rites and temples in the areas through which they travel. They even make a stop in Jerusalem and get to comment about that as well, remarking quizzically about the, \\"one God\\" of the Jews, and how jealous he is of other gods. Of interest is the fact that they take these religions on their own terms, never belittling or even questioning them in light of their own strongly held beliefs.Nothing much really happens plotwise, though. There's a minor adventure with the daughter of a family that befriends them and how she becomes a priestess in some kind of a debauched temple, but this is not nearly intriguing as it could have been. Early on there is a skirmish with a German tribe and the narrator feels a little ashamed that he and his mates are given the task of wiping out the women and children, a task they perform with relish. This also blows by in a hurry with little detail or commentary.Finally there is the great battle against the Parthians which the novel has been foreshadowing with a sense of doom throughout, and sure enough, the Romans take a thrashing. But again, there is little of the gritty detail and observation that great historical fiction exhibits. In McCarthy's Blood Meridian, the hero, dazed in the midst of a cavalry charge, notes a pony darting by, snapping at him with its teeth. In Pressfield's Last of the Amazons, the hero jams his shield against the stony ground and huddles behind it, fearfully enduring the arrows and stones being flung against it. These are the kind of exhilarating, exciting, heart-pounding moments historical fiction aficionados yearn for, but here, they barely exist. Our guy charges into the Parthian horse, he watches his friend and his leader get killed, he manages to break through the line, and he runs like the dickens back to his own line. There's not much more to it than that.Which brings up kind of a weird subplot going on in here, too, having to do with the narrator's lack of fortitude. In nearly every engagement in which he participates, he routinely takes the easy way out. For example, after fleeing ignominiously at the last battle, he states, \\"I served the Romans for pay and I thought our charge had been enough.\\" It is not clear what the author is trying to show by this. Is it supposed to be a comment on Gallic honor? Or on Roman mercenaries? Or is it on the narrator individually? It's hard to tell and isn't explored enough to know one way or the other.This is not a bad book. It moves along pretty well and there is a little depth, anyway. But if great historical fiction can be defined as having great characters, a great plot, and great detail, this one is thoroughly average in all three respects."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"War is business. It's a basic theme to Alfred Duggan's epic tale called \\"Winter Quarters.\\" I had been looking for a shorter book to read in the interim before I moved onto something longer, and I came across Alfred Duggan, and this book came in highly recommended, and it was the perfect length, so how could I resist? Well, temptation is the hand of the devil, and I must say that I was extremely impressed!Taking place during the time of Caesar, Caesar is waring in Gaul, and soon moving eastwards towards the Germanic tribe area. However, our story is not about Caesar, but of 2 Gaul nobels, Camul and Acco. On one particular day, Acco was off hunting when Camul saw him running down the mountain in a terrible freight! Acco had killed the bear of the goddess Pyrene! After talk amongst the nobels and family, it is decided that Camul is going to leave and join the Roman army, and Acco will follow. They will leave their home while the wrath of the goddess dies down, before returning.Over the next few years, we read about how Camul and Acco join up with Caesar, the cavarly, and eventually move into \\"The City,\\" aka Rome. Through their eyes, we see how roman lifestyle was like, the desire for blood, but only blood that was well deserved. And how the romans went to war not so much to defend themselves, but more because it was business. They simply invaded a country which was not hostile, because it would better suite roman needs.We see how Camul and Acco travel from Rome, out to the Middle East, through Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem. They give an incredible retelling of what life was like all across their journeys.Winter Quarters was a fantastic book. One of the points which captured me first, was how the book opened at \\"present times,\\" and one evening Camul has his friend write down his telling of how he came to be where he was. I really felt what life was like during these times, and the pain and pleasures that these men went through, and experienced during their odyssey. We see how their cultures are different, how politics are played, and how the Gaul lifestyle is much older, than the new roman ways.I plan on continuing reading Alfred Duggan's novels, and I would recommend this book for people who enjoy historical fiction, and need something light. This book is not very deep, or difficult to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"I won't reiterate other reviews here. Just comment that this is a soundly researched, well-written piece of history that starts with Caesar's Army in Gaul and ends with the annihilation of Crassus' legions by the Parthians in one of the great military disasters of the early Roman Empire."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"Alfred Duggan is an author with a deserved high reputation. This book will keep your attention."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"This was a fine and accurate depiction of the Roman army. This Latin teacher recommends it highly."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"This is a novel that should be very engaging from both an historical and a character perspective. It details the lives of two Gauls serving in the Roman army who end up among the captured legionaries serving the Parthians after Cassius' defeat. Unfortunately, it is merely an extended set of episodes, not a unified narrative. The characters and context are likewise thoroughly undeveloped--no immersion at all in the world of Gauls, Romans, or Parthians. The novel is equally disappointing from a military perspective--no rich descriptive material on tactics or events. The book feels like an outline for something much, much richer, but as it stands is merely an uninspired exercise."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"Nothing like reading a very dull book about an imaginary looser. This writer seems to write a lot about nothing. The subject is dull. The story doesn't ever go anywhere.I will mark this author and never buy another book by him."},{"Title":"Behind Ghetto Walls: Black Families in a Federal Slum","review":"Mr. Rainwater was such a vibrant force in speaking about the problems that resulted from some of the more infamous Urban Renewal projects. His work in the area probably helped change the way society looks at and deals with housing assistance. He found the few benefits of proximity but exposed the down side.Excellent book. If you are not familiar with what was viewed as assistance and solutions in the middle of the last century, it just might open your eyes a little."},{"Title":"Behind Ghetto Walls: Black Families in a Federal Slum","review":"Lee Rainwater is one of the greatest sociologists of our time. His numerous works have influenced public policy and educated the general public. Behind Ghetto Walls should be required reading for every member of Congress and the state legislatures. So much of what goes into public policy is uniformed opinion and bias. This book brings readers into the experiences of what it means to be poor and excluded from the benefits and privileges that most people share in democracies."},{"Title":"Behind Ghetto Walls: Black Families in a Federal Slum","review":"I really loved the horriffic tales with interviews and tragic details of lofe in a huge public housing project in St. Louis, the Pruitt-Igoe. Amazing insights & interviews with real people throughout the book make for a very impactful, well organized work."},{"Title":"Invitation to Sailing","review":"In-depth, even includes boat care and tuning. But the part of the book that struck me the most was chapter entitled 'What Makes a Sailboat Go' which included demonstrations helping to explain how a sailboat moves in the wind."},{"Title":"Invitation to Sailing","review":"This has to be one of the better books that I have read written for someone new to the sport, covering the basics of both sailing and seamanship all the way to starting in racing to intermediate helmsmanship. The opening words of the dedication \\"...to Junior Sailors everywhere...\\" basically says it all.Brown's objective was clearly to provide a training manual for Junior Sailors and even included a section on how to develop instructors. If you already know how to sail the first half of this book is a good refresher. The later sections are an excellent primer for the sailor who wants to start getting involved in racing. The chapter ending tests are a little tedious if you already know how to sail.Though this book doesn't cover the material at the level of say Richard Creagh-Osborne's \\"This Is Racing\\" it does cover most of the same information in a much more digestible manner. Osborne's book is a masterpiece all in and of its own but he is writing for a more advanced sailor then Brown is addressing with \\"Invitation To Sailing\\". Brown's diagrams are much easier to understand on a first reading. He covers the topics at hand selectively whereas Osborne's diagrams are extensive covering too much and jam packed with many possibilities.Reading the two in conjunction with each other will provide an excellent foundation in both the aspects of seamanship that are missed in most other books and racing from beginning to intermediate and advanced levels."},{"Title":"Invitation to Sailing","review":"If you really want to learn how to sail, this is the book to read. He walks you through the entire drill and after you've read it, you can crew pretty much for anyone and you'll know what you're doing."},{"Title":"Invitation to Sailing","review":"Loaned from coach an old library book he gotten from annual sale. Didn't think I could lay my hand on a copy for myself. Pleasantly found it in Amazon and was expeditiously delivered. Now having fun time reading at my own leisure!"},{"Title":"Invitation to Sailing","review":"I learned to sail by reading this book and sailing on a 15 1/2 foot daysailer. The book is easy to understand and should be required reading for all beginning sailors. Although dated, the instruction is timeless. A word of caution---sailing can be habit forming; my husband and I circumnavigated."},{"Title":"Halo Parade (Harpur & Iles Mysteries)","review":"I have read several of Bill James' police procedurals and this is one of the best. The characters are highly original, the dialogue sparkles, and the descriptions are often poetic. (Example: &quot;His brain shone like potato peelings.&quot;) The settings can be dark and sinister, but there is plenty of black humor in both this entry and in the series. James creates a morally ambiguous but fascinating world in 1980s/1990s Britain. I intend to buy every one of James's Harper &amp; Iles mysteries."},{"Title":"Halo Parade (Harpur & Iles Mysteries)","review":"Book was received on time in good condition. I recently finished reading it and it was interesting and fun, as with all the Harper & Iles police procedurals."},{"Title":"Halo Parade (Harpur & Iles Mysteries)","review":"This third entry in James' lengthy (20+ books) \\"Harpur + Iles\\" series takes place not too long after the first two. By the end of the second, DCS Colin Harpur and Assistant Chief Commissioner Iles were almost at each others throats, so it was with great interest that I picked this one up to see how they would get along. As in the previous two, James starts the book by dropping the reader into the middle of a case. Harpur is running a young undercover cop who has managed to get close one of the area's major drug wholesalers, but Iles and the newly installed Chief Lane are getting nervous about the setup. As readers of the first two might expect, something goes badly wrong, and Harpur and Iles are left to pick up the nasty pieces.There's something slightly unsatisfying about this entry in the series. The case just isn't as compelling as the previous ones -- perhaps because the villain isn't that distinctive. He's kind of a typical, cocky, smooth piece of work whose only distinguishing feature is that he's gay (what is it with the British and gay gangsters?). The story is mostly a psychological battle between Harpur and Iles and villain, but it never really builds to a proper crescendo. The reader does get a little deeper into Iles' twisted mind, and once again, he spouts some of the most off-the-wall dialogue to be found in a crime novel, but none of the other characters are developed much further. Harpur's assistant Garland hovers unobtrusively in the background, Chief Lane doesn't leave much of an impression, and Harpur's wife Megan and paramour Ruth make brief appearances, but it's all fairly status quo.Although the body count ratchets up by the end of the book, and some of it gets grisly, but there's not enough depth to the case to really capture the imagination. Most readers will have guessed at how everything will be resolved, and so the ending lacks the shocking power James certainly intended. Definitely weaker than the first two in the series, but I'll keep reading to see how it all develops."},{"Title":"Halo Parade (Harpur & Iles Mysteries)","review":"The third in the Harpur and Iles series. Full of humor, grit, gripping dialogue, sex, drugs - what more could one want in a story? Harpur takes more than his share of tough breaks in this one, and Iles really starts to blossom as a character as well. The series keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"I suppose if one looked closely at all of the information available at Amazon, one could learn that this book was written about fifty years ago. I suspect that the original was written in the author's mother tongue (Italian) and this is a painfully translated version. I found it to be very difficult and tedious reading."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"Reading J&eacute;rme Carcopino's timeless account of life in ancient Rome brings the reader back to the dark, narrow, crowded Roman streets, flanked on both sides by teetering, five-story tenements. Although written in a style of long ago, therein lies the charm of this book. J&eacute;rme Carcopino has effortlessly summoned 1st and 2nd Century Rome back to life. And what a society of contrasts he evokes: on the one hand, the highly refined aspects of Roman society, epitomized by the public baths, the public parks, the theater, and the dinners hosted by the wealthy for their friends; on the other hand, he describes compellingly the dark side of Roman society, in particular, slavery and the gladiatorial games which entertained the Roman public with the appallingly casual slaughter of both man and beast. His detailed accounts depict horrific spectacles pitting man against man, man against beast, beast against beast -- and woman against dwarf. The most interesting part of his book, though, is his insight respecting the toxic impact slavery had upon Roman society, both upon the poor pleb in general and upon the Roman family in particular. This book is a must for anyone captivated by Roman social history."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"Were it not for the customer reviews below, I would have rejected this book for having three strikes against it: it was written in 1940, an English translation (groan) from French, and published by a university press -- a prescription for dated unreadablity. But not so! Though at first the typeface and writing style feel a little anachronistic (and the first chapter does NOT represent the richness to come), it quickly becomes charming and flowing. And what a bounty of fascinating detail is packed into its pages!I wholly agree with what my unknown compatriots below have said. I can only add that I finished it with that rare, dejected feeling of &quot;Oh, no! I've run out of book!&quot;"},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"Jerome Carcopino's scholarly work on how the Romans of the second century A.D. saw and lived their lives has been in print for almost 60 years, and with good reason. This book provides, in addition to the basic facts and figures, a poignant commentary on the people and their times. Always reflective, the author does not hesitate to express his opinions (often in the first person) on his ancient subjects, whether they inspire admiration or revulsion. To bolster these opinions, he frequently quotes the views of contemporary scholars as well as ancient sources. While much of the text related to the modern era is dated and the archeological research treated as &quot;recent&quot; may have occurred very early in our century, &quot;Daily Life in Ancient Rome&quot; does not need updating or revising. The basic premise of the book, i.e., the social life and customs of the Romans, remains unaffected by the passage of time. Furthermore, the unaltered text and its references give us an interesting glimpse of Roman archeology and historical writing during the first half of the twentieth century and earlier. E. O. Lorimer's English translation of the original French text is fluid and well structured, while the bibliography and notes by Henry T. Rowell are excellent. &quot;Daily Life in Ancient Rome&quot; is a welcome reference for the student of Roman history"},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"Nice and readable presentation of the daily life in imperial Rome.

You may notice a few complaints about the age of the book, the old fashion feel to the author's writing (which I happen to enjoy) and some complaints about the sources he uses. But think about it - even poetry can be used to understand a culture. So even flawed history or fiction can be used to understand a time period - it tells us about the thoughts, ideals and view points of the author. And the author is a product of his time.So, I have no issues with the sources Jerome Carcopino uses and feel the book is a wonderful excise in bringing to life the Roman people of the temples, baths, games, the busy streets. Can't you just picture the crowds of shouting venders, the begging homeless, the screaming children, the grumpy old people and the people whining about how good it was in the old days? The smell of fish, fresh bread, urine, unwashed peoples, perfumes and spices.Books like this give us the image of what Rome was like. The passion and the glory, the Holidays and the slavery, the Emperors and the Gods.What more do you want?"},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"You might want to turn directly to the last chapter in which the gluttony and debauchery of Imperial Rome is most clearly spelled out. Then again you might want to wait for that as one does for a dessert. Then again I shouldn't be such a smart aleck.Jerome Carcopino who had this published in France in 1939 is a Latin and Greek scholar from the old school, from the days when Latin was required in our public schools and any educated person had at least a smattering of the dry stuff. This book presumes some Latin and some knowledge of Roman history. Additionally the Latin is not always translated into English--I presume it is the same in Carcopino's original French. And he refers to personages in Roman history without giving dates or even a sense of temporal order such as an American author might refer to Emerson or the Nixon administration and feel comfortable knowing that his readers would be able to form an approximate time frame. Furthermore, there is a pedant's feel to much of the book with Carcopino giving us again and again the exact Latin terminology in italics following the English expression. Readers interested in learning or brushing up on their Latin will find this most agreeable, and readers like me, who have little Latin and less Greek, will enjoy recognizing the Latin originals in their ancient usage that have given us English cognates. Thus \\"frigidarium\\" refers to the cold part of the Roman bath, and a \\"paedagogus\\" was a slave who served as a tutor.Sometimes Carcopino (and I must say his able English translator, E. O. Lorimer) gives us the English translation following the Latin, and often it is a famous Latin phrase that will delight the eyes of the learned. For example on page 336 we find this observation explaining the use of a certain room near the feasting room: \\"vomunt ut edant, edunt ut vomant (they vomit in order to eat, and eat in order to vomit).\\"I found it interesting to notice Carcopino's views on certain subjects and how they differ from today. For example he writes that the Roman players fought for a ball \\"blown full of air...as in basketball, but with more elegance.\\" (p.320) I doubt that such a line would be written today considering how graceful and elegant basketball has become since those early days of the sport from which Carcopino writes, circa 1939. I also note that as Carcopino was banging the typewriter keys the storm clouds of impending war were once again gathering over Europe. I kept looking for some indication as to where our author stood vis-&agrave;-vis the rise of the Storm Trooper mentality in Germany and elsewhere, but he remained true to the historian's credo of not judging current events.Interesting too are the occasional references to the modern world as colored by Carcopino's zeitgeist. For example he sometimes compared Roman habits to those of Europeans, Americans and even Arabs. Thus he writes \\"As among the Arabs still, belching was considered a politeness, justified by philosophers who thought the highest wisdom was to follow the dictates of nature. Pushing this doctrine even further, Claudius had considered an edict authorizing other emissions of wind from which even Arabs refrain...\\" (p. 335)My take on the daily life after reading this volume is I would prefer to have lived in the pre-history rather than in Rome during the days of the emperors and I am very glad I live today and not then! As cases in point consider that the wine the Romans drank was blended with resin and pine pitch and drunk diluted with water. (pp. 332-333) Furthermore the glorious baths of Rome were communal without chlorine or the like, while the public bathrooms featured a kind of latrine with holes in the top that citizens could sit on and defecate while talking to their neighbor a few inches away. And the narrow, unpaved streets were filled with refuse of all kinds including the nightly contents of chamber pots.The book is divided into two parts, \\"The Physical and Moral Background of Roman Life,\\" and \\"The Day's Routine.\\" Carcopino goes to great scholarly lengths to get his numbers right on the size and extent of the city and on the likely number of inhabitants, including breakdowns on citizens, freedmen and slaves. He calculates the relative fortunes of the various levels of society and informs us on religion, education, the status of women, arts and leisure and many other aspects of Roman life. From the title we can expect that the politics and warfare of the emperors will be glossed over, and in this we are not disappointed. In fact the great success of this volume, which has been in print since it was first published almost seven decades ago, attests to the lively interest that readers have in life apart from what is usually presented.I should mention that I have the volume from The Folio Society published in 2004. It is beautifully rendered with a number of color plates, a fine introduction by Keith Hopkins and includes an up-to-date (as of 2004) bibliography for further reading. There are several footnotes per page citing such illustrious authors as Pliny, Martial, Petronius, Tacitus, Juvenal, etc. By the way, Carcopino's book is not to be confused with a book with the same title written by Florence Dupont which I haven't read."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"This interesting study is ruined by faulty production that runs words together and replaces some words with question marks. These flaws make if difficult to read and slow down the reader. Not good enough."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"Though considered a premire source for information about daily life in ancient Rome, the book is not without its flaws. For example, the author subscribes to the romantic notion that the gladiators always saluted the emperors with the \\"Hail, Caeser!\\" when in fact there is only one recorded instance of this during the reign of Claudius. Also, he treats fictional works, particularly Petronius's Satyricon, as if it were factual reporting rather than the hyperbolic satire that it is. In the Bibliographic section of the second edition (Carcopino did not include a bibliography in his original work), the editor admits Carcopino utilized the questionable source called the Augustan History. The author, in addition, shows little empathy for his subject but much negativity that left this reader wondering how slanted was his work in order to support his prejudices. Worthwhile for supplementary information, but I would suggest not using it as a main source for information about daily life in ancient Rome."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"For the past week or more, I've been intermittently reading Carcopino's work in Google Books, as always looking for errors in my understanding of Ancient Rome, since my Youtube videos on it are um.. controversial. In fact, only about 30 minutes ago, I closed the Google link, and came here looking for the book. But I didn't want, hardback.Just downloaded the Kindle app yesterday to rent the Leadbetter book on Galerius and the Will of Diocletian (available here at Amazon), and now found Carcopino on KINDLE. Just now bought it. It downloaded in about a nanosecond.Some people like illustrations in books. I hate them. JUST THE TEXT, PLEASE. Kindle is perfect for this, and better than Google Books, because you don't have to fuss with the weirdness of its interface. Kindle's interface isn't perfect either, but the people at Kindle are eager for feedback. This is a GREAT way to buy books.Think: you can lie on the floor with your netbook or laptop, and read to your heart's content. You don't have to hook up to the internet, your page is right where you left it, and you can bookmark individual pages then skip to them. Interface has a semi-Adobe feel, but has many better features I WISH Adobe would adopt, like the ability to size the text to exact screen widths or sizes which you can SEE as you size them. Like, changing screen in one click to sepia, or white on black (which I can't stand, but the younger set adore).THIS is how books are best kept, when you think about it. A simple Acer netbook can hold thousands of them. Your outdated computer can hold thousands more. The software is not subject to the cloud, or really to technological change, in a way: the software is ON your computer, and you can READ the books now. So if the technology changes later, you still have the old technology on your old computer. Better than a lot of musty old shelves, and better for the future, too.I love this.As for the content of the book, it's as depicted by the other reviewers, so read their comments. Book is a great overview to put you into those times."},{"Title":"Daily life in ancient Rome: The people and the city at the height of the empire","review":"A highly engaging, well thought-out book. The author dares to have an opinion--very refreshing.The upper classes were diminished by low birth rates and had to be augmented by people who, several generations ago, were slaves. Those of the upper classes who survived considered the burden of empire too great they simply could not provide the leadership or the administration necessary for such a great enterprise. Finally, the education system did not teach their upper-class students to wrestle with real-life problems, and completely avoided subjects like philosophy and science which could have given them the enthusiasm and the tools to beneficially modify their society.I sense the beginnings of some of the unfortunate Latin traits which followed the Iberians to South America."},{"Title":"When Memory Speaks: Reflections on Autobiography","review":"This book is a fascinating, clear, balanced, and informed look at what Conway calls \\"the most popular form of fiction for modern readers\\"--autobiography. Although Conway is drawn to modern themes of race and gender, she also has a keen critical eye, balances the popular with the less-well-known, and the present with the past. She focuses on meaning making, the way people see their own lives, and the lessons they draw for others from them. For better or worse (and often worse) she argues, the Homeric Greek hero on his action packed odyssey is archetype for meaningful autobiography. Church father Augustine in his Confessions (c. 400) internalized the action, chronicling his attempts to resist temptation and submit to the will of God.Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Confessions (1871) attempts to succeed on the temporal level, to be a worldly success in touch with self and emotions beyond society's external laws. Benjamin Franklin in his Autobiography (1818) defines such worldly success in economic terms based on diligence and delayed gratification. The analysis of 19th century women's rights leaders such as Harriet Martineau and Elizabeth Cady Stanton are artfully analyzed through their autobiographies, as are colorful female personalities less obviously political such as stepbrother-abused Virginia Wolf (1882-1941) and the hilarious Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-1962)who was married four times (and had an affair with D.H. Lawrence) and wrote a four-volume memoirs entitled Intimate Memories. More familiar feminists such as Australian Germain Greer, Gloria Steinem (\\"full-time feminist leader, slipping into the role of caregiver for the feminist movement and unable to care for herself\\") are also analyzed with a critical focus of Conway's refreshingly non-monolithic feminism. Because of her rare combination of empathy and critical clarity, Conway excels when she is examining more marginal characters such as lesbian May Sarton's 1968 Plant Dreaming Deep, the 1974 Flying by lesbian Kate Millet (who appeared on the cover of Time),black lesbian Audre Lorde's 1982 Zami, A New Spelling of My Name, and so on. Conway also analyzes gay male autobiographies such as historian Martin Duberman's 1991 Cures, and A Different Person (1993) by James Merril (son of Charles E. Merril, one of the founders of Merril Lynch). She examines James/Jan Morris's transexual account in Conundrum, and decides that such stories are intrinsically more essentialist (structurally sexist)than simple gay and lesbian autobiographies. I am not sure I agree with all of Conway here--her definition of postmodernism seems too simple, and it is not clear that the true goal of autobiography writing is to own up to ourselves as significant actors in the drama of our own existence, rather than victimlike or overly modest (\\"feminine\\") being to whom things happen. To know that we would have to know the status of free will, which we don't, and there is the added danger (also an artistic one, although it can have comic effects) of the egotistic memoirist who takes credit for all sorts of things that were not related to his actions or decisions. So there is a continuum between active/egotistic/sellable autobiography and passive/modest/marketplace-challenged memoirs that needs to be carefully navigated by any aspiring autobiographer.But what is good about Conway is she is nice without pulling any critical punches. She shows how even the most successful feminists can hurt their cause by the way they report their story, and she ends with the striking image of a man (French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby--The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, 1997)paralyzed in all but one eye from a stroke, telling his story by blinking as a devoted helper goes through the alphabet until arriving at the correct letter. Although nominally about autobiography, and a brilliant work of feminism, this book may perhaps be of most use to creative writers."},{"Title":"When Memory Speaks: Reflections on Autobiography","review":"Jill Ker Conway, author of The Road from Coorain and True North, is one of our most widely-read and admired memoirists. Her books are praised for their graceful explorations of our most urgent questions of personal meaning: Where do I come from? What is my story? How has my past experience shaped me?In When Memory Speaks, Conway turns her attention from her own life to the stories of other lives, looking at the modern memoir and the way it reflects our culture and ourselves. She isn't writing exclusively about women, but this is a help, for she uses the narrative patterns of men's stories about their lives to show how women's memoirs evolved, comparing and contrasting the forms. Using examples from the autobiographies of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Benjamin Franklin, David Livingston, Conway shows that men's stories typically involve the self-made hero who creates his life in conflict with social or natural forces. In men's memoirs, she says, the male hero reveals himself as acting upon the world in order to give it the shape and meaning he chooses.Conway argues that until very recently, women's memoirs have shown quite a different pattern. They reveal the autobiographer as a \\"romantic heroine\\" who is acted upon, who seems to believe that she lacks control over her destiny and tends to censure her shaping role in her own story in order to satisfy her readers' expectations. Conway shows, for instance, that Jane Addams developed the the Hull House project after several active and energetic years of careful study of European social reform--and yet she writes about her idea in the passive voice, as if she were its agent, rather than its creator. In this way, Conway says, \\"Addams is able to conceal her own role in making the events of her life happen and to conform herself to the romantic image of the female...shaped by circumstances beyond her control\\" (p. 49). And, Conway points out, even such assertive feminists as Germain Greer (in Daddy, We Hardly Knew You) and Gloria Steinem (Revolution From Within) reveal in their memoirs the difficulty of redefining ourselves as heroes of our own stories.Conway's book is valuable for its deep and thoughtful discussion of the history of women's stories, compared to and contrasted with the autobiographical stories of men. But it is also valuable for what it has to say about the memoir itself, as a way to help us understand ourselves and our past experiences. If we recall the past as a chaos of random bits of good and bad luck that shaped us willy-nilly, we are likely to be victims of a similar future. If we see the past as the product of our choices and actions, we are better able to shape our futures:\\"We travel through life guided by an inner life plot--part the creation of family, part the internalization of broader social norms, part the function of our imaginations and our own capacity for insight into ourselves, part from our groping to understand the universe in which the planet we inhabit is a speck. When we speak about our memories, we do so through literary forms that seem to capture universals in human experience--the quest, the romance, the odyssey, the tragic or the comic mode. Yet we are all unique, and so are our stories. We should pay close attention to our stories. Polish their imagery. Find their positive rather than their negative form. Search for the ways we experience life differently from the inherited version and edit the plot accordingly...\\"As women memoirists, committed to understanding our stories and getting them straight, we need Conway's book. I hope you will read it, not just once but several times. It will help you to see which pattern your own story fits into: that of the woman who actively shapes her plot and chooses her response to the world, or that of the woman who waits to see what sort of plots life is going to dish out to her.by Susan Wittig Albertfor Story Circle Book Reviewswww.storycirclebookreviewsorgreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"When Memory Speaks: Reflections on Autobiography","review":"A deep, thoughtful and wonderfully written look at women's autobiography.

This only adds to the charm of the adventure which has lots of interesting characters including a New York cabbie Sikoski and good locations such as the Waldorf Astoria. The Toff has to rescue a kidnapped millionaire business man from a gang of New York hoodlums and has lots of interesting encounters before bringing the case to a successful conclsion.

It took me nearly a month to get past them, but once I did, I couldn't put this book down. Hagar Shipley's wit killed me; the cruelty she inflicts on her kids, and which they repay, got me upset. By the end of the night (I read it all at once) I felt like I'd seen a whole life in pieces, which is how life tends to look when we think back. Hagar screws up, but she doesn't back down.

Most novels I read for my course are a bore but I found this one an enjoyable read. I highly recommend it to anyone that has an intrest in literature, Canadian literature to be specific. This book helped me to reflect on my life, to see what I say and what I mean. To look at what I show and what I hide.

The book tells both stories of her last days as well as stories Hagar remembers about her life. What a tough bird she is, hard on her older son, indifferent to her husband. This is a book that feels very, very true. I recommend it highly and I'm adding it to my list of best reads ever. One question that nags at me: Is Hagar a relative? Can I blame it on her (and my) Scotch blood?"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Narrated in the first person, this is the life of Hagar Shipley, a woman born and raised in a small town on the remote Canadian West, the daughter of the store owner, a self-made man. From her extreme old age, Hagar mixes her autobiography with the story of her present situation: she lives in her Vancouver house, with her son and his wife. Hagar is a cranky, difficult woman, and her health is declining, so the couple are trying to convince her to move to a retirement home. And here is the center of the book: Hagar's life has been a long, uphill struggle for independence, dignity, and self-reliance, and the idea of going to a nursing home is simply unacceptable. While all this is happening, Hagar tells us her life in the hamlet, the story of her father, brothers, husband, children, and financial ups and downs.This is a good novel that tells us of a life defined by self-respect, and a unrelenting conviction about the value of freedom and autonomy. Hagar does not complain, does not blame anybody for her sufferings. Along her life, she makes decisions and takes responsibility for the consequences. Of course, the depiction of rural life in Western Canada makes for hardship: adverse weather, parochial society, hard times. An admirable character and a capable writer result in a very readable novel with important subjects, one of which is the sad process of ageing."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I had not known of Margaret Laurence until I found this book in 500 Great Books By Women.

If this is not a feel-good story, then I simply don't know what is!! This is the feel-good book of the year.... This is no overstatement.Yes. It is sad that people die. But if people did so with as much dignity as Hagar, the world would be a better place. And, no, I am not just saying that, again.Why hasn't this fine novel---this vanguard story--been adapted into movie form? I see the unflappable Glenn Close playing Hagar--with courage and grace.

As could be expected of an elderly woman, her present life isn't exciting, but unfortunately for the reader, her entire past is also a long, dull journey. The only interesting part of Hagar's life, her childhood, is summed up in a few pages.Hagar complains constantly throughout the novel. She is not an endearing grandma type, nor is she a wise old woman. Hagar is probably a realistic example of a typical elderly woman, but who wants to spend hours listening to the ramblings of a bitter old lady? Not me. However, Hagar's personal qualities aren't what ruins this novel. If a nasty character offers keen observation or leads an interesting life, a book can still succeed. But Hagar's lack of wit and insight and her boring life make &quot;The Stone Angel&quot; an utter failure. This novel is as dull and dry as a prairie town in the summer (no offense to the good folks out west), and I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"It was a dull and boring book that put me asleep while reading what was thought to be the most interesting parts of the book."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I'm a grade twelve honour student in Ontario who just finished reading this book.

I believe had the extravagance of the two been incorporated in the book, many may have been more willing to relate to the plot.

It touches universal themes of life. It focuses on the problem that everyone encounter or can related to. For exmaple, Hagar cherished one of her son more than the other, eventhough the son that she abandants is the one that actually care about her. And in the age of 90 she still can not see the irony of this. I guess we can't appreciate things until they are lost.The Stone Angel also touches on the issue of understanding our parents. When Hagar was younger she rebeliuosly marry Bram, even though her father disapprove of it. She did not understand why then, why would her father prevent her from finding her happiness. But years later when her own son, John, want to marry a young girl that Hagar disapprove of.

The protagonist in this book has suffered as a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mother, and a mother in law. She has a son who tries to be good to her, and she does make a friend now and then, but they can not help much. You must read this book slowly and carefully.

She relives her life to provide her memory with false space....she snaps in and out of her memories to relive the horror of the inevitable..the nursing home......the hospital.......the smallest space we as humans end up in is our coffin or an urn.....at least by that point we are beyond caring.Loved it. So true to life."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The character of Hagar (\\"stranger\\") from the Book of Genesis has retained a fascination for many readers over the millenia. In the Biblical story, Hagar is the servant of Sarah, the wife of Abraham. Hagar becomes pregnant with Abraham's child, Ishmael, after Sarah herself is unable to conceive. Twice, before the birth of Ishmael and thereafter, Abraham sends Hagar, at Sarah's insistence into the desert to wander and die. Genesis 17 and 21. On both occasions, God rescues Hagar and promises that Ishmael will be the father of a great nation of warriors. Throughout the Biblical account, there is an enmity between Ishmael and his descendants and Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah, and his descendants. African Americans frequently describe themselves as Hagar's children, for her character as a lonely outcast. For example, a famous early blues by W.C. Handy is titled \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children, in a recording here by Louis Armstrong.Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. HandyAn extraordinary story by Edward P. Jones takes Handy's title and adds new dimensions to the Biblical tale, stressing themes of common humanity.All Aunt Hagar's ChildrenThe renowned Canadian author Margaret Laurence's (1926 -- 1987) novel \\"The Stone Angel\\" (1964) adds its own layers to the story of Hagar. The story is set in Manawaka, a small fictitious prarie town in Manitoba, Canada and spans roughly the late 19th to mid-20th Century. The main character and narrator is a woman named Hagar Shipley, (born Hagar Currie.). She tells her story when she is a woman, terminally ill, in her 90s. Hagar tells the story of her old age with many flashbacks to and dreams of her long life.Hagar feels herself an outcast, a loner, and independent, as her Biblical namesake. She is not an entirely likeable person but rather is tough, raw, judgmental, and cantankerous. She has been living for 17 years with her 65 year old son, Marvin and his wife Doris in a small home. At the age of about 80, Hagar took up cigarette smoking. She is demanding and makes life difficult for her son and his wife who themeselves are frail and getting on in years. Marvin and Doris try to persuade Hagar to move to a nursing home, but Hagar refuses and runs away.Hagar is not an unreliable narrator, but she has blinkers in how she sees herself. Laurence presents her convincingly while also inviting the reader to come to his or her own understanding of Hagar. The story is taut, sharp, and sometimes told with Hagar's withering judgments on herself and others. I find the book secular in outlook although replete with Biblical allusions, including Hagar herself, other Scriptural stories, and the young minister of Marvin and Doris, Mr. Troy, who visits and tries to comfort Hagar at critical moments late in her life.Hagar was the child of a self-made man, Currie, who owned a successful general store in early Manawaka. She has two brothers and a mother who died when Hagar was very young. We see in the book the deaths of these three men and Hagar's reactions and memories. Hagar's father sent her to the eastern part of Canada to a finishing school even though Hagar felt the money would be better spent by sending her brother to college. When she returns, her father tries to make Hagar a suitable match, but she is uninterested. Instead, she marries Bram Shipley, 14 years her senior. Bram is shunned in Manawaka. Her father refuses to see her after the marriage and cuts her out of his will. She truly becomes an outcast, as was the Biblical Hagar.Bram's first wife died of natural causes. He lives on a run-down farm but has no interest in working the land. He is taciturn, crude, and vulgar. Hagar with her manners and education, seems swayed by the opinions of others about Bram, but, to her own surprise, she responds deeply to Bram sexually. Hagar ultimately has two children, John, who dies, and Marvin, with whom she lives. She leaves Bram but returns when he dies.Hagar strives to be independent. She tends to blame others for her misfortunes, but she realizes that when she married Bram she knew much of what he was about. She valued Bram's crudeness, vulgarity, and sexuality. She remained ambivalent, and her pride, particularly, got in the way. She was unable to stand up for what she wanted, but adopted the view of Bram of the higher, more reputable citizens of Manawaka, particularly her father. When Bram dies, he is buried in a plot with Hagar's father and Shipley-Currie is inscribed on the grave. There is some belated reconciliation here, perhaps similar to that which might occur between the descendants of Ishmael and Isaac.When Mr. Troy, late in the book, sings Hagar a hymn about serving God \\"with mirth\\" and rejoicing, she has an epiphany of sorts. She says: (p. 292)\\"Pride was my wilderness, and the demon that led me there was fear. I was alone, never anything else, and never free for I carried my chains within me, and they spread out and shackled all I touched. O my two, my dead. Dead by your own hands or by mine? Nothing can take away these years.\\"As with most people, Hagar straddles uneasily between her insight into herself and her ingrained habits and responses.This is a thoughtful, well-written book about growing old and about the never ending task of coming to terms with oneself and, as Nietszsche might describe it, becoming who one is. The book reminded me of two other recent works I liked a great deal in which an elderly narrator reflects on the course of his or her earlier life. The first is \\"Veronica\\" by Mary Gaitskill, in which a middle-aged but terminally ill narrator gains peace with her earlier life of tawdry sex and sexual exploitation.VeronicaThe second novel is \\"So Long, See You Tomorrow by William Maxwell. In this acclaimed novel, a narrator in his 70s revisits and tries to understand haunting events from his youth, including the death of his mother and a sensational adulterous affair and murder-suicide involving a young friend.So Long, See You TomorrowThese two books, and Laurence's, offer varying understandings of the relationship between old age and youth.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I was made to read this book in high school as well, having said that, I loved it. Still do. In fact it inspired me to read more of Laurence's work. I have read EVERY Margaret Laurence book I could get my hands on. I was inspired to read all of her books because of the brilliant character developement she showed in the creation of Hagar. I mean I have never had such strong feelings about a fictional character in my life... Sometimes I was filled with sadness and pity, sometimes I laughed out loud, and sometimes, I just wanted to shake some sense into her! (None of Laurence's other characters brought out so much emotion in me.) In my mind that is what makes a book worth reading. I've made other people read this book too.

Being born, getting married, having children, dying -- this is basically the condensed version of Hagar's life. This book really makes me reevaluate me decisions about the futur and my life goals.

I had to read it for grade 12 English this year, which is why I thought I wouldn't enjoy it. Once I finally got started, though, I read it in one night. It didn't have a lot of action but Hagar was an interesting character and it gave me a lot of insight into how the elderly feel."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I am an OAC student who has just completed this book. This fictional story is one of the most lethargic books I have ever read.The constant shift in tenses is confusing. And althought the book is tedious and uninteresting I believe the book has a alternate meaning perhaps one about life or what we should do with it. If you are planning to read this book I suggest cole's note's."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I didn't want to like this book. Frankly, it made me think about things which, as a woman in my early 20s, I simply don't want to think about. Growing older. Losing the ability to perform simple tasks which I once took for granted. Feeling alone and unloved. The fact that it made me want to think about these things, that it made me keep turning the pages when I was tempted to put it aside, I think that demonstrates its power.I think it's no accident that many of the negative reviews for this novel here are by teenagers -- I don't know if it's possible for someone that young to be as touched my this novel, to understand it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"hagar shipley, turned 90 and showing all the symptoms of her age, spends the book reviewing her life and resisting the old folks home. Laurence is as skilled as Jane Austen in weaving a delicate tale of ironies, self-deception and double bottoms. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I liked this book but it needed a little bot of a lot and climax. This book was a book that I wouldn't pick up to read in my leisure but i had to read for my OAC English class. All in all this book was alright and even though i wanted to hate this book I kindda enjoyed, It's a story about an old woman and how she struggles to regain her freedom as a woman and live a life that didn't include a son that she didn't love and hasn't loved since the day he was born. She is always remembering the times that she had with hert second son that died quite a long time and she learns that she cannot hang on to the past but must move forward in order to rest in peace when the time comes and to be happy with herself."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Margaret Laurence did an excellent job at balancing the past and present. Both stories had the same plot structure. The climax of the story comes when the past and the present meet. Those who do not appreciate such a fine work of art do not know what makes good literature."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The end of the book was disappointing because she shows really believes in God. Otherwises the book is pretty boring. However the shifts for present to past are quite clear."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Well I wanted to hate this book after all it seemed to feminine for me, about a woman who finally realizes her mistakes and all that stuff. Unfortunately Margaret Laurence has put together such an amazing book that I really couldn't put it down and wound up finding myself feeling happy every time Hagar does something right. Bravo to Margaret Laurence on making an amazing novel that really does relate to the way many of us live and makes us think about it"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"FIRST I give this book 0 stars. I had to read this &quot;book&quot; for my english, and i mean this is far the worst thing i have ever encountered in my life. This book is not just boring, it is also very negative. My advise to anyone that is about to read this book is, read the coles notes."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"This book I must say was pretty boring at the beginning. But as you read further on, it gets more interesting. One flaw is that it gets a little confusing, when Hagar is 90 and then the flashbacks."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The only thing true about that statement was the Canadian part. This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. I had to read it for OAC English and it ranks right up there with The Grapes of Wrath. I recommend reading the Coles notes if you have to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"An unusual and insightful view of one's own life in retrospect, highlighting the frustration that a previously vivacious person feels when surrounded by old age. Perhaps more suitable for personal reading or study than prescribed school work,this is not always a comfortable read but is ultimately a rewarding one."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"As for many of these people that read The Stone Angel, I was not forced to read it.I choose to read it for my grade eleven Independent Study.I have read this book twice now and I have found it more enjoyable the second time.If anybody has ever read any of Margaret Laurence's books they will know she likes to use the main character as her narrator.This narrator goes back in the past so you can get an idea of their life.If Margaret Laurence did not reflect on Hagar Shipley's past there would not be a story.I quite enjoyed Hagar's stories of her life and I especially enjoyed her elderness because it contrasted her womenhood."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"First, as an uninterested english student who only took the oac course because i failed grade 12 course i had taught myself as a general rule to hate all books assigned. But the Stone Angel was different, Hagar's character paralled the ways i alienate my ownself from my life and others around, never really wanting the emotional closeness everyone else wants. This book, not only well written is a great lesson that life is lived once and no one escapes death. No matter how hard you try to run from it. This is a book i reccomend for anyone, and am happy it was assigned."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I was required to read this book for a high school assignment and found it to be laborious read. I found Hagar's character to be so bitter, angry, and grouchy that it just put a damper on the whole thing. She (as well as the other characters) is well fleshed out and that just makes things worse.There are several things you can pull out of this book but the most obvious one is the classic example of a person who is so proud and stubborn that s/he is unable to accept love or give of it. That's the character of Hagar and like her, this is a novel you'll want to avoid because it's a very dour thing to contend with.Darkhorse86"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I read this book in one of my classes in Teacher's College and I really disliked it. There are few books that I dislike, but this one ranks highly on that short list. It was one of the few books where I felt absolutely no emotional connection to any of the characters. I did not care what happened to the characters in the book. The author fails to hook the reader. Frankly, I would never choose this novel for high school students to read because they need books that make them want to continue reading. I also feel that most high school students would find it difficult to relate to the characters. I found that the plot was slow and ... well... the book was just boring. Some of the prose in the novel, however, was very poetic so the novel might be useful for studying &quot;found poetry&quot; but I really do not think that it would be the best choice for high school students to read for a novel study. If you are looking for a novel full of excitement and emotion, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"This book was very irritating to read. I felt like I knew exactly what kind of impression Laurence wanted me to get, and she went about it in an unskilled way. The themes were simple, and the charactes were archetypal and predictable. If you pick up this book, you are in for a boring read."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I found this book to be very depressing and I wish I hadn't read it. I heard about the book when I was taking a continuing education class on Canadian literature, but it wasn't part of our assigned reading. Since the teacher recommended the book so highly, I picked up a copy in a used book store when I saw it there some years later. So unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not have to read the novel for any class. Laurence uses the Proustian device of interweaving past and present reality, which makes the tale more interesting. The main character, Hagar Shipley, is 90 years old when the book opens, and she reflects back on her girlhood and marriage in a small town in Canada. It seems that someone dies on every page during the first few pages of the book. The story picks up later, but there is still enough tragedy and misery to sustain the downbeat mood. I can't say that the book was boring, because Laurence was able to maintain the tempo throughout without having the story drag. The author was not yet 40 when the book was published, so it's pretty remarkable how she was able to get inside the head of the old woman. If you're seeking a cheery, lighthearted tale, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Everything about Hagar Shipley is repugnant. From rathervisceral descriptions of huiman ugliness, I could find some literaryvalue. It's a technically solid book, but quite honestly, it's -boring.-Authors should feel in some way compelled to be telling a story. One of those simple mysteries, it seems. It seems a rather fitting sequel to W.O. Mitchell's who has seen the wind, and in fact I see a lot of sharp parallels. Unlikable narrator (though little Brian is simply incipid, while Hagar manages to be thouroughly horrid), dawdling, Seinfeldian plot that isn't really a plot at all, and a vcery frank account of praire life.I find myself wishing Bampton would just smack this woman. She's foolish, pretentious, pitiful and downright -stupid- at times. I derrived sick pleasure from her fall at the begining of the book."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I live in Canada and tried to send it as a gift to a friend in the United States. When she attempted to redeem my gift, Amazon told her that this Kindle book was not available to customers living in the USA. Amazon is generating a gift certificate for her, but disappointed that there was no warning or information about this restriction. I even ordered from Amazon.com, not the Canadian site."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"A ninety year-old woman who has lived a bitter, prideful life, looks back through time while wrestling with her debilitated present. It's much more fun than it sounds. Hagar Shipley is a piece of work akin toOlive Kitteridge. Her outbursts and antics wring bursts of admiration for this woman's spirit from the reader, despite her being a complete pain and an unreliable narrator.The book is beautifully written, with flights of description that verge on magical. Yes, there are shifts in the tenses; the past is told in the past tense, the present in the present tense. I don't think this is exactly confusing, is it? A friend recommended this book to me for years before I finally picked it up, and I wished I'd have made time for it sooner."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Compelling reading--so why, I wonder, have I waited all these years to actually read it (rather than read about it...). As a high school English teacher for 150 years...I steered away from 'Angel' because it was, I believed, not really suitable for (and wouldn't be of much interest to) my students. Having finally read it cover to cover, I'm glad I didn't use it. The subject matters and descriptions are ones I now find totally engrossing, but my students would, as I suspected, have found them far beyond their realm of experiences. And boring. But it's not. It's heartbreaking, funny and beautifully descriptive of a character and a time of life I can now see all too clearly.It's too bad that the Kindle e-copy is one of the worst edited I've ever read. Amateurish run-on paragraphing, punctuation errors, word reversals, contraction errors ('shell' for 'she'll', 'hell' for 'he'll', etc.). So many it becomes really aggravating. Does Kindle not engage proof readers?Otherwise, a magnificent story, perhaps because as we get older we see more and more Hagars around (and in) us."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Growing old is a scary idea for many people, and this is a sad look into the life of a very bitter elderly woman. The character is mean, spiteful, and conceited, yet by the end of the story it was impossible not to feel compassion for her as everything she believed and held dear simply vanished into a new world."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"this book is horribly wrong. Really, who wants to read about growing old and dying alone because you hated life and all the people it brought to you. This book is full of regrets and is endlessly tormenting to the reader that your every mistake will kill you in the end and that self-independance is a killer. They make you read this book in high school now and everyone in the free world with the right to education knows that a book they have to MAKE you read is not one that most people would WANT to read. Too bad you cannot make it no stars."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"What I mean by this is that affixing the title of &quot;Worst book ever&quot; to The Stone Angel is not a stretch. I have read some truly bad novels in my time, but The Stone Angel is simply horrifying. Never has there been a more repulsive character than Hagar, a neurotic, arrogant, despicable old woman. The book is told in a series of intermittent flashbacks that seem pointless in conjunction with Hagar's current situation (which is that her family wants to put her in a nursing home).At first I was mildly interested by the florid writing style, but the book soon made me numb (it actually caused me physical pain). The reason for this is that the main character of The Stone Angel's story is the most repulsive fictional creation I've ever beheld. Hagar's bloated idiocy renders her ineffably repellent after just a few chapters. Being 90 years old, her thoughts and dialogue are completely separated from reason, destroying any interest a person could have in the progress of the story. Her flashbacks further reinforce her overweening nature. I suppose this book has merit if you wish to enter the mind of a 90-year old arrogant woman whose logical faculties have been shattered, but who really wants to read about that? Sure it's believable (for which some reviews have credited it), but why on earth does anyone care about a cantankerous old hag with bowel problems? Talk about the ultimate anti-hero!By the end of the novel, Hagar recognizes that she is a loathsome human being and attempts to reconcile that fact with herself. However, all throughout the book, there is no indication that this realization is flowering. All of a sudden, it just occurs spontaneously. This is both incredibly unrealistic and incredibly disappointing for a reader who has put up with the dross of this novel for 250 pages (give or take). Apparently Lawrence realized that her character was beyond hope so she endeavored to hammer in an epiphany that could justify her tedious banter that protracted the horrible, horrible book.Some will surely argue that the book deserves stars for style and canny art sensibility. I disagree. Stylistic merit is only a virtue when anchored by a story and characters that don't sicken the person reading the book. It's times like this I wish Amazon had a 0-star rating, because that's what The Stone Angel deserves."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The Stone Angel by Margaret Lawrence is a novel that doesn't leave much to the imagination. Hagar Shipley describes everything from a fart to being undressed in incredible detail...so much that the reader doesn't really need to know.It is also a novel where Hagar tries to give advice to other people without taking it herself. She is full of pride, so much so that she dies while fighting over a glass of water with her daughter. It is a sad book, but not emotionally sad. It is pathetic that Hagar can't accept the fact that people will be people, and there's nothing that she can do about it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I am a straight A student (grade 12) and a bookworm.

No one."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I've recently finished reading the Stone Angel(Or The Stoned Angel according to my class.). The story was written excellently but there was a weak plot. I personally found the story dull, and it helped put me to sleep at night. On the other hand, Every single Female in the class loved the book, while every single male hated it. The women said that they could get in touch with Hagar and they could understand what she's going through. The males couldn't understand it, This book can be considered 'The Chick Flick' of literature. So, If you're a female, I recommend this book, but if you are a male, I will have to say that you shouldn't get it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"As a high school student I was forced to read this book. I do not recomend this book because it jumps back and forth between Hagar the 90 year old and Hagar the girl and woman. Further more it is difficult to stay focused on the book because it seems like a meaningless life story."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. Hardly anyone in my class liked it. This book is depressing, boring, dull and annoying to read. Everytime i tried to read it I kept falling asleep and i have insomnia! This book does not deserve even one star. This book was written by a miserable old woman about a miserable old woman.There are so many books written by canadian authors that would have been much better to read than this book for my OAC english class. This book was garbage i do not suggest it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"That is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one, there is a chance it was better than I could appreciate in grade 12.but NO!, However many million Elvis Fans can't be wrong and neither can the Hundreds of grade 12 students I've seen read this book. It is almost legendary at the high school I went to. The teacher who always forces her 122 English class to read it gives very specific quizzes on each chapter because otherwise noone will read it. Everyone has an amazing Stone angel quiz guess story. My friend guessed &quot;where did Bram (been a while can't remember all the names...) urinate?,&quot; and got it right.I did read the book. I didn't enjoy it. I found Hagar very unlikeable, and the book was BORING! BORING! BORING! The only person I've every met that liked it was a Grad Student studying Canadian LIterature.Please Please Please, curriculum developers take note: Just because a novel is Canadian does not mean that it is good! It definately does not mean that you should force innocent 16 year olds to read it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I read the &quot;Stone Angel for a literature assignment for my grade twelve english class.

It was incredibly boring how it started off talking about the stone angel in the graveyard and i honestly couldn't care less but i had to read it for the term paper. other than hagar's occasionally amusing use of sarcasm and her bitterness towards the world, it was one of the hardest books i've had to read. her sometimes funny sarcasm, bitterness and negativity towards the people around her still cannot make up for the rest of the incredibly boring novel."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I've read this book a couple of years ago in high school. Yes they make you read this book in Canada! How can anyone be so cruel? How horrible is this book you ask? Let me put it this way, you'd have more fun watching your toilet seat than reading it. It's about a very old woman (ancient) talking about her failed relationships with men, and complaining about how her kids abandoned her, yada yada yada. And if you're Canadian like me, you've probably had to do quizzes on it in grade 12. Let's see &quot;Who gave Hagar water when she was in the hospital?&quot; or &quot;What was her favourite flower?&quot; ...It's boring, unimaginative, and a woman's guide for hating men. It's HORRIBLE!If you suffer from insomia, I suggest you read this book. If not, run for your lives!"},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"This is essential CanLit 101.Iconic!For the longest time I have intended to read Margaret Laurence, and this is where I have started. I now know that I will continue on and read more of her work, especially the other Manawaka books in the series.I think we are looking at some essential Canadian literature here, and yet, nearly every high school student from St John's to Victoria would rise up and say \\"What? Are you nuts?\\" As much as this book is inflicted upon the high-schoolers of Canada, it sure has not gained a welcome reception by that age group! For the Canadian teenager, seeing The Stone Angel on the English syllabus has become the equivalent of.... hmmm what would one say? Having a radio that is locked on the CBC station?I believe this is because The Stone Angel is a book that is all about the \\"interior\\" and to truly love the book the reader must have an appreciation of the life processes involved in becoming an elderly person. From start to finish we are on the inside of this character Hagar Shipley. It is not the realm of the exciting pace and involved plotline. This book is rather a very somber, brooding, introspective look at a proud and uncompromising woman in her nineties. She is a woman who does not (in the slightest) want to succumb to the realities, adjustments, and inconveniences of aging and dying. As she faces the combined trauma of diminished health and loss of meaningful relationships, she has to come to terms with who she really is.How far will her incessant pride and irritable crankiness get her in this last year of her life? How can she escape from those who try to make it all easier for her? Will she confess her unmitigated (and inevitable) need of others... of those who truly, and undauntingly, care for her well-being? Will she break down or remain haughty?Laurence is simply brilliant in that she weaves a seamless web between the present and the past, between Hagar's current experience and her memories.It is not easy, the transition[s] that we who will live on into old age will have to make if we are to succeed at being old. This book pulls no punches with how difficult the process can be, especially for the type \\"A\\" personality.It is no accident that the book begins with the lines from Dylan Thomas:Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light.It is a story about a woman who raged. And yet (in my opinion)there is not one real angry tirade in it! It is (I think) a different sort of \\"raging\\" that is being dealt with here in the story, as with the poem by Thomas. It is not the kind of raging that is with gritted teeth and defiance, [denial] it is the kind of raging that is mingled with profound sadness and regret... yes, anger too I suppose, but anger only because one has to leave behind so much of what one loves.Here is the realistic journey of a woman who has to come to terms with the fact that \\"what's going to happen can't be delayed indefinitely.\\"I think the book is somewhat of a masterpiece. Voraciously, I read it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"As you can probably tell by some of the other reviews, this book will NOT be for everyone. If you're looking for a quick escape, lots of action or a strong romance, this is not the book you want. However, if you enjoy books that aren't your usual fare and are strong on psychological tension, this is an excellent choice. I absolutely loved this story of an elderly woman, a rather judgmental, cantankerous person. I like novels that show how a person grows and changes and I find slow change to be most believable and true to life, as it is in this book. Many readers may have found Hagar Shipley's life to be rather mundane, even dull. But I didn't - her marriage to a man she eventually saw as inferior and coarse, her relationship with her children, her desire to make a proper home and better herself - were all quite realistic to me. As she becomes increasingly frail and dependent on her son and daughter-in-law, she also comes to see her life in a different way. I won't reveal more but I do urge you to read this one and stick with it. Odds are, you'll want to read more by the gifted author, Margaret Laurence."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Most of the negative reviews seem to come from those who are forced to read this for their OAC requirements. I too had to read this book and I too could not, at the time, see WHY. In retrospect though I learned to appreciate what Hagar taught.....that space and the ability and right to choose for one's self is EVERYTHING. It's all we have.Hagar's right to choices was fading and she felt trapped - hence the reason she ran from her present and retreated to the days where she faced a future full of decisions.......Read this again when you are out of highschool and it all makes sense. Better yet, visit your relatives in a nursing home and think of Hagar."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Hagar Shipley is a repressed woman, simply put, and one who is nearing the end of her long life. Realising she hasn't many years left, and watching her body and mind fall apart, Hagar comes to understand the chances she has missed and the mistakes she has made. Looking into the mirror she can still see the eyes of the young girl she once was, and through her memories works through the issues left unresolved from her life. By the end of the book you will understand this woman through and through and hopefully come to empathise more with the elderly. This is a beautiful work, written in lovely, flowing prose. Those who enjoy this book should also try Vita Sackville-West's 'All Passion Spent,' which is similar in theme. Two better works about coming to the end of life I've never read."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The Stone Angel is a book that I felt compelled to read--it is one of the most prestigious titles in the CanLit canon. Unlike many of the &quot;great works of literature&quot; I've read lately, this one didn't disappoint.The Stone Angel is the story of Hagar Shipley's life, told in her own voice. Hagar is a ninety year old woman living with her son and daughter-in-law. She is rampant with memory. Her struggles for independence are interspliced with vivid recollections of her past.The narrative voice of The Stone Angel is astounding. Laurence is a master of the simile and provides the reader with beautiful descriptions on nearly every page. At the same time, the narration, from Hagar's lips, constantly provides insight into Hagar and the people that surround her. At times, Laurence is able to tell you more about characters by their grammar than many writers are able to tell you in entire novels. Laurence has a particularly keen sense of diction. Her dialogue reveals mountains of insight about generations gaps, economic divides, and the walls that pride builds.Overall, this is technically one of the best books I've ever read, and one of the most pleasing."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I want to respond to all those who object to this novel because it is 'depressing.' While it is true that The Stone Angel is not a light-hearted, comic-book romp through the life of Hagar Shipley, it is an accurate portrayal of a dissatisfied woman at the end of her life, wrestling with phantoms of the past and realities of the present. Laurence's brilliant use of the unreliable narrator, as well as her effective manipulation of time and place, make this novel resonate with me. If the novel is upsetting, it's not Margaret Laurence's fault, after all. She gives a justified portrayal of a woman's life, and if we get upset because of it, at least her work has accomplished some form of communication. If you don't want to get upset by literature (being upset triggers active thought about how you relate to the novel!), then I suggest a lifetime subscription to O! magazine."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I read \\"The Stone Angel\\" back in high school as required reading for my senior year English class, so naturally I despised it. A Canadian novel about old age had nothing to do with me, a teenager in Tampa Bay; so apart from helping me earn an \\"A,\\" I had no particularly good feelings toward the book. However, after revisiting it later as a student at the University of Florida, I had a change of opinion.Margaret Laurence's independent voice and candid description of the physical and psychological battle of growing old deserve special attention. In Hagar Shipley, she has created a character worthy of contempt, pity, and eventually admiration. Though I wish she had done more with the book's other characters, Laurence's mastery of the protagonist and her ability to mold the reader's reactions to her stand out nonetheless. Before you reach ninety yourself, I recommend that you read this novel."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"I saw a lot of negative remarks about this book and was a little aprehensive about spending time reading it but you know, it's really very good. I think it's the type of book that you really have to be over 40 to appreciate. How a high-school teacher would expect a young person to relate to this book is incomprehensible. I can see why the negative remarks are mostly from this generation. But being 46, with stubborn elderly parents who refuse to move to an assisted living community - even though they are physically incapable of caring for themselves - I could see where all the characters were coming from. I also volunteer at a nursing home and the conversations she has the residents of the home involved in are right on the mark. For the younger people who hated this book, come back in about 20 years! This is really quite good."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"In Margaret Laurence's novel, The Stone Angel, we are thrown into the life of Hagar. Seen through the eyes of a ninety year old women, we experience her old age along side her and see how her independence is continuously being stolen. As a reader you feel pity for her, while at the same time recognizing and accepting Hagar's faults.As in all of Laurence's writings, the reader is introduced to a character that is ordinary in many ways. What I have learned from Laurence's writings is that even the most ordinary of us have a thrilling story to tell. Hagar's life is arguably Laurence's best novel and everyone should read The Stone Angel at least once.Through her life, Hagar deals with pride and the loss of her independence in a way that is not always admirable; and as a result she gains both humanity and the readers respect. Through flashbacks from her life we see where Hagar has been and understand why she is the way she is. From a father with high expectations to a hasty marriage and lifestyle change, Hagar's life is considerably altered. She finds herself wondering how so much went wrong.I believe everyone will be able to relate to this novel in some way. It is a novel that is enjoyable to read, but also one that becomes a part of you. Everyone should own a copy and keep it close at hand to remind us about life, holding on, and sometimes letting go."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The first time I read The Stone Angel was in high school as part of the reading curriculum. Despite my English teacher's best efforts to ruin the book for us, I managed to enjoy it. I was surprised that a book with adult content (mild) had survived the censor's cut, but I was pleased it did.A year ago I decided to reread the book and found it was even better than I my memory served me. Now that I have some life experience under my belt, I discovered the book to be far more moving and poignant. Margaret Lawrence brings out a true to life character in Hagar, the book's protagonist. Hagar could be your mother, your aunt, or your grandmother.This is a beautiful, touching, compelling, and powerful book. Hagar's struggle with her own painful life memories as she tries to protect her independence and maintain her pride is quite heartrending. I found myself glued to page after page in this story.The Stone Angel is the first book of the five-volume Manawaka series. Each book in the series stands alone quite well and is enjoyable on its own. I don't believe Lawrence had intended a series when she first wrote The Stone Angel, however, the books were there to be written, and write them she did."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The book was in relativly good condition for a used book, with minimal damage to the spine and the pages. The delivery took a bit longer then I would have liked but, was within the delivery estimate. There was some writing and highlighting in the book, very little, but I don't actually remember if that was in the description or not. Overall I was okay with it."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"This is a very good story. It is a sort of soap opera. The story is the telling of the life of an old lady, Hagar Shipley (nee Currie), at the end ostoryf her life. She remembers (a touch of authorial needs here) in chronological order, so you see her grow up, marry, deal with the kids and bad marriage, etc. She is also telling of her life in the present. Here the author is magnifcent. From what we could find out about her, she was in her mid-thirties when she wrote this. It reminds me of Stephen King's \\"The Shawchank Redemption and Rita Hayworth\\" because both are so good at describing somethings and people that you would not expect them to know so much about. It must have taken a lot of research, education or experience to write these stories.My wife was entranced by her use of language and it was beautiful, well done and interesting. I was put off by the soap opera storyline, but the language was truly wonderful to me as well.An oddity is the publisher of this book, University of Chicago Press, notes on the back cover that this is Ms. Laurence's second book in the Manawaka series, which it is not. It is the first. It is slightly surprising that U of C Press would make such a boo-boo."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"The Stone Angel is a very well written and enjoyable book. I would truly recommend this book to anyone in Sr. High or older; even as a high school student I rather enjoyed reading the novel. I found it similar to movie The Notebook, in the fact that it was someone reflecting on the trial and tribulations of their life except that The Stone Angel doesn't include much romance. Rather it deals with the issues of day to day life, in every stage of life. Therefore the ideas discussed in this book could relate to anyone's life; as all of us deal with at least one of the issues Hager faces, whether it is the death of a loved one, or arguing with a family member. But by dealing with all these issues Hager faces more challenges than the average person has to in a life time. Hager deals with these challenges in a unique but understandable way; making the novel both intriguing and a great read. This novel has many unexpected twists as it deals with the life of a ninety year old. Her life is full of sorrow and challenges but her strong personality allows her to preserver through the difficulties she faces throughout her entire life.The Stone Angel is a well written novel. Through Margaret Laurence's use of a first person point of view it really allows you to relate to Hager by the end of the novel. Also, Margaret Laurence does a great job of depicting what life is really like; she doesn't add fantasy or unrealistic perspectives. By placing the novel in a Canadian setting it allows Canadians like me to really relate to and understand the true setting."},{"Title":"The Stone Angel","review":"Hello!In one of the reviews I read, it said something like \\"we should all be like Hagar Shipley\\"...well I disagree, 'cause Mrs.Shipley was indeed, without a doubt a sweet, loving woman however she was always set on what other people thought...I believe it doesn't matter what other people think (live a little) life is too short to concentrate on pleasing others so why not please yourself?And she favored John over Marvin...when John became a drunk(much like his father) and Marvin became a descent man!!! (what kind of mother favors a child more than the others?) I know that not everyone is perfect...and that's what makes this book sooo realistic! The author brings out the good in each character but doesn't forget to include their flaws!Anyway...this book was amazing...it was sooo realistic...I'm speechless, I really am!!!

As she journeys through the final days of her life, Hagar takes us on a journey of years past as she recollects and takes stock of the life she's led. She's a great character, manipulative and proud, sweet one moment, a holy terror the next.

It is an excellent book from a technical perspective, but lacks a lot of feeling. The emotions in this book, while well defined, were a bit dry and didn't draw me in. I was also REALLY tired of hearing about Hagar Shipley by around two thirds of the way through (and I do realize that this could be the author's intention).

I guess I knew how nice it is to be young, but I had taken advantage of it. This book had me thinking, what would it be like to have someone do the things that your use to doing, for you. This is a book that I would certainly not pick up just to read for leisure, but I give the author credit because it was not as bad as she says.

Reading *In the City of Shy Hunters* over the last week has been a beautiful, joyous, heartbreaking experience. Unless you are a really tiny-hearted person, you will probably fall in love with this book, just as the book's narrator, Will Parker, \\"William of Heaven\\", tells you right off the bat that he has fallen in love with you. (He means it.) The vision that informs this book (as well as TS'searlier books, but here on a near epic scale ) is unlike any other in American fiction. It is huge, mystical, generous, \\"sexually haunted,\\" erotic, and deeply spiritual.If you believe in the power of books and poems, music and art in general to reflect and renew what Wallace Stevens called \\"the voice that is great within us,\\" then you will be glad that Tom Spanbauer is in the world, and grateful for his generosity and hard work as a writer and as a human being. Please read this book. *Mitakuye iyasin!*"},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"This is the long-awaited new novel by Tom Spanbauer, author of The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon, a novel which got me into semi-deep trouble when I selected it for a book discussion group once. Spanbauer is just NOT an easy author. Not for suburban matrons, no, no, no... Definitely a stylistic challenge (there are no quotation marks anywhere, so you have to parse it out in your head as you read) and the material and setting have certainly been used before (the joys and agonies of New York City at the beginning of the Age of AIDS), but there's a definite attraction meshed in with all its difficulties. The flashbacks to the narrator's strange, abusive childhood in Idaho are lovely and touching, and the characters are nothing if not memorable---performance artists, homeless people, wannabees and waiters. There are multitudinous references to Native American and Western American culture---Stranger in a Strange Land goes 80's, told in a late 90's style---which inform and propel the narrative and the characters' motivations.It's not like anything all that stellar actually happens---Will is looking for a childhood friend who got a scholarship and moved to NYC years before---and his quest is filled with blind alleys and, of course, with self-discovery. There's a good deal of violence and queasy-making descriptions of edgy sexual encounters and acres and acres of humankind's-inhumanity-to-humankind, but there's also a warped beauty to the whole thing and moments of sincere love. Imagine Tales of the City directed by Sam Peckinpah in a benevolent mood..."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"I waited, and waited, and WAITED for the release of this, Tom Spanbauer's third novel (all good things to those who wait!). A lot has passed in the 10 years since the release of Spanbauer's incredible &quot;The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon,&quot; but by some ethereal craft, he has managed (again) to bring his readers to a very special place he knows, and we love--where things exist, dream-like/life-like, on several planes at once. Here, he again shares with us stories of a few more of those who are, and always will be there--loved by us. If you believe in magic, and in the pathos that life brings to all of us, then you, too, will fall deep (hey! even deeper than that!) into the story of what happens to sweet, sweet William, and the people he knows and loves. The joy and sorrow of modern American living and loving plays out on these pages like an ancient Greek tragedy--it is the stuff that timeless tales are made of. It is the stuff of eternity..."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"Something like a mixture of Dancer from the Dance, Huckleberry Finn, and Gravity's Rainbow, this book is not going to be for everyone. But if you like storytelling, philosophy and style, you may just love it. I do.The author has a unique voice, and I can understand people who have trouble with it (skip the prologue if you do). The book tells a good if classic story, but it's also an exploration of perception, memory and reality. It understands that since events exist by perception, their geography is in memory, not in time. As in life, the absurd and the tragic and the sanctimonious and the sentimental all crowd in on one another; but the characters are fascinating, and I found it easy to get caught up in their lives.The comic scenes are masterful; my favorite is one in a crowded laundromat, where the narrator tries to guard a finally-available washing machine from other aggressive new yorkers while his laundry remains out of reach.I liked this book because it told a good story and made me think."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"People say that Spanbauer, one of my favorite novelists, took so long writing this book because he planned it as his last testament, and that the manuscript mounted up to a magic mountain of pages, enough to dwarf a Thomas Pynchon or a David Foster Wallace. Cold heads at Grove Press prevailed and insisted on cutting the MS down to its present state, where it sort of just sits there, neither fish nor fowl, a sketch for a grander Balzacian social tragedy, like James McCourt's subsequent QUEER STREET but with an actual plot. What we have now is still pretty amazing, but don't you wish that novels were treated like movies and that we might someday hope for the \\"director's cut\\" of ITCOSH, with its lofty architectronics restored to us the way the writer wanted us to have it?Perhaps in years to come a scholarly edition will be prepared, for Spanbausr probably has the missing sections somewhere? Can I do it? If there's a committee, count me in! I cried and cried all the way through the Will Parker story, and his hunt for Charlie the missing lost boy keeps the novel going through some dangerous backwaters. I didn't exactly fall in love with Rose, the glamorous transvestite character, I kept thinking of \\"Angel\\" the one from the musical RENT; however \\"Rose\\" is supposed to be more of an intellectual, a Dorothy Dean type with yet oodles of sex appeal and every trick in the book.Many great novels have been written on the restaurant theme, and perhsps it's Spanbauer's concentration on this setting that, for me, evokes the glory days of Balzac and the 19th century passion for knowing everything and educating one's readers in the process. This book takes place during the days when AIDS and HIV were still unfamiliar to most people, even to proto sophisticated New Yorkers, when a man in the AIDS ward might not be able to count on his own parents visiting him (here, one of them is told that \\"my son died long ago\\"), and even one's own friends might draw back for fear of breath-drawn transmission. The heartbreak and the courage it took to go on in those days make for a stirring story, and even if the rumor isn't true, even if Spanbauer wanted his book to be exactly this size, he took a giant subject and smashed holes in it everywhere, like someone inside a pumpkin compelled to make a jack o'lantern--punching outwards, and shining with a weird, eternal fire."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"The \\"shy hunters\\" of the title in Tom Spanbauer's most recent novel are apparently those reluctant heroes among us who, once pushed to the fore, are capable of great feats of, if not heroism, then at least of affirmation. One such \\"hero,\\" is Will Parker, who comes to New York from Idaho in 1983 in search of his friend, lover, and blood-brother, Charlie 2 Moons, whom he once betrayed in a moment of cowardice that has haunted him for two decades. He is destined to spend six years in New York, at a time of crisis that demands sacrifice, not just from Will, but from his assortment of colorful friends, including perhaps the most tragic, Roosevelt Washington King, a one-time English professor cum drag queen/performance artist (and close friend of Elizabeth Taylor), who, having contracted AIDS, plans to exit this world in a \\"lucid compulsion to act polemically.\\" The action comes to a head for Will in a violent confrontation with an equestrian cop in Tompkins Square Park. By this time, Will has \\"found\\" Charlie 2 Moons, lost one lover to suicide and another to madness, and seen his world nearly emptied of friends by AIDS. This work represents a remarkable tight-rope walk for its author, as he veers between tragic realism and quotidian farce. But, whereas he accomplished this feat quite nimbly in \\"The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon,\\" here he often wavers. Perhaps he identifies too closely with \\"Will of Heaven,\\" who is described as either a \\"handsome Einstein or intelligent Tom Selleck.\\" A glance at Spanbauer's picture on the back cover of my book reveals this as a spot-on description of the author himself, perhaps with a little Gene Shalit thrown in. Spanbauer contracted AIDS while writing this book, which is a labor of love, dedicated to those who \\"have passed through the Door of the Dead.\\" If good intentions were enough, this would be a masterpiece. As it is, \\"The City of Shy Hunters\\" is less of a novel than a collection of brilliant set-pieces, many of which will haunt the reader forever. For all its talk of suicide and death, its ultimate message is a positive one (\\"a kind of ... joy\\"), which gives us hope that the \\"extra lovely\\" Mr. Spanbauer has a lifetime of writing left to do."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"We are introduced to Will Parker, boy from Idaho, as he journeys to the Wolf Swamp (Manhattan) in search of a lost love.During the course of the novel, he learns that it is his task, metaphorically speaking, to &quot;Slay the monster, and rescue the maiden.&quot; I like the uncertainty at the end of the book whether he has been able to accomplish either of those goals, because it makes the point that reality isn't as neat as the stories we tell about it. We can create the stories, but the reality itself is more chaotic and never fully explainable.On another level, the book is easy to understand. Boy moves to city, boy finds self and falls in love, boy's friends get AIDS and die. Although this plot line is somewhat of a cliche, and truly heartbreaking, the vivid characterizations and passions of the characters in their life make it a book about living rather than about dying.This is one you'll ponder for a long time."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"Readers who have already experienced The Man Who Fell in Love With the Moon do not need to be told that Tom Spanbauer can write a stunning and excruciating book. But I do think that they will find In the City of Shy Hunters to be more stunning and more excruciating than even that earlier work.Without saying too much, this is a novel that any serious student of literature or culture cannot afford to ignore, and I hope it finds an audience far wider than that. Buy it, read it, lend it to your mother. A great, great writer is among us and publishing books and we had better not let them go unnoticed."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"Such beautiful writing. Spanbauer has this magical way of writing that makes you feel everything so deeply. You come to care about the characters like loved ones.

The only probably with reading Spanbauer is that after you read him other books won't seem as good as they used to."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"At the March 2009 meeting of the NYC LGBT Center book discussion group, we had a nice sized group read and discuss \\"In the City of Shy Hunters\\" by Tom Spanbauer.Most of us thought that it was hard to get started, but once you did -- Hold on for a wild ride through the East Village in the 1980s. Why was it hard to get started? The language is repetitive and \\"machine-gun like.\\" Why was it such a wild ride? The novel gallops from Idaho flashbacks (which most found very touching) to various episodes in the East Village involving real New Yorkers of the period: performance artists, drug addicts, waiters, alcoholics, Native Americans, drag queens (of various ilks), lots of homeless people, a family from Connecticut, and one naive but well-meaning and ultimatelyvery knowledgeable narrator. The novel ends with many deaths from AIDS (but it took a while to get to the AIDS part of the story) and the infamous Tompkins Square Riots.Some thought that the writing style was completely self indulgent and irritating and the characters pasteboard thin and unsympathetic. I think that by the end of the discussion, those of us who liked the novel and those who didn't found more in the story than they originally thought. Not an easy read - but a great portrait of a period, told in the style of one who was there.This was a tough read for many - but a good book for a discussion group."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"I didn't want to read anything else by Spanbauer for fear it would taint the standing of my favorite fiction, \\"The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon\\". \\"In the City of Shy Hunters\\" didn't take over that position, but it was a compelling, poignant, heartbreakingly beautiful story, told with realism and fancy. A necessary addition to any library."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"This novel hovered at the outer edges of my view for a long time, but I finally got a copy and read it. I am amazed at the lack of publicity In the City has received. Unique characters that you come to care for as flesh and blood beings and wonderous language make for one of the deepest and most tender novels I've ever read. The author claims in an interview that writing this book almost killed him but also saved his life, and I can see why. A work in which to immerse yourself, completely."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"It was, in some ways, what I expected. Manhattan, the 1980's, the cocaine, the AIDS apocalypse. Brutal, indeed. Spanbauer's characters--some naive, some dark, most ambivalent--ricochet through the city and its demon-lined streets, colliding with sub-human debasements and self-destructive dalliances. Within the sufferers and what Spanbauer creates as &quot;fools&quot; or &quot;harlequins&quot;, there is complexity: people do good things, people do bad things. However, the enemy (&quot;pharisees&quot;), is given less depth; the enemy is blanketly: Reagan, the Catholic church, cops, the elite--in other words, the obvious enemies, summed up and embodied by one mounted police sergeant who has no revealed motive other than doing bad things to people. That's too bad, because the moral grayness of the good faction is rather appealing, and more like something feasible.The novel is rhythmically framed with myriad, repeated catch phrases: &quot;Green Date.&quot;; &quot;The lucid compulsion to act polemically.&quot;;&quot;Stranded beings searching for God.&quot; These from the cliquish central cast of the story, at whose lives you peek from time to time, catching glimpses of pathos and perversion, family strife and gloom--though not quite often enough to gain appreciation for the intense bonds the protagonist, William &quot;of Heaven&quot;, avows. The characters, indeed, seem to be a collection of extreme postures and deeds: less an endearing, downtrodden bunch than an exclusive, curious lot. Thus the repeated catch phrases often ring with the empty profundity of inside jokes.What's nice is the depth of history some of the main characters are given. The most compelling part of thewhole affair to me was when we left Manhattan and visited the past, as narrated by various characters, especially the protagonist. William's damaged upbringing on an Indian Reservation in Idaho kept me riveted (and was the book's closest bond to its predecessor &quot;The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon&quot;).All in all, it succeeds in bringing an Apocalyptic edge to the story of the New York AIDS crisis in the 1980's. It's a romp with often-outrageous turns that may stretch credibility, but as such is an absorbing page-turner. Its graphic depictions of acts, both sexual and violent, are not for the dainty, but the overall impression isn't one of despair and gore, but of redemption and survival."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"I love Tom Spanbauer's narrative voice. I read Man Who Fell in Love With the Moon, and was frustrated as heck trying to get through the first half. After a while, he grew on me. Before I knew it I was in love with his style.I won't comment much on the story line, but reading of this author is a great great experience. Give it time, be patient, read it to the end, and fall in love with his language."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"I read The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon and I fell in love with Spanbauer's writing. In The City Of Shy Hunters is quite possibly a more brilliant novel, though both will certainly hold up as classics.There are certain writers who are acclaimed in their lifetimes - and after moreso- and those who are completely ignored. In my opinion, Spanbauer is an unrecognized genius, deserving of more respect from the literary world. In a world where lesser original writers are held up as examples, Spanbauer's voice is utterly unique, his stories completely compelling, his characters unapologetic and unforgettable - and his words, pure street poetry.I recommend this book to everyone wanting to connect to the writings of a true artist telling the story of wartorn New York City in the '80s, ravaged by AIDS. This book isn't about AIDS though. It's about the people you meet who teach you how to love. Utterly compelling."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"Spanbauer's first effort in a decade follows the incomparable and lyrical \\"Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon\\"--a novel that deserves its cult status. The best elements of his preceding work are here--Native American mysticism, elegant prose, bawdy humor--along with a seething anger reminiscent of David B. Feinberg and the neurotic cosmopolitanism of Spalding Gray.The basic story combines two narratives that have been told many times before: rural boy comes to New York and confronts the fact that he is gay; a group of friends live through the early years of the AIDS epidemic. There are some wonderful moments when the Idaho-bred naivety of the lead character, William Parker, meets New York's in-your-face honesty. In particular, the chapter describing his first day on the job in a restaurant is relentlessly hilarious. (A personal note: I moved to New York from the Northwest the same month and year as Parker did. Manhattan was certainly a different place then, and Spanbauer captures perfectly the city's grittiness.)Living in New York during the 1980s was at times certainly like living in a war zone, especially for those of us who lost (and are still losing) so many friends to AIDS. While Spanbauer's portrait of New York City is brutally on-target, his plot and characters never seem quite right. Like David Feinberg, Spanbauer can't contain his anger; his book boils in its hostility toward the Reagans, the Church, gentrification, and other all-too-easy targets, and he overstates his tirades to the point of absurdity. (A vengeful crime directed at \\"Cardinal O'Henry\\" on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral is exceptionally silly.) And, like Spalding Gray, Spanbauer seems more interested in breaking taboos than in exploring their impact on his characters or tying them into his plot. For example, an uncomfortably explicit account of incest does not in any way contribute to the development of the novel's character or story; it reads like an appended scene hoping to equal the shock value of his previous novel. He is often so busy brewing these episodes that he ultimately fails to make his characters and their actions coherent or convincing; without exception, everybody in the novel either goes crazy or dies. Five hundred pages later, the number of loose ends and pointless incidents defy counting.Spanbauer is undoubtedly one of the best stylists writing \\"gay fiction\\" today. But, even taking into account its mystical themes and tragic events, this novel as a whole strains authenticity."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"In this nearly 500 page book, Tom Spanbauer appears to leave no thought unexpressed. The descriptions of the characters' dress, of places and things mundane lard the tale like cholesterol in an artery. The accretion of the quotidian eventually becomes mind-numbing. (What was his editor thinking?) The situation isn't helped by the fact that the punctuation -- there are no quote marks -- is affected and annoying, leading to sentences like: &quot;Maybe I should just confront, I said, The chef, I said, Maybe I should talk to Daniel.&quot; By page 100, I began to skim, looking for names or phrases that might signal an advance in the plot. This proved fruitless, however, since the narrator frequently recants what he has just said. Eventually, I put the book aside. The really unfortunate thing is that Mr. Spanbauer has considerable talent. I suspect this same story would have been terrific if he had indulged the reader instead of himself."},{"Title":"In the City of Shy Hunters","review":"This book is barely readable. It have a lot of run on sentences. The style of writing distracts the reader from the story line. I can't get into the book at all."},{"Title":"Just Being Difficult?: Academic Writing in the Public Arena (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Newspapers and magazines take glee in deriding academics. It has become a spectator sport. But calling an academic pedantic hardly seems sporting -- or particularly original.Reading this book reminded me of why i went to college -- to explore ideas in ways that I hadn't before. It's true that the authors in this volume take rather similar positions; however, it's also true that it's a much-needed explanation of why new ideas sometimes sound new.It also shows how writing needs to be read in context -- not only do individual sentences often need the paragraphs around them to make sense, but individual publications often need the context of other writings to make sense. Each writer shouldn't need to review or rewrite all of philosophical history at the beginning of every article or book! Authors should, in certain times and places, be able to start from the assumption that their writings speak to a particular tradition, one that not every reader is immediately familiar with.So asking if individual sentences can be rephrased to be clearer is sometimes beside the point. Asking if Judith Butler's writings make a contribution to a philosophical tradition dating back to the pre-Socratics is the real question. After all, Plato and Aristotle wrote some texts that were meant to instruct a wider studentship and others that seemed too difficult to the novice scholar. They needed both kinds of writing. So do we."},{"Title":"Just Being Difficult?: Academic Writing in the Public Arena (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Full Disclosure: I bring both insight and bias. You decide.As a literature teacher, I love verbal complexity for pleasure. But as a teacher of writing and \\"shirtsleeves\\" real-world writer myself (feature articles on boating, nature, travel, social issues)--I value clarity and communicability for practicality. Not to be oversimple--just to make important but demanding material accessible to a willing reader.And so here \\"I just don't know...\\" We've heard the criticism that much public academic writing is needlessly obscure, hence inaccessible, due to its jargon, abstraction, complex syntax, and the like. This book seeks to defend difficult academic writing. The authors claim that (1) readers may stubbornly claim not to understand. They also argue that (2) new and different perspectives need new presentations which shake us loose from the old conventional, traditional. They also (3) warn against the dangers of facile oversimplification.(And probably other arguments, some too obscurely-expressed to grasp quickly...)Well, I'd critique the critiquers. As a freelance journalist, I must make sure the reader understands--indeed, cannot possibly misunderstand!--nd is served. George Orwell said \\"good prose is like a window pane.\\" Somerset Maugham, and E. M. Forster, said that the best writers can express ideas of subtlety and complexity quite clearly. Not that each sentence is simplistic. The style may and even should include difficulties. But it does not mislead.I also take a diachronic or historical approach. The postmodern style defended in this book often contains aerial abstractions with cloudy towers with filigree diction decorating them. Will this soon seem the momentary excess of a moment in history? (Created partially in order to create something new and hence gain power, status?) And soon to be rebalanced toward the \\"attainment and restraint\\" of good style?(Less formally, I think that too much postmodern prose is hermetic recondite insular \\"hair oil\\"...The emperor has no clothes-or rather, is overdressed needlessly and inappropriately after all...)I'd like to be convinced by the authors' defenses of linguistic density. But alas, and perhaps also significantly, I see no specific proofs. The book's writers offer no evidence that this difficulty is necessary. We shirtsleeves wordsmiths chant our mantra of \\"statistics, quotes, and anecdotes.\\" We say but then show; we give instances of specific examples to clarify abstract claims or ideas.And so, how I longed to see in this book just one instance of showing how the convoluted style is indeed competent and indeed compulsory. For example (!): take some issue (\\"vegetarianism as egalitarianism,\\" I don't care...) Then (1) state it in clear plain windowpane-prose. Then (2) recast it in the postmodern academese which this book largely defends-I think. Then (3) unpack the latter version to show how it does confront complexities more competently than the prosaic first one. But where's the down-to-earth proof or even the demonstration in this lofty book?Okay, I'll walk my own talk here even if the book didn't. I'll end with an example myself. It's from Judith Butler in her \\"Values of Difficulty\\" in the volume. She's discussing human rights discourse and universality, she reports how AIDS activists in the 1980's sought to enter Spanish-speaking communities to do AIDS outreach. When they asked who was \\"homosexual,\\" few would respond. But when they later returned and asked who practiced anal sex with other men, many more people came forth. Then she sums up her \\"point\\" about all this.I'll give my version (translation?) of her point here first. I'd have said, \\"When communicating with diverse audiences toward persuasion, make sure your cognitive and also emotional language is not simply how you see things, but is in line with how the audience sees things and feels free to respond.\\"But here is Butler's actual version: \\"To engage in activism is not to start with the concept of a shared language but to be prepared to find that communication can sometimes take place only when the terms that initiate a discussion undergo an expropriation that bears no resemblance to the original, where the term abandons the animating conditions of its own efficacy in order to live elsewhere as another term or as a term subjected to a radically unanticipated use.\\"Well...I find her version to be overelaborated ornateness, profitless bloating which almost apotheosizes transmogrified obfuscation. (Or, which almost puts decadent obscurity on a pedestal.) Now, I love dense diction when I write for fun in my own idiolect (a combination of Joycean wordpunplays, pidgin English, earnest illiterate, and pan-European). But when I try to do real-work (sic) writing, I seek glassine clarity the better to illuminate complexity. Sure a camera lens has a tougher job photographing clearly \\"a swamp at sundown\\" than \\"a beach at noon.\\" But a good lens (or language style) can succeed some indeed. A muddy dirty lens (or one distorted with its own interfiliated lenticular elements) can not.Is much postmodern prose the painful attempt not to clarify complexities, but to Gain Points (status, reputation, power) by advancing to something new? Only problem-it's not new, just \\"monstrous and extraordinary,\\" as W. Y. Tindall used to define literary decadence..."},{"Title":"Just Being Difficult?: Academic Writing in the Public Arena (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"This book does the essential task of explaining WHY writing sometimes seems difficult to those who are new to reading it. It does not promote difficulty as a virtue in itself. Rather, in a series of lucid and often eloquent essays, _Just Being Difficult?_, as the question mark in the title implies, questions the assumptions that lie behind the American expectation that all writing in English be immediately digestible by every reader of English everywhere and at all times. It suggests that this idea of a singular \\"reading public\\" is at its core anti-democratic because it's generally marshaled to suppress the free exchange of ideas rather than promote it.The book also addresses why we tend to assume that most of us outside certain specialized fields won't be able to pick up an academic science or medical journal and read it, but that we nonetheless harbor deep suspicions over social sciences or humanities publications that discuss ideas in ways that go beyond the everyday uses of speech.In sum, this publication takes seriously the problem of difficult language and confronts it head-on. As such, it demands a thoughtful reading by those who genuinely want to think about the connection between language and thought."},{"Title":"Sheep's Vigil by a Fervent Person: A Translation of Alberto Caeiro/Fernando Pessoa's O Guardador de Rebanhos","review":"Sheep's Vigil is perhaps the simplest and most amazing of Fernando Pessoa's books.This translation is an amazing piece of poetry on its own, adapting a classic to modern day city life.You will smile, laugh, and sometimes shed a tear. You will not be indifferent to a poet that is maybe one of the greatest living poets of the Americas today."},{"Title":"Alpine elite: German mountain troops of World War II","review":"This book was the first history in English of the mountain troops of the German Army in World War II.The book begins with a brief introduction to the formation of these elite forces, including their special trainning. They were initially drawn from the Alpine and other high mountain regions and Germany and Austria as it was believed that they would have a natural ability to not only fight but live in high mountain territory. When Germany invaded Poland there were three divisions of mountain troops (\\"Gebirgsjaeger\\") in the German Army. As the war progressed, the number of divisions expanded (including the raising of several Waffen-SS mountain divisions) and they were broadly used in all theatres. For example, German mountain troops fought in all three Army Groups (North, Center, and South) in the war against the Soviet Union.Although trained to fight and live in high mountain conditions, due to the vagaries of war and their excellent skills and physical conditioning, these troops were more often than not used in other areas.Because of their wide use and dispersement, a history of all the campaigns they fought in would be beyond the scope of a book this size. The author wisely discusses the battlefield experiences and successes of different groups of these warriors in various campaigns from the beginnings of the war in Poland to the bitter end in Austria, in between are accounts of the fighting in Norway, the Balkans, Crete, Russia, Uman, the Caucasus mountains, and Finland.Altogether, the book is a very good general introduction but the writing at times seems a bit dry, as the author concentrates on the fighting and movement of troops at the battalion and divisional level.Included are brief chapters at the end on the Order of Battle, Weapons, Uniforms, and mini-biographies of major figures."},{"Title":"Alpine elite: German mountain troops of World War II","review":"A former British soldier compiles with loving care information about the German elite Gebirgsjaeger (\\"mountain\\") divisions in WWII. The book is dedicated to his wife, Edeltraude. Lucas spots the main paradox right away. These devout Catholic men from a loving and generous part of Austrian society were giving their very best to preserve a devil, who, if he had won, would have destroyed their entire way of life. He hints at an answer in their value system: their professionalism, pride of organization loyalty to each other, and above all their boyish glee in mountain-climbing and performing the seeming impossible. These are the men who, practically for a lark, planted the nazi flag atop the inaccessible Mt. Elbrus, where there were never any enemies. With regard to their ultimate fate against the Russian army, Lucas shrinks back from story-telling. ...The book includes black-and-white photos."},{"Title":"Alpine elite: German mountain troops of World War II","review":"Gebirgsjaeger in ActionThis is the first book to provide substantial detailing of German Army and SS Mountain forces in World War Two, including order of battle, profiles on principals, and accounts of operations. Also the book covers material on uniforms, weapons, special equipment, and tactics. However, the book covers relatively little on counter-guerrilla and/or anti-partisan activities. The main focus and emphasis is on operations in Poland, Norway, the Balkans campaign, Crete, the Caucasus, and Finland. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."},{"Title":"Amiga Rom Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs (Amiga Technical Reference Series)","review":"Quite simply, the ROM Kernal Manual (RKM) is a must-have item.

Then you cannot understand or be understood. This book gives you insight of a theoretical nature you can also put to work in practical terms.It is very thorough.

There is no sample from Nigerian English, for instance. It would also been interesting to have samples from some non-native speakers from Europe or Asia.Also, the speakers only repeat the sample text. While this enables one to distinguish features of the variety in question quite clearly, it also tends to become quite dull. Additionally to the sample-text some other speech samples (like jokes, for instance) would lighten things up a bit."},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Cinderella: Shall We Dance?

Eyewitness accounts are dramatically read, separated with brief introductions and accompanied by sound effects and a little music.The events leading to Gettysburg are clearly explained in this way. Once the battle narratives strart, audio has its limitations. I missed having maps and diagrams to clarify the chain of events. Still, the stories were vivid and often exciting. I recommend this tape for those who are already familiar with the action at Gettysburg or to listen to alongside a book that diagrams the various parts of the battle."},{"Title":"Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions","review":"Contrary to the other \\"reviewer\\", this is a classic reprinted annually with the originals worth as much as a nice flat screen for a reason. The book has always stirred controversy because it doesn't kow tow to the \\"correct view\\" of those who want to believe that everything before Christianity was barbarism. At the time it was originally published in 1894, this book was literally revolutionary. Keep in mind, the belief of the time was that the Irish were less than human and this book showed that they had been civilized with laws, music, history, and science long before the forced conversion which included the murdering of almost all of the Druid priests. Check out Wikipedia and other sources for more information on James Bonwick (who was very much a religous Christian btw) and the Druids. And, read it for yourself - it is an easy read if you relax about things like the Scottish being called the Scotch and just go with the flow of the book."},{"Title":"Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions","review":"I was excited to find that this book was available after having found a reference to it elsewhere. But the book itself is a disappointment. I expected an orderly review of the origins, development, and practice of Druidism and its contemporary religions, along with specifics on their beliefs, rituals, paraphernalia, etc. Instead, this book is disorganized and rambling, with little specific information on Druidism and no attempt to develop any specific portrayals of this interesting magico-religious movement."},{"Title":"Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions","review":"Blarney, utter Blarney. This is historical fiction. I teach Irish history and ancient religion, and this is nonsense."},{"Title":"Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions","review":"After having read this book, I have to say that I wasn't terribly impressed--nor was I seriously let down. There are plenty of great pieces of hard to find information about Irish Druids--I mean, lets face it. These days you have to really look hard to find your way out of all the wishy-washy fairy-tales concerning Druids and Celtic religion--especially on the internet, where almost everyone seems to be in costume. I also appriciated the mention of other Celtic tribes throughout Europe.What I didn't care for was the repeated and tiresome disdain towards the \\"so-called Druids\\" of Britain. When I'm reading for information/enlightenment, it's difficult to feel that I'm getting it from a credible source when the author's writing seems so biased and disdainful towards the non-Irish Druids. Yes, I know that the book is written with Ireland in mind, but the author just seemed to keep making digs at the other country while elevating Irish Druids over the rest. Kind of annoying, but not terrible."},{"Title":"Watergate Investigation Index: House Judiciary Committee Hearings and Report on Impeachment","review":"This report was detailed but not for the average reader.

The author went too fast and did not describe the principles of the parts of speach in depth enough. He even used grammar principles that he hadn't described yet to describe the current principle of that section. In fact, he even admits a few times throughout the book how hard it is too follow. Another problem lies within the ways he tries to explain the principles; they're too abstract for any person to make a difinitive conclusion on weather that is the part of speach they're looking for or not.

Mr. Good starts on the ground floor, so that no previous knowledge of grammar is needed. At the same time, however, he does not talk down to the reader, nor does he shy away from many aspects of grammar that other books deem too complex for beginners. Everything is explained here with perfect clarity, and nothing important is left out. Moreover, beyond Mr. Good's superlative explanations of grammar, this book earns 10 stars because Mr. Good shows us how our knowledge of grammar can improve our writing. He does this not with airy praise of grammatical education, but with concrete examples and advice that you can start using to improve your writing immediately. This book is not short, and it's not full of jokes and cartoons. But, if you really want to learn grammar and to write and speak better, buy this book now and read it from cover to cover. I can't think of any better way to spend your money and time."},{"Title":"A Grammar Book for You and I (Oops, Me): All the Grammar You Need to Succeed in Life (Capital Ideas)","review":"For many years I have been searching for a well written and well structured book of English grammar but only in vain. I have analyzed a great number of grammar books but none of them had met my expectations. Until now! Good's book is not only well written, it is also simple, lucid and comprehensive. Throughout the entire book, the author gives valuable and helpful advice to the reader as to how to avoid common grammatical errors. Each section is carefully and pedagogically structured to facilitate understanding of the key concepts of english grammar. As is well known, pronouns can cause difficulties to unexperienced users of english grammar. However, Good provides a clear and simple explanation which will eliminate all doubts and answer all questions pertaining to cases of pronouns. Furthermore, some people are not sure when to employ adjectives versus adverbs but Good reveals simple rules and guidelines that will help clarify this aspect of grammar. In addition, this book will also help you identify as well as differentiate between highly important elements of the english grammar such as transitive versus intransitive verbs, direct vs indirect objects and independent vs subordinate clauses. The final section of the book highlights common pitfalls and serious grammatical blunders. Subsequently, you will not only learn how to avoid serious grammatical errors, you will also learn how to rectify them. Needless to say, effective communication relies heavily on adequate and sufficient grammatical skills. This book will provide you with necessary skills that will optimize your communicative competence. In addition to this book, I highly recommend a book called Word Smart by Princeton Review. This book will enhance and enlarge your vocabulary in a way you never thought possible. To my mind, the above mentioned books are the only books you need to communicate effectively in english language. I would like to stress though that mastering english grammar will require an additional book, which is titled Analyzing English Grammar. This is truly an excellent book. In conclusion, Edward Good's book is invaluable. No other book on the market is nearly as good as this one. I strongly recommend this book to all people who want to improve their grammatical skills."},{"Title":"A Grammar Book for You and I (Oops, Me): All the Grammar You Need to Succeed in Life (Capital Ideas)","review":"This book is amusing, it is witty, and it is just plain good. I consider myself lucky to have come across this treasure of a book and would like to thank Mr. Good for writing it.As a professional engineer who speaks English as a second language, I have been searching for a grammar book I can use to improve my grammar proficiency. Over the years, I bought many grammar books that quickly started collecting dust. First of all, grammar is a dry subject, and one is quickly tempted to give up. Second, most books do not seem to address the needs of those who speak and write English as a second language.Well, this one is different on both accounts. In less than a month since I started reading &quot;Oops Me,&quot; I have covered more material than I had in years with other books. And the best part is that I am enjoying the learning.

With clear prose that itself exemplifies what he teaches, Mr. Good succeeds in the Herculean task of explaining English grammar. Beginning with a chapter each for the eight parts of speech, Good then makes four suggestions for writers: use fewer nouns and more verbs, rely less on the verb \\"to be,\\" favor the active voice over the passive, and use phrases more than clauses. If you're like me, and you don't even remember what a clause is (a clause contains a conjugated verb; a phrase does not), you'll like Mr. Good for adding a little humor: some of our language's baffling rules are attributed to cave-dwelling ancestors Amber and Igor, with whom Good has made his grade-school grammar teacher, Miss Hamrick, contemporary. Good then teaches you to make your basic well-cast sentences come alive by using subordination, parallel construction, and noun substitution (instead of nouns, using prepositional, adjectival, adverbial, verbal and other phrases). Finally, the book presents thirteen brief chapters each addressing a common grammatical pitfall, such as \\"who\\" versus \\"whom\\", and finishes with eleven chapters covering the eleven English punctuation marks. Whether you write for a living or for fun, or just want to understand the language, your ability to write, to communicate, and to think will be greatly helped by this worthy book."},{"Title":"A Grammar Book for You and I (Oops, Me): All the Grammar You Need to Succeed in Life (Capital Ideas)","review":"\\"Oops, Me!\\" is exactly the sort of grammar book that I have been wishing for.

The four sections I tested produced an average Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score of 7.1 and a Reading Ease score of 67.2.

American English grammar, at times, seems to be more a collection of 'rules of thumbs', rather than a coherent set of readily-understood principles; Mr. Good does a fine job of bringing some order to the chaos. Particularly clear and crisp are his handling of punctuation (Part five) and common grammatical mistakes (Part four). He also provides an excellent discussion of the &quot;fused participle&quot; bogeyman.Regrettably, this book-- like most in its genre-- is overly prescriptive, emphasizing 'rules' and convoluted terminology. Do we need to know the difference between a prepositional phrase and a past participial phrase, as long as we know how to use each correctly? Mr. Good seems to believe that you should.If your written and spoken grammar and usage are adequate (or better), you'd be better off reading a descriptive resource on grammar and usage.

The few examples in the book are mostly artificial and very limited in their scope. i'm not sure people dealing with data have an interest at reading this book, it's more about neurofuzzy techniques than data modelling.The book edited by Schwefel, Weneger and Weinert entitled &quot;Advances in computational intelligence&quot; published by Springer emphasizes a lot more on fuzzy techniques based on real data although it does not discuss the &quot;neuro&quot; part of &quot;neuro-fuzzy&quot; techniques.Still this book is not bad from a theoretical neuro-fuzzy perspective, but since these techniques are aimed at dealing with real data, i would have hoped a much better treatment of the practical aspects, which it fails to provide."},{"Title":"Further Five-Minute Mysteries","review":"I have used other mystery books in the past, but this one is my favorite for working with senior citizens."},{"Title":"Further Five-Minute Mysteries","review":"You can't go wrong with this series.

They are REMARKABLY similar. While both books are good, Disclosure was written first and is simply the better of the two. Its practically the same plot, same characters, in the same type of situation, working at a different company. The facts about airplanes I found to be interesting, and it was exciting at times, but the ending wasn't as hard hitting or exciting as \\"Disclosure\\" and I was slightly disappointed.Basically you have this high ranking executive who loves their kids, their company has a terrible problem with their product, and the main character works with their co-workers, the engineers and such, to figure out the problem. In the end, they find the company is out to screw them over, and they get right back at them in the end with a revealing meeting. Its really, very largely the same book under a different cover. I'm a little surprised and disappointed because I was actually able to predict some things that would happen based on what I'd read previously. My advice: Go with disclosure first, and maybe read this one after you've read several of his others so it might seem more fresh to you."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Some have expressed dissatisfaction with the ending. I thought it was perfect. I won't give anything away. I'll just say that if you understand the overall point Crichton is making, you'll like the end. If you miss the point (as I think many have) then you'll say, \\"That's it? That's the explanation for the accident?\\" Yep. That's it. And it's brilliant! Beyond that, the end also gives a comeuppance to each of the antagonists. Even the young, arrogant female producer for \\"Newsline\\" gets her just deserts in a particularly funny bit involving vomit. I thought everything ended on a high note. The perfect ending to a fascinating book that shines a LOT of light on the airlines, airplane manufacturers and, most interestingly, the media. I may not always agree with Crichton but I COMPLETELY agree with his views on the media. One rant in particular (by a character in the last chapter) about turning off the TV was especially good. This book was a winner. It's not for people who like long descriptions of sunsets or emotions... But for those who want a fast, interesting read where all characters get what they deserve in the end, then this easily satisfies."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was recommended to me by a friend, and this friend suggested I wait to read it until I was in the airport awaiting my flight. Since I am moderately afraid of flying, I thought that reading an airplane-disaster novel as I was starting a flight would be a bad idea, but did so anyway. As I turned that pages, however, I found myself less and less worried about the flight, as I was reading not a airline horror story, but a technical thriller about aircraft(frame) design, corporate and union politics, and the state of investigative reporting, ala 1996.Not much has seemingly changed in the latter two topics over the last 15 years, as television news continues to deliver bit or bite-sized glances at stories that have the best visual aids, and unions continue to clash with private businesses over concerns of job fairness and availability. However, I was very surprised to learn about the detail that Crichton was delivering on the airplanes themselves, and of the safety procedures that kept the designs in check. I left the book feeling much more confident about my flight than I started.Crichton delivers all of the detail necessary to convey the importance of every small, relevant part on the aircraft, and does so without leaving the reader behind. I never had to worry about new acronyms or terms, as Crichton would blessedly explain them to me in short order. This readiness to make clear the technical, along with the fast pace and short chapters made Airframe a quick read. At the end, I felt both smarter and safer about the concept of shooting through the air in a metal frame (at least in the US), and experienced an excellent thriller about the search for truth that follows a disastrous airline incident. Recommended."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I doubt anyone who enjoys a good fiction would have liked to open an airplane training manual to learn some of the stuff I ended up learning from this book. Some of the poor reviews criticized this book for stuffing too much information into the book. However, always keep in mind that the books that benefit us are the ones most educational. This is why we outgrow Little Red Riding Hood. For Crichton to pack so much knowledge and information into the book, most of which I ended up learning and appreciating (I read most of this book through a flight), but never boring me since carrying all this information is a gripping story and gripping characters whose decision making skills can also teach us a lesson or two. As a fiction, it lacks certain suspense and pace, costing it a star. But the amount of learning you walk away with from this book, is much much higher than some 5-star fictions ther are."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A pretty good book. It was interesting to me since I have worked in Quality Assurance. Michael Crichton seems to have done his research pretty well, except for one thing. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Export Control regulations would really allow transfer of wing technology to a foreign country. Other than that, there were some interesting insights into the effect of the media on a company's product, and all that can be done on both sides to affect the outcome of a news report. Some of the tension seems to have been over-manufactured - like being pursued in the dark in a nearly empty hanger - and seem unrealistic to me.

Now, I'm already planning on passing AIRFRAME on to another co-worker when I go back to work next week.I can attest to the authenticity of Chrichton's coverage of the inner workings of the \\"Norton\\" plant in Burbank, (one of the actual Lockheed commercial aircraft plants was still located in Burbank around this time, and I myself had worked at a medium-sized Lockheed plant 40 miles to the east in Ontario)."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"...I overpaid!I usually enjoy Michael Crichton books. This was not one of them. Lots of rambling and technical jargon with plodding, forced and uninteresting corporate suspense worked in. Crichton clearly did alot of research about airplanes and aeronautics; unfortunately, he shares all it with the reader and most of it is boring. The book reads like a movie script. I'm guessing Hollywood was smart enough to realize no one was interested. Read Crichton, but skip this one."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A charter is going from Hong Kong to Denver. Suddenly there is a problem, the plane dives and passengers are discomforted. TPA 545 makes an emergency landing in Los Angeles for medical care. Many foreign charter carriers did not match the rigorous safety standards of domestic scheduled carriers. The FAA investigates these \\"incidents\\".Casey Singleton, a single mom, works in Quality Assurance for Norton Aircraft. QA dealt in problems in customer support. Casey has a new assistant who has to be educated and gently handled. Casey explains the very high standards needed for aircraft (\\"Bldg 64 6:45 am\\"). The \\"War Room 7:01 am\\" chapter shows how problems are investigated. There is a big order that will save the company, but only if this problem can be explained by next week! The problem appears to be \\"severe pitch oscillations\\" which could be caused by \\"uncommanded slats deployment\\". The expert says it could not be pilot error because that pilot was superb; it had to be a mechanical problem (\\"Bldg 202/FSIM 7:59 am\\"). [Is this a clue?] Inspection reveals a non-standard part that could have caused the malfunction (\\"Hangar 5 9:40 am\\"). Is the rumor about the wing offset just a projection of fears? Why do the media censor information about \\"Cheapskate Airlines\\", a stock scam similar to the then current \\"high-tech\\" stocks? Do reporters write with a presumption of guilt to make their subjects look silly or foolish? Has deregulation resulted in using aircraft beyond their expected life (\\"Proof Test 10:19 am\\")? It takes regulations to provide safety, not a \\"free market\\". Every part on an aircraft has a paper history for documentation. Casey finds the repair record (\\"Norton QA 12:30 pm\\"), and the seemingly correct paper.The \\"Newsline/New York 1:54 pm\\" chapter explains the working of television news stories. More counterfeit parts are found (which don't meet the high standards required). The \\"Outside Norton 11:10 am\\" chapter explains how news stories are created for sensationalism. Note the funding source for the \\"Institute for Aviation Research\\". See the reporter asking questions to cause an emotional reaction. The video camera recorded a sound like the slats deploying. Television news is not required to present the other side of an issue. The \\"Norton QA 11:50 am\\" chapter explains the trick used in interviews to get a reaction. The hidden agenda comes out (\\"Bldg 64 3:01 pm\\"). How difficult is it to film a test flight (\\"War Room 4:20 pm\\")? On Saturday morning the plane is taken up for a test flight, with two passengers. The flight recreates the incident successfully to rule out any \\"design flaw\\". Then the mystery is solved. The Aircraft Incident Report is written in language that means little to the general public. The last chapter contains the news reports that end this story. These items conceal more than they reveal. The phrase \\"deep integrity\\" suggests a well-hidden quality. This novel is educational in telling about the tricks played by any award-winning news program.Michael Crichton has placed this fast-paced story in a manufacturing factory and created an interesting and entertaining story that informs the general public about events behind the news. The High-Tech stock scams have crashed to earth, outsourcing of jobs continues, oppressive taxes on wage earners has resulted in a zero savings rate. Could it get worse? Only with a pandemic."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"With experience in the aircraft industry, I found this book to be right on the money - Michael Crichton's research provides great believability to his characters and story. Always on edge, I found this book very entertaining."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Try putting this one down!! With all the goings-on in today's airplane industry, this timely and timeless book captures the essence of big business and the desire for coverup. But is that it? Another airplane disaster under mysterious circumstances - but this one just doesn't smell right. Reporters, management, blue and white collar workers.... our heroine must get to bottom of this - for everyone involved, including her own safety. Who is right about this one? Outstanding writing!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I would define Crichton as a cerebral author. All his books are written as though he is an expert in whatever subject matter the story revolves around: DNA and cloning in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, deep sea salvage operations and time travel in &quot;Sphere&quot;, the intricacies of an 1800's criminal mind in &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, and now flight dynamics and airplane construction in &quot;Airframe&quot;. True to Crichton's style, &quot;Airframe&quot; starts off running with a catastrophic airplane accident happening within the first few pages, and he leaves the reader guessing until the last page--literally.The story is a successful mix of well developed characters, suspenseful intrigue and mystery, and enough detail to allow you to understand the complexties of airframe manufracturing without overwhelming you with too much detail. I will not summarize the plot since the book is too much fun to start reading it with prior plot details. Just make sure you don't mind neglecting the rest of your life because once you pick up this book, you won't want to put it down.I lopped off one star because the middle of the story wandered around a bit with one of the side stories focusing on a Union protest and teamster-type threats directed at the protagonist that was supposed to add an element of danger that wasn't really needed. Other than that one minor misstep, this tale is expertly written with all the Crichton-detail that make his books so enjoyable and (gasp) educational! You will not be disappointed with this one.(On a personal note, I particularly enjoyed the way he accurately portrayed TV journalists. Having worked in the TV news field for five years, I can assure you that his depiction is right on the money.)"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I've read 7 other Crichton books and loved them, this misses the mark big time.I've always enjoyed the way Crichton teaches the science behind his chosen topic. He's always been able to write it in as an interesting part of the story. This time it was so predictable and dry - every time something technical is explained it's to begrudgingly train the new guy...boring."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I just finished reading Michael Crichton's \`Airframe', and found it a little above average. I have never read any of Crichton's books, but I had read a lot of rave reviews on this works such as \`Jurassic Park', \`Congo' and \`Andromeda Strain', a decided I would give the author a try by reading this book as my first.The story starts off with TransPacific Airlines 545, a commercial airplane, which undergoes some catastrophe in the air, leaving 3 people dead and around 50 people badly injured. It is now up to Casey Singleton to find out the consequences that led to the disaster. However, while she and her research crew start working on the flight, Casey discovers other events that are happening in the background of company, and realizes that someone does not want her to succeed in her mission on the TPA 545. Meanwhile, a news agency starts writing a story on the flight, their main aim to bring down the company, adding to Casey's problems. Will she be able to solve the mystery of the flight and save the company from closing down?While the story starts off fast paced and exciting, it slows down towards the middle, building up again towards the end and resulting in an anticlimax, leaving the reader a little disappointed. What made me give this book a 4-star rating was mainly due to the explicit information that Crichton provides about the Aircrafts and their manufacturing industries. It is obvious that Crichton has done a thorough research on the background and the workings of an aircraft, and for this reason I gave this book as 4 star rating. Now I have a better understanding of how the flight works, and have learnt some technical terms and their functions as well.This book has its moments, and provides a lot of information, but I wouldn't put it as a very suspenseful thriller."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is the first and last time I read a book from Crichton. The story is weak since the beginning. Everything is predictable. An example? a) The American woman sees the pilot leaving the cockpit, b) the crew leaves the airport in a hurry, like fleeing the scene, c) The airplane shows no defect, d)The flight instructor swears that it can't be human error because Chang is the best pilot he's ever seen... it's so hard to figure it out? If you need to go from page 10 (the incident) to page 340 (when Casey finally figures it all out) to get a clue, this book is for you. Otherwise, try something else. The characters are weak and artificial and since Crichton wants to show his famous research skills, every character is unnatural, they don't speak, they lecture. Good people are really good, shy and well-intentioned. Bad people are mean, greedy and false. Chinese are detailist, Korean are hardworking, the test piot had to be a bold Texan, of course, the engineer lives for his plane, journalists are hollow, etc. etc. He only forgot a couple of corrupt politicians to complete the plot! My recommendation? Stay away! This airframe will take you straight to boredom!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"My last two reads from Crichton were Timeline and Prey and I liked them a lot so I was very excited to see what this one was about. From the cover alone I deduced that it had something to do with planes, and as much as I don't like them I have to use them from time to time ( I had a close call twice on the same day same plane, yeah..) but it didn't diminish the enjoyment of what this brought, there was nothing supernatural this time, it was pure brain and iron power with a little mystery on top. This reminded me of Raising Sun which Crichton also wrote, I saw the movie but I'm definitely going to read the book, and this has a similar feel with the figuring out what happened, and things happen right away, chapter one is like a comet and it's coming straight down.Planes are basically metal birds but with a larger percentage for error, any little part can be faked, even though they are photographed and cataloged a little fake in between can mean a catastrophe, the pilot's range and skill and age also matter so when things go very badly in the story which luckily didn't have a crash but still had casualties and injuries galore there are questions in the end that need answers, Crichton wrote it so you can bet it's going to be deeper than meets the eye. Airframe is an intelligent thriller that will teach you a thing or two about a whole profession that many people don't know much about.There is no gore, no blood no icky stuff, just some questions that need answers as reputation and money are at stake. Casey Singleton, v-p for quality assurance for Norton Aircraft is in charge of finding out what happened to the company's plane. Her boss is breathing down her neck to find the solution for a problem no one seems to know how to solve as they are about to make a huge deal with China that will save their company, bad publicity will mean that their time is going to be limited in the money making department and the company's future is in question. The plane that went down killing four and injuring fifty six was designed in the Norton Plant, started by aviation pioneer Charles Norton in the thirties during WWII as it made the legendary B-22 bomber, the P-27, the Skycat fighter and the C-12 Transport for the Air Force, so this is not some baby company but a giant with a history that is trying to stay afloat as their reputation is going through the ringer. Casey is a sympathetic character and her adventures made me grip the pages tightly, the closer she gets to the answer the stranger her life seems to get, danger is breathing down her back as she dissects the case coming to a very interesting conclusion and a very cool plane scene towards the end.I loved how the plane factory was a small city with thirty thousand workers covering sixteen square miles, the principal assembly buildings greeted Casey warmly upon arrival to her new position at the plant, it was a nice way to introduce her by giving her a new job and refreshing the reader of her past while keeping the story flowing. It was fun figuring the mystery of the N-22 and how it was built while Casey risked her life, the answer was surprising but a lot of good searching went into it that beefed up the story. In the end I was happy but sad at the same time since Crichton is not around anymore, I can't even imagine what other stories he would have made if he had enough time. This was a great read and I adored it, full of intrigue, suspense and a mystery to solve, good stuff.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton and Airframe did not disappoint. There is intrigue involving a mysterious aircraft accident and industrial espionage both from inside and outside the aircraft company. Crichton gives a masterful look at the aviation industry and an insightful glimpse behind the scenes of today's media as well.I held my breath as his main character, Casey Singleton, weaved her way around the media, her boss and angry union employees in order to solve the aircraft accident and possibly save her job and the company.This is not of the same quality as his once in a lifetime hit Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park). However, it did offer a great page-turning, want-to-finish summer read that I really enjoyed.Sam Hendricks, author of Fantasy Football Tips and Fantasy Football Basics"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is one of my least favorite Michael Crichton novels. The story wasn't bad, just technical in a way that was less entertaining and interesting than most of his other novels. The mechanics of airplane design and engineering was informative but very much too confusing to follow.

This book involves less scientific research, no secret organizations, and no heroic character. However this book does have some qualities that the other books don't: a very quick read, wit,and a more realistic day-to-day setting.The story revolves around the VP of an airplane manufacturer. This person is in charge of the QA (quality assistence). Her job is to make sure that all problems with the airplane are properly fixed and prevented in further cases. When a TransPacific flight flying from Hong Kong to Denver loses control over the Pacific Ocean leaving 3 dead, Casey Singleton (the VP)must find the solution. To make matters worse.

As an aerospace engineer, the only reason I finished the book was to see how inaccurate a book could be. The concept of flight testing an aircraft after it has exceeded design allowables is inane.

I skimmed past most of the jargon, since it had barely anything to do with the plot. Every once in a while I'd stop and tell my wife, &quot;This is a dumb book. It's boring and slow.&quot; And she'd say, &quot;So stop reading it.&quot; And I'd reply, &quot;Nah, I have to find out what happens.&quot; And perhaps that summarizes Crichton's skill, to be able to write engaging mediocrity. A stellar example of pop fiction--brain candy, an okay distraction from real life, better than a made-for-TV-movie but instantly forgettable."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Unfortunately for me I read this book shortly after I read Cold Mountain - kind of like following up Filet Mignon with a big bowl of Apple Jacks. I suppose there are those who prefer Apple Jacks though...The character development is exceptionally weak. None of the characters were interesting, all were predictable and cliche. The ploy of the 'assistant' who needs all of the details explained to him is especially sophmoric. This book is a good mindless read, nothing more. A few interesting details on the inner workings of aircraft, delivered with a pretty awkward touch."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The master of genre has most definitely come up with his next movie script and not a thriller to his normally exceptional standards.While the book provides a deep insight on the Aerospace industry and how it deals and is dealt with by its customers and its regulator/promoter (FAA), the plot is not complex and characters are very shallow. Very predictable, and very unlike Crichton's past works.Airframe revolves around the N-22 built by Norton Aircraft. The parallel between the DC-10 and McDonell Douglas are clear to see, even the new generation aircraft from Norton is the N-XX (MD's DC-XX).The plot comences with an N-22 having a mishap over the Pacific ocean. Faced with an imminent sale to China, Vice President Katherine &quot;Casey&quot; Singleton is responsible for &quot;solving&quot; the &quot;incident&quot; within an unheard of, 7 days.Add to plot the usual corporate power tussles and subterfuge in the upper echelon, and serious union problems. Also add in, a TV news show, whose producer hates everything American and wants to use the N-22 incident to trash American products, and of course Norton along with it.Casey is in an uneviable position.The final outcome is quite expected.The bright point of this novel is its revelations into the conflicts faced within the highly competitive Airline industry. The FAA is not only the Regulator of Civil Aviation, but also its promoter. An aircraft builder, when faced with an accident, cannot blame the Airline when it is indeed the fault of the Airline, since they are the customer.These insights are indeed the best feature of the book and will be a good read for the &quot;techno thriller&quot; buff"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"\\"Airframe\\" is meant to be a topical story about the business of building airplanes - full of details and praised for being \\"ripped from the headlines\\" and \\"plausibly detailed\\" - but we should know better. Topical stories typically cut-and-paste news stories and rely on publicity from actual events to boost sales, filling in the blanks with convenient fiction. The result isn't as realistic as \\"apparently realistic\\" - plausible enough to convince readers that the author's slim understanding of aviation will back up the slim plot.\\"Airframe\\" centers on a fictitious airliner - the Norton N-22, a technological marvel. Popular opinion shifts when an N-22 encounters severe turbulence - killing three and injuring scores more. The media, unlike their real-life counterparts - blame Norton rather than the airline. (Remember the hype over low-cost outfits like \\"ValueJet\\" and bloated dinosaurs like Pan-Am and TWA, and remember all of those \\"US-scare\\" jokes?) Ambitious reporters, \\"bottom-feeding\\" lawyers and other unethical, uninformed and non-credentialed \\"experts\\" descend on Norton.Admittedly, at this point that \\"Airframe\\" could still have been a great novel with which to explore issues like products liability, airlines and the media, but the plot is built on two large elements that make \\"Airframe\\" an unnecessarily bad read. First off, \\"Airframe\\" makes no secret of its sympathies, and wastes no time establishing who the bad guys are - lawyers, bad; college boys with imported cars, bad; the media - bad; rich people, bad; engineers at Norton - good.Secondly, despite becoming a polemic in defense of the aviation industry, \\"Airframe\\" unconvincingly sexes up the story with corporate intrigue and an internal sabotage of the N-22's future. Worse, true to form, Crichton makes both the media and the conspiracy responsible for Norton's ills, never deciding which is actually responsible. (Crichton normally mixes the mundane - hypocritical political correctness, feminism, environmentalism, foreign control of domestic businesses, genetic engineering, etc - to drive his plots, and then combines them with a sinister conspiracy to accomplish the same end. In other words, if evil corporate types are really guilty, then it's kind of unfair to saddle the media or lawyers for the same result - sort of like having your pie and throwing it too.)Despite a novel looking into the dynamics of commercial aviation, and despite Crichton's reputation for books that are meticulously researched, \\"Airframe\\" doesn't even seem all that realistic. \\"Airframe\\" is meant to pit the informed scientists of the aviation industry against the ignorant profiteers of the litigation industry and the media, but there are no visible characters who are pilots or engineers. \\"Airframe\\" begins with a quote by a veteran journalist who warns against giving respectability to the uninformed, which does less to make Crichton's points than seize the moral high-ground of debate. Certainly \\"Airframe\\"'s details don't betray any more knowledge of aviation than any other layman who subscribes to \\"Aviation Week\\".Also, Crichton's characters repeatedly compare their case to that of the DC-10 (which suffered a string of accidents and bad press in the 1970's) as an example of evil media. For Crichton, the DC-10 fits the N-22 - the media hounded the DC-10, and McDonnel never sold another one. (I lived near an airport until '98 and routinely saw DC-10's in flight until they were phased out recently - nearly two decades after their \\"grounding\\" and about the same time as its competitor, the L-1011, a plane the DC-10 outsold. I even flew a DC-10 on a major airline in 1994 - I can't remember when I last flew a Tri-Star. DC-10's more likely suffered - if at all - from airline deregulation, which boosted demand for small planes like the 737, now one of the most popular airliners. Crichton never mentions that MacDonnell managed continue selling other planes and even try their hand at the MD-11, a development of the branded DC-10.)Like a poorly designed aircraft, \\"Airframe\\" never gets off the ground - Crichton quickly lets you know that he's less interested in aviation than the media. This is not Craig Thomas' \\"A Different War\\", where the hero redeems the suspected airliner by flying it. The flight in one simple chapter of that book easily beats Crichton. Crichton's holds airliners in a perspective no different from that of the dim laymen he populates his books with - as vehicles. Alas again that the plot heaps scorn on the media even though corporate espionage has more to do with Norton's problems. Despite often using \\"corporate\\" as synonymous with \\"sinister\\", \\"Airframe\\" is at best a flaccid indictment against corporations, let alone the media.Knowing he lacks enough plot to remind readers (and perhaps himself) that \\"Airframe\\" is about something exotic and beyond his grasp, Crichton falls back on his usual suspects - corporate intrigue, but his corporate villains are especially weak. When the plucky heroine, a Norton exec, wants to clear the N-22, she's saddled with an unwanted intern (and likely spy) named Bob Richman. It's clear that Richman is dead-meat from page-first: if blue-chip upbringing, top-flight education, and high-priced (and foreign!) car aren't enough warning, his youth makes Richman enemy number-one (not that he does anything apparently evil, but Crichton's villains are seldom evil, just unlikable). At first, I expected a surprise - make a hero out of the sleazy ivy-leaguer and confound readers primed for the Richman's fall. Instead, \\"Airframe\\" remains boldly unsurprising (the brat's name is the perfect example - I guess \\"Richboy\\" would have been too obvious), and there isn't a thrill to be had. Throw in a \\"twist\\" ending that's blatantly lifted from a true incident that Crichton would never have known about had the media failed to responsibly report it, and you've got a book that deserves to be grounded - for good. If you've got to read Crichton, read the first Jurassic, the Andromeda Strain or Sphere. If you've got to read about flying, pick up Coonts or Craig Thomas."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"hello there im a high schooler and a popular guy and dont read very much but i read this for our manditory reading and i have to say for a book this is pretty freaking sweet"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is a very realistic novel by Michael Crichton, which shows the real way that the plane industry works. This novel gives you and inside look at the ways that planes are made, how investigations are conducted, and how much the media complicates things. The only real main character in the book in Casey Singleton, a single mom that has just been premoted to the Vice-President position of the Incident Review Team, IRT, at Norton. She is a very plausible character, much like all of the characters in this book. She represents the good in people; the will to do whatever it takes to bring peace to chaos, which she demonstrated many times during the novel. The evil in the book is represented mostly by the media, who is always trying to get their story no matter how many people get hurt by there selfish actions. Evil is also present in Casey's boss, John Marder. He becomes greedy with his rise to success, and ends up putting Norton in danger.You first learn of two incidents concerning the Norton N-22, their wide body plane. On both of the planes all of the evidence, the little that there is, points toward an un-commanded slats deployment. Such a mistake would cause the plane to fell a little turbulence, but then before any real damage could happen the autopilot would take over. The problem is that one of the flights, Trans Pacific flight 545, had four deaths and over fifty injuries. After a few days of investigation, Casey and her crew conclude that the slats did in fact deploy, but they are not sure the reason. Casey cannot really understand what happened until the data recorder is found. While doing a search of the plane itself she finds what she is looking for. With the help of the data box and a home video found in the plane, she discovers the reason of the accident. What the team finds shocks everyone. Casey and the rest of the IRT recreate the first flight, to show exactly how the planes problems began. After the test the give a press release and relate to the press the real reason to the flights problems and who will blamed."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I just can't say that Michael Crichton hasn't the Gift to write. Yes, he does. The problem is that he's too much worried about research. I'm not saying that an author who's writing about a subject he/she doesn't dominate shouldn't research about it. But Michael Crichton is so worried about it that his books sometimes seem to be written only to those people who understand about it. And instead of a good entertainment, we have in our hands an instructions guide. That's exactly what happens to AIRFRAME. The plot is filled with information about those biggest airplanes and their structure and the whole thing. Boring. Boring. Boring."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Where is the thrill that MC used to turn out? Not only is this book thoroughly dull, it's terribly written. Don't waste valuable hours of your life on this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"In &quot;Airframe&quot;, Michael Crichton did an unbelievable work. I mean, nobody that has ever read his previous books can believe this one comes from the same mind of &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Jurasic park&quot;. By the way, his new books are so passable that his old ones are gettin the public and midia's attention. &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Eaters of the dead&quot; are being or have already been taken into movies. After great &quot;Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;Jurasic...&quot;, Crichton couldn't keep the pace. &quot;Lost world&quot; is very numbing and &quot;Airframe&quot; is tottaly waste of time and patience. The main plot of the book is, however, good: what could have happened to TransPacific flight, leaving several people injured and some dead? Crichton carries de reader through the hangars of a frame-making company on the edge of bankruptcy, which must solve the mistery quickly so not to loose a big deal that could make money flow on the registers again. There're so many characters in the plot that even the main one is took aside. Another problem are the infinite number of CCAs, WWCFs and FDAs that take away the good mood from everyone. And when the whole mistery is solved, the accident's motive is so imbecil that you want to throw the book in the fire and watch if it burns. The writing is boring. The will to leave the book alone is huge, but the reader keeps it in his hands, remembering the money invested in the book and thinking that afterall this is a Crichton book, there must be some kind of surprise at the end. Believe this reviewer, there isn't."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Simply put, if you are a Michael Crichton fan you will enjoy this book. Typical Crichton style up to the very end. Awesome!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is not one of Crichton's best works partly because it seems to be based on an airliner crash where a similar event occurred. Crichton skillfully mixes in other intrigue, but if you make this connection you'll be dissapointed in his creativity compared to his other excellent work."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It kept me in suspense until the very end. Michael Crichton is an excellant writer"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was basically a good book. I wonder about the tecnical accuracy, since Michael Crichton is a doctor (isn't he?) and not an engineer. Anyway, it was an enterntaining fast read. I thought the Richman character was a clever way to expain the technical stuff--how else would you do it? The most interesting part for me is that the aircraft manufacturer was in a catch-22 with the airlines. They were the customer and the customer is always right, but you don't want to take the blame either, right? The other interesting part was the power struggle, which was similar to disclosure. I didn't like the clues though (disclosure did it better) and the solution to the problem was easily guessed. The second part of the book delved into the news media, which was right-on. The media don't seem to care about the real story, just as long as it's a shocking story. I read Sphere, and I found it boring, but it had better character development than this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is a trite mystery written by a bad mystery writer. Facts emerge that the reader never knows about, and in the end the conclusion to the mystery is absurd! Flat characters, unexplained events, and sterotypes make this a poor work of fiction. Some humor though. Newsline (Nightline?) and Reardon (Koppel?) are humorously portrayed, but alas they too are mere stereotypes. Save your money. This book has little; kids might like it though."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"No surprise here. All of Crichton's books are so interesting and unique, Airframe is hardly a surprise. It's a reallllly good book! Crichton fans, you won't be disappointed. I don't care what people say about MC's writing being based on movie deals or that his writing has terrible characters. It's just great, read it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was an OK book. Chricton is best when he uses his extensive research to ignite the imagination of the reader as in Jurassic Park, Congo, Sphere. While Airframe contains a great deal of research, it does nothing to inspire the reader. Additionally, his charactarizations are stuck in a rut. He must be convinced that evil MBA's are going to ruin the Earth. Airframe, Disclosure and Rising Sun all contain characters whose chief goal is to sell out all the honest working people in order to make a quick buck for themselves. Inspire me Mike!, don't beat me over the head with the evils of financial markets and the press. At least let's have some new villains."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is so much better than Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Both of them were soooo boring at the beginning.

I recommend this book to anyone who loves exciting books or any Michael Crichton fan."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Definatly not his best. I suggest starting with Andromeda Strain if you want to read Crichton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is defionetly one of Chrichtons best books I've read (I've read them all). The book is non-stop suspence from the first page to the last. The most excitng scene was the Hanger scene. I couldn't stop reading it. The reason for the 9 was that some of the book was boring, in-depth description of some of the characters description. Over-all I love it and don't regret buying it one bit."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I really enjoyed this book, simply because it was written in Crichton's compelling style and had an intriguing story-line. The technical material was interesting, but no matter the calibre or credentiala of an author, I never treat a novel as a textbook. Besides, whether the airframe material was authentic or not is irrelevant to what I saw as the main theme of the book: the industry's struggles with its popular image. This is, I think, typical for Crichton -- to encase what is essentially a story about human responsibility in a technical and dramatic framework. *Terminal Man* and *Jurassic Park* deal with the question of whether scientists *should* do something, simply because they *can*. *Lost World* deals with the idea of responsibility in the area of extinction. *Congo* is essentially a study of three different approaches to exploration, asking the question of which is more responsible. *Sphere* is riddled with &quot;Should he (or she) have done such and such&quot; questions. The only Crichton work that pops to mind which which is different in this regard is *Eaters of the Dead*.Does *Airframe* deal with this issue well? I think it does. Aside from any technical or literary quibbles, I found the questions of corporate responbility to their customers and employees, of press responsibility to the people they cover and to those to whom they report, and of personal responsibility in the face of crisis situations (positively in Casey Singleton, negatively in Captain John Zheng Chang) fascinating."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton has written another great page-turner in Airframe. It is a more coherent and riveting book than some of his previous novels. The success of the story is achieved not through an exhaustive dissertation on airplane technology but through his unforgiving portrayal of an unscrupulous media interested not in investigating news and uncovering truth but in menacingly carrying out an agenda that distorts and misrepresents the realtity of an airplane accident for the sake of sensation and ratings. After reading Airframe, I have no problem riding on airplanes-- but I'll never watch 20/20 the same way again!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Pros: A good book full of suspense and a sympathetic female main caracter in a technical environment. I had fun to read it in a few days. Like in his best novel (Disclosure) Crichton provides (or seems to provide) some inside aspects of professional life in technical companies. Moreover, when looking at recent news, parts of the plot have become reality. Cons: Crichton's language and his dramatic means are limited. You find repeats of certain phrases a bit too often within the text."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a great fan of Chrichton's work and have thoroughly enjoyed all of his books I have read. I was excited when I found it in paperback and I bought it. The book had some exciting chase scenes and disaster scenes, which are his specialty, but not enough to keep me happy. It was almost purely techinical which I did not enjoy. He wrote the book well and it had some good qualities but it just wasn't near as wholesome as his others."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichten's use of technical 'jargon' made this book. He showed a great sense of knowledge of what he is writing about, as he does in all of his books. Excellent."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The story was very informative, but it was boring. Every once in a while Crichton would through in a chase scene just to keep you from droppping the book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton has this knack of blending the latest in techno knowledge with breathtaking plots. This one's no different. His best sci-fi after 'Disclosure. A movie should follow soon."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It was a pretty good book, but nothing much compared to his other books. There isn't much to hold you in and I was really disappointed with the ending."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The biggest problem that I had with this book is that I had the thing figured out by page 40. I enjoyed the tense writing style once the media got involved and I enjoyed the overall pace of the book but I think there were just too many obvious clues dropped as the book went along. Try Agatha Christie if you want a tough mystery!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is another Crichton book, except that this book is the best I've read. Keeps the reader at the edge of his seat. Great suspense. Simply irresistable!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is like most of Michael's books. All the way back to A Case of Need. Airframe is good for all ages to learn about planes and how much technology has pushed them higher and higher. To me Crichton was not just thinking about adults but children also. This is a great book for anyone who would like to learn the interesting facts about planes and how much effort is put into making one of them."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The thing I like about Michael Crichton is his ability to make the reader feel like an expert in whatever field the book is written around. While reading Airframe, I was thoroughly annoyed when outside characters attempted to interpret the complex airplane industry.

This is a thrilling book; an easy read that I never wanted to put down."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I must admit i'm only 15 and have only read 7 of his books, but i did read Sphere, Congo, The Adromeda Strain, and Jurassic Park. All of these books had a great plot because they're not something that we think about daily and because of the extensive research. Airframe follows this pattern, but it lacks the superb finish these other books have. If only he could have put an added twist to the end it would have gotten 5 stars from me. The reason it did get 4 stars is because of his originality, occasional plot twist, and the great detail he goes into to explain the business and some of the technology it uses (which for a 15 year old is interesting). I also wish he would have included more than one media personality (like a race between companys to get the story first). Inspite of the few flaws i found this is definately a book to read and to let your teenagers read (they might actually like it)."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton's latest script--er, novel was written in just about the time it takes to read it. The technical information is well presented, and, one hopes, accurate. Because that's all there is, folks. The characters are two dimensional, the plotting convoluted, and the payoff disappointing. Having said that, it's serviceable cotton candy--Crichton is a most accomplished purveyor of contemporary pulp fiction, and is no doubt cruising through his next bestseller at this very moment. One suggestion--skip the chapters, replace with scene numbers. It'll save the script girl some work."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I just finished with Airframe and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though not as good as Disclosure, it is worth the time spent. Crichton delivers a nice &quot;twist&quot; near the end which comes as a pleasant surprise. I did, however, feel his closure at the end a bit abrupt. It felt as if he was hurrying before he ran out of pages. The Technical information was wonderful! Crichton has prepared me well for the next time I fly. His explanations were clear and precise and the real wealth for me in this story is how much I learned. From now on, when I look out my cabin window and see those &quot;slats&quot; moving back and forth on an airliner, I'll remember Crichton......and know what's going on....and why!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The story was fairly well written and the technical data was actually fairly interesting. I was somewhat disappointed in the cynical manner in which Crichton portrayed all the main characters (except the heroine)."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton, the master of the techno-thriller is back with Airframe. His new book is a criticalperspective of todays trash media and its rule in the pop culture. Against the backdrop of an airlineaccident, we follow the attempts of a female executive of the aircraft manufacturer to solve the mysteryof the incident that caused the death of three passengers. A sensational TV news team is also after thestory -- albeit from their perspective the truth really is not the goal. The book does not waste anytime ingetting the readers attention up to the incident -- it actually occurs on the second page! As with all ofCrichtons novels, this one is fast paced, and involves a certain deadline. This time, however, when itcomes to the assortment of high tech gadgets his books became famous for, Chrichton is more subduedin his handling of the subject matter. IMHO, the book is too short for its own benefit - I only wish theauthor restrained himself a little bit and allowed his characters to mature a little before their immersioninto the plot. Airframe might not be as powerful, and it might not generate as much controversy andmight not be as talked about as as some of the authors other works, yet it tells a good story about a veryintriguing topic.

As a Private Pilot myself, I have a HUGE fascination in Air Disasters, and thought this would be 'right up my allay'. It wasn't. In all fairness I've only read 1/2 of it but don't intend to finish it because it doesn't seem to be going anywhere?! Starts very well but then slackens off rapidly. I've found that there are too many characters which are not established long enough to be remembered (I had to keep flicking back to remember who they were!?!) The plot doesn't thicken, there is way too much technical jargon (some of it might as well of been written in Latin) and the chapters are too short, so there's a lot of chopping around. My advice... unless you're an aeronautical engineer with a lot of time to spare... skip it!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book was a good read, but it just doesn't live up to the reviews printed on the back cover. \\"...will cause a lifetime of white-knuckled nightmares.\\" HARDLY! Crichton does a good job of pulling you into the story in the beginning of the book. It actually starts off pretty suspenseful. However, as the you get deeper into the book, the more boring it becomes. The most disappointing aspect is how irrelevant much of the book's content is to the actual ending. There also appear to be too many sub-plots, and at times it can be difficult to follow. The ending is also disappointing. You're expecting something exciting, or at least some answers to the many sub-plots, but there is essentially nothing.However, I will confess that I am a student-pilot, and I still found the book a decent read...if only because I love airplanes!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"\\"Airframe\\" is meant to be topical: full of details and praised for being \\"ripped from the headlines\\" and \\"plausibly detailed\\".

The media - as opposed to their practice in more recent disasters - blame Norton rather than the airlines (remember the hype over low-cost outfits like \\"ValueJet\\" and bloated dinosaurs like Pan-Am and TWA, and remember all of those \\"US-scare\\" jokes?), turning Norton into a target for ambitious reporters, \\"bottom-feeding\\" lawyers and other unethical, uninformed and non-credentialed \\"experts\\". \\"Airframe\\" could have been a great novel with which to explore issues like products liability, airlines and the media, but Crichton proves as prone as his media villains to unconvincingly sexing up the story. The N-22 becomes beset by every conceivable unethical character in America, sharing nothing more in common than greed and ignorance. Norton's Aero experts are his heroes, selflessly protecting aviation from the Knights of the Round Tort.Using a fictitious story that makes no secret of its sympathies, Crichton rails against the media's uninformed depictions of the aviation industry, citing the history of the DC-10' - which was temporarily grounded following a string of accidents and bad press in the 1970's - as an example. Though DC-10s returned to fly, Crichton insists that McDonnell never sold another.

The heroes of \\"Airframe\\" - experts involved in designing and building airplanes - are almost as removed from flying as the villains. Though he pays lip-service to the wisdom of pilots (check that other quote before the first page) Crichton either won't or can't make a pilot one of his main characters, and Crichton's aero-engineers - N-22 partisans who know airplanes - are kept around only to add the veneer of scientific correctness to his screed against the uninformed media.

At the beginning, I found his style too slow moving for my taste. Nothing seems to happen. Yet, Crichton is a crafty writer. Reading AIRFRAME is like putting together a fascinating puzzle. It starts slow but builds and builds and builds to the point of supersonic speed and intrigue. He teases the reader to continue to read with mere tidbits of unrevealed clues - then he slaps the reader in the face. Everything is laid out for the reader, but I missed it. That's what makes this a great novel - the element of surprise.Crichton's characters are also vivid. In my experience, character development is the most complex and difficult task for a writer. Crichton's mastery of the English language enables the reader to feel that the characters are real rather than fiction. The pace in describing the main characters demonstrates his crafty writing skill. His style produces a rare kind of realism that pushes the reader on the edge of the chair. The vividness of being chased and falling are so genuine, one feels like one is watching a film rather than reading a book.Lastly, and this will not spoil the plot, the story line can be found in the title.

After doing this she knows the truth about what happened after she took a test flight on the plane that was in the accident.Airframe is a novel that you don't want to miss whether you are a fan of Michael Crichton or not. Not only does the book have a fabulous story, it is also a great reference just like all of his other books. Be sure to read this one and enjoy it. I think you will.HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I was serioulsy expecting an entertaing book when I bought this. When I finished, I finished VERY confused. The plot seemed to jump all over the place, and didnt teach me a thing, which is unusual for a Chrichton book. It was boring and slow and confusing. Hope Timeline will be better."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is by far my favorite book. As an engineer, I want to know all the technical details, and this book mostly fits that. The story was almost never boring, and the ending (spoiler alert) was quite happy. Michael Crichton is now one of the few authors I'll follow."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Pros-Crichton easy to read writing style, page turner.-Thriller story with believable characters.-Nice integration of technical information.-Not too long, to the point.-Pretty good depiction of a long gone small aircraft company.-Nice critique of the media industry and it's dangers.Cons-Plot holes. I'm not sure that the mystery part about the behind the scenes company stuff made any difference if the incident didn't happen. The story seems to place them as dependent, a bit misleading once you read the whole book.-Some cliched assumptions. Many companies get bad press and still survive and prosper. This book assigns more power to the press than is warranted. Not everyone gulps down what the \\"news\\" media tells us. This is especially true in technical industrial areas.-Kind of an anticlimax as to what actually happened on the plane.This is one of the non-science fiction Crichton books that focuses on an aircraft in-air incident and the goings on at the plane manufacturer while the incident is being investigated. It follows Casey Singleton, a Quality VP, at the fictional Norton Aircraft based in Burbank, CA. Casey is investigating the incident and this describes her struggle to figure out the cause as well as dealing with a hostile media producer, Jennifer Malone, who wants to produce a damning story about the company. Singleton also has to deal with a mystery at Norton as to what is going on behind the scenes in the company during all these happenings.I was intrigued by the small aircraft company described as I live not too far from the Burbank Airport and much of that infrastructure is still there. It's kinda sad that that is not really done here anymore, but there is a decent residual aircraft components industry around there and SoCal in general. A quaint small-er company as described simply doesn't exist in that industry around here or pretty much anywhere in America anymore. It's large corporations(Boeing)that do non-military aircraft now.Some of the outsourcing stuff about China doesn't seem that believable though. If the wing is the whole key to proprietary information what's to stop the Chinese or anyone from just buying one plane and reverse engineering it? as opposed to a premise here that they would buy 100 planes in order to get the offset of making the wing in China/Korea etc. I think industrial espionage is even cheaper than buying one plane. The real proprietary value is the specific experience of the employees of the plane manufacturer, the average education of the talent pool,tradition and culture, etc. not tooling. I doubt large numbers of technicians/engineers here would be willing to relocate to China/etc., even if they did the vast majority of workers would still be relatively inexperienced Chinese, etc.The critique of the media is a running Crichton element in a few books including State of Fear. I think this issue is so important as TV and other media outlets and forms dominate our lives, too much a lot of the time. Vast amounts of people are non-critical thinkers who just take on faith what media people present them with. This can be seen a lot of places, people get confused as to what reality is. For them it's defined by the news as well as entertainment and the two are not distinct much anymore: infotainment. Just look at younger people who are so wrapped up in it and make choices daily in sole reference to what they see in the media. It's the same with everyone but the young and the old are particularly prone. This effects everyone from individuals, business, governments, etc. The media is a powerful thing that people need to be educated about and be able to sort through what is real news that should be used to make decisions in our own lives and what is trash to be ignored and discarded. The media is great too and does liven up our lives but without keeping it's downsides in perspective it can be a harmful thing.In summary this is a good book, nothing like a classic but a good mystery/thriller that is a great read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Once again, hard to put down. Filled with just enough research (as always) to come away feeling your view on a subject might be changed, but not enough to keep it from being a page turner that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"TransPacific flight 545's pilot calls in reporting turbulence. When the commercial flight lands, it turns out there are over fifty passengers injured and three dead. The people who have the answers seem to be hiding something.Casey Singleton is employed to investigate whether the incident is the fault of the manufacturers of the plane. As she peels layers away she learns more of the truth and puts herself in extreme danger. She finds counterfeit airplane parts and procedural problems and she is determined to discover what really happened on that horrible flight.As usual, Crichton does his homework. He brings us right into the technical world of airplane manufacturing. Interlaced with interesting technical facts we get a thrilling mystery and action packed story."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This novel was very intriguing and I couldn't wait to get off work so I could go home to read it. Although it is very technical and takes the reader into the world of aeronautics, at its heart it is a mystery with great characters. A book that is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Air frame is about the plane industry, the new form of gotcha journalism, the labor union, corporate intrigue and an investigation, into deaths aboard a Norton-22 Widebody plane flying from Japan to Nevada. The story is told in bits giving you key elements to the story through four or five characters. All the characters are really convincing, and have believable personalities, there's a lot of character's in this story and even the minor one's have quirks that separate them.This is a story that I would have passed on otherwise if not written by Crichton, He know how to and intrigue to a story, this novel is very fast paced and has it's edge of your seat moments, wondering how this is all going to come together. It does have a cheesy plot where the bad guy tells his scheme and says there's nothing you can do about it.All in all it's a good quick read that seems very real"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I'm a big fan of Michael Crichton. As always, I enjoyed the technical detail. It inspired in me a greater interest in aviation. But this was not one of my favorites. Overall I found myself a bit bored and the ending was kind of a let-down. Not much more I can say about it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is the third Michael Crichton book I've read and definitely the worst..It is very slow moving and way too much airplane technical lingo..."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I kept waiting for this story to get better, didn't happen. The characters were boring, not the Michael C. I love to read. Maybe some people might enjoy. I did finish however because I had to see the end, yawn!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have loved the Jurassic Park books. I choose this because I do enjoy most everything related to airplanes. I could not stand this book it was incredibly boring. Although it had some interesting facts and tid bits about the commercial aircraft field it was far to drawn out. I felt that the story could have been over in half of the pages it was. Overall I would not recommend this particular work of Michael Crichton but I have read his other books and would suggest reading them. Do not stop reading books by this author just avoid this particular book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book was good and exciting, but some of the bits seem like reading a technical airplane book. Fortunately I didn't mind it, Crichton has a way of making it usually very interesting. To me, it seemed there was a lack of suspense, but the book was still interesting; it was very much like reading a great magazine article about commercial airframes with a loose plot tied in to make it more interesting.An airplane has crashed, killing three people and injuring pretty much everyone else. Casey Singleton, the VP of Quality Assurance at Norton Aircraft, must help the team figure out what went wrong by the end of the week or the company will miss an airplane deal with Bejing that will save the company. Not to give anything away, I will say that there are some fairly-unpredictable plot turns at the end.Another thing that bothers me about this book is the countless characters and acronyms in the book. It takes awhile before I started to remember who all the nonessential characters were and since airplanes are so technical-like, there is a lot of industry jargon and acronyms thrown in to the mix.I had mixed feelings about this book. It was enjoyable to read, but I never really felt there was any real suspense. However, this book is great if you are interested in technical things, especially airplanes."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"By Jeffrey W. Bennett, ISP, author ofISP Certification-The Industrial Security Professional Exam ManualandUnder the Lontar PalmGreat book and fast reading thriller. This story could have been stolen from the news. I actually wanted to get into Quality Control with an air line manufacturers after reading about it. The Heroine was very realistic. Great work."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I love this book. I love the detail, the suspense, it is just impossible to put down. The story never felt slow or lacking and even re-reads are exciting. It is impossible not to enjoy this wonderful work. What would be interesting is if it was made into a movie, as I could see it happening."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a huge Michael Crichton fan. I love his books more than any others and once I pick them up, I cant put them down. Im sorry that I cant say that about this novel. It was terrible.This is a very different kind of book than other Crichton novels, and maybe that is why I couldnt get into it. I felt that it was dry, and un interesting. If you are into planes, then maybe this book will be for you, mainly because of all the technical info about aircrafts. But this is more of a book about an investigation of a plan that almost crashes. I got half way through the book and stopped reading it. I just made me want to go to sleep. Boring Boring Boring. I didnt want to put it down, just because i know that Crichton is always full of surpises. But if i got halfway through the book with none yet, then I didnt think anything special was coming up.As I said before, I didnt like this book at all, but some may be into this kind of stuff. If so, feel free to pick it up, but for all that are bored by investigations that dont have any thrill to them, pass this book up."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is Crichton at his best. The story is full of detailed information about the commercial airline industry that I would never have known without having read this book. He fizzles out on the ending, but the set up and wealth of techincal detail was quite interesting."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I found this hard to put down, the main in the book is very strong, real and interesting. One fantastic twist at the end and you want to cheer ! Take that Newsline."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was an excellent and suspenceful novel one of the greatest of Michael Crichton's works!Great details, suspence and a sense of knowing. You feel like you really had been working for an airline media group. It's that detailed and well portrayed the works of an airline media team.I recommend it to everyone! It might be alittle draggy on the details and explanations but other than that, which is necessary in the plot, this book keeps you questioning. Read it and see for yourself! ***** five star!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I can't rank this book among Crichton's most exciting or interesting stories, but it is a reasonably good page-turner. And I'm tempted to give it another star for the wonderful job Crichton does of portraying the incompetence, ignorance, and sometimes deliberate deceptiveness of the American media."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. I loved it from beginning to end. I checked the book out, and was done with it later that same day, you just can't put it down. It is written from a day to day point, and you just have to see what happens the next day. After reading this book I became interested in aviation, before I never even thought about it, I just didn't like planes. I recommend this book to anyone who likes Michael Crichton books, it is one of the better ones out there."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book will disappoint even the most avid Crichton fan. It lacks the suspense and excitement that Crichton novels are known for. If you like Crichton and want to keep it that way, don't read this. If you want to try reading Crichton, start with Sphere, which is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I read words from Michael Crichton, I can visualize them all. I imagine visually the entire story. His stories are technical and flowing. This book is highly recommended. I won't bother to tell you about the book because you should read without knowing to make it more exciting. This book is for techincal thinkers who can visualize."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Many people don't like this book and think it's one of Crichton's worst, but I loved it. It had a good story to it, good characters, and I learned some things about air flight while reading it. This was the first Crichton book I read and I have read the majority of his other books because I liked this one so much. Although it's not my favorite, I would recommend it, especially to people who are interested in air flight and planes."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is not great literature. There is no point in describing the main character, because she has no more personality than any of the tens of thousands of parts that make up a Boeing 747-400.But despite the total lack of any human drama, I found myself sneaking into the bathroom during work hours to finish off the last few pages.I find anything to do with flying fascinating and have enjoyed reading a flight manual of an F-16 fighter. Crichton has certainly written a more interesting book than a flight manual, although without any more characterization. But anyone readng &quot;Airframe&quot; will both learn about and admire the engineering that goes into producing a large passenger aircraft.Crichton also makes a delighfully vicious attack on the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; type of news program.&quot;Airframe&quot; is a &quot;page turner&quot; in both the best and worse sense. It would be a great book to take on a long airplane trip and while away the long hours, if the subject matter didn't happen to be about a near plane crash."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I thought that this book was great but just not as good as his others. Maybe he ran out of ideas or didn't know as much about airplane buisness but on the other hand, it was very scary in a lot of parts. I recommend this book to adults."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Very Good. Gripping. I read this on a road trip. I couldn't put it down. You get enveloped in this story and the mystery that surrounds a troubled airliner, a company in peril, and an odd episode over the Pacific Ocean. And all the events that follow are excellent. Airframe follows the investigation, the media's reaction, and the top level management trying to cover everything up. It has lots of suspense and surprises at every turn. A story of Conspiracy, Politics, Business, and Business Tycoons on the loose. Cover-to-cover Heart pounder. You must own it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was a great audio-book. Michael Crichton has done it again.Being one who spends alot of time in the car commuting to/from the office I listen to many audio-books. This was the first book that has ever kept me so riveted that I didn't want to get out of the car once I arrived at my destination. In fact, I spent a portion of my lunch time sitting in my car in the parking garage of my building listening to this book.Ms. Brown took Crichton's colorful characters and truly brought them to life. The mental images Mr. Crichton/Ms. Brown created were extremely vivid. At times it was like actually watching TV or being in a very real dream-like state.This book will also start the wheels turning in your mind about the airline industry and aircraft manufacturers (e.g. What really goes on in their board rooms). After reading or listening to this book you will definately look at the air industry in a different light.Mr. Crichton obviously spent many hours researching material for this book. He had the majority of his facts together.Please, if you are looking for a great read for this summer make it Airframe. If you commute and are looking for something other then the same hum-drum radio to listen to, again, make it this audio-book. I'm sure you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As shown in the title of this review, this audio book was wonderful.Being someone who commutes to work in a heavy traffic congested area, I found this book to be captivating.

This audio book captured your attention just a few minutes into it.Ms. Brown did such a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life that the mental pictures were so clear it was like actually being in the seen. The one I remember most is when Casey is walking in the hanger and looking at the planes being constructed. I felt as if I was standing right next to her.I found absolutely nothing about this audio book that I didn't like which is obvious by the title of this review.If you commute, listen to books and are tired of the same hum drum stuff on the radio, then try listening to this book.

I found it difficult to get out of my car and go into my office.I would highly recommend this book on tape to anyone who commutes and gets tired of the radio."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"True to form, Michael Crichton writes yet another novel about a topical issue - this time the issue of public airline safety in the new deregulated environment we find ourselves in.There's something about Michael's novels that seems to capture me, but I just can't seem to put any of his books down once I start. The characters are plausible, and you often feel like you've learnt something after reading any of his novels.Airframe is no exception. In presenting the troubles of a fictional airline manufacturer that competes with Boeing and Airbus Industries, Crichton exquisitely illustrates the motivations and the vested interests of everyone in the industry, from the manufacturer to the airlines to the media and the public.It's an incredibly thought provoking read!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I first checked this book out from the library, I only did it because I like Michael Crichton and I didn't think I would enjoy it very much. Boy, was I wrong! This book is so awsome!! I couldn't stop until I had finished! It was suspensful and it kept me guessing about what she was going to do. In the beggining, it suggests that the autopilot did it, but that definitely wasn't what really happened. Contrary to what you may see below in another review. I don't think they really understood the book very much. This book was really descriptive and actually got me nervouse, or scared or something like that which no other book did. Get this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I think that Michael Crichton is getting into more depth, if that is possible. Well, his acknowledgements section is getting bigger too. This one is very different from most of the other books he writes. Usually they are about something killing humans. This book is a mystery that is pretty cool. Detailed and suprize twists at the end. Too cool!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I think this book was great. Crichton's amazing talent of giving detail and intrigue really shines through in this one. I honestly think that this book is well-worth a consideration to read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Though the main issues of this book are corporate politics, air-safety etc, I found the remarks-or should I say footnotes?- on TV-everyday-business really amazing. Crighton's thoughts on how TV works and how viewers receive TV-messages and TV-&quot;information&quot; are really deep and can make a reader think a little on that issue. I have read 2-3 Crighton books and they were rather boring. This one was an exception."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am not interested in how in depth this book goes about unions and toher inter large corporation scandlas. The end of this book got confusing and i didn't like it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Although it is interesting at first, the plot quickly slows to a crawl with dragged parts. It came to a very disappointing ending. A waste of money, but a Crichton fan might like it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I really enjoyed it and loved the end. It kind of reads like the lost world."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is full of suspense. In scenes were Casey is getting chased around the company, and when she recieves the threatening phone calls. It was good writing. Crichton displays a goos stroyline, and unlike Congo doesn't get too informational. I enjoyed reading Airframe."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Although Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors, I usually tend to enjoy his science fiction novels far more than his other books. However, Airframe was a very notable exception. I have very little interest in airplanes, and less in corporation politics, but as boring as all that sounds (to me, at least), this is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. There are several plot twists and interesting surprises -- a must read for any fiction fan!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Although the book reminded me too much of Disclosure (subtle events occured in both), I though that the book was an excellent read. Although it can be non-adventureous and non-suspensing at times, I found that I came out knowing more about the topic at hand than before I picked up the book. The book is well worth the money that I paid for, and in the past year or so, I have read it three times."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"_Airframe_ is absolutly not his best novel to date, but it is a nice conclusion for his nay-saying 90s.Since the _Jurassic Park_ in 1989, Crichton becomes an author that bashes a lot. He attacks biotech, and Japanese tycoons, and femm, so to get readers' attention. We now know why he did it. It is all about the power.From the beginning of Crichton's writing career in mid-60s, he writes a lot on female issues. I have all 8 John Lange books, but only read two of them so far, so I can't say too much about this period. But started from his _A Case of Need_ (a book written under the psuedonym &quot;Jeffery Hudson&quot;, a famous 19th century dwarf), Crichton wrote intensively on female issues. In this book, a young woman seeking for independence dies for malpractice of abortion, then illegal in the pre-Roe-vs-Wade United States. A doctor (written in third person, I remember) who wants to clear the bad name for his American-Chinese collegue started to investigate...The dead body, Karen Rendall, is the mascot of a Boston-based medical family. She wants to escape from her reality, and failed. That's why she lost her life.The movie _Carey Treatment_ is loosely based on this novel, and is lousy to death. It is just another seen-and-forget whodunit flick Hollywood made every year. If you want to read more about this issue, read Robin Cook's _The Acceptable Risk_. It mentioned about another Boston raised family girl. Her medical career, medical boy friend, and best-of-all, the Salem witchcraft trial that links herself and her 17th century great-...-grandmother. This is a nice book talking abot the forming of role model to a woman who does not know what to do.Women in Crichton's books are evolving. From a dead body to be exaimed, to a math genius who can risk the life of a team just because she wanted to (Karen Ross of _Congo_), to someone who can start a sex war (Meredith Johnson of _Disclosure_), and to someone who can arrange a counter attack (whoever she was in the f**king lousy _The Lost World_). His female casts are more and more comfortable with power. They are much more reasonable. And responsible. Cathy Singleton of the _Airframe_ is absolutely a woman like this. She is good at her field, she is divorced, the whole plot happends at the week her daughter is at her ex-husband's house. She is free to Rambo the system. And she confronts woman -- Jennifer Malone, a reckless new kid in town who knows not a damn about knowledge but seeks power.You might say that the enemy Singleton faced is Marder and Richman, no, they are not. Look who's the last one mentioned in the book at page 351. Our dear Jennifer.That's why I believe I've grasped Crichton's hidden moral in these books. He wanted to talk about power. As time goes by, women are actually gaining more power. There is no true equal between sexes. And losers can still exploit other's sympathy to gain power. You can not be alone, if you are the member of a group who consisted half of the world's people. Whoever owns the power, in Crichton's view, should not be left unsupervised. And whoever owns the power, as time flies, will learn to use it better. That's probably why he bashes around.The diaster 35,000 ft above, I believe, is based on two real events. A crash of China Airlines (a Taiwan carrier) at Nagoya Japan, 1994 for the autopilot issue. And a crash in Russia where the pilot lets his child fool around with the plane.Miss Miriam in _The Great Train Robbery_ is the woman who handles her power best in Crichton's former books. Now Singleton becomes the one who can control herself so well. Just like Miss Miriam. Otherwise this book is still a piece of trash. He even dares to recycle Virtual Reality for this novel. The original Crichton flavor is gone. We no longer see breathtaking (and also errornous) high tech detail in this book, but at least we now know what he wanted to say."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was a joy to read. The writing style is so smooth and the story moves along quickly with no wasted narrative. I was dissapointed at the end--not because of the ending--but just because there wasn't any more to read"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Not as far-fetched or sci-fi as his other books, yet no lessexciting.Crichton is one writer who actually knows what he's writing about. I'm amazed by his technical knowledge.Almost scary because this kind of thing really happens."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"No, no Mr Chrichton, if you need to write a screenplay, please do not publish it as a novel! I loved Jurassic and Rising Sun,but please do not waste my money again. You just left out ...lights..action...! Your screenplays are excellent and make for wonderful TV and movies. Please just make up your mind which hat you are wearing"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The characters are probably portrayed more accurately than I would care to admit. The plot left a good deal to be desired. However, as a former employee of a major airline I can relate very well to the electronics, and the wires hanging all over the place. Chrichton has had to have done quite a bit of research, and walking about in a hangar to have related the technical details as well as he did.The plot was not at par with Chriton's better works. However, compared with the work of his peers, it was none the less very good. The story went very quickly and did manage to hold my attention. There was a considerable amount of white space, and I can't help thinking he could have saved a few trees by combining a few of the chapters.The overall rating is the lowest I have given Chrichton for any of his works, and that is mostly due to the plot. It's a good book for a rainy weekend, or when your mother-in-law is over."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"If you like Crichton novels, you'll like Airframe. The plot builds well, but still, it didn't knock me out. I'd rate Airframe behind Jurassic Park, and on a par with Sphere and the Congo"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I enjoyed Airframe. It was a quick read, and something I didn't put down for long. With all the recent airline news, it was an interesting spin on the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; investigative stuff usually not seen in everyday life. Strong lead women character, perhaps that's why male crichton readers don't like it in the reviews below. It had me surprised right up until the end. Differnet from other chrichton books, yes, but definately worth reading"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am an avid fan of Mr. Crichtons and have eagerly divoured his previous works - all of them. After finishing Airframe, my only feeling was one of having wasted a couple of hours reading a book that appeared to have been thrown together.There was a significant amout of industry jargon, much more four lettered words than normal, and a plot that sort of left me feeling like I just finished a rerun of 'Murder She Wrote'.His normal work stands head and shoulders above the rest of the techno-thrillers; this one, however, just barely came into the average range"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The storyline was slow to get started. The action becomes intense as an investigative reporter is introduced into the plot. The book becomes a real race after that. This book is as good as I expected it to be, but lacked the initial grab experienced when I read &quot;Congo,&quot; &quot;The Lost World,&quot; and &quot;Sphere.&quot; I do, however, strongly recommend it"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It was a very quick read, at times I felt I was reading a screenplay not a novel. The combination of Business and Technology was similar to Disclosure, just better. The technical side of the book was great I could identify with the engineers delima of trying to solve the problem and defend there abilities to less informed characters. Some of the action sequences felt out of place. Over all an enjoyable way to spend a few hours"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I HAVE NOT READ AIRFRAME, BUT LISTENED TO THE UNABRIGED AUDIO BOOK.

As with many ofMichael Crichton's books it is so accurate it'sscary.

Moreover, Crichton manages to show us the intintions of the Media today, the corporate power challenges. All these wrapped up in a matter which is really hot today - Aircrafts safety.GET THIS BOOK NOW! (or atleast, go see the movie - which I'm sure, will follow.)"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Forget literary merit when reading a Crichton novel. Judged asa beach book, this thriller is typically Crichton and a darn goodread. As a former corporate public relations manager, I loved his portrayal of a TV news team--right on target for a significant portion of the journalistic world. I winced, however, at some stereotypical comments about engineers. For thoughts on this, see the op-ed at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rodgersmail/engineer.htm And for a nonfiction book about a real aircraft company, see Amazon's entry on FLYING HIGH by Eugene Rodgers."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book in itself was typical Crichton material; well-researched, touches on relevant issues and hard to put down. However, I must say that this book lacks anything new. In my opinion, this book is just Disclosure with a woman in the lead and the airline industry instead of computers. Take note of these similarities;The company is in the midst of a significant event. In Disclosure, we have a merger, here we have a big sale to ChinaThe leading person finds himself/herself in a situation where he/she in in danger of being out of a jobMeredith and Arthur conniving against Sanders while here, we see Marder and Richman conniving against Casey.Again, the monday, tuesday, wednesday thingThe ending's almost the same, the hero finds himself/herself in public spilling out the beans.Well, that's about it. To boot, I already knew the ending. That son thing was topic of a news article around a year ago in an airline company somewhere. It really did happen."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book except for one point: making an enemy of the floor workers on the pplane. I found the big chace seen through the plane to be completely unbelievable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the description of how stories get made on shows like 60 minutes. From now on, I'll never again wonder what the importance of the producer of those shows is"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Well, I decided to go ahead and read this book, even after the poor reviews. I always like to give a book the benefit of the doubt (especially one written by someone such as Crichton). In a word, &quot;terrible.&quot; I felt like I was reading something I may have written in Junior High School!! Don't bother folks, save your money"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"One thing consistent about Crichton books is that they are difficult to put down...and I found that to be true of Airframe, although I disliked it. The characters are flat and I found myself struggling to root for the protagonist. Crichton obviously has an axe to grind against the media, to the extent that it damages the novel. The depiction was so one-sided, my book actually leaned over when I put it down.That said, I have to admit that I read the book in one day. The story picks up considerably in the last few chapters. The author did a good job of keeping the mystery alive until the end. The background on airplane manufacturing was informative, although also somewhat dry.Reading Airframe reminded me of eating a big bag of potato chips -- you open the bag and find that you can't eat just one, the next thing you know the bag is finished and you feel somewhat ill, full but not satisfied"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton has again written incredibly. I breezed through this book in one night! It was suspensful, educational, intriuging, unpredictable, and fun. This is his next best after The Andromeda Strain! - Matt Colvi"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is awesome. Forget the bad reviews about the technical jargon!!!Michael explains all of it so almost anyone can understand it!! I recomend this to anyone that likes to read"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Like many Crichton books, Airframe has a a good story. This book will keep the reader glued to his seat, like for me, it was a one-sit reading."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I Purchased the audio tapes for this book, and the first time I listened to it I was LATE for work every day.The second time I was driving to South Carolina (about 11 hrs)and listining to the book made the time fly.There was three of us, and the two who were supposed to be resting couldn't fall asleep because they didin't want to miss any part of the story.If you have never experienced audio books try one the next time you have a long drive or trip. Having someone reading the book brings more suspense and life to the story.I recommend this book not only for the story but for the insight to airplane mfgs and the whole airline industry. I have listened to this book twice and will listen to it again."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As usual Michael Crichton delivers an exciting narrative, though almost in a different genre from his other thrillers such as Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, or Congo. Airframe is fascinating to readers who appreciate Tom Clancy, though it is easily dull and tedious to those that do not. It is loaded to the brim with Clancy-like research and page upon page of technical jargon which might discourage some readers, though as a whole it is a satisfying, interesting, exciting, and informative novel, easily read in a day or two."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I didn't think I would enjoy a book about an airline accident, but I was wrong. This book kept me turning page after page -- the characters were strong, if at times a bit stereotypical. I loved the understated strength of Casey, the main character. And contrary to the opinions that have been expressed by other reviewers here, I enjoyed the jargon and the feeling of immersion in an industry that was previously foreign to me. Much better than Timeline, which proved the opposite experience for me (I was very excited by the premise of that one, but disappointed by the delivery). One of my favorite Crichton books overall."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The blurbs on the back of the book jackets are misleading. Although I found this book to be interesting and reasonably suspenseful, it is not about corruption and bad practices or even danger in the airplane industry (which comes off very well in the story) but about problems in the media. I believe that is what the title is about, too -- that they take an incident and completely reinterpret, re-framing it using little more than hot air."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is the best Criton book I have read so far. The characters were well defined. I have read other Criton books, and this was by far the best. The suspense was unmatched in this one. I liked this suspense one because oyu don't know what they will find next, or what they are going to what is wrong with the plane, next."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Chrichton is an excellent author. You just have to know his style. His plots and charachter development are always good, and this novel is no exception. I've read &quot;Airframe&quot; at least 5 times now, because every time I read it I feel like I am entering Chrichton's mind. Sure, &quot;Airframe&quot; does have a lot of technical jargon in it, but that is just because it's what it's like at a place such as Boeing. 5 Stars Easy."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Only those who truly know what they are getting into when the read a Chrichton book can truly respect this book...it is Chrichton's style to go into enough detail about a field that you almost feel like you know enough to pass the final exam in the course on the subject...Airframe is beautifully written all the way through in my opinion, filled with details of the industry and a very intricate plot. A page turner to the last paragraph."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book lacks character development. Plus, there is SO much information in it that after a while the plot just gets lost and the reader just can't care anymore. You have to really be in the aircraft industry to fully enjoy this, but if you think about it in that way, strictly as an informational volume, then the book could work on a very shallow level."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"From page one you are taken into Michael Crichton's world. He grabs your attention right from the begining and doesn't let go until it's over. This is a compulsive page-turner and keeps you reading right up to the last word. A must have book especially if you enjoy his other books. Well stop reading my review and get it for yourself. Trust me!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Who done it story that keeps you guessing. Most enjoyable aspect of the book is the understandable technical info on airplace structures and the depth of work involved in engineering an aircraft."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I first heard about this book and what it was based upon I thought I had foun the perfect action and suspenseful book, however this book was very dissapointing. The beggining of the book was very exciting, but as the plot unfolded I became more and more confused as to what was happening. I do not recommend this book to people in search for action-suspense type books, because this book is very boring and confusing."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I picked up this book and read the back, deciding it looked like a suspensful, gripping story about a strange happening in the air. I still thought this 3 chapters in, but then it slowly faded to a boring novel about a bit of turbulance that killed 3 people. Not a very good plot, a very disapointing climax."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The action started right at the beginning and he kept me interested all the way through the book. He described the terminology he used and I felt that I understood all the technical terms even though I knew nothing about aeroplanes. It was a brilliant book and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was a good book not his best, I've been a big fan of Michael Crichton for years and will always remain one. This book sort of reminded me of Disclosure, but it was still pretty good. The characters as usual are interesting, I just hope they don't make this one into a movie."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The greatest book on earth! Not to be read before boarding a flight"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Definitely, one of his better works. I really enjoyed it. His dipiction of what goes on in the air industry is an eye opener. The Unions, the underhand deals, bad parts, it makes one think &quot;What on earth is happening to the Airplane Industry!&quot;"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I guess the literary purists couldn't stand it and Crichton fans thought it sucked. Sorry, I didn't find it boring for even one page and I didn't think it was too technical, nor was I sorry there was no action or tension. I guess I'm too stupid to know anything about good literature. I too guessed the ending, but it didn't matter, I enjoyed it immensely!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"What on earth has happened to Crichton? This book is so technical that I can't make a head or tail of it! Let me repeat my question once again: WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE GREAT AUTHOR OF &quot;THE LOST WORLD&quot; AND &quot;SPHERE&quot;?"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was right at the top as all of Crichton's books are! I couldn't put the book down before I finished the story !!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I read somewhere that at any given hour across the globe there are an estimated 800,000 human beings flying from point A to point B. Now this novel comes along to add to all those white knuckles. Planes are aging and Crichton shows us what happens when we take things for granted eg. of course the captain's in control and in the cockpit! The author also capitalizes on woman's intuition while dwelling on technical faults most of us would rather not contemplate. Add a dash of corporate politics and you have another riveting read. Great stuff for a rainy evening, and infinitely better than most TV fare"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After his previous books I was SO anxious to read this; only to be real disappointed in it. It was disjointed. It presented several scenarious that never went anywhere. I have to admit though, the ride for the reporter was pretty good - she had it coming"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Not one of his best books but is a good read for anyone interested in aviation. The story is loosely based on a real-life avaition diaster that occured a few years ago in Russia but with slightly different results"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton never writes the expected and it is always worth the trip. I thought this would be another airplane disaster book. Surprise! I have read all of Crichton's books and none of them are predictable. AIRFRAME is no exception. An excellently researched and always fascinating look at the airplane construction industry with a lot of suspense and action. I, once again, could not put this one down"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I read novels to be entertained. Micheal Crichton alwaysentertains.

Shallow characters; read more like a screenplay. Boring with a rather unbelievable ending"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Well, actually 9.5. This is a great read and nothing couldprepare me for the surprise ending. The story of a crashand the race to solve out WHY it happened make for one heckof a story. I couldn't put it down! Mr. Crichton does it again!I'll read it six more times while I wait for his nextmasterpiece. I'm sure it'll be great, but I doubt he can topAirframe!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is perhaps not the best book Mr. Crichton has written--but it IS a good read. I couldn't put it down and read it in a day. Michael Crichton's usual style embodies painstaking and massive research--and this book is no exception. I learned much about the airline industry by reading it--for example: I never knew that &quot;ariplane manufacturers&quot; do not make the engines that power the plane. It was also fascinating to learn what happens after an &quot;incident&quot; and the amount and type of testing that goes on by manufacturers. Although not as &quot;exciting&quot; as some of his other works, Airframe is definately worth reading"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I was really excited when i heard there was a new michael crichton novel coming out. I got a copy as soon as i could, raced home, cracked it open, and began to read, expecting the best. By the middle of the story, i was ready to give up, but i kept on, hoping for something juicy. But nothing interesting ever happened. I never cared about the characters, and once you don't care about them, you'd better hope the adventure is there, but that too is lacking, sorely. It was like a recycled crichton story. He's already done sexual harassment and lawyers, cops and cultural intolerance, dinosaurs (twice), alien invaders (twice), and a guy with a plug-in in his brain. I think he's getting really desperate for a good idea. Seems like he was watching the news one night, saw an airplane crash story, and pulled out a few outlines for his previous books, and whipped this one up to make his publishers happy. A three might be too generous here, but since i love his other work, I have tyo give him some credit, and hope the next story is as good as Sphere, or close to it"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Not all stories sound as good on tape as they read; Airframe, however, was one of the good ones. I listened to it during a 6-hour car trip and was entertained all the way by Airframe's vivid scene descriptions, suspenseful action and fast-moving plot. (Not to mention the fact that I was glad I was driving instead of flying."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After reading the &quot;The Lost World&quot;, I was very disappointed with Crichton as a writer. Airframe was a pleasant surprise !! Granted that there were similarities between this book and &quot;Disclosure&quot;, but this book provided an interesting insight in the aircraft industry. The lead charcter for a change turned out to be a strong, independent woman who knew her stuff. The ending as usual was somewhat sensational, but then I could live with it"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was my first Michael Crichton ever and now I have become a real fan. Chrichton describes the technical issues concerning the aircraft itself very simple and easy to understand for a reader not familiar with aircrafts and how they work. But unfortunately there is also a negative thing I have to say about this novel. The ending is just too simple for me. After all that thoughts I made asking myself why the plane had crashed just do not fit to the actual ending.Nevertheless if you are interested in getting some deeper information about aircrafts and enjoy an exciting story this is a must read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I was really enthused and interested at the beginning of the book, but as we cruised on it was like parts were just filler to get to the end of the book. I have read other Crichton novels and felt that this was written for a movie or mini-series rather than for readers"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is a perfect book to read while you travel this summer (the irony of reading about an airplane accident while you fly is just too tempting) With a great story and detail that's become Crichton's signature, this book is a great read. You'll never look at airplanes quite the same way again"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I enjoyed this book, although it was in my opinion pretty obvious that something similar with what actually happened in the book had to be the explanation ofthis...mystery...if you've (like me) read all the otherCrichton books, don't hesitate with buying this one"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As usual, Crichton has written a suspenseful book. But this one did not hang together well. The key to the solution was an anonymous article and picture sent to the investigator, but Crichton never showed how the sender knew that the picture would match other evidence that only the investigator had seen. Also (and maybe this was intentionally ironic) in a one-sided, shallow, agenda-filled way, Crichton portrayed television reporters as one-sided, shallow, and agenda-filled"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Not being an expert on the subject, Crichton painted a clear picture for me. I took the book wherever I went and had my nose in it during all my down time. Can't wait for his next"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is a page turner, no question about it. But although the writing style is indeniably Chrichton, the plot just isn't - it is actually too obvious.And then, Chrichton fails to provide the single most important piece of information: who is the camcorder manufacturer?"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After finishing Michael Crichton's latest book Airframe, I have to conclude that, while the book was pretty entertaining, it was not quite up to the standards set by Crichton's previous novels. Other books by this author including Jurrasic Park and Andromeda Strain became bestsellers because of the suspensful writing combined with interesting characters and detailed technical explanations. While Airframe does deliver on the technical interest, which I greatly enjoyed, the tense scenes were not written quite as well and were fewer in number. Despite the relative lack of action scenes, there were enough to make the book satisfactory entertainment, and there were some insights into the media world that were both unexpected and apprecaited, as I find that subject to be very interesting. The technical explanations that Crichton is famous for were also very well done in this book, and I found th obeservations on the aircraft manufacturing industry and the airline industry to be very interesting. Parts of the novel also managed to invoke emotion into the reader, mainly outrage at the behavior of the media in the novel. The plot of the book was reasonably well organized, with a decent-sized pool of characters. The events were connected well and were easy to understand, but character development was fairly limited. We only get a good understanding of one character since the author focuses primarily on the events. Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I wouldn't rank it among the best novels that I've read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A Chinese-flown jumbo jet apparently encounters severe turbulence and lands at Los Angeles International Airport with deaths and injuries. The aircraft firm that built the airplane organizes an investigation team to figure out why the incident happened and why the backups didn't work. However, there appear to be people who do not want answers found. The novel contains many details concerning aircraft construction and aerodynamics as well as issues concerned with government regulation and corporate politics that I found fascinating. And this includes the discussion on safety. But, most of the most biting observations were made about television journalists. I particularly enjoyed the not-so-subtle comment about the Internet: &quot;The irony of the Information Age is that it has given new respectability to uninformed opinion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"&quot;Airframe&quot; Author:Michael CrichtonI find &quot;Airframe&quot; is a very interesting book, at least enough for the reader to finish it. Crichton, as in all his novels, did a lot of research. Despite this, I found many aspects in this novel tiring, specially the fact that there are too many technical details that almost dwarf the main story -of course they don't get to do it-. The characters (you can count over three thousand), except, maybe Casey Singleton, aren't sufficiently developed and at times they become essentially boring cartoons, because Crichton employs too much time in his techno babble. Not that the facts about the airplanes are so boring, but sometimes they take over the plot, slowing down its rythm. Anyway, I enjoyed this novel very much because it presents a chain of very exciting coincidences and events (Crichton succesfully keeps our attention making real life a lot more interesting), so many of them, that sometimes they can get exhausting. What I definitely liked the most was that the book makes a solid critic at modern life aspects such as sensationalistic media and industry management corruption. Like his &quot;Lost World&quot;, at the end it makes us wonder: What's this world turning into?, because we realize that honesty and search for the truth -what Casey defends as an honorable person, even when it could cost her job- are just forgotten principles and all that rules powerful people's minds is search for money and more power. Happily, Casey triumphs at the end, but actually because of her luck, as her neighbor makes her see, &quot;You were stupid. You should have lied&quot; he tells her, and we think next time she will have no other choice.A great novel from a great writer. I can't wait till the movie!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"...I thought Airframe was pretty lame. 2 stars are for two afternoon's pleasant and quick read through of the first 250 or so pages, and for learning some interesting details about the aircraft industry and airplanes themselves. Minus 3 stars are for the totally contrived and uncompelling \\"twist\\" that brings this novel to an abrupt halt 100 pages later. On the plus side: 1) Airframe is a very fast read; 2) for a few hours a reader can at least entertain the hope that something dramatic will eventually happen; 3) the novel cost me 50 cents at a used bookstore. On the downside: 1) the novel hashes out a lot of the same details again and again; 2) the basic story is beyond skeletal; 3) the conclusion (and its exciting-lead-in) are lame lame lame. A penny more than 50 cents and I'd be pretty ticked."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"One thing about a Crichton book, you will learn things.The problem you usually learn them at the expense of little things like character development. The idea of a book dealing with the study of an airplane malfunction, with occasional rants against the people who are supposed to protect our safety was a good one. Crichton once again fills a book with a tremendous amount of information and barring a background in the field, the casual reader will be dazzled by the quantity of info presented. (The quality would need a more expert opinion than mine.)However cookie cutter characters abound and they are often interchangeable with the most cursory of description and motivation. Sometimes I think Chrichton decides to research things that he is interested in and than thinks, &quot;This might make a good book.&quot; Not this time."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton does it again! This time we're in the air planemanufacturing business and Crichton makes it live. As anadded bonus, we go behind the scenes on one of themost widely accepted venues of 90s American life, news showtelevision. This book has something for everyone: If youwatch TV for news, read the papers or listen to the radio...if you fly on a regular basis, fly once in a while, or if you are afraid to fly, you have toread this book!As a frequent air traveler, he engaged myinterest with the very first pages. We witness anevent filled morning aboard the passenger cabin ofa foreign carrier from the perspective of an American couplebound from Hong Kong to Denver with their baby girl. As Iread, my excitment and curiosity grew.Crichtontakes a female point of view for the duration of the book--and like last summer's movie, the Net, the heroine ofAIRFRAME is a woman. Through all the intrigue and mysterysurrounding her investigation of an &quot;air incident&quot; we come to admire and respect Casey Singleton for herefforts to find the truth despite high personal risk.AIRFRAME presents a credible tale filled withencounters that reflect reality in the media andthe air transportation business. When I bought it,I thought it might sway my feeling of security onplanes, knowing statistics show that flying is much saferthan driving a car. On the contrary, the book reinforced myconfidence in the air plane industry and the system of airsafety in this country. Crichton's surprise ending leavesyou with an empathy and sympathy for fellow travelers onlife's journey, particulary parents. The understatedtruth demonstrated by Casey's investigation shows us thatseemingly inconsequential everyday decisions can have anenormous impact on others.Totally readable, totallyexciting, totally engrossing Crichton at his best. Don'twait for the movie--buy AIRFRAME, read it, enjoy the rideand tell a friend!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Except for the insider snapshot of the airline/airplane business, this would be a MAJOR lamer. I can't beleve how a book this bad made it to the bestseller list. This is nothing more than a screenplay for TV. This is what happens when you become a hollywood writer/director: 1. Token Character developement (think 2 hour movie timeframe) 2. Idiotic action scenes with main character which lead to...nothing! (picture a overweight 40 year old woman climbing down a 50 foor scaffolding escaping the clutches of Bad guys) 3. Telegraphed plot twists: &quot;Don't tell me this is going to be a parts story!&quot; 4. Typical hollywood ending (remember the movie, &quot;Wall Street&quot;)I bought this hardcover book at a garage sale for a dollar and it was barely worth it. Any takers???"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I first read this fifteen years ago, and decided to pick up a paperback version to re-read. I always thought Crichton to be a bit of a prophet, but this novel still seems up to date in 2012. Thinking how CBS \\"60 Minutes\\" tried to screw over George Bush with fake documents, the tv crew in this novel tried to destroy an airplane manufacturer with false claims making the novel now more real than ever. It also makes the double entendre of the title pop out! Television has become reality for most people, and what is proclaimed on tv imagery is reality whether truthful or not. And just as nowadays, if the truth does not fit the agenda of the broadcaster it will not be broadcast.This is a fast paced novel which is hard to put down (not to be too gross, I even took it to the bathroom so as not to break the flow of the story). It has a lot of technical jargon, but Crichton uses an intern novice technique to be the person that is being educated along with the reader.I am an avid Crichton fan, and his unique talent is sorely missed since his death."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"even though I was reading it on an airplane LOL - great story, well defined charactors & not the usual 'disaster' ending - good choice!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Not interesting at all, I got 1/2 way through, and threw it out.Boring, silly semi-tech stuff...Did he really write this? Nothing like his other books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The only reason that I gave this book four stars is simply because it is not the best Michael Crichton book.Michael Crichton takes you in to the world of aviation design and politics and delivers a high suspense thriller.Whether you have a broad knowledge of aviation mechanics, or never set foot on a plane, Crichton will give you an understanding that will take you deep inside the complexities of this remarkable field.It will make you look at air turbulence in a whole new light."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is just downright amazing. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down, and actually stayed up until 2:30 A.M. to finish it one night! I just couldn't put it down until I found out what happened to Casey Singleton and The Norton Company. The characters are perfectly developed and are easy to relate to. I could picture every character Crichton presented. He used a perfect blend of &quot;good&quot; guys and &quot;bad&quot; guys.The plot was even more amazing than the characters. All the subplots came together in the end. After I was done, I could sit back and think about each of the plots and see how realistic they were. If you didn't know whether this novel ws fiction or non-fiction, you wouldn't know. It was so believable. Crichton puts you right into the novel with his great setting descriptions, beautiful character development, and excellent plot flow. This is truly one of the greatest novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Flight TPA 545 is travelling from Hong Kong to Denver with an entirely Chinese crew aboard. Somewhere along the way, something goes wrong, and the pilot asks for clearance for an emergency landing at Los Angeles. Over the radio he reports, &quot;We have a passenger emergency. We need ambulances on the ground. I would say thirty or forty ambulances, maybe more.&quot;But nothing prepares rescue workers for the carnage they witness when they enter the plane. Ninety-four passengers are injured. Three dead. The interior cabin virtually destroyed. What happened on board?The pilot says it was turbulence, but other than that the entire crew remains mysteriously tight-lipped. Enter Casey Singleton of the Incident Review Team of Norton Aircraft, the company that built the plane. It's up to her and the rest of the team to find out what happened, and they have to do it fast. Norton Aircraft has an as-yet unsigned huge deal with China on the cards, and everything depends on clearing up this incident, so the pressure's high.To make matters worse, along comes a bunch of journalists who care more about visuals and &quot;how it looks and sounds to the public&quot; rather than actual facts.This is one great thriller from Michael Crichton, and it's one of my personal favorites. The story is paced well, and as usual Crichton &quot;got the science right&quot;. There's a lot of details on the sturcture of an aircraft and some of it's crucial parts. But all that technical gibberish won't make you feel out of place, because it's written so that even a layman would understand. After all, they don't call Crichton &quot;a master storyteller&quot; for nothing.Another notable point of the novel is how Crichton points out the mishandling of information by the American media. This one really makes the media look evil. But I guess it's somewhat true.All in all, this is one of Crichton's best. You can't afford to miss it for anything. Go read it!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"OK, I've got this book figured out. It's about an airliner that suddenly goes into a steep climb, then a dive, another climb, another dive, etc. This is a metaphor for the book!! For a few pages you can't wait to turn the next one, then the book goes into a sudden stall. Wait, the plot is moving again! Nope, false alarm, turn out the light and go to sleep.The main character is Casey Singleton, a modern super-businesswoman and super-divorced-mom. Luckily for her, though, she never has to worry about any work-family conflicts, because Crichton makes sure Casey's daughter is shipped off to stay with her scummy father for the whole book. Once in a while, Casey will gaze at her daughter's picture for a sec just to make sure the reader doesn't forget Casey still has a child. It might have been interesting to keep the kid at home and have Casey deal with problems faced by real moms (kids barfing down the hallway at 2 AM, for instance), but no, this would mean Casey would have to choose between work and family.Casey, like all characters in the book, are worn cliches you've met a thousand times - the flaky sound engineer, the cheating ex-husband, the sneaky double agent, the violent and stupid union employees, the macho test pilot, the greedy boss, the slimy TV producer. Few of them are developed enough to care about. At one point Casey is pushed out of an airplane (sitting in a hanger, unfortunately) and it looked like things would get interesting, but I'd forgotten about that darn safety net under the plane.There's a lot of technical info and jargon in the book that I, as something as a techno-nerd myself, found sort of interesting. Still, one gets sick of reading for the thousandth time how Casey turns to the newbie next to her and explains &quot;You see, Bobby, a BOE refers to a Big Old Engine, etc, etc&quot;. It's kind of like watching Mr. Wizard (Ms. Wizard?).The book sputters and starts along, with only Mr. Crichton's storytelling ability keeping you going, until the end, which is anticlimactic and unexciting. You feel like flipping back through the pages and asking &quot;Did I miss something? That was it?&quot;Check out his book from the library, if you like Crichton. Otherwise steer clear - you'll probably see it real soon a a mini-series"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I've read a number of novels by Michael Crichton, and he really does his research, making somewhat complex subjects understandable to most readers. Whether it's cloning and dinosaurs (\\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"The Lost World\\"), sexual harassment (\\"Disclosure\\"), or even quantum physics (\\"Timeline\\"), he can really hold your attention while you learn a thing or two. Too bad he can't come up with a well thought out plot to go with any of his \\"topics du jour\\".\\"Airframe\\" is a good example of this. As a result of reading this novel, I know more than I ever would about the building of airplanes, the operation of airlines, and how well (or badly) commercial airliners are maintained. Crichton also gives us a glimpse of how the FAA and its European equivalent, the JAA, operate, especially in the post regulation climate that we live in. If you read this book before taking your next flight, you may end up wanting to drive or ask if you can store a parachute in the overhead compartment.Casey Singleton is the Vice President of Quality Assurance for Norton Airplanes, a builder of commercial jets. One of the Norton planes encounters a serious problem in flight resulting in several deaths and a number of injuries. Casey is named to the team investigating this occurrence. In addition to her seeming role as a one woman investigator of the incident, or at least the only one with a clue of what to do, she is appointed to be the person talking to the media, even though the company has people whose job this is.What Casey doesn't know is there are sharks in the water. She is surrounded by evil executives, evil co-workers, evil union types, and that old stand by, the evil media, this time in the person of a story producer for a national, \\"60 Minutes\\" type, TV news magazine. People are out to destroy her professionally and personally or otherwise advance their interests or their careers. With all of this going on around her, there's only one thing she can do.Run, Casey Run!And she does. She runs here, and she runs there. She runs all over the Norton plant. She dodges one group of stalkers by climbing down a cable. Another group throws her off the ill fated airliner, now in a Norton hanger for testing, but fortunately she lands in some netting. (Whew! That was close.) Clues indicating that nothing is what it appears to be just drop into her lap, but it takes her awhile to put them together. (Well, long enough for Crichton to have typed a sufficient number of words to put \\"Airframe\\" out as a novel.)Then there are the coincidences. One character's has an evil plan to get control of and then wreck the company. Fortunately for this person, the airliner event happens through a series of freak occurrences, too silly to have been planned, right when he's about to make his move. Then a second, non-fatal incident involving the same airplane model happens THE VERY NEXT DAY. (How's that for timing?) Then, Al Pacino (no, really) walks out on an interview for the TV news magazine, and, in desperate need of a new story, the producer gets wind of the problems at Norton. If that's not enough, the producer, only caring about making a big ratings splash, chooses to completely ignore the fact that most of her sources are clearly lying to her, not credible, or pushing their own agendas, while she dismisses factual information that contradicts the story she wants to tell. Wow, the main villain couldn't have planned it better. (And trust me, little that happens here is planned by anyone. Everything just seems to happen on its own.)I did like the Casey Singleton character. She is bright, imaginative, and courageous. She has to be. She has been set up to \\"take the fall\\". In the end she outsmarts everyone, saving her job and the company. She almost saves this mess as well, but that would have been too much to ask of anyone.I realize that Crichton is a very popular and successful writer. However, \\"Airframe\\" is not a very well thought out novel. I knew what was going to happen long before it did and the cause of the original incident was so obvious by the middle of the book that I almost didn't feel the need to finish it.Finally, the use of a series of coincidences as a means to advance the plot is a symptom of lazy writing. It strikes me as odd that Crichton clearly put so much time and effort into researching the airplane industry and so little into creating a story that follows a logical series of events."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I found Airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation. I was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary (i.e. the media). That being said, I was not the least disappointed.In his typical style, Crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain English. I learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry - it was fascinating. He also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals - which was fun (and somewhat ironic from the creator of \\"ER\\")!The book is fast paced and reads like a movie - which I am sure is no coincidence by Crichton ;) The main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her. There are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages.In summary I would not say that this is Crichton's best work, but it is surely a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was an extremely fast read. It was a book I enjoyed, but most likely won't remember. The characters are appealing but instantly forgettable. The author wisely chose not to dwell on relationships in the novel, but there still seemed to be remains of previous, more romantically oriented plotlines that weren't removed. It seems to be written as an attack on the sensationalism of the modern news media. The book includes many sequences detailing the workings of a commercial jet-liner that are vaguely reminiscent of an early Clancy work in their detail. Well written but not worth paying much for."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Try putting this one down!! With all the goings-on in today's airplane industry, this timely and timeless book captures the essence of big business and the desire for coverup. But is that it? Another airplane disaster under mysterious circumstances - but this one just doesn't smell right. Reporters, management, blue and white collar workers.... our heroine must get to bottom of this - for everyone involved, including her own safety. Who is right about this one? Outstanding writing!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I would define Crichton as a cerebral author. All his books are written as though he is an expert in whatever subject matter the story revolves around: DNA and cloning in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, deep sea salvage operations and time travel in &quot;Sphere&quot;, the intricacies of an 1800's criminal mind in &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, and now flight dynamics and airplane construction in &quot;Airframe&quot;. True to Crichton's style, &quot;Airframe&quot; starts off running with a catastrophic airplane accident happening within the first few pages, and he leaves the reader guessing until the last page--literally.The story is a successful mix of well developed characters, suspenseful intrigue and mystery, and enough detail to allow you to understand the complexties of airframe manufracturing without overwhelming you with too much detail. I will not summarize the plot since the book is too much fun to start reading it with prior plot details. Just make sure you don't mind neglecting the rest of your life because once you pick up this book, you won't want to put it down.I lopped off one star because the middle of the story wandered around a bit with one of the side stories focusing on a Union protest and teamster-type threats directed at the protagonist that was supposed to add an element of danger that wasn't really needed. Other than that one minor misstep, this tale is expertly written with all the Crichton-detail that make his books so enjoyable and (gasp) educational! You will not be disappointed with this one.(On a personal note, I particularly enjoyed the way he accurately portrayed TV journalists. Having worked in the TV news field for five years, I can assure you that his depiction is right on the money.)"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"An international flight from Hong Kong to Denver experiences a phenomenon that leaves 3 dead and 52 injured. What happened?Although the technical information was new and interesting, and Casey is a compelling character, this book was not terribly entertaining. Besides Casey, people did not have credible motives for doing the things they did. The plot didn't really add up and the big 'reveal' was something I figured out about halfway through. Accurate portrayal of the media as fear mongers and not interested in the truth but what plays well as a visual was refreshing. A lot of the technical jargon was mystifying and the explanations for it were either non-existant, or unnecessary. I mean, times that I probably could have figured it out myself, there was an awkward interjection of explanation, and there was never an explanation when I was mystified.Also included were many lines of reports in binary that really seemed to just fill pages.I will always keep an eye on the slats on all future airplane rides..."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It's too bad that the rating scale does not include negative numbers that would be more appropriate for the book. This novel was thin, boring, senseless, elementary reading level, and all-around awful.

Spare yourself"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I'm very disappointed, the plot is really weak, looks like a cheap 2 hours TV special. The final chapter is Ridiculous. Don't waste you money/tim"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A pseudo-researched story with a clear goal: fill the pockets of Mr. Crickton while the interest of the public opinion about air safe is hot (the vulture come always from the sky!).Pseudo-researched because the reported facts didn't happen in the context pictured in the book , for instance, not all happened in the same accident and almost all happened in America and not abroad.But this is one case more, of the Super-ball syndrome, as we call it in Europe -- the Americans think that the rest of the world stops to see the Super-ball final :-). Another definition could be: they think that who is competent is American the others are all a bunch of incompetents. Despite the recent tragic examples of American incompetence on air safe, Mr. Crickton choose a Portuguese company (AIR Portugal) to illustrate incompetence and, of course, the hero was an American girl. For your information, the magazine AirWeek rates the AIR Portugal as one of the safest companies in the world and much of the credit goes to the maintenance services of the company. These services make the maintenance of airplanes for Air France, Lufthansa, Federal Express, NATO,...Finally I must say that, I don't understand the success of this guy, with banal stories written in a pseudo-informed style. The only explanation I found was given by Alan Bloom's book The Close of The American Mind."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton is an author whose work is well admired and respected by not just myself, but readers of all ages all across the country. His ability to create page-turning suspense and devle into interesting topics of science-fiction are well noted in books like \\"Sphere\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", and \\"The Lost World.\\"\\"Airframe,\\" however, seemed like a day-off from storytelling and a long excersize in expressing well researched knowledge in the airline business. Crichton seems to miss the narrative pull and focuses largely on showing-off his ability as an expert in research. The characters are far from interesting, the story is hard to find (if there is one) and nothing about it is shocking, interesting, exciting, or inspiring. I felt like Crichton was not even interested in this novel himself and wrote it more because he felt he had to with his extraordinary knowledge in the subject.Bottom line is if you're looking for a book of facts and numbers and words you can't understand, this is for you. But if you're looking for a fun, exciting, suspensful, and engaging novel, look towards Crichton's other remarkable works. This is just not it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"With &quot;air-rage&quot; on the rise, novels about air catastropes will always be topical. Topical books are usually meant to sell themselves and &quot;Airframe&quot; - with its flat charachters, by-the-numbers plot and paper-thin moralizing - offers nothing but slim reading waiting for a headline for back-up.The titular fuselage belongs to the N-22, an airliner designed by Norton Aerospace, one of those bland and vague corporate entities typical to Michael Crichton novels. N-22 jets are known for their safety, especially in America - though this might have more to do with the fact that much of the N-22's competition is European. Aero-chauvinism vanishes when a US-bound N-22 encounters inexplicably severe turbulence, and a conspiracy of media, lawyers and assorted, uncredited &quot;experts&quot; descend on Norton like vultures. &quot;Airframe&quot; could have been a dramatic vehicle to explore such issues as corporate accountability, gov't regulation of industry, products liability, and the media, but Crichton never gets anywhere near that destination. The Norton Aero experts are his heroes, protecting the corporate world from the scum of special interests. Crichton saddles them without a shred of self-doubt in the quality of their product, thus removing what would have been a rich source of dramatic and moral tension. The enemy (bottom-feeding lawyers, self-proclaimed experts and the amoral media types that give the other two their voice) are not only undeniably amoral and dim, but ugly. We almost see the warts.Having created a force with no chance of reader sympathy, Crichton seems to rail against media manipulation of commerical flight, but it all sounds hollow. Much is made of the DC-10 which was grounded temporarily following a string of disasters in 1979. Though the DC-10 was eventually cleared to fly, Crichton insists that McDonnell never sold another. I'm suspicious because a) living near an airport, I used to see plenty of DC-10's until recently when they were phased out - nearly two decades after the grounding and about the same time as the DC-10's competitor, the L-1011; b) DC-10's market misfortunes (if they existed) would have occurred when airline deregulation created dozens of new airlines flying short routes with small planes. The small 737, once a niche aircraft, is now commercial aviation's most popular jet, typifying market erosion for all big planes. Figures show the DC-10, for its perceived faults, outsold its competition, the L-1011; and c) if the DC-10's misfortunes resulted from public mistrust in its construction or design, lack of confidence should have spread to all McDonnel planes. Instead, McDonnell continued selling planes and did well enough with smaller planes like the MD-80 to try their hand at a next-generation airliner, the MD-11. Crichton mentions the DC-10 like a mantra, so pat and without a sound of dissent, it's almost impossible to take at face value.Like a badly damaged jetfighter, &quot;Airframe&quot; bleeds energy quickly once its apparent that the author has less interest in aviation than the media's sway over America. In fact, the book is so divorced from its high-flying mascot, that it could have been written about any product - like toys or appliances. In that respect, &quot;Airframe' recalls the little-seen &quot;Missile Lords&quot; (Sutton, 1963), a novel about the high-stakes world of ICBM's, and the companies that build them. So focused on the corporate and marketing minds behind the fictitious ICBM, that the missile itself and its explosive power are never fully realized and the company might as well have been trying to sell the air force some mopeds. &quot;Aiframe&quot; could also have been written about Mopeds until media attention over TWA 800 required adding some chapters and judiciously use find/replace to swap mopeds for airliners. Though Crichton seems to fight this with some thin prose praising the autonomy of the plane makers, it's thin. This is especially because &quot;Airframe&quot;'s heroes are almost as divorced from aviation as the N-22's enemies. Though extolling the pilots, none of the book's main charachters are airline pilots, and the band of N-22 partisans who know anything about airplanes exist only to cry fowl at the media and demonstrate the stupidity of those without the author's sense of flight. This is not Craig Thomas' &quot;A Different War&quot;, where the hero redeems the suspected airliner by flying it. The flight in one simple chapter of that book is enough to banish the mopeds. Crichton's attentions on airliners, in contrast, is no different from that of the dim laymen he populates his books with - as vehicles.To remind readers - and perhaps himself - that his book is about something expensive and exotic, but beyond his grasp to put in its element, Crichton tosses in his usual suspects - corporate intrigue: darker forces are at work here, as evidenced here by Bob Richman, the plucky heroine's unwanted intern. Richman is dead-meat the minute (or page) he appears. His blue-chip upbringing, top-flight education, high-priced (and foreign! ) car and his youth are enough to raise warning flags. At times, I thought Crichton was on the verge of a surprise that would not only redeem the sleazy ivy-leaguer but confound his readers as well, primed for the brat's fall. Alas, &quot;Airframe&quot; remains blatantly obvious (the brat's name is the perfect example - I guess &quot;Richboy&quot; would have been too obvious), as averse to turbulence as a well designed airliner. Alas again that Crichton, while heaping scorn on the media fails to realize that his corporate cloak&amp;dagger undermines his bloated polemic - the media's hatchet job would never have progressed without help from Norton's inside enemies. But that patent flaw in Crichton's argument probably made sense when the book was about mopeds. If you've got to read Crichton, read the first Jurassic, the Andromeda Strain or Sphere. If you've got to read about flying, pick up Coonts or Craig Thomas. Keep this airframe grounded."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was totally lacking in imagination. The characters were underdeveloped, and the plot was rather uninteresting. I would rather recommend a couple of his other books, &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Timeline&quot; over this poor novel."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have read every book Crichton has written and I consider him my favorite author, but this book was a massive dissapointment. Totally mundane and unimaginative, I got the impression that he was only writing this book because it was on a subject that people have been interested in lately -- air safety -- and he was hoping to make some money off it. The plot was exceptionally dull. Basically Crichton tells us of a mid-air incident in which a plane suffers extreme turbulance. Right from the very start, one of the character's suggests that this is caused by a problem with the auto-pilot. Then the main character spends the whole novel trying to figure out what happened and in the end she finds out that yes, indeed it was a problem with the autopilot. What was Crichton thinking when he came up with this? And am I the only person that saw incredible similarities between this and Disclosure (both involve a small company designing a great product with hopes of hooking a larger company into merging with them. And a third company who doesn't want the merger to happen tries to derail it by attempting to show that the new product is not any good). I would have given this book zero stars had that been an option."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It's been a while since I read this book, but I do remember thoroughly enjoying every aspect of it.

It will especially appeal to aviation buffs. It is entertaining and informative; I learned a lot about aircraft design, handling, and flight theory, but in a thoroughly enjoyable way.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Certainly not Crichton's best, but a good read nonetheless.My only real problem is that the lead character does many things that just don't make sense in a real-world situation.

Only after a friend strongly recommended it did I give it any consideration at all. And even then, I waited until there were no other books on my \\"to read\\" list before buying a copy. Well, I wish I hadn't waited so long. Airframe is a great book!Michael Crichton brings his usual cinematic writing style to Airframe, reinforcing a suspenseful story with a level of technical detail that brings depth and additional interest to the events that take place. And while the book is primarily focused on an investigation into an airplace accident, which may sound dry and uninteresting, the character interactions and intrigue are more than enough to keep the story moving at a steady pace. In fact, there was never a point where I felt the momentum lull.As an added plus, I particularly enjoyed Crichton's portrayal of the news media. I felt that his unforgiving commentary on the motives and methods of television \\"news\\" programs was dead on, and in fact has become even more accurate in the years since he wrote this novel.Kudos to Crichton for this one - I would recommend that anyone read Airframe, and do so before they ruin it by turning it into a movie!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"With this book you will learn some things about airplanes and TV networks, is a good book but I don't recommend to read it in a flight, just kidding, the writer keeps you reading all the time except when he describes the preparation for the people for the TV show and the epilogue, but that is a short chapter, is a good reading."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"In Michael Chrichton's, Airframe, there are two obvious literary devices that prove tobe essential in the novel. The first, setting. Setting is where the story takes place-date andlocation. Airframe takes place just outside Glendale, California. This is important to thedevelopement of the story because it is where the Norton Aircraft Hangar is located. Everythingin this novel revolves around the hangar. It is where complications erect and where conflicts aresolved. The story takes place sometime during the 1990s. One thing that I really liked about thisnovel was being able to peek inside the executive offices of an Aircraft plant, and seeing how they perform in a time of chrisis. Another aspect of the novel and its setting that really appealed to me was seeing the competition that exists in the business world, and more specifically the Airline world. The second literary device that proved to be a foundation of the novel was the authors tone. A &quot;tone,&quot; is described as a manner of speaking or informing. Chrichton's tone throughout Airframe is somewhat unique. If I had to choose one word that describes it, it would be informal. If you were counting, there were numerous references to aerodynamics. I am sure most people will agree, that unless you are thoroughly interested in the field of aerodynamics, you probably did not enjoy this book. I must admit that Chrichton's tone is somewhat confusing, however, his overall writing style impressed me. This is the first Chrichton novel that I have had the chance to read, and I am told his others are very much like Airframe. I learned to look past all of the technical terms and acronyms, and that is why this book was readable to me. Chrichton obviously has a hobby for the subject or just put in a lot of research because at least 10% of this book was compiled of difficult terms. In the end, I found that Airframe was an enjoyable book, after I learned to look past the use of all the aerodyanmic references. I stand by my position of the setting and tone being the foundation of this novel. They definetly proved essential to the story."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"-Michael Crichton, has excelled in this book, he has used his amazing ability to make a story informational as well as compelling at the smae time.

After having read Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, my standards for Crichton's work were pretty high going into this book, but I was not disappointed. While it wasn't as good as Andromeda or Jurassic, it was still a very thought provoking novel that I read pretty much straight through til the end. Even after reading a few Crichton novels, I am still blown away by how much of a genius he is.

AIRFRAME is both interesting and suspenseful. In a few spots the narrative is awkward, but overall it is a first-rate Crichton novel. I would like to say that, before you read AIRFRAME, you should read a suspense novel I read recently that is much better: THE SHAPE by Craig Furnas. It is a page-turning thriller about Nazis trying to take over Peru (but is about much more), and I could not put it down. THE SHAPE gripped me like a sumo wrestler, and would not let go!!

I was very disappointed after reading several other reviews with lines like &quot;it made me think twice about flying.&quot; While &quot;Airframe&quot; is set in the Air Travel industry, the real message of the book deals with the mob mentality of &quot;the people&quot; and how the press manipulates it.

A novel with so much suspense it will glue you to the chair. The way Crichton describes what happened in the cockpit of the plane is extremely clever! This book will have you racking your mind to solve what went wrong!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I found this book to be very intersting. Not only was it a good plot but I found the technical descriptions to very interesting. The book explored issues of air safety such as cut rate airlines, shoddy maintenance and aging aircraft. Another issue was the power of the media, the way it had destroyed the reputation of a good aircraft and was threatening to do it again. This meant the loss of many jobs for no good reason.The book was clearly and concisely written. It even inspired me to read Jurassic Park, which I must admit, I didn't care for."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I always enjoy Crichton books and I was not disappointed with this one. It was fast reading,educational and exciting. Unfortunately, I started reading it while flying from Chicago to San Francisco and almost finished it on the return flight. I will never sit on a plane without my seat belt tightly fastened."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is vintage Michael Crichton. It has lots of technical jargon and great storytelling, precisely the stuff that I admire about Crichton's work. The plot is a little weak, but I don't care. The book has a point. That's what's important."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As I read some of the reviews by the people who have read it I noticed one thing from some of the people. &quot;I think about traveling by air again&quot; if they had read the book they would realize that its people like &quot;Jenifer Malone&quot; who give the business and bad name. You are more likely to be hurt walking from your car to your house than flying an airplane. I am a commercially rated pilot with over 5000 hours and I know many other pilots who have never scene an incedent or an occurance in their life. On the last note this book is a great example of what goes on behind the scenes at a airplane plant."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Nicely done. Concise. Complex plot to a simple explination. Think before you give your kids the keys to your car next time:). I love how MC leaves out alot of scene descriptions, allows my imagination to paint the canvas! His knowledge on his subject always seems to be complete, this novel is no exception."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have read all of Michael Chrichton's books and they just keep getting better. Right after I completed this book, a commercial airline experienced the same problems that this &quot;fictional&quot; airline did! It makes one think twice about air travel. I highly recommend that if you enjoy Michael Chrichton's writing style, that you obtain a copy of this book. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe teaches you a lot about planes and the way they are built, and makes you wonder if you should get on your next foreign carrier, but it doesn't have as much suspense as some of Crichton's other books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to say it only took me three days. I could not put this book down. It's technical information makes it realistic but it's not overwhelming. This book stirred up many emotions (especially anger)at various industries (especially the media) like no other book has before. You get behind the character and feel like you are the one that all of this is happening and you feel what she feels. The best thing about this book is you put a lot together yourself but then the ending is completely different from what you expected. The fact that you see a lot of what actually happened actually stirs up your emotions more. This book has made me a huge fan of Michael Crichton's and I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A good book must include many literary devices, to keep the readers attention and interests in a book. These devices must be used to end up with a good book as the finished product. In Michael Crichton's Airframe, like many of Crichton's other works, it seems as if he gets interested in a topic and says this will make a good book, disregarding most literary and writing devices. In this book Crichton dazzles the reader with superfluous details of the Aircraft industry, but he forgets the use of all-literary terms, but possibly imagery and tone. Crichton lays the story and characters out forgetting character and story development, theme, and nearly all plot structure. The only device he uses well is imagery, and he goes to great extents to use this. Airframe is filled with detail and imagery that makes the reader feel as if they are in the hanger with Casey going through the fuselage checking every wing panel and frame board, but again that's all the story has. This story has cookie cutter characters that don't develop, and are only described in vast detail, and not thought out in the least and a plot that is transparent, and is predictable from nearly the title of the story. The story suffers much from the lack of these key components, but makes up for it somewhat with the meticulous details and tidbits. Tone in most cases, should be used to help the reader better understand the novel, like most literary devices, however tone in this story is negligible, or having a negative affect. The tone in this story is one that you might call casual or informal. This tone doesn't change anything about the other literary devices, but again helping with the descriptions and imagery. Overall this book is lacking many of the devices it needs to be a compelling, well written novel, and instead is a mere thriller that might help one understand more about the aircraft industry along with its people."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is my favorite book by this author. The characters are believable, the plot is vivid, and the ending makes every moment of rapid page turning worth while. Highly recommended to any fan of Crichton's works."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was a great read! The plot gained momentum as it went along and I could not put it down. This is the first time I've read Michael Crichton since The Andromeda Strain very first came out and I will be going for more of the work of this very talented author."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was the best book I've ever read. Crichton at his best. This must be the greatest book he ever wrote. Casey Singleton is a real and believable charicture. The airplane science is engrossing and easy to understand. READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!! GO!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was the best book I've ever read. Crichton at his best. This must be the greatest book he ever wrote. Casey Singleton is a real and believable charicture. The airplane science is engrossing and easy to understand. READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!! GO!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"should admit that the book was gripping - a one sitting read,but one -especially if you are not from US - cannot ignore the racial overtones that are plenty in this book, it sounds more like the author could not resist adding them, because at some places he could have done without qualifying the characters with their racial descent, but he has added it.The author often makes it a point to say that concern for quality and public safety is lacking outside US. but after having worked in the US for some time, i am convinced that most US companies care only for short term gain, and image, just like those TV guys in this novel."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is a great book!! The other reviewers have pretty much said it all, so just press the 'buy now' button and enjoy the best read you'll have in a long, long time."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Cardboard characters, a stilted plot, wooden dialogue...where to begin? When Norton Aircraft VP (of Quality Assurance, no less!) Casey Singleton told another character that the wing spar of a particular plane was \\"two hundred feet long - almost as long as a football field\\" I knew I was in for a rough ride. Doesn't anyone edit this kind of dreck?Aside from an amusing take on the media (particularly a TV newsmagazine reporter obviously meant to be Mike Wallace), the book slogs along for 431 pages before coming to a tepid conclusion.I'm a sucker for books on airplanes and the aviation industry in general but I can't recommend this half-hearted effort."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I opend it. It had arrived, finally after the long 24hour wait. I was shaking and read it that night. Since then i have begun my search for a better book, but believe me there is none under the sun of this timid world (at least in its genre). Michael Crichton simply blows all expectations. I thought that i would fall in love with all of his books. But NO just this one! 100% action packed fun and for those folks that didn't enjoy it there's tonnes of books from Michael Chrichton!! Enjoy.This review is subjest to your taste in books. Do not blame me for ruining a perfectly placid evening."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Okay, now I have read 10 Crichton novels, Andromeda Strain and Jurrasic Park are his best. But since JP, his novels are nothing more than movie scripts (well, JP was too, but it at least had a lot to chew on, no pun intended). I saw Disclosure, and then read the book, and they are exactly the same, IT WAS A SCRIPT, NOT A NOVEL! But Airframe is more on the line of Rising Sun. Rising Sun had a lot to say about Japanese business, and I must say that I learned from it, but it made the characters secondary, they're cardboard cutouts. And the same goes for Airframe. (Don't get me started on The Lost World.) I guess one of Crichton's trademarks has to be shallow chracters that are just talking heads, along with his fast pace reading. The hardcover looks to be about 350 pages, but that is decieving. This could have easily been 250 or 225 because there are so many blank or half-filled pages. And that reminds me, what is with the line breaks in the middle of a scene? At least in other novels I have read, authors use those as a means to change scenes or locations, but in Airframe they are put right in the middle of a conversation! Actually I think they might be there so readers can have permission to take a potty break as maby times as possible. However,I will admit that I am glad I learned some stuff about how the airframe industry works, but does it have to be so shallow? Do we really have to have the work stoop so low so more people will read it and Crichton will get more royalties? I am sad because this book and all but 3 written by Michael will be forgotten in 50 years time because of their slipshod need to be in the here and now. He does have a talent, but I think it was lost in the ER."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I found this text to be dull and predictable. The continued reference to structure, by part number or something similar, was extremely boring. You could sense what was coming next for the characters.I have read every Crichton novel and this one is at the bottom of the heap. Save your money. This may have been done for bucks rather than bounce. Airframe needs to be grounded."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"this is not my face; i am wearing a mask. it has 3 eye holes but i only have 2 eyes. i think that the 3rd hole is for my nose but i don't beleive in that kind of stuff because it scares me; also i am scared of television shows beginning with &quot;r&quot;. my calculator is broken because i took it swimming. joy comes only from nbc(national air and space center) the cat is sitting on denise's neck. i think it just died."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton has always excelled at mixing his intense research into often mysterious subjects with dramatic, even melodramatic, plots. ANDROMEDA STRAIN told us more about germs and stuff than we wanted to know, but it was gripping. JURASSIC PARK told us a bit more about dinosaurs and stuff than we needed, but it was a good, old-fashioned monster show. DISCLOSURE probably delved more into specifics of harassment law than we needed to enjoy the book, but that gave it an authentic, journalistic edge.In AIRFRAME, I'm sorry to say, the jargon is almost all there is. After an exciting opening chapter, it takes almost the entire book for anything of true interest to happen. We follow Casey, our lead character, from one meeting after another with a bunch of faceless engineers who are going over the plane that was involved in a mishap, trying to find the cause. Once in awhile, her life is in jeopardy, but Crichton writes the technical jargon with the same intensity, speed and emphasis that he does the plot twists, so that the entire book feels the same. It's not a plot peppered with authentic detail...it's a textbook occasionally lightened with some fiction.Crichton is not the greatest writer (from a literary standpoint) anyway, but his books are so cinematic and crammed with plot that you can still burn through and feel entertained with ease. AIRFRAME is an exception...a clunky book that never takes flight."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Admittedly, I was dismayed at the storyline for Airframe. Having read and been hooked on other Crichtons such as The Lost World, Jurassic Park, and Timeline, I found Airframe to be one of his lesser works of fiction.As usual, Crichton backs up his story with scientific gobbledegook. If he doesn't thoroughly research his topic before writing it, he does an excellent job of making things up from what he already knows. Airframe is no different; it contains a plethora of technical terms, most likely in regular use within the aerospace industry.I found the book frustrating, in much the way as one finds with an Agatha Christie novel: the plot is shrouded in mystery because one simple fact is concealed until the final stages of the book. There were also doubtful segments in the book, things that would never occur in real life. For example, the \\"common workers,\\" the engineers in Norton aircraft factory, seem to want to murder a senior member of staff (Casey Singleton, the hero of the story). In fact, she knows about their dramatic tendencies even before they are focused on her. Like anyone would stay in a job like that!Despite these shortfalls, the book is entertaining, and had me gripped for some long nights, albeit to find out what the final mystery was (don't worry - I won't spoil it). And, as usual, the scientific side is well explained to the average-intelligence human being!But in the words of Simon Callow, \\"a distinctly average performance\\" by a superb author. Better luck next time, Mike."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton must have been on vaction when he worked on this novel. The characters are two dimensional and the story is boring but plausable. Not one of Crichtons best works by far! Not representive of the great writer that he is. Other earlier works show his superb writing style much more elegantly than this work. I am still a Crichton fan however this is not one of his best works."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As an avid reader, I was very reluctant to pick up this book. I had received it as a gift from my parents when I was younger. I was a reader, but not really into Michael Crichton at the time, more so into John Grisham and the likes. I knew Crichton had written Jurassic Park and Congo but that was about all. I was in my early teens when Airframe came out so his novels like Disclosure and Rising Sun were not on my radar being very adult-geared. Anyway, after about four years of sitting on my shelf I decided to pick this book up and read it. Wow...Jurassic Park, Sphere, Congo, The Lost World...Airframe? Airframe is absolutely as different from any of the typical Crichton sci-book thrillers as you can get. Does it mean it is bad and his fans will not love it? Ha! No. This book is hard to review, because the plot is very basic. Young woman who is an executive in an airline company is getting investigated about an airline disaster. It is so much more than this. She reminds you of the strong, single dame in the movies you see a lot. Which, on a side note, I cannot see how this was not made into a movie instantly having the most easiest of all his books to be filmed other than Disclosure and Rising Sun. (Ashley Judd gets my vote). Anyway, Airframe isn't a high-octane thrill ride like Timeline or Jurassic Park but it really really shows that Crichton has more up his sleeve than science fiction. This mystery thriller ranks up there as one of his best. For all you Grisham fans, let me put it like this: Airframe to Michael Crichton is like The Testament to John Grisham; they both go outside their general genre's boarders in these books.In fact, like I said, the four years it took me to read this book...well, lets just say since those four years I've become the biggest Michael Crichton fan. I own the majority of his books in hardcover and have read most of them multiple times. So, thanks Airframe. If you are looking to get into Michael Crichton take my testimony. This book pulled me in. The story development, the twists, the suspense, the...everything! This book does pretty much everything right. I enjoyed it, I know you will."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"At first when I heard this book was about an airplane crash, I was reluctant to read it. I decided to pick up the book and while I was reading it, I was surprised at how interesting it could actually be, despite the fact that I am petrified of airplanes. This book is great for everyone. I learned a lot about airplanes, for example what slats and proximity sensors are. The storyline is very realistic and the dialogues seem like they could actually be heard outside on a regular day. This is Michael Crichton at his best. It is such a great book!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Over the years, Michael Crichton has evolved from being an excellent author of the scientific thriller into being an author who is also highly accurate in often acute social critiques. As he did once before in Rising Sun, Michael Crichton takes aim at the corporate world and the media in this harrowing novel about a plane crash and how the manufacturer and the media became involved in it.Casey Singleton is a vice president at Norton, an aircraft manufacturer that has built up a reputation for quality and safety. At this time, Norton is preparing a multi-billion dollar aircraft sale to an Asian airline, which would help to boost the company, which has fallen on hard times lately. Also, workers at Norton's plant in California have heard that the company might possibly be outsourcing or closing down some plants, costing thousands of jobs and elevating tensions between the white-collar people who run the company and the blue-collar people who work there. The task is forced upon Casey to deal with percolating worker attitudes while maintaining a positive face to the media to ensure that the aircraft deal does not go sour.Then a plane crash involving one of Norton's aircraft occurs. Casey must then deal with the aforementioned troubles and the plane crash, where she is now thrust into the spotlight as the public face of the tragedy and must find out what went wrong on Transatlantic Flight 545. As she delves closer to the answer of what went wrong, she realizes that she is being set up to take the fall. Casey must then race against time to find out what went wrong and to save her job and life.Michael Crichton once again summons all of his formidable literary skill to write a novel that speaks not only of the unbridled nature of the press, but of the competitive world of corporations."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is a difficult book to rate.On one hand, Michael Crichton's Airframe is a page-turning book. So long that I haven't spent one whole day sitting and just reading one book. It captures me from the first page and turn more excited till the end.I suppose Crichton have done a lot of research about the commercial airplane, this informative detail is added in the scene of this book and being a crucial part to get reader understanding more for all the technical stuff in the book. Very well-done.On the other hand, I found that there is not so many impressive feeling left much after finish reading this book. I don't have any intention to re-read this book which I think it pretty weird for me. Not like &quot;Congo&quot;, &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; or even &quot;Travel&quot;, all these books I always pick them up and re-read from time to time. At least, the action scenes in this book is very dull. Overall, I give this book 4 stars, this is an exciting and a good choice for anyone. Make sure that you have free time before open this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"i thought this was a fast pased thrilling novel, it holds ypur annention well its smart but not complicated all in all a really good read"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Just a word of advice - don't read this just before or during a flight - you may just want to get out and walk. Thorougly enjoyed the book in spite of all the chills and goosebumps it caused."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton's novel Airframe delivers entertainment and knowledge in droves.It is the tale of an aircraft accident and the subsequent exploitation and manipulation of the media. That is the main point of the book, is that the media is not interested in what actually happened, what actually caused the crash or accident, but in what sells: fear. Airframe is a suspenseful novel, utilizing high tech knowledge and corporate secrets and greed to propel and interesting tale that is more investigation than spectacle. If you are looking for dinosaurs on parade, this is not that book, but if you're looking for top-flight fiction from a master, check out Airframe. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton's novels are usually hit and miss for me but I always like them even if they don't excite me. Airframe was one of the ones that, for me, read like an incredibly lengthy example of what could go wrong in an airplane manual. It contains tons of information on the workings of airplanes and how to fly them and, thankfully, I am fascinated by things like this. If I was one of those people who do not care at all about how things work, I would have hated this book for its incredibly (almost amazingly) anti-climactic ending. I am not giving anything away here. If you have read a few Crichton books you should be use to it. I love the effort he puts into it but I always get the impression that he is a much better researcher than an actual writer. Airframe has a good cast of characters and we know easily which ones to like and which ones to hate, and a good mysterious quality with some action, but overall it is like a plain ride itself. It rises quickly, levels off for a long while, and then drifts down safely with hardly a bump as it touches the runway. The plain is not high-jacked, the pilot is not drunk, there is maybe just an obnoxious baby screeching in the background and your curiosity of why no one will shut it the hell up is the most interesting thing on the flight."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The chapters are pretty short so the pages turn quickly. It is, as others have pointed out, a very good overview of the airline manufacturing industry and even the news industry. The characters are very 1 dimensional but I found myself really wanting to know what caused the incident in the end.I love to travel, but HATE to fly. Strangely, this made me feel more confident in the metal tube with wings that hurls me from place to place at mach .8."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton knows how to write a page-turner. Yet in this case, it's analogous to eating Doritos. You know they're not great food, and after the first few, they're not even that tasty...you just can't stop. An hour later, after you've eaten the bag, you definitely don't feel all that great.Characters are stereotypes and flat as paper. We don't really learn what makes these people tick. Plot is relatively predictable. If the whole cast of characters crashed in the plane most readers probably would not feel a bit of loss. The only characters that we may feel some empathy with, the young family in the first scene, are disposed of and never referred to again. Ironically, Crichton's main thrust here is a criticism of the vapid and substanceless media of commercial television news. And that's pretty much what he delivers up here in print.You'll read it to the end but it's lite stuff. Beach fodder. Put it in the empty bag with the Doritos and coke cans when you're done."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I certainly liked this novel. True, I have a zestful curiosity for learning about aviation -- and this novel packed a punch for that. Still beyond that, I found it a neat thriller drama with an unusual business twist. It mixes media and publicity with big manufacturing, international trade, and government safety monitoring and policing. Different. I could hardly put it down.The only downside I'd say is that maybe a few of the characters seemed a bit too simple, at times like stick figures. All the same, the writing style carried the whole story with verve. It's been nearly three years since I read it, and it seems like just a few months ago. Vivid."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Is the objective. Set against a backdrop of an airline in turmoil.This is a good read. There are some technical aspects, but thankfully Crichton doesn't get too deeply involved in these and keeps his priority to story-telling."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton was a professional. He had a habit of taking topics and creating characters to make it work as a novel.Airframe is about a conspiracy in an industry I know nothing about. Airplane construction. I still don't know much, but I know more now than I did. It is a tale of a single, unsuspecting person being thrust into a slew of scenarios that are beyond them.I advise reading this if you are looking forward to a quick read that doesn't require deep concentration.t"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I'm surprised that at this point there are NO READERS' REVIEWS! There are only reviews from editors and publishers. For those of us who fly ( and I feel that applies to the great majority of us ) AIRFRAME is a ' must ' read.Exciting, engrossing, and as is typical of this wonderful author - an exceptioally well-written book. From the very first page, it's a read that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Excellent book. I made the mistake of reading it before flying to go to a wedding. Noticed a lot of things about the way the plane works that I wouldn't have ordinarilly."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was great. I was not very interested in the topic of airplane crashes so I nearly passed on this one. As it turns out, this book is not really about an airplane crash. It is about corporate greed and power. The fact that the problem was with an airplane is really just part of the setting. As usual Crichton gives plenty of details and creates some interesting characters along the way."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The one thing I have to say about this book. Finish it before you plan on taking your next flight! Or, if you wanna really freak yourself out, start reading it on a transoceanic flight. It was a real page turner..... especially since I read it about a week prior to my first cross ocean trip via air."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I read my first Michael Crichton book, Sphere, around 1994. I followed it with Congo, Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Every single book blew me away. Last fall I read Timeline.. also excellent. Airframe was no exception.I was GLUED to this book. It's written in language anyone can understand. Not too many complicated terms or exotic language twists.I'm not a journalist, or a writer of any sort, so I won't try to summarize the book, but take my word for it... it's a GOOD read!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Thanks to the utterly amazing attention to detail, we can all now fly a plane. Crichton tells us how it gets off the ground, tells us the controls and also gives us a guided tour of the very components. This is astounding! One of my most adored Michael Crichton books, and subsequently one his best, I feel, of all his novels. The beauty of this book, though, has to be the almost anticlimactic ending. What am I saying? I will tell...Take all that the book goes through. The investigation, the characters views, the notions behind what 'could' have gone wrong, and see where the reader ends up? That's right, the simple failure of the 'pilot' to leave the controls to the autopilot. How fantastis is that! To be honest, I was fooled all along, expecting some ground breaking discovery, some hideous revelation. But no, not this book. Oh, no! All the suspense, anticipation and all the direction changes in the plot lead to such a simple solution. Brilliant.This is art in itself. Crichton has exelled himself with this book. He makes the obvious seem somehow beyond us, allowing us to blur our vision with so many ideas that we simply forget what we are really supposed to searching for. If you want a book that will take you wherever it decides to go , then grab this quickly."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It's got strong characters, great plot, many twists, hidden motives and a lot of knowledge. If this book isn't already in the works to become a major motion picture, it should. Full of thrills and suspense. It will keep you guessing and literally prevent you from putting it down once you start it. Another Crichton classic!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When reading a Cricton book I am almost certain to enjoy the reading, and I wasn't let down. If you are looking ror a great novel with a lot of suspense and we keep you turning page after page, I recomend this novel.If you are a first time reader I also recomend Sphere, another great novel by Cricton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is an excellent story about which, like many things, seems like a simple case but is much more complex. An airplane catastrophe causes four deaths and 57 injuries, but what is the problem? Corey Singleton, a Vice President with Norton Aircraft, is assigned with finding out. This is not a mystery novel per se, but you will be wondering too, with anxiety and fascination, while you read this fantastic book. The plot is thick and unexpected, and the resolution is unexpected. The characters leave a little something to be desired, but this is a plot-driven book, and after reading it, you will feel smarter and you will be glad you spent your time reading it. Worth the time."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I love this book! I've read it several times over the past few years, and have recommended it to friends and loved ones.I am a Crichton fan, which may color my views, but this book in particular is very hard to put down, from page 1 to the end. In addition to the behind-the-scenes views of the airline manufacturing industry, and some political and international intrigue, this book offers up some likable protagonists, including Casey Singleton, a well-written, strong heroine.Like many of Crichton's books, this one reads like a screenplay -- you can easily see how next year's summer blockbuster could derive from this book. This one in particular has a few scenes that would tweak the PC police, so it would need a little bit of rewriting before it got past Hollywood's censors. Not much, mind you. And if they make it, I'll be there on opening day to see it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Like most readers of this book, I picked it up in an Airport during a trip this past year. Initially I could not get through the first few chapters and switched my concentration to the In-flight movie instead. Upon my return home I finished reading the book more as a mountain to be conquered than to seek reading pleasure. Perhaps it was my disappointment in the author's knowledge of the aviation industry. I was hoping more for a plot that would center around a commercial airline instead of an aviation manufacturer which no doubt contributed to my disenchantment of this novel.Crichton's writing style and methods of building suspense are indeed noteworthy and if you are a die-hard Crichton fan this is not to be missed. Additionally his knowledge of the Aviation Manufacturing industry is obviously a result of his good research, which makes it delightful and thought provoking. However, if you have no interest in this industry and are not much for suspense I suggest you save the few dollars this paperback will cost you and buy something more suitable to your aviation interest."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Of all Michael Crichton's novels, Airframe has to be one of the best. It was action packed all the way through with factual information added all the way though. You had no clue what he was going to hit you with next and what was going to happen to Casey next. A recomemded book to read if you're interested in Airplanes or Michael Crichton as a writer"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have enjoyed every Crichton book I've ever read, but this one is a poor example of his capability. As another reviewer mentions, I have been contemplating writing a novel myself; I'm positive I can do better than this.I eagerly read through the book, finishing in three short evenings. But I blazed through the bog just *knowing* that Crichton would have a dramatic ending, and would reveal a fantastic reason the plane experienced its ordeal.I won't reveal the &quot;shocking&quot; ending here out of politeness to those who have not read it, but I can assure you it is quite tame. Very, very disappointing. I could sum up the entire plot in two or three sentences, and you would gain nothing more by reading the book (unless you are in the aircraft manufacturing business).Read &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;; it is Crichton at his best: weaving an intriguing, complex story. &quot;Airframe&quot; is indeed an aviation mishap."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next, but I wouldn't read it if you're planning to fly anywhere soon."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I read the book in less than a day during a vacation in Antigua. The informational and technical aspects of the story were easy to understand and comprehend, besides being interesting. Every time I fly I always look at slat deployment. A definate reccommendation!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton has gone above and beyond with this book. He adds mystery, suspense, and twists to the story like none other. Airframe is defenetly worth reading! I give it 2 thumbs up."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I've read just about every Michael Crichton book and this falls into about the middle to bottom range on my favorites list. Plot is just not very interesting and gets to be plain out boring, even on a subject that I find particular interest in. I was disappointed but it is not unbearable."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Love all of Michael Crichton's books, mainly because he mixes current interesting scientific/technical information with a great suspense story. I feel like I &quot;learn&quot; something about a specific topic while being thoroughly entertained. Airframe was one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"About time Crichton had a major female character. Kept me guessing until the end. The last two pages are the best."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Many people say that Airframe is too informational. I disagree. Congo is defienetly way too informational. It is one of the only books by Michael I didn't like. (The other being Eaters Of The Dead). Anyway I found Airframe suspenseful. When Casey recieves the phone calls at her home and then sees the truck outside. Also when she is being chased through the Hangar and other parts of the company. I felt my stomach drop during these scenes. It isn't perfect but still very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton has proven himself a master at writing about a variety of topics from dinosaurs, mass disease, and airline safety. Airframe keeps the readers interest from beginning to end. The book is concise, well written and a good &quot;starter&quot; for someone just discovering the wonderful writings of Mister Crichton"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I don't read very much, but I couldn't put it down! A true suspence thriller, it combines seriousness, humor, and heart-pounding drama into a great book. Highly recommend for people interested with airplanes. Don't be fooled with Crichton's other science fiction books...this one isn't the same. MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I'm really amazed at the flexablity that Crichton shows in his books. I think women would really enjoy this book because the main charater is a women working in a male dominated field."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is great!I am only 21 years old but this book is still great! It starts with a bang! Somthing goes wrong on a air plane but no one knows what happened. Then people are trying to cover up for it and trying to kill people. The book keeps getting intense as you read it. I recommend it to any one who knows how to read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I don't like writing negative reviews, it's a very easy thing to do, but this book was an absolute failure for me. The first ten pages were interesting, then we go through 450 pages of nonsense to come to a rather boring ending. The test thatthis book fails is that you can skip the middle 400 pages and not miss a thing. You might consider doing just that."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I would rate this as the worst book by Crichton. I bought this book with great anticipation but was highly disappointed. The author has used lot of technical/aviation terminology (must have done extensive research). However, the plot never builds up convincingly. There are too many characters and the plot is quite clear in the first 75-100 pages. definitely, if airframe science interests you, this might be good read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is such a good one, I got into trouble for reading it during English class! It is such a cool book, because the plot is a fast one, and since you are asking yourself over and over again &quot;What happened to that plane!!?&quot;, you are tempted read the last chapter, but don't! This book will be very dull if you do!! And about the plot, someone said there is none, but, LOL! (Laugh-out-loud)This book begins in a N-22 widebody airliner just minutes before the pilot begins to lose control of the plane. What plot could be faster than that?? This plot is very identifyable also. And so, after this incident happens, 2 people are left dead and many other are seriously injured. People are giving the N-22 aircraft a bad rap, when they probably shouldn't, because, after all, was it the plane, or pilot error? And so, the Norton company who makes the aircraft, needs to prove that their plane is safe. But first, they must find out what happened inside that plane the day of the incident. Ok, enough jabber. Go get the book and start reading it. Now!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book started off interesting and had a well-considered plot and concept but it carried on too long. When an interested reader picks up the book in a store it seems to be very interesting but it was a let down. Crichton lacked interest in the middle of the book and I started to no longer want to finish the book. The ending is a surprise and it is something that a Crichton fan will enjoy. But for the first time Crichton lacked interest in one of his stories which was really surprising. It's a book that you can read if you don't mind long amounts of time with nothing resolved. And if that wasn't enough, the technical terms and abreviasions of companies and government branches make the book at times boring and hard to follow. So if you're in a mood to pick a book that is not fast paced, it's yours ! I guess the saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' stands true to this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I think this is a very good book. You don't really know what is happening until the end. There is just one thing to do: READ IT!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Ranging from dcumentary to fiction this book can only be characterised as a technological thriller. Crichton masters to this kind of books but we are going to see where he lacks. The book certainly is not an adventure, neither a charac- ter driven adventure since he presents to us a lot of these characters, but only on the surface and he takes them back and forth to a non stop action, putting them to cope with different situations, something that diffuses the attention of the reader, since these actions are not dense, while certainly are branched around a central idea, his plot. And here, the plot is not a mystery, it's straightforward, while Crichton in some places is very much expected and in some other places (few but well placed) unexpected. He also exaggerates a lot (e.g a handycam that is bouncing all over but never destroyed, his he- roes become comics superheores, justifications that are too simple, etc). As to characters we said that are surface attributed and not well placed, neither delved into and the book never becomes the brain-psychology type that a real novel requires. Crichton is still scripting, something that means a fast book, with tempos that are climaxing towards the end. The only real offer of the book is the documenary side of the aviation technology/manufacturing, where it really hits bullseye. You're gonna learn somethings. Narration is again simple and not literary, as we are used by the author and the scenes flow without any hinder. The book still becomes intense and this makes it an interesting reading, but not a real novel and not not a book for readers that expect much. It could be more dense, it could be more dramatised (I wonder how a man that writes/creates ER can not put that hind itno his books), less exaggerated. Still a fair reading and obviously a real Crichton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Assume novel. I literally was thinking about it day and night, wondering when I could get some time aside to keep reading this book. I can't imagine anyone not loving this one..."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As an aerospace industry worker, I found the subject matter quite interesting. I expected the story to be about counterfeit airplane parts, but it went in another direction. Unfortunately. The ending was a real let-down. All in all, not a bad read"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"In Michael Crichton's new book, Airframe, he takes his story in a different direction that all of his other books. He shows the audience how the media can ruin the reputation of a large company. He shows how simply it can be done and how other comanies prey on this opportunity to put that company out of business. He has interwoven action and thrilling suspense with media and legalities. It is a must read for any fan of John Grisham books, while not directly dealing with legal matters, the book deals with liability and malice. The last 50 pages of the book are excellent page turners and the book has a nice twist at the end"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I saw what this book was going to be about I decided I was going to hate it. I loved his previous works such as Jurassic Park, and Sphere, but I was sure that this was just some sort of sell-out book, a I'll-just-write-what's-going-to-be-popular book. Boy, was I wrong. In an well devised mystery, Crichton leads us through the tribulations of determining the reason for an airplane crash. Personally, I don't even like airplanes, but somehow Crichton got my attention and sucked me into his story. While some might say the characters were weak, I think that they were not weak, but merely took a backseat to the story, which was so intense and riviting I stayed up all night reading it. Amazed and thrilled with the conclusion of the book, I tucked my tail between my legs and faced all the people I told I would hate the book and fessed up: I loved it!

However, it was just better than average. The book was also quite short. Crichton started a new chapter every time the scene changed, almost like he was writing a screenplay. Some of the &quot;chapters&quot; were only several paragraphs long. This created quite a bit of blank page space. With normal segmentation the book would only be about 225-250 pages. My recommendation is that if you must read the book, check it out of the library. Or wait for the TV movie, I doubt Hollywood will bite"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A must read for Crichton fans and anyone curious about thecommercial aviation industry. Crichton reminds you that theworld and reality is a complicated place.The incident aboard a Norton N-22 airliner, ultimatelykilling four people and injuring 56, and the subsequentinvestigation, is not the real story. Crichton merely usesthe incident as a framework to skewer electronic journalismand the corrosive effects of television. The media used toclosely mirror reality, pontificates one minor character.But thanks to television, things are reversed: &quot;Now, television*is* reality.&quot; And our drab everyday lives just don't measureup. Interesting theme coming from the producer of &quot;ER.&quot;Well, nothing really new here. &quot;Airframe&quot; is a quick read andyou'll learn a lot about the politics and intracacies of commercialaviation.

I was interested in the characters, and that's the only reason I finished the book. I was totally lost and couldn't care less about all the technical jargon Mr. Crichton used.

Her struggle to do what is right in the face of threats, 18 hour days, and corporate manipulation is even more heroic when the reader realizes how much she has given up in her personal life.&quot;Airframe&quot; is a well-written book that will keep you up all night reading and will certainly change your view of airline travel. A note of caution: Read this book while your feet are on the ground."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I like the fact that most of Crichton's books have the action start on page 3. Very dramatic.

A movie from this book would probably not reflect the intensity of the personal fight as portrayed in the novel. A very realistic story. Strongly recommended on long flights over the Pacific Ocean."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Upon first reading a brief synopsis of this book, I honestly thought it seemed a rather boring story line, especially for a master like Crichton...\\"A book about turbulence on an airplane?\\" I thought.

He never fails to entertain.His works are always thought-provoking, and so well written and researched as to almost make the \\"unbelievable\\" seem well within the realm of possibility.This particular work could IS quite possible.

The heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards. But as the jeopardy increases, the guards aren't there.

But he's a great storyteller and keeps you turning the page while surprisingly giving lots of info on how airplanes work.Potentially offensive material: Fair amount of strong language"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is an excellent book. A aircraft manufacturing company is under severe media pressure because of a mid-air accident involving its star product, a wide-body passenger aircraft, the N-22. The accident kills and injures many passengers, and does not get explained until the end of the story. The story's heroine Casey Singleton, Vice President for Quality Assurance, is under pressure to get to the bottom of the accident, because what looks like caused it is a problem with the wing slats that has happened several times in the past. At the same time, the company is negotiating a large N-22 order from China, and the American media is threatening to trash the plane as a deathtrap, putting the China order, and the survivability of the company, in jeopardy. There is also a management faction within the company who are quite prepared to help the media to wreck the company for personal gain, and a union faction prepared to use violence to see that they don't. It's a great plot, with good characters, and you have to read the book to see how all this works out.Two excellent features stand out. One is the author's research into the aircraft industry. It is excellent and very interesting. I particularly liked how he describes the importance of the wing manufacturing process, with statements like: 'but the wings are a work of art'. The other excellent feature is his illustration of the power of the media to destroy what is good, for no other reasons than achieving a 'good story', or acting out some unfounded anti-business prejudice. They have this power, the author appears to argue, because they have too many rights, and too little accountability. For me, this is reminiscent of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", where honest industrialists are devastated by corrupt politicians and the media. In \\"Airframe\\", the author is probably exaggerating the negative media forces a little (at least I hope so) for the sake of the plot, but he sure does a convincing job.This is one of the author's best books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have just finished reading Airframe by Micheal Crichton. I have read several of his other books and I think this is one of his best yet. The way he keeps you guessing and makes you want to keep reading is awesome. Crichton develops the main character, Casey Singleton, in a way that is absolutely stunning. He leads you to believe that the predicament is simple and easy to solve but then he throws a wrench in the works and gives you new information, characters, and a whole other side of the story. Instantly you believe that Casey and her team at Norton Aircraft will quickly figure out why the accident that they are investigating in the book, took place. However he throws in a couple twists and turns and you can hardly guess how everything will be solved. In the end, the truth is finally revealed and everything snaps together. Airframe is and amazing jumble of twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the very end. I highly recommend Airframe to all readers."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I found this book disappointing, and not even close to as captivating as his other books.If you're an airplane buff, you'll like this book. If you are a Crichton fan, maybe not."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I'm not real sure why this book has never been made into a movie. It is Crichton at his best-- detailed, well plotted, and well written-- and while I know it was a best seller when it came out, it just never seemed to garner the attention his more sci fi oriented books have.A near disaster in the air leaves three people dead and nearly three dozen injured. Casey Singleton is sent by her hard-driving boss to uncover the mysterious circumstances that led to the disaster before more people die. But, as you might expect, someone doesn't want her to find the answers she is looking for and soon she is risking her life to unravel the mystery.While Crichton has featured strong women in other books, Casey Singleton is, I believe, the first to actually be the lead character in the book. And she is truly a great character! More than just solving the mystery rides in her shoulders, the fate of the company she works for may depend on whether she can solve the mystery before someone sees to it that she is no longer around to try to sort things out.Crichton probably does a better job of explaining the inner working of airliner manufacturing and the airline industry itself than most textbooks. Well there are echoes of \\"Disclosure\\" here, Crichton ably demonstrates that the most entertaining intrigue is corporate intrigue. A truly superior novel."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A airplane's interior cabinet has been mysteriously demolished beyond belief. Three passengers are dead and fifty-six are injured.

Throughout her journey, twists and turns come when you least expect them. The mystery and suspense is soaked into each and every page of the amazing , yet believeable story.

It takes you through an airline disaster with great detail in a very entertaining way. Tense moments make this a fast listen. I'll never fly again!

These are what I call his &quot;rant&quot; books.He takes a subject, comes up with mystery to solve, then has his main character bounce from person to person who gives a rather lenghty monologue on why the subject is bad. Rising Sun had the Japanese buyout of America, Disclosure had sexual harrassment, Airframe has the airline industry's lax safety standards.These are his worst books. The plots are usually weak, and every single one of them is formula. There is always a message left for the main character which would solve the mystery immediately but for some reason our hero never gets the chance to check his machine, email, etc.Don't get me wrong, Crighton is a favorite author of mine, and his books are always fun to read, but these books are too predictable. Airframe is one of these.For fans only. Those looking for an introduction to Crighton should start elsewhere."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book is not one of his better works.

It kept me intrested from beginning to end. This book was hard to put down. the very best"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"First of all, I should say that I listened to the abridged audio version, so take that should be taken into account.Crichton has a nack for taking interesting subject material and butchering it with a bad plot. This book is certainly no exception. Airframe is similar to the movie Twister, in that the insertion of the bad guy detracts from the interest in the chase.I don't understand how Crichton could write an in-depth book about a technical field and then dumb-down the plot so much as to make it appear like a made-for-TV movie. Oh, wait... I do understand... people will buy it.By &quot;dumb-down&quot; I don't mean to imply that the plot isn't intricate, but rather that the author believes that the only way to make a book about airline accident investigation interesting is to throw in external elements of suspense. In fact, these added elements are in themselves more significant than the actual investigation.There was one point in the book where I had to laugh out loud - shocked that this book and author are taken seriously. If it had happened earlier in the book, I would have quit listening right then."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I find &quot;Airframe&quot; is a very interesting book, at least enough for the reader to finish it. Crichton, as in all his novels, did a lot of research. Despite this, I found many aspects in this novel tiring, specially the fact that there are too many technical details that almost dwarf the main story -of course they don't get to do it-. The characters (you can count over three thousand), except, maybe Casey Singleton, aren't sufficiently developed and at times they become essentially boring cartoons, because Crichton employs too much time in his techno babble. Not that the facts about the airplanes are so boring, but sometimes they take over the plot, slowing down its rythm. Anyway, I enjoyed this novel very much because it presents a chain of very exciting coincidences and events (Crichton succesfully keeps our attention making real life a lot more interesting), so many of them, that sometimes they can get exhausting. What I definitely liked the most was that the book makes a solid critic at modern life aspects such as sensationalistic media and industry management corruption. Like his &quot;Lost World&quot;, at the end it makes us wonder: What's this world turning into?, because we realize that honesty and search for the truth -what Casey defends as an honorable person, even when it could cost her job- are just forgotten principles and all that rules powerful people's minds is search for money and more power. Happily, Casey triumphs at the end, but actually because of her luck, as her neighbor makes her see, &quot;You were stupid. You should have lied&quot; he tells her, and we think next time she will have no other choice.A great novel from a great writer. I can't wait till the movie!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"If you pay attention to the first 50 pages then you've figured it out. Pretty good until that point. Then when the main character (Casey) figures it out Mr. Crichton still drags the story out another 100 pages so that Casey can convince the media during a test flight. Richman was a boring and worthless character. I believe the character insults Yale graduates. The vocabulary of this character was limited to - Jesus. What? Wow! etc. Other than his little connection to Korea he was nothing more than someone for Casey to dispense a lot of technical information to the reader. Mr. Crichton is a better writer than this and he could have used another method to deliver that. He was able to do it in Jurassic Park. (the book NOT the movie) If you have never read Mr. Crichton's work and you like a mystery then this one is okay. Get the paperback and buy it at a used bookstore. Lastly, I hate over used swear words and intentionally misspelling words to make us hear how the speaker speaks. The teenage girl. That enough was all I needed instead of reading, &quot;I was rully rully scared.&quot;"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"From the first few pages, this book drew me in. The characters, especially Casey, Randall and Marder were well developed. The intrigue mounted, the suspense element was always there, except when the technical airplane talk took over, but even that didn't stop me from putting it down. In fact, if all the techie info is on the up and up, it's partly an education on airplanes and flying.I'm an average reader, finishing 350-450 pages in 2-3 weeks. I finished this in about 10 days. It definitely kept my interest. The inclusion of TV woman Malone, half way through, gave this book a resurgence of suspense. You knew she'd get squashed, but you wanted to find out how. The ending (somewhat predictable)was still exciting. It was a hard book to put down. This was my first Crichton-read. Possibly not my last, although I'm not a sci-fi fan, which is the majority of his work."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton is my favorite author in the whole wide world but I was a bit disappointed with this book. It's language is too technical distracting the reader from the story. Although I liked the heroine in this book the bad guys, Marder and Richman were just too weak to be compelling. And the stakes in this book are too little. In his other novels like &quot;Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;Disclosure&quot; what was at stake really mattered but the fact that a airplane company would go bankrupt if it lost the sale and Casey would lose her job just didn't cut it this time. His other novels, like Sphere and Great Train Robbery and even Congo! were also a lot more exciting than this one. That said the book is not bad with an heroine you can really like and root for to upstage that stupid news producer jennifer Malone who really got on my nerves. You want to see the producer fail so much and the throwing up in the airplane was very satisfying indeed. The ending was a reeeeeaaaaaall surprise but left me unfullfilled. I would have liked to have known what happens to the people responsible for the accident. Did they get sued?!! And all the double plotting by Marder just to become president of the company seemed a bit unbelieveable to me. But even Michael Crichtons worst novel is still better than many other authors I can think of and even though I could see how easily it could be a movie,(even imagining all the technical jargon being cut from the movie!!) I don't think Crichton has sold out or anything like that. I really hope he never does!!!!That would be a tradegy!!!! So I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read but don't expect another Crichton classic. I personally can't wait till his next book comes out!!! I wish he wrote more often!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is Crichton's best book. It starts with a bang and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Despite this book's focus on a plane accident, I picked it up at an airport. As such, it was the perfect quick read. Like all other good \\"vacation books,\\" after it was digested, I completely forgot everything about it. That's exactly what you want when you're travelling! Much of the plot is unbelievable, and the main character makes many judgment errors (e.g., repeatedly entering airplane hangars alone at night and then being chased), but the plot hums along. A good page turner."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I got this book on tape because I lost one from the library and had to replace it. It was much less expensive then what they would have charged and in better condition"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have been reading Crichton since college and enjoy the research and background he puts into his stories. Fast paced and a good story but I was put off by the profanity. I would not let my teenager read this book nor do I plan to read any other of his newer novels. Very disappointed in Dr. Crichton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Three passengers are dead. 56 are injured. The interior cabin of the airplane is virtually destroyed, but the pilot manages to land the plane. Casey Singleton is in charge of not only finding out what really happened to cause so muich damage, but also to deal with the media despite the people who are working against her and trying to publicize lies.This book is for mature readers only, as it has quite a bit of language which may be offensive. 41 different pages contain offensive language, not including the ones that contain \\"Jesus\\" or \\"Jesus Christ\\"."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I just finished rereading this novel and, even though I knew the ending, it was as good or better the second time around. The story deals with a female executive named Casey Singleton who works at an airframe manufacturer in Los Angeles. Think Hughes Aircraft or Boeing. She's in Quality Assurance and is assigned to a team of engineers who have to determine what caused an incident that killed three and injured fifty on one of the company's planes. To make matters tense, the incident happened on a Chinese airline and if it is shown in the wrong light it could kill the company's multibillion dollar deal with the Chinese. One of the major networks is also planning an expose on the plane after footage of the incident is shown on CNN. Casey is assigned the task of dealing with the media.The novel was written in Crichton's prime, shortly after he peaked with Jurassic Park and a few years before he started writing real stinkers like Timeline and Prey. The thing I like best about his writing is how he can take complicated topics like aeronautics or network news production and make them understandable with an economy of words. I particularly liked his interpretation of prime time news programming and found his characterizations of engineers to be right on the mark. This rank up there with A Cases of Need and Disclosure as Crichton's best."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The incident in the book is fictitious (as is Norton Aircraft), but the possibility is not. While not as compelling as some of Crichton's other novels, Airframe is an eye-opening look into the world of the National Transportation Safety Board and aircraft manufacturers. High profile crashes like the Columbia breakup, TWA Flight 800 and United Flight 232 have made the public more aware of what can go wrong on an aircraft -- and how hard it can be to find the true cause because the wreckage does not always make the root cause of the accident clear. Airframe proves this point as investigators pore through physical evidence, video and audio records from flight voice/data recorders and passenger video cameras, and the \\"black box\\" (they are actually bright orange for visibility reasons) that records the status of major systems on an aircraft on a looping tape or on a digital recorder. The true root cause of the accident is uncovered at last -- and it's something that one would never expect to happen with the long hours pilots put into their training and with the extensive simulations and testing carried out by aircraft manufacturers -- but is something that is quite capable of bringing down a modern airliner. It's worth reading, especially to any fellow aerospace buffs out there."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"AIRFRAME is another mystery on Crichton's growing list. The daughter in this tale shouts, \\"Oh, Mom, I missed you!\\" Which is what the reader will also echo in his or her search for character in this novel. When you write film scripts, which this essentially is, you leave it up to Sharon Stone to provide the elements of character. The heroine, Casey, in this story is one of the author's chess pieces, a woman who dumps her daughter off on her ex husband and engages in zipless sex while she stumbles her way to solving the mystery of the why an airplane dove out of control.Crichton does put some nice messages out there. He shows how TV news show producers and anchormen become prostitutes to their own stories. He displays the infighting that goes on between corporate bosses and their wannabe underlings. He demonstrates how corporations play footsie with their big customers. So what if he does pass off film scripts as novels, Hollywood is where the money is. The reader can't have everything."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When reading this book, you'll say &quot;gee, you know, it has Crichton's very descriptivness, and his good character choices; but, where's the science?&quot;. Yeah yeah, if you've read Timeline, then you read Airframe, you'll swear they weren't written by the same guy. Airframe is a great page-turner, and isn't like a super action-packed and science book like Timeline. This book deals with betrayal, investigations, suspense, and drama. It almost seems like it was written to be a movie with all the great aspects of the book. But, this book was one of my favorites. I suggest you read this book...and if you've read it, well read it again!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I first heard of this novel, the subject matter sounded uninteresting to me. Only after a friend strongly recommended it did I give it any consideration at all. And even then, I waited until there were no other books on my &quot;to read&quot; list before buying a copy. Well, I wish I hadn't waited so long. Airframe is a great book!Michael Crichton brings his usual cinematic writing style to Airframe, reinforcing a suspenseful story with a level of technical detail that brings depth and additional interest to the events that take place. And while the book is primarily focused on an investigation into an airplace accident, which may sound dry and uninteresting, the character interactions and intrigue are more than enough to keep the story moving at a steady pace. In fact, there was never a point where I felt the momentum lull.As an added plus, I particularly enjoyed Crichton's portrayal of the news media. I felt that his unforgiving commentary on the motives and methods of television &quot;news&quot; programs was dead on, and in fact has become even more accurate in the years since he wrote this novel.Kudos to Crichton for this one - I would recommend that anyone read Airframe, and do so before they ruin it by turning it into a movie!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton at his best gives us a mix of brilliant technological insight set in an atmosphere of almost suffocating paranoia; one thinks of scientists racing against the clock against a killer ET virus (The Andromeda Strain) or dinosaur cloners who are hunted down by their own creations. This is not Crichton at his best. The paranoia is definitely there, as always, the heroes seem to be at the mercy of dark forces lurking in the shadows, but the technology part simply doesn't measure up. Crichton's understanding of both the aircraft industry and the basic rules of aeronautical engineering are sorely lacking, and it shows, especially in the downright ludicrous \\"resolution\\" at the end, in which a team of engineers and a test pilot come up with a completely ridiculous explanation for a plane losing control in flight. It may sound like nit picking, after all, most people who read this won't know about the technical details and probably won't care, nonetheless, Crichton has established a rep for being a master of detail, especially on technology, so this book looks as sloppy as if Tom Clancy tried to pass off a B-52 as being \\"stealthy\\"."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was the best book I've ever read. Crichton at his best. This must be the greatest book he ever wrote. Casey Singleton is a real and believable charicture. The airplane science is engrossing and easy to understand. READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!! GO!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is 100% completely standard Crichton, which is to say that it's an immediately engaging story with enough facts to both make the reader feel he's learned something and feel the story is more than just imaginary. Ostensibly the novel focuses on the airline industry. But for me the more compelling story line was how the media interacts with big business and how it chooses to tell its stories. Though the television story developer and her star reporter are a bit too extreme, seeming more parodies than believable characters, Crichton's points retain their validity.The ending snippets supposedly culled from various news sources put a nice finishing touch on the novel, both wrapping up its plot lines and emphasizing Crichton's media theme. I imagine he must have been grinning mischievously when penning the final snippet--a brilliant ending to a solid read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I was an avid Michael Crichton reader up to and NOT including Airframe. I am no longer a fan, or at least not with the same enthusiasm. I have not picked up a Crichton book ever since. I am still recovering from this literary disaster. Crichton has a knack of going into great technical detail in the middle of his books to further inform the reader. In every other book I read, this flowed quite smoothly, in Airframe, this technical information could not have been drier. The book never seemed to get off the ground as the action happened within the first 5 pages, and the remainder of the book dicusses the investigation. Simply not Crichton's best work."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I won't get wordy about this book, because it is simply the best book by MC I have read. It is believable, incredibly well written, the characters extremely well portrayed, the depiction of the vulture-like characteristics of our precious media - nothing less than PERFECT; It's scary, exciting, precise, three dimensional, intelligent, very well researched, imaginative and GREAT! I'm tipping my proverbial hat to Michael Crichton... Well done!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is fast and enjoyable reading, in a credible framework. It is the sort of story that actually happens around us all the time. Michael Crichton immerses us in the technical and legal details of safety issues in aviation, but also packs in some commentary on the contemporary world of outsourcing and international interlocking production, when production and technology is increasingly shifting to China..The other big topic of this book is the media frenzy that dominates our societies. As one person in the novel says, that \\"game's got nothing to do with accuracy, or the facts, or reality. It's just a circus.\\" And, that person continues, \\"sometimes I look around my living room, and the most real thing in the room is the television. It is bright and vivid a mile and the rest of my life looks drab.\\" In other words, there is a giant dislocation that is taking place, away from our own realities to something that's manufactured (the book was written before Internet took over).Obviously this is not an academic book, it dramatizes this story, adding salacious bits that I would have considered unnecessary, but that probably is needed to make it sell -- almost like an ironic comment upon itself. I personally felt that it was the best book by Michael Crichton I have read so far. No need for future science, a lot of excitement is already happening today, if we look closely and attend to it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"To me this book was a mixed bag. Air Frame is about a woman (Casey Singleton) who is sent to investigate a near crash of an air plane for the company that she works for. The thing about that is the fact that the way the plane crashed made no sense. When the crew looks at the nearly destroyed plane, they're suprised to see that no evidence points to why the plane crashed why it did. Add that with the fact that the flight crew was acting very weird and the media is getting all over it and it turns out being a very good book, but this book wasnt perfect. There are a few points that werent very entertaining to read, but it never takes too long for something to happen and pick up the suspense of the book. For me, what turned out to be what i thought was a boring read at first, in the end turned out to be a very good book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe by Michael Crichton is a good novel with good technical information and understanding of aviation. It's a mystery essentially, and a more well-done one than Crichton's previous mystery novel, Rising Sun. It's easier to follow and makes more sense in the end. Casey, a vice-president at Norton Aircraft is taking part in an investigation of an aircraft incident in which a Norton-built aircraft poirpoises (not sure if I spelled that right) or takes a series of steep dives and climbs that results in the deaths of three people and fifty-six more injured. (Although if I am right in my calculations it becomes four dead and fifty-five injured. Don't worry, that wasn't a plot spoiler.) Norton tells her and the rest of the people involved that they need to discover what really happened fast, otherwise a major deal on which the outcome of the company rests could be flushed away. Casey has to work through a twisted puzzle of clues and technical info to solve the mystery, with the wait of the company and the pressure of the media on her shoulders, and against a foe who is determined to not let her succeed. Like I said, this book makes good use of aviation tech stuff for a suspenseful plot, which is a Crichton trademark. It's a great read and is definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A trans-Pacific flight from Hong Kong encounters severe turbulence leaving several passengers dead and many more injured. Casey Singleton, who is in charge of Quality Control for the airplane manufacturer, is assigned to head the internal investigation into what went wrong. But it soon becomes apparent that someone doesn't want her to figure out what happened. Add to it a labor dispute, and not only is the future of the company in jeopardy, but Casey's life as well.&quot;Airframe&quot; offers an amazing and interesting insight into several industries. I learned some very interesting things about how the airplanes are made and the tests and regulations required. While reading it I even felt a bit uneasy about flying, and found that I paid a lot more attention to the operations of the jet the next time I flew. But not only was the book informative (for a work of fiction, anyway), but it was also a lot of fun to read. Maybe not my favorite Crichton book, but I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was my first Michael Crichton novel, and since then I have read many others; I have yet to read one that surpasses this intelligent, thought-provoking, and technically spun suspense about an airplane crash that leaves a bizarre and gruesome scene behind. Crichton's superb writing reflectes the meticulous and educational research he must have gone through to depict a world in the aftermath of an airplane crash and the media's obssesssions with sensationalism.The novel is centered on the heroine's relentless investigations in order to salvage the airline company's reputation and airplane manufacturer. The media, government, incompetent technical team, multi-billion corporations, and an elusive presence that clearly does not want her to find out the truth and many more heart-palpitating twists are incorporated in the story.If you do not know which Crichton book you want to choose, I highly recommend AIRFRAME!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"On average, I finish a novel every 3 days. I read all kinds of books. I loved this one and it prompted me to write a review for the first time. I love to get to know the characters, but I prefer to do it through their actions and dialogue. Not through endless descriptions and insights. This is my main problem with Koontz and King. Airframe allowed me to get to know the characters well but through the story. The story keeps moving and never gets side-tracked or bogged-down with endless, tedious descriptions. I loved this book. I loved the subject matter, the story, the twists and turns. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton is one of my favourite authors because of how much you can learn from all the deatils he includes. This book definately displays his ability to demonstrate an understanding of something technical. The details of all the parts of the planes are described in great detail, and this only adds to the pleasure gained from reading this book. Some people say it is too much, but it really depends on the reader. I hardly knew anything about airplanes before reading this book, and i can say i gained a substantial amount of knowledge by the end. This book also focuses on news reporters and the media, which IMO is another reason to buy this book. The characters seemed very realistic as well as thier reactions to events. I was surprised to see that airframe was fast paced and involved a huge amount of plot twists. It really goes into the airplane industry and shows how one incident can affect so many people. This book is informative, yet exciting and surprising. It is a great read, you will never think of the media and airplanes the same way!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe, like many other Michael Crichton novels, deals with the impact of technology on society. In airframe, however, the perils of technology actually derive from the impact of television media, while being informative and maybe a little condescending about the wisdom and perils of modern air travel. Also like his other novels, Airframe has a fairly likeable protagonist (this time, a female by the name of Casey Singleton), a suspenseful plot yanked along by a looming deadline, high technology, a seemingly greedy and/or malevolent big business, a huge business decision that would make or break everyone, and a cast of seemingly moronic second tier characters.Actually Airframe resembles Disclosure in many ways (except the whole sexual harassment thing), which is not necessarily a bad thing, though is somewhat predictable &#65533; you&#65533;ll find that in portions of the novel apparently nothing ever really happens, and the investigation really goes nowhere (to the exasperation of one of the characters).Still, Mr. Crichton maintains more than what is needed to keep the reader to not stop turning the pages. The plot, which occurs early on a Monday morning, involves a passenger aircraft over the Pacific that has an &#65533;incident,&#65533; for lack of a better term. Several people end up dying, and many more are injured. Norton Aircraft manufactures the aircraft, where Casey Singleton is the Quality Assurance representative for the company&#65533;s Incident Response Team - responsible for figuring out what happens on any kind of incidents regarding Norton planes. The incident needs to be resolved by the coming Friday, as there is talk of a company-making (or breaking) deal with China to be solidified since then. Any bad publicity could kill the deal.The story quickly goes into the fast-paced investigative mode as Casey and the various members of the Incident Response Team first unravel, than uncover why the aircraft did what it did and the discrepancies in crew testimony. Along the way Mr. Crichton, through a convenient new assistant, lays out the concept of aircraft and safety, the FAA, deregulation, media ignorance, black boxes, accident investigation, and practically everything else you wanted to know.By the middle of the week a television news magazine similar to 60 Minutes jumps on the story when a video taken by a passenger during the incident suddenly airs on CNN. The producer, who builds, researches, and pushes the stories in television news organizations, is a young up-and-coming woman who right off the bat comes off as one of Mr. Crichton&#65533;s antagonist morons (Casey&#65533;s assistant, anti-Norton &#65533;watchdogs,&#65533; various Norton executives, and all kinds of union workers are the others) that you wouldn&#65533;t mind slapping after five minutes of conversation. Of course, the media practically gets everything wrong, through which Casey has to patiently explain everything (to the reader), as the investigation builds to &#65533; well, not a whole lot as it turns out &#65533; and then the mystery is uncovered through a semi-dramatic ending.It&#65533;s as if Mr. Crichton didn&#65533;t really know how to end the book, and once you understand the cause behind the incident, you&#65533;d think there&#65533;s no way it could have been like that. Unfortunately, aircraft accidents have happened in much simpler ways, but you wish that Mr. Crichton could have been a little more inventive. There aren&#65533;t too many interesting characters, and the rest are unsympathetic at best. I find it hard to believe union workers would act like that, but again I suppose there is precedent.Airframe is a good book that uses Mr. Crichton&#65533;s patented dramatic pacing and technology (media) gone amok, but really concludes weakly, though it pretty much solves everything &#65533; just like Disclosure. Is that good or bad?"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I had to read this book for an aviation safety class. I didn't particularly enjoy the dramatization of the story, but the depth of research into the aviation industry is noticible. If you like a good story about turmoil in the aviation industry, not to mention a quick peek at how the industry operates, this is an amusing book. I found it modestly entertaining."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I don't particularly care for Crichton's works. I just pulled this one at random from my uncle's bookshelf in the den because I needed something to read while waiting at the mechanic's shop. Airframe is certainly entertaining, but don't expect anything too serious out of it. It has that &quot;made for cable tv movie&quot; feel to it. The character development, even among the main characters is rather shallow. I think they were intended to be almost like caricatures. The characters didn't seem to matter all that much. Their development is to give you an idea of the type of person the character is. There is no need to go beyond that. For people looking for a &quot;Summer Book&quot;, this isn't a bad choice. I use that title lightly. It applies to rainy days, which we do get a lot of down here, or cold winter nights, which we don't. hehe Most people can probably tear through it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I really liked the Michael Crichton book, Airframe.

He moves the reader along relentlessly. For instance, some reviewers here complained about the short chapters but that doesn't bother me because that's MC's fast paced style - in and out. He packs so much information on each page that long chapters would not be ideal.He's great at distilling very technical info and then bringing it to life in a dramatic format. That's probably what I like most about MC. I always feel smarter when reading one of his novels. He delivers pithy insights - food for thought - in a fast paced narrative. Hence, great beach reading.That's all he really tried to do. Fun and interesting. Light and breezy. I doubt he ever thought his prose or literally prowess would linger with his readers long after they put his books down. It's a good ride while you're on it.

Nothing I didn't already know about the press or human nature."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"AirframeAirframe, by Michael Crichton would make someone who is interested in aviation even more interested. In the beginning, a plane has a mid-air accident that kills three people. The rest of the book is primarily concerned with describing the investigation that the company launches trying to find out why. In my opinion, since part of the conflict is that the media is producing a story with incomplete information that could ruin the company, one might believe that the author is trying to show how one bad media report could cause good companies to go bankrupt and leave many people unemployed. One good thing about the novel is that it is very factual with its description of how airplanes work. It is also a book that would make any person who is interested in aircraft to become more enthusiastic about them. One bad thing about the story is that it would be thought of as very boring to someone who is not interested in aviation.The author of the book was Michael Crichton. Crichton was born in Chicago in 1942, and has written many fiction and non fiction works. Most of his novels, such as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Congo are science fiction based books and many of them are bestsellers. If the reader liked Airframe, they would probably enjoy The Great Train Robbery, or any of the above mentioned books.Centennial Critic # 17"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Strangely enough this is the first Michael Crichton book I've read and it probably won't be the last - I really liked his writing style but overall I was disappointed in this story. There was way way too much technical detail - most of which in the end turned out to be pretty irrelevant - the end was pretty much of a disappointment. I kind of thought we were building up to some major conspiracy and much of the stuff that happens - eg security guards being assigned to protect the heroine and a couple of incidents where she is being followed and threatened really add up to nothing but red herrings when you think about it all afterwards. Why should a character involved in a plan to deprive her of her job, take the risk of threatening her with physical harm? It was almost like he wrote this book with the sole purpose of it being turned into a film thinking - this would make an exciting scene - rather than focusing on the plot making sense. I just began to feel irritated with the way he was keeping certain plot elements in reserve to build up to an exciting - and not very believable climax on board a plane. Would a news reporter really risk her life in such a way? I'd like to read some of his other books though, as I liked his writing style and think he's probably better at sci fi, based on what I've seen of films made from his books ..."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"\\"Airframe\\" is a typical Michael Crichton work in which the author thoroughly masters the subject matter of the novel, and goes on to tell an enthralling and plausible story. This is the story of modern aviation, and the intrigue within one aircraft manufacturing company. Plot and counterplot abound, to determine who, if anyone, is selling out American technological superiority for twenty pieces of silver, figuratively speaking. Along the way Crichton acquaints the reader with the brilliance, discipline, and high standards that characterize the American aviation industry, and which have made this industry one of the marvels of the world. How Crichton manages to learn so much about each topic of his various novels is the real question; the man is what the British used to call a \\"polymath\\"--a person who can quickly and thoroughly master a plethora of disciplines.This story moves at a breakneck pace and never loses the reader's interest. There are heros and villains within this novel, and sometimes the reader knows who is which and sometimes not. Plenty of suspense here, and this is a fascinating read to which many readers will return multiple times. Highly recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"\\"Airframe\\" is a story about the detailed investigation of a bizarre plane crash. It's fast-paced and very well written. This book will definitely change the way you feel about the airline industry!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A terrible accident has occurred on a transpacific N-22 flight. The plane is able to land but the interior cabin has been torn to shreds. Casey Singleton, the public relations and quality assurance for Norton is assigned to find out what happened on flight 545. This is a very untimely accident when the company has a multi-billion dollar deal going down with China. The N-22 is one of the best planes in the business, but this doesn't make it look good when there seems to be an error with the slats in the wings. Things only get worse when Casey views video footage of what happened in the cabin. But as things look their grimmest, stress and tensions rise as Jennifer Malone, a producer from Nightline finds out about this horrible occurrence. Now Malone is producing a story that could and will jeopardize the big China deal, and possibly put Norton under for good. Casey is the only one who can save the company, but when the workers start putting force on her, can she manage to do it?This book has vivid, life like descriptions that make you never want to travel in an airplane ever again. It is a brilliant thriller that truly will make you view aviation in a whole new light. A \\"cat and mouse\\" strategy leaves you guessing what will happen next and who might slip up causing their empire to fall. It turns out to be either Norton goes under or Malone's producing career is terminated. This is one of Crichton's best books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I started reading, I really didnt have such high expectations for this book. I had liked Crichton for the Jurassica Park BOOKS(and books only) and Sphere, etc. This seemed a stretch for me but it ended up being my favorite of his books.This story is another Crichton thriller--so you know what you're getting going in and you know how he's gonna move the story--but in this book there is something much more inviting and familiar. It is because he spends alot more time making you care about the main character(s). Though you can probably see the end coming(if you know his writings well enough), the characters and the path they use to get to that ending is what really makes this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was one of my favorite suspense novels. The author did an excellent job paint the scenery of the large areas where the planes are built. He definitely puts you in the eyes of the character. Great book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Another thrilling Crichton page turner! I was expecting this to be about the dangers of flying, but in the end it left me feeling rather reassured about the safety of air travel. The real suspense in this book arise from the tensions created by the internal company politics in the airplane manufacturer, as well as from the aggressive &quot;reporting&quot; of the tabloid television crew. As usual, Crichton's characters aren't as well developed as I might like, but he knows how to pace a story and sustain interest. Definitely an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"this was my first michael crichton book so i approached it with sceptisism. i was not dissappointed however as this had me gripped from start to finish.forced to write this review after reading the odd one or two give it 1 star out of 5. this is grossly unfair and deserves far far better. best book i have read in ages.i have since read &quot;prey&quot; by crichton and intend to purchase more of his books as they are geat reads."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Most news coverage about plane wrecks in grossly inaccurate. Even when solid facts emerge the media almost always gets it wrong. That is the real story of this book.An aviation incident is turned into a fiasco by a press more concerned with sensationalism than accuracy. Getting down to reality is another matter. I've worked in the maintenance department of a major airline and I found the story, setting and characters to be very realistic. Crichton did his homework very well on this book. Perhaps the most realistic part was the maintenance people watching a news report outraged by the misrepresentations. Been there, done that.If you want a realistic novel about the world of transport aviation this is it. One warning however, the language is straight from the shop floor too. Nothing gratuitous but just the way things are."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was one of the top ten books that I have ever read! It adds a certain level of humor and successfully shows the manufacturer's point of view to an air accident."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"i'm reeading the book at the moment and i'm thrilled it's seems like it really happend"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"For a reader like myself, that reads a few chapters each night, I had a tough time putting the book down to fall asleep. I have always enjoyed reading Mr. Crichton's books because each chapter is short thus providing me more opportunities to stop at a end of a scene. The recent United Airlines incident is parallel to Airframe. Has anyone seen the misprint of a title page &quot;Video Imabging Systems&quot; in this book?"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I began reading Airframe I really wasn't interested about airplanes and all that type of stuff but after reading Airframe I realized what I was missing!Crichton weaves some of the best charecters ever.Usually Crichton doesn't have that good of endings to his books but this book has one of the best endings I've read!I can't wait for the movie to come out.Although I'm not sure I agree that Demi Moore is fit to play Casy Singelton.Matthew Mchgounahay is also going to play Teddy Rawlings.But anyways read this book if you like airplanes and read it even if you don't."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As usual, Michael Crichton writes more as a brilliant inculcator than a storyteller, weaving pages of information about how a plane is built and it's safety precautions.Airframe was far less intriguing than his other novels, that is I found it boring. But, if I need to build an airplane, Airframe would be a great point of reference."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book reminded me of the time I was standing at the edge of the ocean wondering if &quot;Jaws&quot; was out there waiting for me. Now I'll be standing at the end of the boarding walkway wondering if... well I'll let you read the reason I'll be scared to fly from now on. It's a white knuckler. The only shortcoming is the lack of depth to the main female character. Major events occur to her and her dialog is too passive."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton writes a compelling story around almost any subject. Airframe is one of his best; a real page turner."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton's work is highly variable in quality, ranging from the really excellent (Andromeda Strain?) to the really miserable (Sphere?). This one is in the middle-top, being a pretty good read. What's fascinating is that within a year of publication, an incident occured which bears an uncanny resemblance to the core incident in the book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"One of the best Michael Crichton novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was somewhat of a letdown. Crichton makes the airline industry somewhat interesting though not compelling. The book is more concerned with television newsmagazines than commercial aviation. And Crichton pulls no punches here. His portrayal of the media is not subtle asthey are reduced to stereotypical ratings mongers with no regard for people or the truth. Although, perhaps itr is accurate, it came across to me as a personal vendetta and was a bit overdone. Above all else you will learn how to &quot;sigh&quot;. Every few pages somebody sighed and it got very tedious!!!!!!! If it's the only unread book you have around the house and winter is howling outside, read it. Under any other conditions, get something else . It is an average book, especially for Michael Crichton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I loved everyone of Crichton's books and this ranks with the best of them. Sure the characters are stereotyped but there supposed to be. This book is a cultural statement about the media's willingness to tear down a safe company for ratings. After I read this book, I watched a news special about the TWA crash and it was like it came straight out of the book. Crichton has an amazing talent of knowing America's vulnerabilaties and twisting in an amazing thriller. The aviation industry talk is great."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is a really great novel!!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is a huge redemption for Crichton since the Lost World. It seems he put a lot of time and thought into this one. This gives me a better view on the world of Aviation. I'm a big Crichton fan and I believe this one of his best yet."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Overall, enjoyable. I solved the &quot;mystery&quot; right away (why else even mention the hat?) and that's half the fun. I did spend several pages wanting to shake some sense into Casey. I think Mike writes better when the lead is a man. Good beach read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Criton has delivered a variety of works, some I enjoyed and some I did not. AIRFRAME is probably the most well researched and intresting book I have ever read. If he doesnt know his subject here, he has done a masterful job of faking it. If aviation intrests you, or even if you are just curious about he workings of an airplane, its a great read. All of this technical information is wrapped in a story that grabbed my attention and kept it until the final plot twist. Intresting characters and multiple suprizes!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After starting to read this book, you will want to keep on reading to find out what happens next. I felt the ending was satisfactory and explains what we were wondering throughout the book. Not my favorite Crichton book, but one of the better ones."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is one of Crichton's greatest. I've read most of his others and this is only surpassed by Sphere. It is about a plane that starts porpoising above the Pacific, killing three and injuring fifty six. Casey Singleton is called in to investigate and finds herself in the middle of a huge conspiracy. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe lacks character development with shallow stereotypical playing the lead. Crichton goes into so much detail with all his aeronutical knowledege that the plot becomes almost non exsistance. I was up to page 300 and was resisting the urge to wipe the tears of boredom out of my eyes.Jenifer Malone is probably the most stereotyped character I have ever seen in seious novel. There is no realism to her. Casey, the heroine, is not much better.The technical mumbo jumbo does make it intresting for the first hundred pages or so but after that it just becomes to much.This is classed as a thriller but in my opinion it is not. If your idea of a thriller is having to read through two hundred and fifty pages of pointless jargon then there is something deffinetly wrong with.Michael Crichton has done a lot better than this and I'd recommend that you read one of his better books such as Sphere, Jurasic Park, Disclosure or the Andromeda Strain."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe was only the second book by MC that I'd read, having previously read only Lost World. I had enjoyed Lost World very much, so I was looking forward to Airframe. While the story was interesting, and some of the suspense was enjoyable, I was quite disappointed with the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but I was hoping for a more powerful finish."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book's a shocker. It has such a thin plot and the characters are transparent and boring. Even the potential exitement of the news story fails to thrill. It is low on action with the exception of the initial air mishap, which is riveting, but then the novel drifts in to cliches and predictability. It is hard to believe that an author who wrote the superb &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; can write such a childish novel as &quot;Airframe&quot;. It has more value as an introductory aircraft technical manual than as a thriller."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton follows in the tradition of great books before this one. It is a excellent plot and great storyline. The situation is one that could that occur in real life."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It's been 20+ years since I last read a Crichton novel (Andromeda Strain). In the interim, Mr. Crichton has enjoyed tremendous commercial success with such novels as Jurassic Park and Congo. Having missed those novels, I can't compare Airframe to them but I think it's fair to say that Airframe is comparable to Andromeda Strain with its blend of suspense and use of science/technology. I can only assume that those reviewers who have complained that the book contained too much &quot;technology&quot; and not enough action have had their intellects dulled by too many action films and their non-plots and non-stop pyrotechnic special effects. Too bad!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Except for the technical aspects, could have been a short story. Only reason I kept reading was to find the answer to one or two questions, but there is not much character development, almost no action - nothing happens along the way. Not to par with Crichton's other books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I thought the Airframe was a great book. It has taught me many things about airplanes. The book is griping and gets you wandering what would happen next. I realy liked the setting of the book because i like technical things of the book. Michael Crichton has a great storytelling ability that keeps the reader reading the book. His technical details are very accurate. I recommend this book to the poeple that like a thriler with lot of technological stuff."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"this book is one of his worst books and i would not recommend i"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book goes into detail on the business behind making and flying passenger jets and a sensationalized news program. Told from the point of view of the PR woman of the aircraft manufacturer and a journalist who thinks she has hit on a big story, the book explains much about airlines, big business, and the laws of the press. For a book about airplane tragedies, it made me feel more confident to step on board. Chrichton's style of writing makes everything so believable that you don't doubt that it is all true. If there was ever a book to get in hardcover, this is it!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I really liked this book because it was interesting and fun to read. It was interesting how they peiced together each clue that they were left with. I learned from this book on how they peiced together each clue and came to the conclusion. It was easy to read the book even though there were many terms that the flight people use because Michael Crichton weaved the definition of each word in the text. I didn't have that many dislikes because it was fun and pretty easy to read, although the parts when they get into the news reporting text was pretty boring. I recommend this book to any one because it is fun to read and anyone who likes puzzles or mysterys will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is masterpiece. So much factual information and intriging plot makes this book a must read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Micheal Crichton is already one of my favorite authors but this book pushes him over the top! This story has a great story line and lets you into the world of aeronautics without any complication! This story also has some more flavor than others by putting a female in the lead role also with a position of power. This is one boook I recommend to any avid reader!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Do not under estimate this book. Crichton's thrill seeking, plot twisting, mystery finding, page turning book is one of his best. Just when you think you know it all, you don't."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Chrichtons &quot;Airframe&quot; is an exciting and mysterious book.

Casey Singleton, who works at Norton Aircraft Company, is assigned to investigate the plane crash. During her investigation she finds out that the pilot, who is highly respected, let his son fly, and his son did not have a license to do so.

This book is worth spending the money."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Today I woke up ashamed of myself! How can I forgive myself after I wasted my time and money reading that monumental piece of garbage--Michael Crichton's Airframe. How can I forgive myself when there are countless literary masterpieces that I have not read, and yet, I stupidly read this awful book? How will I ever explain to my kids that I read this worthless &quot;novel&quot; even though I had long ago realized that Crichton writes terribly? Why, I must wonder, did I submit myself to the same kind of unconvincing characters, contrived plot, and insipid prose that characterized Crichton's Disclosure? I cannot understand or justify my actions. But don't despair, for I have learned my lesson. Never again will I waste my time on Crichton's work. I promise."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I didn't feel that this was his best work. I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes. Too much detail on mundane stuff. Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like \\"PREY\\". Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is my first Crichton book and I must say I'm very disappointed. I have another one of his books on my shelf but I'm in no hurry to read it.On the plus side the story was well researched and it provided, to a novice, an insight into crash investigation. However, the book was slow and only the fact that I'm stubborn I would have given up on it.The ending is very good but it take a long time coming.In summary, give it a miss. Good ending but you'll feel disappointed having sat through it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Great storyline. A mixture of the hi-tech-thriller that Crichton is famous for and corporate intrigue that Crichton mastered so well in Rising Sun."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Great plotting. if this were a summer movie no doubt that it would be a smash hit. Great writing. Fantastic! A thrill ride! Pulse pounding!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Recently finished \\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\". That quality, talented writing made this book look silly by comparison. Chrichton obviously has talent and brains with several books turned into super movies. This Airframe will teach you a lot about how planes are made and why you should hate unions and lawyers. Nothing about Crichton's denial of global warming though.Dialog is primative and page filling. Author certainly did his homework on airframe construction and the science of flight. After an honest effort to engage after page 191 I started skipping pages of useless stuff. The end was a surprise that was clever but did not interest me in terms of the human condition.Like food Chrichton will fill many hours for readers who like his style. Expected a lot more and Chrichton is behind me now. Will try Ludlum next his Bourne movies were pretty good. Chrichton's political leaning are too obvious although I heard he was liked by fellow writers before he died."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Found myself trying to get through just to get to the good part. It never came."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A charter is going from Hong Kong to Denver. Suddenly there is a problem, the plane dives and passengers are discomforted. TPA 545 makes an emergency landing in Los Angeles for medical care. Many foreign charter carriers did not match the rigorous safety standards of domestic scheduled carriers. The FAA investigates these \\"incidents\\".Casey Singleton, a single mom, works in Quality Assurance for Norton Aircraft. QA dealt in problems in customer support. Casey has a new assistant who has to be educated and gently handled. Casey explains the very high standards needed for aircraft (\\"Bldg 64 6:45 am\\"). The \\"War Room 7:01 am\\" chapter shows how problems are investigated. There is a big order that will save the company, but only if this problem can be explained by next week! The problem appears to be \\"severe pitch oscillations\\" which could be caused by \\"uncommanded slats deployment\\". The expert says it could not be pilot error because that pilot was superb; it had to be a mechanical problem (\\"Bldg 202/FSIM 7:59 am\\"). [Is this a clue?] Inspection reveals a non-standard part that could have caused the malfunction (\\"Hangar 5 9:40 am\\"). Is the rumor about the wing offset just a projection of fears? Why do the media censor information about \\"Cheapskate Airlines\\", a stock scam similar to the then current \\"high-tech\\" stocks? Do reporters write with a presumption of guilt to make their subjects look silly or foolish? Has deregulation resulted in using aircraft beyond their expected life (\\"Proof Test 10:19 am\\")? It takes regulations to provide safety, not a \\"free market\\". Every part on an aircraft has a paper history for documentation. Casey finds the repair record (\\"Norton QA 12:30 pm\\"), and the seemingly correct paper.The \\"Newsline/New York 1:54 pm\\" chapter explains the working of television news stories. More counterfeit parts are found (which don't meet the high standards required). The \\"Outside Norton 11:10 am\\" chapter explains how news stories are created for sensationalism. Note the funding source for the \\"Institute for Aviation Research\\". See the reporter asking questions to cause an emotional reaction. The video camera recorded a sound like the slats deploying. Television news is not required to present the other side of an issue. The \\"Norton QA 11:50 am\\" chapter explains the trick used in interviews to get a reaction. The hidden agenda comes out (\\"Bldg 64 3:01 pm\\"). How difficult is it to film a test flight (\\"War Room 4:20 pm\\")? On Saturday morning the plane is taken up for a test flight, with two passengers. The flight recreates the incident successfully to rule out any \\"design flaw\\". Then the mystery is solved. The Aircraft Incident Report is written in language that means little to the general public. The last chapter contains the news reports that end this story. These items conceal more than they reveal. The phrase \\"deep integrity\\" suggests a well-hidden quality. This novel is educational in telling about the tricks played by any award-winning news program.Michael Crichton has placed this fast-paced story in a manufacturing factory and created an interesting and entertaining story that informs the general public about events behind the news. The High-Tech stock scams have crashed to earth, outsourcing of jobs continues, oppressive taxes on wage earners has resulted in a zero savings rate. Could it get worse? Only with a pandemic."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am really disappointed in this book. I have always enjoyed Crichton books, and found them entertaining. This one is boring, the characters are not well-developed, the suspense negligible. I wish popular authors would forget publishing just to publish and get back to what made them interesting in the first place -- having a good story to tell"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"_Airframe_ promises to keep Michael Crichton on top of the best-sellerlist with the intensity only he can deliver. In this, his 11ththriller, Crichton pulls the reader into a laborious aircraft disasterinvestigation and follows the investigation to an unheard-of sixthday solution. Although he borrows pieces of plot from _Disclosure_,he does so sparingly and well. Through the airline manufacturer'sinvestigation, _Airframe_ conquers the television media, showing thereader their rushed 'reporting' and the misinformation that results._Airframe_ continues to satisfy the expectations of Crichton readers,and leaves them longing for what he'll do next."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have read other Crichton novels, but this is the first one I had to abandon after only 40 pages. The 'info-dumping' was painful, the characterisation was crass ( a redhead with a fiery temper? How does he think of these things?) and the subject, for a thriller, was mundane. But it was the casual racism which pushed this reviewer over the edge. Crichtons' insights into the minds of the Vietnamese Americans (&quot;Quiet, self-contained..hard-working&quot;)or Chinese(&quot;great attention to detail&quot;) made me wonder about the rest of his legendary research skills. If you can't trust a writer to describe things you know with any realism, then you can't trust him when it comes to imparting esoteric knowlege about aircraft engineering, for example. Crichton is a fantastically successful writer. He does not need to write for a living any more. The biggest mystery about 'Airframe' is, why did he bother? Michael, baby, take a break."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After oredering this book from Amazon.com it sat on my bookshelf for about 2 months without me starting it. I finally got to this enthralling book and read it in just three days.The novel stars Casey Singleton the QA director for Norton and an enthralling investigation over an N-22 jet that suffered damage for unknown reasons in the air killing three leaving 56 injured. Through twist and turns Michael Crichton takes you on a thrill ride through the life of a highpowered associate at a major company and phony TV reporters. After CNN shows a disturbing video of footage of what happened on the plane it gives Jennifer Malone, a 29 year old that works for Newsline the idea to make a story of a lifetime. Meanwhile Jennifer wants to interview the people at Norton and Casey has to really figure out what happened. Since the flight data recorder will take over a year to finish she goes on the plane and searches for a QAR and finds one. Throughn many contreversies and plots, Airframe is a book that and reader does not want to miss.Read this book as soon as you can. You'll thouroghly enjoy it! Good job Michael Crichton!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I usually like what Crichton writes, but this book is awful.The Plot: Thin, and uninteresting, mixed with the old Corporate In-Fighting theme, repeated from Disclosure.The Writing: Crichton as usual. Sharp, undecorated text, not much value as true literature. Crichton doesn't usually write well. It's usually the plot that is interesting.The Characters: Cliche, all over again. A single mother with a child! Stressful and agitated corporate stereotypes.Boy, Hollywood is going to have a wild time making an awful film based on this novel. It'll be one of those fast-paced junk films with tolerable actors.My advice: Even if you love Crichton, this one is simply too boring. So sorry, Mike."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Never in my life have I read a poorly-written book. Sure, in my time I've seen a truckload of god awful movies that just made me wanna puke. But I never expected this sort of work to be fit into a BOOK. Well, it looks like I proved my self wrong after reading Michael Criton's &quot;Airframe,&quot; a supposedly good novel that turned out to just plain stink.This book was a total waste of my time. I could have been listening in class and taking notes, but noooo . . . I was too busy reading this book and expecting it to get good... how strange that I still had my hopes up after page 300.First off, this book barely has any plot. All it is is some stupid story about a bunch of people investigating a plane crash. It has no thrills or no suspense whatsoever; the only thing that really kept me reading was the chase scenes, which were obviously thrown in to spice the story up a little.Second, NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS. I was expecting something we'd find in the average Michael Critchen novel, like Marty Reardon getting wasted on the plane on his way to the interview. Nope, none of that! Its 350 pages of the most boring content I've ever read . . .In conclusion, I just want to get the point across about how much I hated this book. I don't see how the book could get all those rave reviews on the back, saying it was Michael's &quot;best since Jurassic Park.&quot; Wrong! Jurassic Park actually had what I'd call a 'thrill', plus a bunch of big dinosaurs. So you're telling me a PLANE CRASH is better than people getting eaten by a T-Rex? I think those critics actually need to READ the book instead of just looking at the description on the back, because this book certainly does not deserve all of this credit. I'm really hoping that Micheal's upcoming works aren't going to bore me as badly as &quot;AIRFRAME&quot; did."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is by far Crichton's worst novel. The suspensein this novel is about as exiciting as walking down a Vermontcountry road. As usual Crichton has done his research on his subject matter, but losesthe reader by drowning them in airplane technical jargon. Furthermore, his characters are so shallow, thatone doesn't really muster up any sympathy for them as they are written as mere bodies walkingthrough a dilemma. Crichton writes his 'chapters' in a concise fashion as if toprepare the novel for a screenplay adaptation. Airframe lacks the page-turning dilemmas of Disclosure and his radicalsocial commentaries (reverse sexual harrasment, the Japanese's lack of principles, the dangers of bionic cloning). Airline disasters are nothingnew, and Crichton is late in excavating this topic versus the times when he has broken ground with alerting his readers of the social dangers evolving out there.It seems as though Crichton was afraid to thrust his readers in the middle of a real jet crash a la last summer's Long Island incident. Hence, the story comesacross tame in its excitement, and fails to confront the real problems and aftermaths of a plane crash (particularly from the victims' standpoint). Airframe reads like a cheap made for TV film, and the best one can hope for a feature version of a film, is one where theproducer and director change many elements of the story."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was my first Crighton book, and it will be my last. The one-page chapters, the many divisions that yield blank pages, the tables of data, the irrelevant dialogue--these are the indicators of shorter story stretching to pose as a novel. The topic is good, and the story is somewhat catchy, but the lazy execution left me feeling like the author and publisher took my money and left me holding a half-blank book"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton is an interesting writer, this does not make him a good writer. There is the question of plausibility, often connected to the probability of coincidences, and Michael Crichton strains my reasoning on almost everything he writes. Consequently there is one overiding concern, to believe ir not. I find I prejudge him, I regard each of his stories as I would a cartoon, it just can't happen. Then I throw out all my beliefs, settle back, and enjoy the book. This I can do, if I do not read the book as I would a text book, but absorb the story without criticism of reality but only inteested in the action, then I am satisfied. Crichton does cover a lot of ground, he does introduce new concepts, or old concepts in a new setting, and I do not question whether he knows what he is talking about. If I come to a resounding error or an implausible situation, or even a a character acting not according to his character as set up, I skip over it, knowing Crichton wlll inevitably introduce such elements into his story. If it happens to be some scientific point I am not familiar with I have no problem. I have already decided not to quibble over such implausibilities.Airframe was full of them. I spent most of my working years associated with such aircraft companies, and he was generally on target but he also made many misstatements. I am not going to enumerate them, many of them helped the story line and some were essential to the plot. Why quibble, the main facts were true. The wing is the soul of the aircraft, no manufacturer would use wing offset as a means to obtain a contract, also the U. S. government must approve any offset anyhow. So let us assume that the wing could be manufactured overseas and imported back into the U. S. for assembly. On with the story. Again, contracts, before signing. are highly classified so how did the union know? Ignore it, on with the story. That is how I read most of Michael Crichton. I have written criticisms of some of his other stories, now I have revealed how I am able to read them amd enjoy them.Most of his stories are fast paced and action packed but he has trouble ending them, or I think his endings are weak, compared to the action in the story and he often leaves unanswered questions about some of the action. However criticizing the endings is difficult to do without revealing the ending and ruining the story for anyone reading the review. Surprisingly, the ending to \\"Airframe\\" is pretty good, even the payoff to Casey is not too bad. It was a good read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"If you are involved with either airplanes or the media in any way, then I do NOT recommend this book to you. Just like a TV show, the book likely twists a few facts from both subjects, just to keep the story interesting to the readers. So pilots and airplane manufacturers would find the book poked through with technical errors. Journalists would be enraged at his critique.But I am neither of these, so I found the book a good read. It is really more about the media nowadays. It was easy to be annoyed at Jennifer (the main protagonist), and how all she wanted was something that would get good ratings. She seemed determined to grind the manufacturing company to the ground. I disliked her character, but she was interesting, so I kept reading on. The ending is has a strong \\"just desserts\\"/moralistic style, but this is characteristic of Crichton.I don't know if it is good enough for full price. I'd suggest buying a cheaper version from another seller, or perhaps just borrowing it from a library first."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Great plot but... weak characters. If you have alot of time in your hands, go for it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Having read the hits Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Congo, and Rising Sun, I decided to give this one a shot. I am glad that I did not stop in the middle of the book (when I felt that I should have because it became bland and seemed endless). I hung on and read a surprising ending.Crichton's hopping back and forth between the main character and the reporter for Newsline sort of threw me off, and there were some chapters I just didn't read because they were pointless, but the whole picture was clear when the two leads combined in the end."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton excells at teaching you while you are reading (or in my case, listening - I heard it as an audiobook read by Blair Brown).In this case, Crichton tells us about the world of airplane design and construction. However, the more compelling story is that of the news media getting the story wrong due to lazy work - the same theme as is developed in \\"The State of Fear.\\" Seeing stories that are produced on the local level in my city about items that I have personal knowledge of, I cannot say that I disagree.Entertaining, informative read.Final grade: B+"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Like a good neighbor, Michael Critchen is there. When you want to read a no hassle guaranteed good book, M.C.'S airframe is a book that can certainly share that tile along with many of his other novels. Airframe is as slick moving and as aerodynamic as one of planes described in his novel.The story involves a plane that has an in air accident, people are hurt and questions need to be answered or heads will roll. Critchen takes a technical subject and makes it easy to follow. You will learn alot about the airplane industry, deregulation drawbacks, corrupt business men, union troubles and immoral reporters. Critchen pulls no punches on touchy subjects and makes it really entertaining. The last 100 pages read like a roller coaster ride, loops and all.In a nutshell, an accident in the air causes many to be hurt. Now the question is cast: Is the plane unsafe? What caused the accident? Will this accident prevent a potentially large contract from being obtained? Who or what will prevent it? Critchen's heroin Casey, must put her reputation on the line as the airplane quality assurance rep, and dig through the mass of technical facts, bureaucracy and overzealous reporters. What will happen next you'll need to read to find out."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When I read this book, back in 2000 I was sure I was reading a script to a movie. Instead I was reading a Crichton novel, which to no surprise this producer, director, screenplay writer and novelist, makes the transition from page to screen a rather seamless one.It would have made a GREAT action blockbuster, along the lines of perhaps &quot;Air Force One&quot; but hopefully with the Crichton touch alot better.The book was well written, with a slow start, but picks up pace quickly when our heroine discovers the true cause of the wreckage, and her inevitable lover comes and saves the day during a perfectly illustrated fight errupts in the hangar.Unfortunately, after the events of September 11, I doubt this book will ever become a movie, atleast anytime soon. The mainstream public is still too sensitive, and not willing to withstand two hours of painful flashbacks of the greatest aviation castatrophe in the history of the world. No matter how little the plot of Airframe has in similarity with the accidents of that Black Tuesday, the country will no doubt be thinking of that in the back of thier minds."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As a flight attendant, I enjoy any books related to the airline/ aviation industry. This past Christmas, my family took a ski trip but I had broken my toe, so I wasn't able to ski. I ended up reading this book in just a few days! I was glued to it!I love Micheal Crichton's books and this is one of his best!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book was classic Crichton, but I was disappointed with his factual errors that could have been avoided with some really basic research, such as:1. His description of a turbofan engine was very jumbled and just plain wrong. In one passage he refers to the fan and compressor interchangeably as he talks about metal temperatures of 2500F. The air temperature does not get anywhere near this high in that part of the engine because it is prior to fuel combustion. Even in the hot section of the engine, this might be the temperature of the gas, but certainly not of the metal. Thousands of engineers in the aerospace industry could have helped him with his description without giving away any proprietary information.2. He refers to runways #2 and #3 at the same airport, apparently thinking runways are sequentially numbered. As any private pilot could have told him, runways are numbered by the compass heading, with the last digit deleted, so that a runway aiming to the east is #9, one to the south is #18, and so on. You would never find runways #2 and #3 at the same airport.As usual for Crichton, the book was a page turner, but these blatant errors interrupted the flow of the story for me."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton's Airframe is a shining example of the fog over the fine line between classics and passing fads. Written in 1995 amidst a global fear of air travel, Airframe is a fast-paced story of one airline's struggle between the media and financial ruin. Norton Airlines is a top-notch airline manufacturer with a flawless record. When one of their planes goes down because of a mysterious \\"turbulence\\" the company's Incident Review Team must frantically piece together the puzzle to save a corporation. This combined with a rabid dog news agency, provides for an enthralling novel that only Michael Crichton could orchestrate.Michael Crichton does an excellent job developing his characters in Airframe by stepping outside the typical novel frameworks and using a technique that is rarely seen in pop novels. Crichton, the founder of such notable screen works as Jurassic Park, and ER, uses a screenplay format in this novel. The characters are exposed in life like situations by an author who is basically a camera lens, unbiased and factual. While indulging in the pages of Airframe the reader's mind immediately wanders away and \\"watches\\" the action take place in one's head. Unlike other ensnaring books; however, Airframe's plot is arranged in sections and cut scenes as though it were ready for the big screen. In doing this, the characters are exposed as they would be on a film, without author narrative.The major themes of this story are the man versus self struggle of protagonist Casey Singleton and her man versus man struggle against the biased and twisting news agency. The story is written in the \\"slice-of-life\\" format, focused around one event, and the characters are represented in a realistic way. All characters are flawed in their own way, but some, as in the case of Casey, are trying to be better people. Thus another aspect of the conflicts rears its head: good versus evil, or more specifically honesty. At the completion of the book, Crichton shows where the characters are a few years down the road, and subtly passes judgement on them in accordance with their stance on the good versus evil theme. Airframe is a book of morals tales.The plot of Airframe, as Cricthon would write it, is easy to read and draws the reader in to the story. The story ends with the warm sense of completion, which inspires one to read other books that Crichton has written. Within the screenplay rubric, Crichton uses foreshadowing that is only seen after the event. I learned this from my father, who, because his line of work, reads large quantites of text in a short time. He has a habit of analyzing what he is reading while he reads, and immediately begins looking for evidence to support the conclusions he has drawn. It was he who pointed out some of the well hidden foreshadowing devices used in this book. The hints are in the fabric of the story, but one must focus to see them.Several moods are inspired because of this book. The moods change quickly based on revelations in the story, once again very similar to the way moods change in a movie or television show. The moods in Airframe range from hopelessness to anger to contempt and finally to success.Airframe is written in third person omniscient point of view with a non-intrusive and unbiased author.I would recommend this book to anyone because it is entertaining and informative. Crichton is a very learned man and typically studies his subjects to the point of obsession in order to be factually accurate. Airframe is no exception."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The only thing I could think of when I finished this book was who would I cast in the movie, if they made it into a movie. When I first started reading the book I was able to put it down, but as I continued there was no way I could put it down. One night I started reading and finished it the same night, because through everything that was going on I could not stop reading."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When reading a Cricton book I am almost certain to enjoy the reading, and I wasn't let down. If you are looking ror a great novel with a lot of suspense and we keep you turning page after page, I recomend this novel.If you are a first time reader I also recomend Sphere, another great novel by Cricton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After recently finishing Crichton's brilliant &quot;Timeline,&quot; I found &quot;Airframe&quot; to be quite a disappointment, at least as far as imagination and suspense are concerned. One cannnot deny that Mr. Crichton as always has done some remarkable research into what goes into making an airplane safe. The novel opens briskly with a very unusual air disaster, resulting not in a crash, but still three corpses and over fifty injuries. Casey Singleton is a very well drawn character and I found myself involved in her dilemma. The only other characters that I found remotely likeable, however, were her secretary Norma, and her some-time lover Ted. The rest of the characters are merely duplicitous, irritable and just plain nasty. The story takes a long time to develop and little suspense is demonstrated, particularly in the seemingly unnecessary &quot;union scares.&quot; All in all, this is not one of Michael's better books, but if you are a frequent flyer, you might want to check it out and see why I love terra firma!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Some reviewers fault this book for being formulaic, and lacking of philosophical and moral depth. To them I say, read War and Peace!If you like a story that pitches and yaws through more Machiavellian twists than a presidential primary, then read this book. In true Crichton fashion, the reader is sucked into a vortex of suspense and thrills, with just enough interesting facts about media bias, corporate double-dealings, and aircraft safety, to leave the reader entertained and informed.Read this book on your next trans-oceanic flight and you'll get twice the value."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is definitely the best I have ever read. If you liked this you have to read the &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;. That was one of the best too. The way he writes his books iof phenominal. I really wonder how he does it. Absolutely amazing. Only Took me two days to read because i couldnt read it. I know someone that read the whole thing on a 6 hour plane ride. I obviously reccomend this book and all his others. I give it a 10 STAR report! Best book in the world. Do yourself a favor and read it. :-) Please"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is one of Crichton's best books. The suspense is first-rate and it never lets up. Crichton writes in such a style that it is near impossible to put one of his books down once they are started, and this is no exception. Aiframe is a very good book, and I gurantee you that you will be hard-pressed not to read it in one setting.Also, as always with Crichton, you will learn a good deal about the subject matter of the book by the time you have finished it, a testament to his legendary research. You will learn about how airplanes are built, who makes them and what goes into making them, the various problems that an airframe manufacturer runs into, and more. Imagine that, educational fiction."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"An exciting start to an exciting finsh. Once you think nothing else can happen it does! It eductaes about avaiation and Crichton's research must have been a novel itself. This must have been one of his bests books he has written. There should be a movie! BUY it! :-)"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton delivers again his old formula of technical romances. But, this time, it is very good. We have very few dead bodies, we have no cartunistic villains, we have no global conspiracy or crazy plan. What we have is a good history, well-developed characters (well, comparing to others Crichton's characters...) centered about people trying to find out what went wrong with some determined flight of some determined air company. Good."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The back of my book talks about a thriller that will make you scared to fly -- for me the experience was quite the opposite. The book underscores all the safety precautions of the airline industry. Instead, what the title refers to is the media -- how they take a story made of nothing but hot air, and by framing it sensationally, injure innocent and hard-working people. I think this book is reading for this point alone."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I loved this book. Perhaps it may seem boring to people who aren't involved in the airline business like myself. I found it to be incredibly realistic and very well researched. If you are tired of people trying to create believable airline/airport stories such as lighting Jet fuel with a match and seeing it blow up a plane in midair..(Die Hard 2)...yeah right...then you will love this book. Nothing fancy...just like real life. Believable! A truely great read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After having been treated to a double dinosaur special of 'Jurassic Park'and &quot;The Lost World&quot;, I was a bit skeptical of reading a Micheal Crichton novel which didn't deal with the prehistoric. Anyway he pulled it off yet again but only just. The narrative is excellent and the technical detail is pretty neat though I wish he had some sort of glossary to help readers not familiar with aerospatial or avionic terms. There seemed to be a dash of 'Rising Sun' in the plot but somehow that didnt get developed too well. Thats why I lopped off one star . However, all in all, a good read .Dont take it on the plane though !"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I almost didn't read this novel after seeing all the negative comments about it, but I am now glad I did and you will be, too. Any investigation undertaken by the government or a large company will be somewhat dry and methodical, but Mr. Crichton takes this serious mishap in the Air and launches a step-by-step description of how the mystery is investigated and solved. At the end of each small chapter is a sentence that screams for you to keep reading. You will learn plenty from this well-researched book about how a passenger jet is manufactured and maintained, how the pilots are trained, the power of the media, unions, and corporate America. You will learn and be entertained at the same time. There are mistakes in the book, but you can easily overlook them. You may guess correctly the true cause of the incident before the ending of the book, but getting to the end of the book is great fun."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am constantly amazed by the breadth of Michael Crichton \`s interests and by his remarkable skill in researching his subjects. I also find his indirectly expressed issues of more than passing significance. In Jurassic Park the issue is the arrogance of science in its manipulation of nature and the tendency of Western science to eschew accountability for the spillover costs to society when things go wrong. Airframe is another example of it. Here the issue of the freedom of speech and the lack of accountability of the media, particularly television news, is explored. In a society that has come to stress individual rights, little emphasis has been placed on individual responsibility. In order to be a functional culture, there has to be a balance of both rights and responsibilities. Airframe makes this abundantly clear.As so often with Crichton's central characters, a uniquely placed individual must come to grips with the inherent difficulties of fighting an uphill battle against society's inertia. The heroine, Casey Singleton, is given the task of deciding how a disasterous air accident happened before a crucial business deal collapses and takes the company she works for and all of its employees down with it. It is by no means clear what is taking place, and ultimately she must come to trust her own personal interpretation of events to bring things to a head.The detail is impressive. The characters are well developed and real. The story is riveting and fast paced. A thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is absolutely my favourite book by Michael Crichton. He may have a medical degree, but he writes about journalism, the media and politics with much more insight than the condescending attitudes of his scientist characters. This book is Crichton at his best--backed up, as ever, by extensive research into the topic, a cast of hugely realistic characters to love and love to hate, and, of course, an intriguing mystery thrown in to boot. Casey Singleton is a classic Crichton heroine--world-weary, wise, and an expert in her field, she reminds me of Sarah Harding from &quot;The Lost World&quot;, except Casey has a REAL job. The realism of the plot is one of the main factors in making this one of Crichton's best books--all of this could really happen. I've seen other reviewers bellyache about the mundaneness of the final solution to the aircrash, but isn't that the most chilling note to the whole plot? Just how easily all this chaos was caused? Sleazy journalists, wise colleagues, a comical team of experts called in to exammine the aircraft, and at the centre of it all Casey Singleton, trying to save the company and at the same time trying to stop herself becoming the scapegoat to be sacrificed to the media: for me, this makes a brilliant novel. The final pages will blur by--and when you sit back with a sigh of relief, the underplayed conclusion to this book behind you, there is the final message: Don't believe everything you read in the papers. Well, I said it was realistically underplayed, didn't I?"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was a very enjoyable novel. The trademark punchy Crichton opening scene, around which the entire story revolves , is incredibly exciting. You'll also get a concentrated class in aviation acronyms. And the thoroughly satisfying \\"getting even\\" scene, toward the end, is especially tasty. Once again Mr Crichton gives you the tools to figure out the final revelation, but it will still knock you sideways, because I don't think you'll figure it out. The science is fine, and digestible. Once you get into the swing of things (acronym-wise) even the aircraft reports get semi-discernable, and pleasing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The inner workings of this book are fantastic. Michael Crichton puts us into the Norton Aircraft facilities, with all the political goings on, the backstabbing, the wolves at the gate and now...an air disaster.As well as entertaining us, Crichton provides with an education in Public Relations and how the investigative journalism doesn't care about the truth, unless it suits their entertainment needs (one example is the DC-10 story he puts in).I liked the main character who is always on the edge of losing her job. She has a tightrope the size of Dental Floss to work on and timelines that are impossible to meet. That, and the fact that her superiors want her to fail. It was worth the price of the book just to see how she would escape the tomb that others had thrown her in.The book is chopped up into days (she has 7 days to figure out what caused a near-fatal problem that caused 3 deaths on a flight.) and that provides good suspense and closure as each section ends.I recommend this book to anyone. It is a good read and one of Crichton's best books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The narrative is very engaging in the best Crichton style. Since the chapters are very short (approximately 2-15 pages) and self-contained, you can read a piece whenever you have time without loosing the thread. This book is not only entertaining, but also very informative about how commercial airplanes are built and maintained. I fly frequently on long-haul flights and this book has changed the way in which I look and listen to the airplane where I am sitting on. I give only four stars because I could figure out the end before the final chapters, but it's only a minor detail."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"If you are a frequent flyer, or afraid of flying, this is a riveting book that will easily cause several hours to pass and will have the added benefit of making you feel much safer as you fly.The author has done a really outstanding job of first understanding and then explaining to a lay person the enormous complexity and rigorous attention to detail that go into building and testing commercial aircraft, and investigating mishaps when they occur.The minor plot elements aside (the usual cast of media mediocrities, intra-office back-stabbers, etc.), this book makes aircraft safety *exciting.* I was completely absorbed in what this author has put together, and highly recommend this book as an intelligent thriller with a practical foundation."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Wow, now that's what I call a good, quick read. Michael Crichton just never lets you put down the book. At the end of almost every chapter, he leaves you with a cliffhanger just making you want to turn the page. Airframe was no exception. Airframe is about a commercial airliner and its internal happenings. Casey Singleton, the newly appointed QA director for the builder of the plane, gets the job just in time. En route from Hong Kong to Denver one of her company planes all the sudden jerks out of control. Does TWA Flight 800 ring a bell? Casey must investigate to find out why the plane mysteriously did so and in doing so killed several and injured many others. She encounters many obstacles along the way and has to do and say some things that she wouldn't normally. Overall all, I thought that Airframe was a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15. If you really want a rush, read it while flying on a plane. That should at least double the value of reading it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I have read all or Crichton's novels (including the &quot;Great Train Robbery&quot; which I highly recommend) with the exception of &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;.Crichton has an uncanny knack for giving the inside story of interesting, even fascinating businesses and technology.I couldn't wait to get my hands on his latest work.This book is his least riveting. I found it tedious and confusing in the details. The characters were not well developed.With the recent rash of air disasters - Value Jet's Florida catastorphe and TWAs continuing mystery over the Atlantic - I expected to be completely enthralled. Contrary to this, the ending left MUCH to be desired; it seemed almost anticlimactic. Kind of like, &quot;Oh, so that's what happened. How interesting...&quot; (said with tounge-in-cheek).If you like learning the inside scoop on big business in a not-well-known industry, you will be mildly interested in this work. If you want gripping drama with plot twists leading up to a totally unexpected ending, I suggest watching &quot;ER&quot;, Thursdays on NBC"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I love this book! Michael Crichton writes his books in such a way that they are near impossible to put down. This is accomplished primarily by the fact that the story never gets boring, and he usually ends chapters on a cliffhanger note, thus nearly forcing you to turn the page. This applies not only to Airframe, but all of Crichton's book.Also, his documentary approach to the novel of suspsense (complete with a very posh looking intro) will leaving you wondering whether or not the story really happened, such is the level of detail. It's a shame that this wasn't made into a movie as it seems more fit to be one than some of the other Crichton ones that they've made into movies (Rising Sun, Eaters of The Dead (13th Warrior).I can gurantee one thing, after reading this book you'll either never worry about riding an airplane again, as the safety measures of them are recounted in this book so painstakingly detailed, or you'll never fly in one again!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Based on the plot blurb on the jacket, this didn't sound like one of Crichton's best novels, so I put off reading it for years. Now I wish I hadn't. Airframe stands up with his best. A story of corporate politics, union violence, bureaucratic b.s., and media responsibility (or the lack thereof), Airframe weaves all of these elements into a seamless whole.Casey Singleton is a single mom, and a vice-president of quality assurance at Norton, one of the world's top (and few remaining) manufacturers of airframes (i.e., the body of an airplane, but not the engines). With a terrible but inexplicable accident threatening to upset a vital deal, it's up to her to get to the bottom of what actually happened in order to prove that the model of the plane is safe and reliable. But the union, afraid that jobs are going to be outsourced, will go to any lengths to stop the deal, and that means derailing Casey's investigation. Plus, it seems like there may be someone in upper management working against her as well. On top of all this, Casey is appointed as the company's liaison with the media about the incident. Can she deal with a violent union, back-stabbing co-workers, irresponsible journalists, senseless bureaucracy, and still solve the mystery in time?As usual, Crichton puts in enough technical detail to make the story seem hyper-real, but not quite enough to bore the reader with minutiae entirely irrelevant to the story. And unlike some of his more science-fictiony stuff, this novel is firmly in the realism camp, along with some of his other better novels (Disclosure and The Great Train Robbery come to mind).A couple of minor drawbacks: Some of the characters are a bit thinly drawn, for instance the upper-level management of the company, whom Crichton portrays as very hard workers in a sort of vague way but who we otherwise have no idea how they got where they are. And he treats some of his subject matter a bit inconsistently, for instance having a character who appears to be speaking for the author insist that federal regulation is the only way to ensure that corporations make safe products, but then showing regulatory agencies basically just getting in the way with a bunch of useless red tape and showing very clearly that the company's real motivation to put out a safe product is so they can actually sell it and make money off of it and not go out of business and all be out of jobs.But these are fairly minor issues in the novel. Overall, it's a great read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was a very quick read. It was a fairly enjoyable book, although not one of Crichton's best. I found it difficult to feel any empathy for the protagonist and most of the other characters were stereotypes. The plot was interesting enough to keep me going, but the ending was anticlimactic. A good book to read at the beach."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is my first venture into Crichton's work, and it was engrossing. Mind you, in January of this year, my nephew, 30 yrs. old, died on board Alaska Airlines flight 261. The book was lent to me by a co-worker who heard me speaking of my experiences in the wake of the 261 crash. While parts of the book were difficult to endure emotionally, I found it extremely informative about the airline industry and many facets that we as travellers take for granted: the relationships between the airline manufacturers, the carriers and the FAA. I have first-hand knowledge of attending the many meetings the NTSB coordinates in the aftermath of such an air disaster. Reading this book was like being right back in those briefings. And Crichton's portrayal of the media desparation in search of a story is as accurate as his reference to the G-forces acting on passengers. Crichton well describes the &quot;universe&quot; of modern air travel, but in the end the resolution seemed weak and disappointing."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I read several poor customer reviews for this book, but I finished it last night, and I feel it deserves praise. The book was not overly technical. Like all M. C.'s books, I felt I learned a fair amount about the subject matter. If you felt overwhelmed by the technical information in this book, you'd better go back to your romance novels. My only criticism is the sprinkling of union violence. First of all, it seems like it was added as an afterthought to provide some action. Second, as a labor lawyer, it was totally unbelievable. Overall, however, I would strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was my first Chricton novel, so I was somewhat caught off guard by the all the technical detail. However, once I got used to it, I was able to learn quite a bit about the aircraft industry. This book is well written, with the right blend of technical info and drama. Clues are dropped everywhere to entice the reader, but the mystery of the tragic air accident isn't resolved until the final pages. Trust me, you are in for quite a thrill if you read this book!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I liked how this book attacked the media and not the airplane manufacurers. Chrichton makes you love to hate those newsmagazine shows where they go more for dramatic punch and not factual content. It's alot like Disclosure but it's still a great, exciting thriller."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"An easy read that kept me on the edge of my seat. A must read for anyone"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is Crichton at his best. When I read the cover, I didn't think the plot sounded very exciting. Man, was I wrong! Crichton reveals a thrilling mystery through scientific details and some wonderful action scenes. Chracters are believable and you &quot;become one&quot; with the female protagonist as she sets out to find the truth about a near-fatal plane accident. A brilliant novel with twists and surprises galore, just like we Crichton fans like it!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"If you are not into books with a lot of technical and industry jargon, then this book is not for you. But if you like being on the edge of your seat, and can handle the sheer amount of detailed information being thrown at you on every page, then this book is for you! This book follows the same form that every other book that Crichton has written in that he throws in a lots and lots of technical information. A fact that stands out to me is a lot of the morons who gave it a bad review just couldn't handle this massive amount of data, and should have never tried to read a Crichton novel. They should stick with the little Golden Books they read as children. Disclosure was exactly the same way in that respect. The movie did not do Disclosure justice. And if the idiot who said something about the bad guy element doesn't think that insiders involved in an accident of this nature don't try to cover up vital evidence in real life better think again. This book is for the most part true to life, and could really happen. This is an A-1 piece of reading material for anyone ready for a good book. I read it in two days and I highly recommend it. Try Micheal's best book, A Case of Need. His best work by far!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book started off interesting and had a well-considered plot and concept but it carried on too long. When an interested reader picks up the book in a store it seems to be very interesting but it was a let down. Crichton lacked interest in the middle of the book and I started to no longer want to finish the book. The ending is a surprise and it is something that a Crichton fan will enjoy. But for the first time Crichton lacked interest in one of his stories which was really surprising. It's a book that you can read if you don't mind long amounts of time with nothing resolved. And if that wasn't enough, the technical terms and abreviasions make the book long and hard to follow. So if you're in a mood to pick a book that is not fast paced, it's yours ! I guess the saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' stands true to this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It's so discouraging to see that he's orienting his current work towards a future movie screenplay. I truly loved his early books; Congo, A Case of Need, Andromeda Strain, Sphere, but Airframe and The Lost World were just terrible. Shallow writing, no suspense, nothing to grab you from the get-go and keep you through the entire book. It seems that Crichton, along with Grisham are paying more attention to the potential dollar signs at the end of their movie credits rather than producing a novel that lives up to their previous, and stellar work."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton's work always crackles with tension and realism...Airframe may just be his best work yet...The story is classic Crichton--tight, edgy, with solid details and flow, as well as believable characters to sympathize with (or pull against)...After reading this book, I felt like I could step into the role of an NTSB investigator. I also felt like I was on board the doomed aircraft during those fateful moments of turbulence...What's so scary is that this kind of thing can happen at any time...Airframe does not disappoint...Put this one on your shelf now!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I'm sorry to say that AIRFRAME didn't please me at all. The plot wasn't that difficult to figure out from the start. During my reading I was over ran by many technical terms that only made sense to pilots and avionic experts. It was a major disappointment to me and probably others as well. On the back of the book read &quot;The pacing is fast, the suspense nonstop.&quot; I didn't seem to find much suspense in the story. Where was it? The best part of the book was at the beginning, and it only lasted 2-3 pages. He also kept switching the scenario on me. It became confusing at times while trying to visualize the scene. So, I am sorry to say it wasn't worth the $7.99 I paid for it."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a HUGE Michael Chrichton fan, I LOVE his writing style, and very much look forward to his novels...and boy didn't he make us wait for 'Airframe'? I would have thought with a wait so long, he would have had time to at least make it as good as his other works...I am truly sad to say this falls way below Chrichton's past works of art. As a simple story, it was good in it's own way, and Chrichton DID keep the pages turning, but it just didn't have any 'magic'. His other novels are SO good that I kept reading in anticipation that a major cliffhanger would arrise and take my breath away...unfortunately it never did. I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I feel this way...like I said earlier, I am a HUGE fan of Chrichton, but NOT of 'Airframe'. Sorry for those who disagree. Let me hear YOUR thoughts on my views: rmgomske@lightcom.net Thanks and go read something ELSE by Chrichton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"&quot;Airframe&quot; is probably Michael Crichton's weakest novel. As usual, the author shows to have done extensive research, but it seems as if the book was being specifically tailored to fit a future movie version. Worse, if you've read &quot;Disclosure&quot; or &quot;Rising Sun&quot; it's easy to predict the ending from the opening pages.Nevertheless, &quot;Airframe&quot; does keep the pages turning. It may be a cookie-cutter style novel, but at least it's fun. Crichton fans will be disappointed, but those new to his work may get a fresher read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"WOW. How can one author write a 350+ page book about airplanes and at the same time allow the reader to enjoy every part of it? This book is excellent, yet I would recommend (if you're deciding about buying a MC book) his newest-Timeline. Airframe was almost as good but not quite. I found the exhaustive airplane terminology boring and felt that it slowed down the novel. However, airplane terminology was much needed for Airframe. The reader does not need to know about airplanes to enjoy the book though since MC's masterful skill of allowing each character to discuss a specific part of the airplane allows the reader to better understand the &quot;airplane&quot; as a whole. I would have given this book a 4.5 star rating. So if you enjoy reading about airplanes, or would like to know more about them, read this book. If you're more into physics/chemistry, time travel and the medieval era, read Timeline."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"In Airframe Michael Crichton milks the aeroplane disaster theme one more time. The result? Three passengers dead, fifty-six injured, however, the pilot still manages to land the plane. Sound like something all too familiar? That's probably because it is.At a glance the plot seems to be interesting and well developed. Casey Singleton is a representative for Norton, whose plane was involved in the incident. Casey while being part of the investigation team, headed by the hard nosed John Marder, is also having to baby sit new comer to the industry, Bob Richman. On top of all this Casey is given the job of handling the media which includes Jennifer Malone whose sole driving force is to get a good story for her show, Newsline whether it be fact or fiction.Casey with little to go on starts to use some investigative skills not realising that by doing so she is also putting her job on the line.It looks good but what you get is a plot that acts a little like the airliner in the novel. At first it pitches up and then it nose dives continuously. You start off with gripping page turning excitement, then it dies down. You think to yourself, &quot;Don't worry it'll start to build up again,&quot; so you continue to read, and read, and read. Suddenly you realise that your half way through the &quot;Other Best-selling Books By Michael Crichton&quot; list in the back. You think to yourself, &quot;Hang on a sec.&quot; &quot;Where's the thrilling ending?&quot; &quot;Where's the excitement?&quot; &quot;Where's the action?&quot; &quot;What, you mean that was it!&quot; &quot;What a rip.&quot; What you end up being slapped in the face with, is a predictable ending that insults the reader's intelligence.The reason for this badly developed plot is to make room for all the technically accurate (we hope) information. It gets you going for the first hundred pages or so but after that it becomes tiresome. It over shadows the plot and acts more as filler for what would otherwise be a hundred and fifty page book.To accompany this Crichton has also offered a wide range of shallow, two dimensional stereotyped characters. Although sometimes you have to wonder if even this has been done correctly. It's more of a game of which stereotype fits who.Crichton has an annoying knack of having Casey speak down to Richman and as a result the reader as well. This, &quot;You see little Jimmy, this how the aerospace industry works,&quot; approach, at times gives you the feeling that you're watching an episode of Play School.The only thing that keeps this novel together is Crichton's storytelling ability that will get you to the end whether you like it or not. However, ultimately what your left with is a technological thriller that is more of a slow paced whodunit and reads like an explicit reference manual."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"You condition people to expect great things, and then this is what we get. I am an avid Crichton fan, and Sphere is(as it has been for the past 5 years) my favorite book of all time(2nd fave-Andromeda Strain). So you can imagine my disappointment when, halfway into this book, I discovered that this is just a poor excuse for suspense, jam packed with cliche after cliche, with predictable situations and dull charecters. Crichton is great at suspending reality and letting our imaginations have free reign(see: Jurassic Park and Sphere), and he just can't do that when faced with such a real situation(If you'll recall not to long ago, an accident similar to what was described in the book took place). I now believe Crichton is writing for the studios and not for the fans. While I'm not suggesting a complete upheaval into Science Fiction(that would be a little too much) I think he should concentrate on a new, suspensful plot as opposed to yet another poinless Jurassic Park sequel. NOTE: MUY IMPORTANTE! IF YOU WANT TO READ A GOOD MICHAEL CRICHTON BOOK, READ SPHERE. DO NOT SETTLE FOR THE MOVIE, IT DIDN'T DO IT JUSTICE AT ALL."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book is really full of air-industry information - and the absolute majority of its readers will never be sure if it is accurate or not. Characters?! I don't think Crichton has ever heard of that... And, by the way... After all those pages he must have real low esteem for his readers because he wants us to believe that absurd - and childish - explanation for the accident... Ok... he probably is under pressure because he needs to keep up the 1 book (i.e. movie) / 6 months pace. Dear Amazon.Com reader: don't waste your time. Buy someone's smarter and less compromised with money work"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"On the negative side:o The \\"thriller\\" part is too long. I still don't see why anyone would want to hurt Casey. But in any case the physical chases are extremely boring. And anywaywhy did Casey insist repeatedly on going alone without security agents?o Secondly the book as feminist viscous male-bashing that is not calledfor by the plot. E.g., Casey FALLS in a dark airplane--FALLS. Her bruises arethe occasion for a lengthy vicious tirade about men who batter their wives.Other than that, I found this \\"detective\\" story extremely satisfying, a true pageburner. I missed my exercise because i could not put it down.A page-turner! a detective masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"In \\"Airframe\\", the late Michael Crichton weaves deep science, fast-paced action, and characters that we both empathize with and loathe into a gripping novel. His \\"false documentation\\" technique is used to great effect here, and he is able to give some characters and plot devices an air of mystery that leaves the reader furiously turning pages in anticipation. Yes, there are healthy doses of engineering, physics, and aerodynamics - but who wouldn't be curious to find out how an airplane works (especially the wings)? If you liked \\"Andromeda Strain\\", you are sure to find something to enjoy in \\"Airframe\\" as well."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Three passengers dead and 56 injured. A fatal midair disaster aboard a commercial jet traveling from Hong Kong to Denver triggers a pressured and frantic investigation by the head of the Incident Review Team, Casey Singleton. A fantastic book with an involved yet easy-to-follow plot line."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"AIRFRAME. Ask anyone in aviation and they all say the same thing: an accident is not an isolated event. It is the end result of a series of seemingly unrelated events, often unrelated in time, that converge in one terrifying moment. AIRFRAME is such a book. It begins with an accident. No, better, let's use the investigative term, an 'event'. After all, most everyone survived, the plane survived, but will the plane's manufacturer survive?The 'event' occurs within a mechanical entity, an airplane, an airframe. The flight data recorder, the passenger reports, the damage reports all point to a manufactured defect. Bad for the plane's market future. Bad for the future of those responsible for its manufacture. Bad for the manfacturer's future. The crew? Yes, of course they reported the \`event', then quickly hopped the next flight back to the sanctuary of their base of foreign origin.But what is that fleeting image on a passenger's camera? Who was standing in the plane's galley at that awful moment in flight? And will the court of public opinion reverse its judgment, considering the court room reporter is a judgmental press?Queasy about boarding an aircraft, are we? Relax. You are about to enter a carefully constructed AIRFRAME.Reviewed by: Charles Dusenbury, author MOLASBA and COMPUTER BRAIN, on Kindle."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This year might be the \\"year of Crichton\\" for me. I enjoyed this book a lot but I must admit that I'm a little spoiled by Michael. For the first third of the book I was waiting for some big \\"out of nowhere Crichton surprise\\", some supernatural thing that would explain or describe \`Airframe'. There wasn't one and once I realized that I thought I was going to lose interest in the book. NOT SO! Although this book didn't have the classic \\"science-y\\" feel like his other ones this one is by no means boring!It is; however, very technical but Michael has that special skill to write a story so you don't feel stupid as you read it. It was a little different reading a Crichton story that dealt with the \\"real\\" world but (again) I really did enjoy it. This book is over 12 years old so I don't need to tell you about it but I do highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Reading this book, for me, was like riding on a commercial airplane.You get on the plane, all excited. You hear about what's coming up in your city of destination. You strap yourself in. You're all fidgety with anticipation.Then you wait. And wait. And wait.You feel like getting off the plane, you're so sick of waiting.FINALLY, it takes off!!That's how \\"Airframe\\" seemed to me. I nearly gave up on it, I was so weary of all the aeronautical acronyms and explanations of airplane processes and functions, I wanted action!I'm SO glad I waited. The last quarter of the book is completely worth the boredom of the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the book. Still, I wish those sections had been a little less yawn-inducing."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"As the novel opens we see a young family nearing the end of a very long flight across the Pacific. The sun has come up, the passengers are waking to the sounds of the crew getting the breakfast service ready when suddenly, and without warning, the plane hits very rough turbulence. By the time the makes an emergency landing there are deaths and over 50 injuries.The manufacturer of the plane, Norton, finds itself blamed for the event by the FAA, the carrier and the media. Casey, the vice-president in charge of Quality Control begins the detailed investigation into the cause of the accident, one that she soon discovers to be complicated by various hidden agendas that have nothing to do with passenger safety.AIRFRAME is written in the usual Crichton taut style of short sections, some only a couple of paragraphs, that jump from character to character, as they progress in chronological order over the course of a week. Unfortunately although Crichton has stuck to his trademark style and done his usual thorough research this one is just not as compelling as JURASSIC PARK or ANDROMEDA STRAIN. The novel starts out strong but begins to drag towards the middle and by the end, this reader at least, was at the 'only a few pages to go, might as well finish' stage. Still, a less than average Crichton novel is better than many other authors' best effort so AIRFRAME is an excellent read. Just not the best choice for a reluctant flier to take on their next flight."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I enjoyed this book. A bit different than the author's previous books. Quite a bit of mystery to the story which was very readable. The main character is very human and easy to identify with. The story goes into some interesting technnical aspects of airframe design and the ins and outs of contract grabbing.Some have criticized this book as being slow but I don't think so. This book is a good read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Fast-paced, engaging story. The technical jargon didn't bother me at all, I found it to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Of course, I picked up this book because it was written by my favorite author. His other books were thrilling and good, and I thought this one would be the same... But no, it turned out otherwise.I barely knew anything about jets when I first started to read this book. But the book taught me some stuff, and I found it educational.... In a way. It was interesting, but where's the fast-paced stuff that I expected? Nowhere... There were lots of abbreviations and I had some difficulty catching up on those stuff. Either I didn't know what they were, or I forgot what it was and had to look back and find out. The book was kind of slow, but it was interesting enough to finish it. I had to look up words in the dictionary, too! And I had expected something amazing at the end, but no, it wasn't... So it's 3 stars for me."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is the story of an airliner tragedy in which 56 people are injured and three are dead. Norton Aviation has until yesterday to figure out what went wrong because the negative publicity of this, and a couple of other \\"minor\\" incidents, will most assuredly torpedo a multi-billion dollar aircraft sale to China.True to his style, Crichton picks an issue, delves into the arcana to uncover the dirt, and implicates a variety of villians in the process.In Airframe, the bad-guys are the FAA,JAA, unions, amoral and ruthless industrialists, journalist/sharks who lie in wait for the waters to be chummed with tragedy so they can hop on their white horse to get to the \\"truth,\\" which is often how they perceive the world to be. Then, of course, there is a good-guy, or in this book, a good-gal. Katherine C. Singeleton, a veep in QA spearheads the investigation that eventually unravels this labyrithian mystery; the ending is a surprise one, albeit slightly anti-climatic and a bit untidy."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I enjoy reading Michael Crichton novels because they are an easy and quick read - yet they have serious questions behind them if the reader wishes to explore them. In \\"Airframe,\\" Crichton plays with the question of perspective or slant and the related question of fact versus judgment. In a way he manipulates the reader, who, not being at the Norton plant in Burbank, is forced to form his or her conclusions from limited information. The ethical question, of course, is of whether one would prefer to make an informed decision or a hasty judgment - or whose information one wishes to make a decision from.Crichton in a way critiques his own style of novel-writing in the form of the interviewer Marty Reardon. Marty doesn't want information, he wants entertainment. That's what Crichton readers want, and many complain that his novels are too technical. I always thought that Crichton used just enough information to frame his plot (though the footnotes in \\"Jurassic Park\\" may have been a bit much). Yes, \\"Airframe\\" uses a lot of aviation jargon, but never too difficult for the average reader to understand.Finally, Crichton seems to be playing with Dickens-style names for his characters. Casey Singleton is a single mother. John Marder (think \\"martyr\\") has his head on the block throughout the story. And, of course, Bob Richman is disgustingly wealthy. They seem a little too corny to be coincidences."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read. It is exellent the way all of the problems comes together to be solved. I hope many people read this book. It teaches you not to give up when things are at there worst."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This being my first Michael Crichton book to read, I was thrilled and surprised with the intensity with which I read it. I was captivated the entire time and found it difficult to put down. Even with all of the technical jargon I was unfamiliar with, I found it to be an excellent book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was typical Crichton, an easy read, good facts, and a great thriller. Though it could have went farther especially with character development and tying up loose ends, the story is so good that it makes up for any shortcommings that may arise. Some have said this is like Disclosure at 30,000 feet, and true it is very much like Disclosure which is also a great novel. For Crichton fans, buy it and read it. For everyone else, its a great summertime read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is one of those books in which you can't put it down. Things just keep happening and you want to read on to see what happenes. I'd recommend this book over Jurassic and The Lost World. The author knows almost nothing about dinos. (who does?) I feel by this book that Crichton does know alot about airplanes and does a good job describing things about the work in a jumbo jet plant."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book was fantastic a lot of action and very realistic. The book was about an airplane that has problems in midair. Three people are dead fiftyseven injured. Now it is up to Casey Singleton to find out what happend. She only has two weeks before a major busness deal takes place."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book will keep you reading on until the very last page......really exciting and thrilling. I must say this is about the best of Michael Crichton. I'm not a Crichton fan, and I think his novels like Jurassic Park and the Lost World are absolutely ridiculous, but deifinitely not this book. Airframe is quite different from the others, at least it's PRETTY realistic. And it's quite amazing that Crichton can know so much about airplanes and stuff. Anyway, it's worth reading, so buy it now!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Another great one from MC, I t seems like he sat down, read everything he could about airplanes, then figured out an accident that could happen. Only Crichton could make planes this exciting without a crash involved. I did a book report on this book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton delivers a another great novel. I like the way he portrayed the main character Casey Singleton. She is portrayed in a strong way, not as a helpless female. He gives you all of the clues up front, and then ties them all together at the end of the book. He does a great job of making technical information interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a great Who-Dunnit."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"After I picked this book up and startedto read the first few chapter I started to thinkto myself &quot; A lot of technicalites and a lotof abriviations i have to remmber&quot; But afterI got though that and got into the book Iabsolutely love it.

It can get a litte monotonous sometimes, but for the most part it is exciting and a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael brings it all home in this master piece, a genuine thriller that has you riveted to the edge of your seat until the end. If you liked his other books, you'll love Airframe. A must read, I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is a great detailed, fictional novel that gives you a behind the scene look into the Airplane Contractor Business and the problems that are dealt with when the plane is on flight. The graphic and articulate details makes it easier for the reader to understand. The way the entire mystery climbs up to the climax makes the novel more and more interesting. Casey Singleton plays a major factor in the novel as a Qualitive Assurance rep in the Incident Review Team. As she tries tremondously hard to solve the case, someone that is involved in the scenerio tries to keep information from her in solving what happened during TransPacific 545 was in flight."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I would not recommend this book to others because I thought it was a little boring. The beginning and the end are superb but the middle is slow. Maybe it is suited for the people that like repetitive and detailed detective work, but for the rest of us, that like action and exciting entertainment, this book isn't suited for us. Over all, I wouldn't recommend this book. The story is basically about a plane that crashes in an extremely weird way. The Vice President of the plane's company tries to find out why three people died and fifty six got injured. This is a problem that is very hard and time consuming, as well as page consuming. The first pages of the book get you involved in certain characters and are packed with excitement. The middle pages change to totally different characters and are more about plane parts like, wing slats, than people. Also I didn't like the slow progress of the team of investigators. The best aspect of the book is that the beginning gets your attention and makes you want to keep reading. Also, the end is very clever and enjoyable. This is the way that, in my opinion, all good books should be. But the worst aspect of the book is that the follow up to the plane crash is slow, repetitive, boring, and un-enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a long time fan of Michael Crichton's work. From the first big book I ever read (Jurassic Park) in 5th grade to the most recent I've read, which happens to be Airframe, I still have yet to read a boring book of his. Airframe is one of his better works. A plane goes through a disastrous turn of events during a routine pan-pacific flight, killing some passangers. Now the company must figure out what has happened before a big sale of aircraft to China blows over. Annoying reporters, conspiracy craving executives, and an exciting plot make this an edge of your seat page turner. I couldn't put the book down. I loved every page of it. Definately a must buy for aerospace and Crichton fans."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Happy Book."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I cant beleive how accurate the information in this book is.

Technically complicated but nothing can prepare you for what happens at the end! A total twist!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book gives me the urge to write myself. Probably because I think I could do better. The characters are as thin and underdeveloped. This is the first Crichton book I've read. I thought I might enjoy it since I work in the aerospace industry. The technical details are accurate but not impressive."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I found it to be very technicaly entertaining. The detail about the plane seemed very convincing. Michael must have done his homework. I will never fly charter again!!!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I've been a fan of Michael Crichton for years now and all I can say is he keeps getting better and better. Airframe has just the right mix of scientific and technological elements, as well as character development, action, and a surprisingly plausible plotline. Though I wouldn't go as far to say that after reading Airframe, you will never want to fly again, it will make you think. The book details how many things which could go wrong, but usually never do. Such things as counterfeit parts are fairly common when dealing with airplanes. This book has a lot of fact, you may learn more about planes than you ever wanted to."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is a great combination of two different types of writing. The way that the thrilling half of the book interacts with the technical half is outstanding, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the read. Crichton ties it all together with a great, unexpected ending, which makes this book one of the best he's ever written."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was a short read and I enjoyed it, especially toward the end when I wanted to finish it and find out what caused the plane to crash. There are definitely better books to read, but this novel was very informative about the airline industry, and I enjoyed that."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"a good, fast paced thriller, starring a great heroine, and other good supporting characters. the storyline is intriguing and exciting, and crichton wraps it up with a great ending, contrary to some of his previous books."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"If life were as simple as most soap operas you wouldn't need to bother with that techno babble.

But in the real world, mid-airs happen. And this book is written for those who want to get into understanding Why, and how to prevent them from happening! Use your imagination: aircraft collisions are messy and cause lots of Owees, and the stuff of real-life tragedy that soap operas try to talk about. Walk in Michael Crighton's character's shoes for awhile and he will have made a difference in your life."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A terrific, yet typical, Crichton novel.

His attention for detail gives you new insight into the airline industry. This detail gave relevancy of this story for me."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This fast moving mystery thriller is Michael Crichton at or near his best. The setting is within an aircraft company, ostensibly about aircraft safety. However, the theme goes far beyond that. Aircraft safety issues are raised, but read carefully and you will find the story more about the media and business. I especially enjoy the epilogue to the end of the story. It concludes the action and suspense with some provoking ideas that enrich the book. If you are looking for action, adventure, mystery, and an intelligent hero(ine), this book is a sure winner."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"FOR SOMEONE WHO FLIES A LOT, AND IS ALWAYS AFRAID, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. BUT CONTRARY TO WHAT I THOUGHT, I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. CRICHTON IS KNOWN FOR HIS DETAIL, AND HE DOESN'T FAIL HERE. I LEARNED A LOT AND REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT IS A FAST READ AND A RELATIVELY GOOD STORY. TWICE I THOUGHT I HAD THE STORY FIGURED OUT, BUT TWICE I WAS WRONG."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"It has become a standard for Michael Crichton to thoroughly investigate the scientific aspects of his stories and then wrap this knowledge within the context of a mystery/thriller. In Airframe, the story is predictable and the science not that exciting.

This book is going to be a multi-million dollar movie..."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Crichton's detailed description is ever-present in this reality check novel, however his great sense for action seems to be absent. The entire topic of airline scandal is perhaps weak, and already overexploited by the media. The topic is obviously a personal interest of Crichton's, and the book reflects heavy research, but is only exciting to a certain degree. A fairly dry read for Crichton fans, but overall an OK read."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book not only deals with office politics but also deals with the way the media handles situation. This book is gripping and has some very intense moments, but i found the ending to be very disappointing. There was no new insight into anything and the final revalation was a complete letdown. I have read all of his books and this is better than some but not as good as others."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This book has less to do with actual airframes and airliners as the title may suggest, but more to do with American office politics. It is set at 'Norton Aircraft', a fake company. This takes away the reality for the educated reader. Roughly 300 pages are quite boring, yet the slow build-up stops you putting this book down. Despite the simple text, the partitioning of chapters makes for awkward reading. The characters and scenes are square, yet this is reassuring, for the whole thing is a saga devoted at getting at the truth. In general a good read, 'Airframe' always leaves you guessing and hungry for the next piece of information to complete the picture. If you like airplanes or work in similar high-powered industrial office conditions this may be the book for you."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I listened to this book on tape for the first time and it was so good that I bought the paperback. The book doesn't let you down for a moment. From the beginning with the situation of the passengers aboard a trans-Pacific flight to near the end when the media gets ready to grab the &quot;real&quot; story, Casey Singleton, with her cool professionalism never lets you down. Casey discovers that there are corporate secrets within the &quot;structure of Airframe&quot;, but with her wit and savey you will be pulled through to a great ending.

Given my love of aviation and my zest for thrillers, it was a natural.The story takes twists and turns that aren't even slightly expected. Hypotheses disappear, as does evidence. The end of the story--the truth--catches the reader off guard.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked up at an aircraft and wondered how it stays up there."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I've read all of Crichton's fictional books, this was the least interesting by far. His early works are the best. I read the first 150 pages and then skipped the next 200, skimming the final chapters. Forget about this one, unless you work for an airline."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I recently read this book, and it is fantastic! Aside from the constant swearing, a flawless publication. A must read for Crichton fans!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a risk assessment engineer and have measured the risk of accidents (aerospace, chemical and nuclear). I know that the true true risks (or lack thereof) of many new technologies never get properly communicated to the public because of media-bias and media's hunger for sensationalism. The media is interested in the gore and attention-grabbing details, while caring little for the disservice done to society as a result of premature retirement of excellent technologies. In this context, Michael Crichton does an excellent job of delving below the surface of a media story taking shape. Excellent read! I wish the public relied less on the popular media for obtaining information on technological risks, and made objective decisions based on their own research. Sadly, this is not going to happen anytime soon. Kudos to Crichton!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I felt that this book had gave us more information about the current state of the media in the US then it did with the aircraft. It is a book that anyone concerned with fairness in journalism should read. It has something for the airplane enthusiast and the media enthusiast in all of us."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe captivated my attention after just reading one page. The suspense and drama of Airframe captures the reader's mind as the plot thickens. There isn't one dull moment in the book...not even when it comes to those long, technical descriptions of machines, charts, and numbers Michael Crichton includes in all of his books. In fact, if you read the technical details of Airframe closely you may be able to solve the mystery of the novel long before the main character, Casey Singleton, does.The main character was one of my favorite things about the book. Smart, tomboyish, courageous, determined, and hardworking all describe Casey Singleton. Her life describes the lives of females who work in jobs that are usually held by men. She proves that she can do her job just as well as the men she works with can.Overall, I strongly suggest Airframe for all fans of Michael Crichton novels."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Give it to Mike, he will write about it. Most authors now days just develop a formula and just pump out he books one after the other. That is one of the reasons I always give him a little slack, he tries to take on new and different themes and topics - ok the T Rex books are all about a new vacation home. I am a bit of an airplane junky and read a good amount on the industry so I loved the extra details he throws in, it gives the book more depth without slowing it down at all. The book also has a good, thriller type of pace that keeps you interested. The only draw back I have is that maybe he could give us more on he characters, a little back story or maybe a sub plot of two. Becuase the story is very straight forward and not complicated with anything extra it reads easy, if that is what your looking for this is an integrating book"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"***** LOOKOUT for the review by Lauren Brown. Her 2nd paragraph is pure spoilers!! *****While not in the same league as many of Crichton's earlier novels, the story is enjoyable enough as it is. I felt empathy for the main character and appreciated all the obstacles she ran into. I learned some neat stuff about commercial planes and aviation. Don't worry, it's quite easy to follow for anyone of reasonable intelligence.I especially liked the last 50 pages or so, as he really brought the story in for a rapid landing (get it? ;-)If you read real carefully on the last page or so, you get a good chuckle when you realize what the \\"official report\\" actually said (and WHY it was said that way)."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Only Michael Crichton could make the investigation of an airplane crash interesting.

Only Crichton could construct this novel. Taking a perfectly plausible idea, and turning it into an action and information packed page-turner.Its apparent Crichton has two things going for him - he can write fluidity, and he can write informatively. He brings the user to world of aviation without confusing or boring the reader. More importantly, he can do it while incorporating it into excitement and intrigue of the plot. This is classic Crichton.This is a great, though non-typical mystery. It's not a who done it, but why it happened mystery. This book is not all great however. It is, after all, a book revolving around the aftermath of an airplane crash in an aviation company. The ending is a little unsatisfying, the main character evokes no feeling, and the aggressiveness of the Unions is not too believable.It's a very good book, but it's not in the class of Sphere or The Great Train Robbery."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Fifty-nine casualties. Severe problems in the cockpit. The interior destroyed. Yet somehow, the pilot successfully lands the plane. When a jet liner from Hong Cong to Denver hits disaster, it is up to TransPacific airlines to see why and how the plane was virtually destroyed. However, a nosy reporter might beat them to the solution. Everything is put on the line when a drastic test is done to keep TransPacific and Norton Aircraft's squeaky clean reputation. Even though I didn't enjoy &quot;Airframe&quot; as much as some of Crichton's other masterpieces, this was suspenseful nonetheless. A New York Time's bestseller, this is a must-read about safety and death in the skies; a thrilling work of art that will keep you on the edge of your seat. (Hint: don't read this when you're on an airplane like I did. The result isn't too good.)"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Coming from a background in aircraft maintenance, it is great to see a story like this come along that not only kept my attention but didnt put me off with an over abundance of deep technical jargon. Great characters and briliantly constructed story, a job well done for Mr. Crichton"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I am a HUGE Michael Crichton fan, and I was absolutely thrilled when I picked up a copy of Airframe...coming off what I thought was a perfect sequel to Jurassic Park, I figured that he was on a roll. To say that Crichton does his homework on his subjects is like saying a brain surgeon must do a little schooling in order to perform operations...this is NOT in debate. I found the research to be absolutely facinating, and if I were to judge Airframe based on pure background work, it'd be a 5-Star plus novel...however I am somewhat more picky and base my reviews on the total package, and in that, I am sorely afraid that Airframe left me wanting. That isn't to say that it isn't a facinating and fun read, but compared to some of his other novels, it just fell short--for ME anyway.I would be hard pressed to cite specific details of the 'why' but based upon content, the storyline and the ultimate outcome of the novel, I just felt that it left me flat. It starts off as exciting as pretty much any of his previous novels, and the investigation following the *incident* is thoroughly entertaining--but even though I can't seem to put my finger on exactly what it is, Airframe just didn't do *it* for me. I must say however, that his next novel, 'Timeline', was a very pleasant surprise, one that I enjoyed very much."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Another nearly excellent thriller from Crichton, he's done his homework on the subject again (the ins and outs of the airline production and sales market), and provides the reader with a decent amount of suspense. Although it's a very decent read, somehow this book doesn't quite do it for me (but then I'm overly critical), characters don't seem to make much impact or get little or no real explanation: making it difficult to really sympathise with any of them. Nuff' said about the cons', cause in all honesty Crichton has once again made himself a nifty, quite unpredictable thriller wich will leave you thinking how the mystery of the fateful flight 545 could have been so simple. This is what the writer does best, boggle you with little clues all the way through, not letting you in on things the characters already know, and finally delivering an outright frustratingly logical explanation. Don't let me put you off with my habitually harsh low rating, this one is worth a read!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Michael Chricton seems to be on a roll, and his books keep getting more interesting. Although not his best ever, airframe balances techincal and buisness information with a thrilling plot and a mystery. A definate must-buy for fans of Chricton."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I love this book and i understood it perfectly since im studying for a job in the aviation field."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Because I didn't like this book at all. It was bogged down w/ technical jargon. It didn't refer to the underlying intrigue enough. The only reason I continued w/ the book is because I kept thinking it would get better. The ending was okay, but not worth reading all the other boring chapters to get to it. This is the first Crichton book I read and I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Great characters, great story with lots of the usual Crichton detail. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A must read ***** superb storytelling by Crichton. The best book by him. A great ending to boot."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"... only behind by Sphere (I recommed that as well). Airframe is an accurately told story with some of the best characters in history, and by far the author's best characters (except for in Sphere). Interesting points and humorous sterotypes towards the reporters. Crichton HIMSELF said that he believed ALL reporters are that way."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"A very enjoyable book yet not one of Crichton's best. But fun nonetheless..."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"So far, I have become a Crichton fanatic, reading THE LOST WORLD, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, and JURASSIC PARK. All of them being good (some being better than others), but this being the best, I zipped through it in a few days, never knowing what was going to happen yet, getting fascinated in Airplanes while I notice the excellent storytelling by Micheal Crichton.He gives accurate detail, a solid story, and the best characters he's made yet.Slowly but surely, I believe his SPHERE will beat this out as my favorite book written by him (I haven't finished it yet), but for now, it's his best book.I wish I never finished it because I wanted it to go one forever.I especially liked the way he played Dick Shenk, Jennifer Malone, and Mardy Reardon out. It seemed just like the way reporters would be.Excellent book, Crichton's best."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This is a superb book, with a clever ending. However, the audio cassette version unfortunately does not make sense - it wasn't until I read the book to see what was missing that the reason the Newsline story could not legally be aired.

If you are looking for a action packed thriller, this is not the one you want; if you are not, you just can't miss this one"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I bought Airframe unsure of what exactly to expect and I wasreally impressed. Among all the books I pick up I can honestly say there are not very many that really keep you riveted to the book to see what happens next. Airframe is definitely one of them. I found it easy reading and very intriguing with some very interesting comments about the power and purpose of the media in our days. It makes one view the news in a slightly more cautious and thoughtfulmanner.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Poor Michael Crichton! He's fallen into temptation! Temptation of the big $$$ that the movie industry pays him to translate his latest novel into a screenplay. I remember Jurassic Park. It was a novel I just couldn't put down. I read it in 10 hours! Its sequel, The Lost World, was slightly disappointing after the tense thiller that proceeded it, and Congo, well, let's not get into that. I have many Crichton novels, and some are hit and miss, but none so disappointing as AIRFRAME.I'm married to a pilot, and read aloud the situations in which Casey Singleton found herself. We had a good laugh at this one! And contrary to what some of your &quot;book reveiwers&quot; say, American aviation is safe... real safe, as Michael Chrichton knows and which is why he wrote about it. Unfortunatly this book followed the TWA Flight 800 disaster. I'm sure many of your readers expected something quite similar in plot. Must say though, Michael, that you hit it on the nail when you portrayed the press. BRAVO! I too enjoyed the chapter with the reporter tossing her cookies! (realistic to have her aboard? NEVER!)Was so looking forward to this book, only to be greatly disappointed. (This book was a Christmas gift too!) Sure hope you can come up with something that is written for the reader (remember us, your loyal fans?) and NOT for the big screen!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is a very enjoyable and exciting book but will not be remembered as much as other books by Michael Crichton. An interesting and very promising plot is somewhat underdeveloped and the characters, specially the main ones are not as smart as we expect. It is a bit tiring to keep reading all the data about planes when we soon learn that the solution lies elsehwere. In a way, it can be said that the book lacks some magic in it, dealing with a subject closer in extreme to our daily lives. In this sense, it reasembles Rising Sun, but it misses the novelty of the former subject. Closing up, Airframe is a nice book, but not one who drives us with excitement and passion as (easy one to guess) Jurassic Park"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Casey Singleton, divorced and mother of one child, vice president of Norton Aircraft.

The novel picks up right on the first page and doesn't stop until it's over. It includesa commercial plane disaster, a local union on edge, hard-core press interviews, and an intelligentprotagonist, Katherine Singleton.The story starts off aboard Transpacific Airlines Flight 545 as an unidentified error takes placeduring the flight causing the plane to shake violently and dive. Passengers and luggage are being thrownaround the plane like pinballs. The pilot is able to safely land the Norton N-22 widebody at a Los Angelesairport. Three are dead and many more are injured.Meanwhile Norton Aircraft is on the verge of a multi-million dollar deal with a Chinesecompany interested in purchasing some of their planes. The Local Union is also upset because of rumorsthat the wing of a plane is being sent to China and that they will be laid off. They will do anything ittakes to slow production and keep the wing. Kasey Singleton is now in charge of finding out whathappened on Flight 545 and that the China deal doesn't fall through. Can the single mother do it? Whatcaused the crash? You'll have to read Michael Crichton's bestseller Airframe to find out."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"With all the hype and tension the real life media is creating about the &quot;dangers&quot; of flying, Crichton has attempted to take it one step further. However, the poor character development does not help the weak story line. If you are looking for something to do to kill time, this is the ticket. It seemed to me that he is just writing to get another movie deal"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"I think that it is the greatest book. He really knows how describe the situation. You might need to know some air plane lingo like fdr=flight data recorder, it tell's you every thing you need to useally once so you should remeber them but it's not important. Just again read the book if you don't you are missing a great thing"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"This was the first book that I have ever read by the author Michael Crichton.I expected a little more than the book actually delivered. I expected thebook to be very suspenseful and action filled but unlike for instance,Jurassic Park, there is alot more talk than there is action. While it isinteresting enough to read it is not at all a suspenseful book - mostlyit just covers an avation group as they try to uncover the mystery of whyone of their planes had a very bumpy ride. There was reported turbulence butturbulence doesnt usually kill people as it does in this story. So CaseySingleton must find out what happened in that plane and why. There is alotof technical jargon in the book having to do with the different part ofairplanes and it can be a little overwhelming. But I did keep up with thebook and amazingly enough, it captured my attention long enough so thatI finished within a couple of days.If you are going to read this book just keep in mind thatit is not really heartpounding action or daring suspense,but it is interesting enough to read if you would likesomething different!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"When reading Michael Crichton, you expect to be either turning pages as fast as possible or doing extensive research on the latest scientific phenomenon. Both of which are OK. But Chricton fails to do either in Airframe, which never makes it off of the ground.You really don't ever find excellent character development in a Chricton novel and usually it is OK, but here it hurts him. Introductions to characters are short and trivial. My reccomendation to the author is to get back to the basics. Either research or suspense, but not an imbetween attempt at both.I'd love to see Mr. Chricton write an eerie novel surrounding the subject of cloning. Talk about possibilities. -Matt Perrron"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"AIRFRAME STARTS WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS, BUT UNFORTUNITLY FAILS TO FINISH WITH THE BANG IT WANTS TO. AN ENTERTAINING READ, BUT I EXPECTED BETTER FROM THE USUALLY MAGNIFICANT CRICHTON."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Airframe is pretty much in keeping with Michael Crichton's usual fare (except for the trully dreadful &quot;Lost World&quot;),i.e. its a ripping good yarn. There are a few things that bother me about it in general though. As usual he has a political agenda. I find him xenophobic to say the least. While his writing style is pretty awful, he does manage to keep you riveted for the entire novel. Unfortunately the best place to read this book is probably on a long flight, but that seems to be quite out of the question."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Is this the author of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;?For once,the cover is better than the book. This is typical Arthur Hailey fare with the mandatory weakplot and lots of jargon.The only redeeming feature is the well-sketched characters who manage to live up to real personas.The climax is banal and disappointing, to say the least.Good for a relaxedread and a temporary memory."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Following the lukewarm reception of &quot;The Lost World,&quot; Crichton has penned a new offering in a different vein: aviation safety. Despite the potential that would seem to exist with such a topic, the book is rather mediocre.The biggest flaw in this work (and, I daresay, in the majority of Crichton's work) is that the characters are stereotyped to the nth degree. I think of myself as having an active imagination, yet none of the characters in this book stick in my mind. Come to think of it, almost none of the book does.The main thing I noticed, when I finished the book, was that IT HAD NO CLIMAX WHATSOEVER. It was altogether quite unexciting, so much so that I didn't even stay awake to ponder the novel, as I usually do when I finish a book. I climbed into bed, turned out the light, and went right to sleep.Attention to detail is an important tool for a writer. Attention to technical detail is quite something else, and Crichton lays it on with a trowel, especially in the early chapters. Crichton readers will know that this is one of his defining characteristics, and shows up in almost all his work, but I personally got tired after reading, for the third time: &quot;She knew that a COW was a Completely Opened Window, and in most cases not utilized during high-altitude flight, but some manufacturers chose to employ it on shorter flights, because of the...&quot; I strongly believe that entire paragraphs should not be devoted to technical details.All things considered, &quot;Airframe&quot; defines light reading.

It happened to be Airframe, and I casually read the first page, then the second, then the third...Soon I couldn't put it down and had to take it home with me. My friend would just have to wait and finish it himself later!What really caught my interest in Airframe was how Crichton's language was so easy to understand. I knew nothing about airplanes, yet was able to comprehend the technical language, which definitely increased my appreciation for the story's suspenseful nature. I would recommend this for anyone who likes a realistic suspenseful book, but beware of friends who pick it up to read &quot;JUST ONE PAGE!"},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"Crichton being Crichton has added aviation to his list of techno-conquests. Surely he will come full circle and do one set in outer and maybe inner space as it remains to be seen. However...please make sure a character that is dead, stays dead. On page 15 Casey's mom died when she was an infant, so Casey was raised by a household of men. Unless daddy lied, about her mother, she's back! On page 248 (first paragraph) Casey tells herself she'd better get some sleep. She didn't want her mother to call afterward (afterlife?) saying, &quot;Dear, you looked so tired...&quot;Casey...&quot;What about you mom?&quot;Or...Casey faints dead away.Still a good story but leave mom in the movie, she can take care of the daughter."},{"Title":"Airframe","review":"The book is well written but readers should be aware that a general knowledge how a plane is made, why it flyes, what is avionic is NECESSARY !

Both sides of most issues were presented.It was enough for the reader to realize the airplane industry is veryvery complex and solutions are not easy.

You're going to give this a chunk of your most valuable possession: your time. You assume that someone held this up to some objective standards for quality. You put your faith in the publisher and the editor, assuming that if the author himself has somehow lost his bearings, they'll put him right. They wouldn't send it off to the printer with huge glaring plot holes, massive inconsistencies, multitudinous loose ends unresolved, and heaps of just plain nonsense never explained. I wish I could get back the money I paid for this book and I wish I could get back the time I wasted reading it. The author, publisher and editor all owe us an apology for passing off this lazy, self-indulgent piece of sloppiness as a whole, entire novel.*massive spoilers ahead* Imagine any doctor anywhere observing a patient who can voluntarily manipulate the muscles of his forehead to form shapes approximating letters -- and never reporting it to anyone! On what planet? People see wings and birds that aren't there -- even photograph them! But nobody says nor does anything about it. Useless characters clutter up the story along with useless description about them, their lives, their clothing, their thoughts -- and it all leads to nothing. Carl Jung is content to disregard the fact that a woman killed in an avalanche had the great good luck to have written a farewell letter before heading out that day. Was this just a handy coincidence? Apparently so. And then there's Jung's wife with all those journals. After she miscarried, she just lost interest in those fantastic journals and no doubt put them away in a shoebox somewhere and forgot about them, right? Cuz they were never mentioned again. Right.I admire what the author set out to do. It was a tantalizing premise, a great idea, and Findley launched it in good order, but it absolutely fell apart in the last pages of the book. I was frustrated and miffed. It was a good story, I'd become emotionally invested in the outcome, and so I wanted RESOLUTION. Do we not deserve that?

Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many.

The The White Company was written before Sir Nigel; however, Sir Nigel (Nigel Loring) is set earlier and should be read first. Although famous for Sherlock Homes, Doyle was knighted for his historical novels of which these are two. Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery.

Alleyene intervenes, which causes his brother to set dogs upon him. Alleyene then decides to become a squire to a knight, the knight happens to be the beautiful young lady's father.

Some soldiers called Alleyene weak because he dwelled on the horrors of war, but Alleyenes friend explained his weakness. &quot; It is not weakness of heart, for I know the lad well. His heart is as good as thine or mine, but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine, as a consequence he can see further into things, so that they weigh upon him more.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings the story alive with vivid detail and characterization.

Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been.

I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Chivalry may be on life support, but it's still breathing in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect. One cannot, however, overlook or underestimate Doyle's brilliant use of medieval language in his dialogue, nor the sheer color of his vivid descriptions. This is a timeless book; one to get yourself lost in."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"This books is definitely the stuff of childhood dreams and imagination. Who among you can say they have never imagined themselves playing the part of the intrepid knight battling injustice or the damsel awaiting the return of his true love? The book follows the progress of an adventurous monk that has left the cloister and hitched his wagon to Sir Nigel's White Company, a group of English mercenaries seeking fight and fortune in France and Spain. Those young at heart will especially enjoy this tale. It is gripping without being brutal but with the endearing quality of a bed time or fireside tale."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I loved this book as a kid, and found new depths to it when I came back to it as an adult. A must-read! The breadth of imagination and the color and vividness of the descriptions are hard to match, and the characters are memorable -- Samkin Aylward the master-archer is my favorite."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"The White Company is one of those books which lies completely below the radar. While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing. Upon asking a defeated French foeman to deliver a message to his fiancee: &quot;Do you know the way to Southampton?&quot; &quot;Why yes, only last year I helped burn it down.&quot;"},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I discovered the White Company while reading Louis Lamour's \\"Education of A Wondering Man\\". It was included in Lamours reading list from the 1930's. On a lark i checked it out.What a gem this book is! I simply could not put it down. The language, the characters, the history and the humor simply crackle off the pages.If you have a son, here's your next gift."},{"Title":"The White Company (Great illustrated classics)","review":"A wonderful, charming book. The characters are rich in detail while the dialog is snappy and often hysterical.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2005 (The Best American Series)","review":"This year's editor Jamaica Kincaid has done an excellent job of choosing essays that, more than chronicle exotic journeys, speak about the perplexities of the human condition as her selections are often scabrous, sardonic, and emphasize the dangers and follies that roil beneath the surface of a travel itinerary. Here are some highlights:1. \\"War Wounds\\" by Tom Bissell. A son and father, a Vietnam vet, travel through the father's war trajectory forty years later as Bissell explores what it means to be the son of a \\"war wounded\\" father.2. \\"My Florida\\" by William E. Blundell. Famous for his book The Art of Feature Writing, Blundell has written my favorite essay in the collection. This is a gem of style, pungent, sarcastic, and wise. Blundell describes Florida as a place of grotesque indulgence for those geriatrics who decided to retire into a life of philistinism, tackiness, and decadence. A hilarious essay that would make Mark Twain proud.3. \\"A Really Big Lunch\\" by Jim Harrison. Novelist Jim Harrison proves to also be a rather unapologetic gourmand who describes with hilarity his glutton quests with fellow sensualists. Almost as funny as \\"My Florida.\\"4. \\"My Kindergarten\\" by Peter Hessler. Set in rural China, this is a sad but inspiring essay about a peasant family struggling to overcome a mentally-handicapped family member and a child with a near deadly blood disease. Hessler shows how peasants, held in contempt, and urban citizens, given proper medical care, are treated differently by the government.5. \\"My Thai Girlfriends\\" by Tom Ireland. An American living in Thailand, Ireland can't convince anyone that he is not a tomcat American embarking on a salacious quest in spite of his demure lifestyle.6. \\"If It Doesn't Kill You First\\" by Murad Kalam. A recent convert to Islam and novelist, Kalam chronicles his pilgrimage to Mecca and shows his struggle to navigate through excruciating ritual, fanatics, and Muslims who, like him, are sincere but scared living in a post 9/11 world.7. \\"Into the Land of Bin Laden\\" by Robert Young Pelton. The author shows how difficult it is to track Bin Laden in the no-man's land region of Taliban sympathizers and tribalists who afford great loyalty to the el Qaeda leader. He goes deep in the mountains of the Pakistan border and risks his life to tell his tale."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2005 (The Best American Series)","review":"I'm sorry. I haven't even completed the book. And,in fact, I may not complete it. There's too much to read to subject myself to such negativity. So, the search for stories for this book was for \\"rare pieces that weren't 'aggressively positive'; or that 'underline my sense of my displacement.'Give me a break!This is travel writing! \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" still stands out as my all-time favorite piece of travel writing. Please don't misunderstand - I read copious amounts of non-fiction, and sadly, the majority of that writing isn't positive - it's more investigative, historical material or the author has an ax to grind - as in Al Franken's latest book.But, what's wrong with picking up something to read that will provide a sense of joy or enlighenment? I don't care to read about how brutal Haiti's existence has been - I get quite enough of reality thru the Jim Lehrer Newshour.Don't waste your money if you're hoping for something light - that's for sure."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2005 (The Best American Series)","review":"Travel has become so much easier that it has made travel writing harder. Travel writers used to feed the imagination by tales of exotic places the reader could only dream of seeing, reached after long and arduous journeys. Simon Winchester's piece about Ascension Island and Ben Ryder Howe on the Darien Gap are the closest to being in that old-fashioned genre in this book. These days we can jet to Timbuctu or Samarkand and stay at the Holiday Inn.To make up for the lack of difficulty getting there, some places are so dangerous that accounts of them provide vicarious excitement. Madison Smart Bell in Haiti and Robert Young Felton on the NorthWest Frontier are in this category. A lesser degree of this is to make the destination sound so unpleasant that we feel good not being there. Seth Stevenson does this brilliantly about India. He should negotiate with the Indian Tourist Board to get bribed to keep quiet. Others to make you happy you stayed home are Peter Hessler (helping a sick child in China) and Murad Kalam on the Haj.Another gimmick is to stretch the definition of \\"travel writing\\". William Blundell, Ian Frazier, William Least Heat Moon, Pam Houston and John McPhee do not leave the United States. Bucky McMahon doesn't get anywhere. Frazier describes a trip from Montclair, New Jersey to Weehawken, New Jersey. No doubt this will intrigue Montclair residents who want to know what Weehawken is like. McPhee is wonderful at explaining complicated technology, and that's what he mostly does in his long piece about barges in the Mid-West. I always find reading McPhee rather hard work."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2005 (The Best American Series)","review":"This was a very interesting collection that once again made me tip my hat to the \\"Best American\\" series that Houghton Mifflin puts out. The pieces were almost all worth reading, and they ranged all over the world. There were articles that take place in Haiti, Vietnam, Florida, the West African coast, New Jersey, the Great Lakes, China, the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Panama, Saudi Arabia, the middle of the ocean, Afghanistan, the Scottish Highlands, and Tijuana. There were big names like Simon Winchester, William Vollmann, John McPhee, Thomas Kenneally, Pam Houston, Jim Harrison, and Madison Smartt Bell.Most of the pieces were were not intended for guidebooks, and deal with serious issues. One dealt with the world's dead and dying languages. Another discussed a few days spent with an American military intelligence man in the Middle East - I learned more from that one about what really goes on in those places than I have from hundreds of other news stories. Wacky and incredibly persistent William Vollmann goes on a quest to discover the hidden tunnels that Chinese immigrants supposedly used in Tijuana. William L. Heat-Moon goes on a quest to find some ciscos, once a popular fish for people's tables. Simon Winchester unintentionally spends some time in the tiny British territory of Asuncion Island, essentially a big dormant volcano sticking out of the sea. Murad Kalam describes a pilgrimmage to Mecca, and the chaos and suffering that he encounters there. J. Michael Fay describes efforts by environmentalists to protect the African coast and its creatures from exploitation. In a piece that I have read before, noted gourmand Jim Harrison describes a fantastic 37 course lunch, all based on ancient recipes, that he experienced at a French chateau. Ben Ryder Howe wanders around the wild, dangerous area between Panama and Colombia. Closer to home, Tom Bissell relates a trip he took to Vietnam with his macho, war veteran father; and William Blundell takes on Florida and his father's retirement years there.Most of it was fascinating and wonderfully written - travel journalism at its best."},{"Title":"Masters and Johnson on sex and human loving.","review":"This is a very good book, everyone should be well educated on sex, by reading books from people like Masters and Johnson. They are serious professionals on the issue, with countless researches. And as doctors we can rely on them. This book is written for all ages, since childhood to people over 45 years old. The sex life of my partner and I, changed incredibly. We are 58yo and 54 and we have been together for 9 months. As latinamericans had a lot of troubles with our sex life. But this book it is not important only for people like us. Every parent should read it and learn how to educate his (her) kids. every adolescent should read it too and learn how to avoid pregnancies in early stages of life."},{"Title":"Masters and Johnson on sex and human loving.","review":"Mentioning the work of William Masters and Virginia Johnson has to be like talking about Stephen Hawking: not only are they among the best known scholars of their time, but their works are among those most famous for being known but not read, except by other experts in the field. Their contributions in their respective fields have been immeasurable, but few of us laymen have attempted to read their work -- or if we did, we easily got lost in it (I've actually read some of both, but then I'm different). Still, this is really the only book that Masters and Johnson wrote for the rest of us. And it contains one compelling thing that's stuck with me over the years. That is: they documented that it doesn't matter whether a relationship starts out as purely sexual or purely romantic -- at some point, at least one of the two people will want at least some of the other element to develop in the relationship, and if that expectation isn't met, the relationship is in trouble and soon begins to wither and die unless the situation is reversed.That's complicated but important enough that I'm going to say it again. Whether you begin a relationship wanting only sex or only romance doesn't matter: if it lasts long enough (meaning longer than a few dates or a one-night stand), at least one of you will develop a reasonable expectation of some of the other factor -- in other words, if you began with only sex, one of you will, at some point, expect romance to develop, and if you began with only romance, at some point someone will want sex -- and if that expectation isn't met, the relationship is in trouble. Which leads us to wonder if serial monogamy isn't so foreign to human nature as the animal kingdom has led us to believe. Maybe that's one of the by-products of having a reasoning mind and sophisticated emotions, two things that come from the same part of the brain (the frontal lobes), and it's not the oldest, most primitive part, either. Masters and Johnson don't know brains and never worked with neurobiologists, but they do know bodies and human expectations, and this they have documented. And their contribution is significant, though not definitive.The part to remember is that human nature isn't fixed in stone: we are still evolving, and because of the nature of modern life, we may have more need of stable sexual relationships than ever before -- because they help us cope with the world and thrive. Other researchers have picked up where Masters and Johnson left off; we are all the better for their work. This is the only book of theirs that most of us need to read. And most of us should, with the caveat that there is still so much about human nature to be learned.My advice: if you really want to understand human sexuality and love, you have to take a broader look at it in the context of the human mind in all its aspects. Start here and read this Masters and Johnson book first, then read (in order) Shere Hite's The Hite Report: A National Study of Female Sexuality, Nathaniel Branden's books The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem and The Psychology Of Romantic Love, Daniel Goleman's two books Emotional Intelligence and Social Intelligence, and Ian Kerner's two books She Comes First and Passionista. Taken together, these eight books will tell you more about human love, sex and relationships than 25 years' worth of magazine articles or two decades of Oprah, Dr. Phil, Dr. Joyce Brothers or Dr. Oz. And unlike Oprah and the good doctors, you'll know that these eight are comprehensive, groundbreaking, and based on data, making them both thorough and reliable. In comparison, Oprah and Dr. Phil are wannabe nobodies and Dr. Joyce and Dr. Oz are underequipped.You have the list; now it's up to you, if you really want to learn."},{"Title":"The Clans, Septs and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands","review":"This book is a reference book, not something to read through for pleasure.

He plays a terror theme against the backdrop of actual history, using historic figures we all know and remember well. Reading his novel is like being a fly on the wall of private government chambers. We eavesdrop on conversations no one is meant to hear...ever. De Bono's research is so meticulous that as much as past presidents and their inner circles might like to sue him, the truth is not liable, and they cannot challenge this daring author's replica of word-for-word discussions behind closed doors, for freedom of information rights have given him access to records that speak for themselves.As much as a reviewer might be tempted to skim through this book, it's impossible, for every paragraph drips with such essential information that any point, if missed, destroys the reader's comprehension of the plot. As in his other books, De Bono's imagery is gripping, and the development of his characters wrings empathy for those who live in the secret world of commandos and government field agents. Their conditioning eventually whittles away their idealism, while they witness one political debacle after another yet become addicted to the adrenalin rush of battle in screwed-up \`black' missions that should destroy them except for their tenacious will to survive and their love of home.

After the failure of the Jacobite Rebellion, Prudence and Robin follow the orders of the their father and travel to London under the guise of Peter and Kate Merriot. The twist is that Prudence is disguised as the youthful buck, Peter Merriot, and Robin is dressed as the flirtatious young beauty, Kate Merriot. Prudence and Robin have had years of experience and practice in the arts of deception and disguise under their father's tutelage and this isn't their first dangerous caper.Prudence makes a very credible man with her sharp wit and fearless bravery; and since all gentleman at White's willingly accept her into their company, she feels her secret is safe. However, when she is around the respectable Sir Anthony Fanshawe, the big sleepy-eyed man who watches her intently, she feels her secret is anything but safe...After rescuing a young and romantic heiress, Letitia Grayson, from her abductor and thwarting their elopement, Robin finds himself enamored with this lovely damsel in distress. Unfortunately, because of his masquerade he finds himself in the position of Letita's bosom friend rather than her suitor. How will he ever be able to win Letita's heart when he is dressed as a woman and would she ever forgive him for his cruel deception?This escapade becomes even more exciting and entertaining when Prudence and Robin's father appears on the scene decked out like a grand gentleman and claiming to be the lost Viscount, Tremaine of Barham. If their father is successful in persuading everyone of this outlandish claim it would mean the end of their masquerade and the start of respectable living, and if he fails it would expose them all as frauds and land them in the gallows. Prudence and Robin are torn between a lack of faith in their father's capability to pull off such a ruse and a desperate desire that he will prevail. Their father, an extremely conceited yet comical character that is constantly amazed by his own genius, promises them: \\"I shall contrive.\\"Since \\"The Masqueraders\\" is only the second Georgette Heyer novel I have read, I consider myself to be Heyer novice. Nonetheless, I found this novel to be spectacularly entertaining and brimming with clever antics and adventures. At first, it was a little challenging for me to wrap my head around the gender switch and the disguises, but within a chapter or two I found it easy to follow. Included in this book were many beautiful and tender moments shared between the couples, however, being the romantic that I am, I would have enjoyed seeing how and why the characters fell in love being depicted more.\\"The Masqueraders was a delightfully amusing read and Georgette Heyer is quite the proficient when it comes to historical fiction and romantic romps. I highly recommend!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Try to imagine the rare delight of thinking you have already consumed all of Georgette Heyer's books and then finding this one waiting for you on the shelf of your local public library. While I'm fond of the historical novels, I have a soft spot for Heyer's romances, and this might be my new favorite, since it is classic Heyer with a Shakespearean twist. Resourceful, indomitable heroine in the form of Prudence Colney pretending to be Peter Merriot, young sprig of fashion; clever, likeable, treasonous brother Robin pretending to be the delectable Kate Merriot; taciturn and seemingly-bored-with-it-all hero who increasingly grows on us as we readers detect that the large man does indeed take in more than we think. The antics with this situation alone would be enough to make for a finely riotous read, but throw in the old gentleman with his pretensions and grandiose ideas, and you have a character only Heyer could write. There's another twist, too, in that this book has a real villain, the detestable Mr Markham, which rackets the tension up a notch; more than drawing room repartee or forays into disreputable parts of town, there are duels, kidnappings, sword fights, frustrated elopements, flights in the night, sudden reveals, and coach robberies--more than one! With the period detail and speech that make her characters spring to life, Heyer has woven a tale of high-spirited antics that gave me several moments of laughter and one or two of bated breath. I'm not the first to say it, but I agree: Heyer is the closest to Austen you'll ever get after Jane herself."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"It seemed remarkable that Heyer could have two siblings ofmarriageable age exchange apparent genders (supposedly so one of them couldescape being caught for a crime) and go out into London society, withno hint of sexual \\"impropriety\\". Much is made of their androgynousqualities. It reminded me a bit of Shakespeare's \\"Twelfth Night\\", butwithout anyone of the \\"wrong\\" gender falling in love with either ofthem. Instead the main lover sees through the disguise.Heyer seems to enjoy having her characters cross dress -- Leonie in\\"These Old Shades\\" does so for most of the book, but she is presentedas more of a child. Masquerades in general intrigue the author, as in\\"False Colors\\" where one twin takes the place of another for most ofthat book. These situations seeem to be ones Heyer can arrange to greatcomic effect.The language here seems more intensely distinctive than in some of theothers, with lots of very funny archaic expressions rather than justthe occasional word or phrase for effect.I would not say that this is a typical Regency novel, but it's veryamusing and a fun read. There are some terrific swashbuckling scenesof duels.The first chapter is hard to get into becauseof all the different names whizzing by (because of the cross dressing).Just push on. I would also love to see a movie!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"I just want to join the bandwagon.While I've long since given up on the romance-series novels (ie, Harlequin and Silhouette), I keep going back to Georgette Heyer, even decades after I read my first one way back in the early 60s. Her stories are hopelessly romantic, unfailingly optimistic, endearingly entertaining and one hundred percent fiction. She writes the most delightful escapist literature and I am always happy to escape into her happy, romantic, make-believe world."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"This is one of the last Georgette Heyer novels that I got round to reading - it seemed hard to get hold of at local libraries. Having now read it, I can't understand why it is not more popular as I believe it's one of Heyer's better books. Although in some ways it bears similarity to Powder & Patch in terms of language (and I wasn't too keen on that book), the plot is far more enjoyable and twisted.It helps to know that the two characters we meet at the beginning, Mr Peter Merriott and Miss Kate Merriott, are actually sister and brother in disguise. \\"Peter\\" is actually Miss Prudence and her brother, who was involved in the Jacobite rebellion and is therefore in some danger, disguises himself as a woman. Heyer gives us a few clues as to how this is successful - Robin (the brother) is unusually short for a man, it's the era when women painted their faces, he wears tight corsets, but overall this is a slight weakness in the plot, as is the thought that a woman dressed in man's clothes would pass for a man over a period of several weeks. One just glosses over it, however, and enjoys the fun of the masquerade as Prudence, dressed up as Peter Merriott, gets involved in London society and visits Gentlemen's clubs, challenges a man to a duel and finds herself in love with a very tall man who has befriended her - as Peter. Her brother Robin also falls in love with a young lady he rescued and it's the tortuous ways in which the young couple perform their masquerade which adds to the fun. Their father appears who is the mastermind behind their plans, and claims that he is a Viscount; there is much humour in the scenes with him as he is such an egocentric character.The highlight of the book for me is the interaction between Prudence, disguised as Mr Peter Merriott, and Sir Anthony Fanshawe, with whom she falls in love. These two characters are well-portrayed and come across as well-suited when the final unmasking takes place.I heartily recommend this book for a great fun read with interesting characters set in a fascinating period of English history."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"THIS INGENIOUS STORY OF MS.

I had forgotten just how good this book is. I couldn't contain my snort laughter and giggles from erupting while reading this book.Any fans of Jane Austen will love this book and it's steady wit and history. Any fans of intelligent dialogue should make this a part of their library.Another thing I love about Mrs. Heyer's books is that they are all CLEAN! There is no illicit or graphic scenes and I LOVE that. It's so much more true to the times, and I don't EVER have to feel embarrassed to read them in front of others.I highly recommend any of Georgette Heyer's romances to lovers of the written word!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"This Heyer book combines two of her story types into one double-barrelled romance. Masterful, dashing Robin woos a tender fragile flower who needs protecting, while his sister Prudence the steady and humorous is met and matched by a large unflappable man.Of course, this is all complicated by the siblings' chequered past, complicated disguises, and need to conceal themselves.Prudence spends much of her courtship with Sir Anthony disguised as a young man, and it's interesting to me that it would be so easy to read Miles as bisexual, equally happy with a young man or a young woman. I am morally certain that was not Heyer's intention, but once a text escapes into the wild, it is prone to all sorts of interpretations.&lt;cite>\\"You are very kind, Sir Anthony -- to an unknown youth.\\"\\"I believe I remarked to you once that I have an odd liking for you little man. One of these strange twists in one's affection for which there is no accounting. If I can serve you at any time I desire you let me know it.\\"&lt;/cite>At that point, Anthony has invited Prudence to his country house, and she has declined because... scandal! But it's a very flattering offer to the young man she is pretending to be. Later, Anthony claims that he detected her gender very early, but he is pretty pressing in his invitation, if so.Since this is a romance, of course all the tangled threads are brought together in a neat and satisfactory embroidery. Masqueraders is one of my favorites because I feel like no one is compromising themselves in any of the romances. Everyone ends up better than they started, with good prospects for the future.Read if: You like swashbuckling, swordfights, and heroines who are clear on how to knock a man off.Skip if: You like your gender roles all neat and tidy, you don't read romance for the drama."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Although Georgette Heyer is best known for her Regency novels, The Masqueraders is one of her occasional books set in some other time and/or place. Although the year is never referenced, judging by the description of clothing and the fact that it is set shortly after one of the failed Jacobite rebellions in England, I would place it in the mid-1700s.In The Masqueraders we meet Mr. and Miss Merriott, a young brother and sister on their way to London. Shortly into the story -- in chapter 3 -- the reader discovers that Mr. Peter Merriott is actually Miss Prudence Colney and Miss Merriott is actually her brother Robin (the way Heyer reveals this is a bit cryptic; had I not read the blurb on the back cover I think I might have had some difficulty in making sense of it). Having participated to some degree in the late Jacobite uprising, they are wanted fugitives: hence their elaborate masquerade. They are to stay in London with a family friend who knows their true identities, there to await the arrival of their father, an adventurer (translation: con artist) who has led his children through numerous escapades all over Europe their entire young lives.The plan is that Prudence and Robin will keep a low profile; however, starting with the opening scene when they rescue a pretty young miss from the brutish man who is attempting to abduct her, they do anything but. They soon find themselves in more entanglements than they ever bargained for. And then to top it off, their father arrives with a huge splash on the London scene, claiming to be the long-lost Viscount Tremaine. In the meantime, both Robin and Prudence have fallen in love, and it appears that at least one of their love interests has figured out that they are not who they are pretending to be. Will they ever be able disengage themselves from this elaborate masquerade and settle down to a respectable life of true happiness?To enjoy this book, I think the reader first has to suspend all expectation of realism; it is impossible to believe that a young man, in particular, could have passed himself off convincingly in drag in 18th century England, and Heyer fails to convince, skipping over many details as she does. However, if you just accept that this is a fun and fanciful adventure, if not a realistic one, then you should enjoy the ride. Heyer's old-fashioned style (this was written early in her career, in the 1920s) as well as her command of the details of dress, manner, and speech of society at that time, give the book a strong sense of the time and place (one of Heyer's trademarks). In typical Heyer style the hero and heroine (Prudence and Robin) were immensely likeable, and their conceited, egocentric, controlling father immensely insufferable (it seems to be a Heyer trait to make one of her MC's parents insufferable). In particular, I liked the inconclusive way she ended the book. I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not yet read it, so I will just say that I was not sure what the truth really was......I didn't enjoy this as much as some of her others (particularly The Conqueror and A Civil Contract), but it was a fun, frolicsome adventure with a strong flavor of 18th century England."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"I've enjoyed most of the Heyer novels I've read, but this is my favorite. Sometimes her novels, though great, may move a little slower in the middle. This one engaged me completely from cover to cover. My other favorites I highly recommend: \\"Sylvester\\" and \\"The Grand Sophy.\\""},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"This rather short book had all the right elements to make it work. A likable hero and heroine who were meant for each other, gender bending comedy, high risk adventure, and a bit of a mystery to unravel.The hero is very serious (yet not dull, thankfully) and so is the heroine and you know right off that they are perfect for one another. That said, she is masquerading as a man and her brother as a woman. Needless to say, falling in love for both of them proves both problematic and amusing. They have lived a life as wandering adventurers with their father --- following questionable causes (thus the disguises) and masquerading as anything but what they really are. The plot point being, they aren't really sure what they are. When their father tries to claim his rightful place in English society, even his own children aren't sure what is a lie and what is truth.What keeps the hero and her brother likable is that despite their almost con artist life, they are genuinely good people and a tight knit family. Conversely, having scruples also gets in the way of true love for our heroine which our hero is more than capable of handling.One my favorite GH stories and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"When I read this book several years ago... I was mezmerized! She has such a way with her charaters. I promise it's worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"The Masqueraders is a fun tale of adventurers; filled with romance, disguises, swash buckling duels, and highwaymen. I love Georgette Heyer and I usually say that her novels are the next best thing to Jane Austen, but The Masqueraders is not one of her regency novels. This novel is set just after the Jacobite rebellion in 1740's England.Prudence and Robin Tremaine had a unique upbringing by their adventurer father, where disguise and good fashion sense were key. After participating in the failed Jacobite rebellion, the brother and sister journey to England, only with Prudence disguised as Peter Merriot and Robin disguised as Miss Kate Merriot. The two start off their adventures by rescuing a damsel in distress and then become the toast of London society. Complications ensue when both find themselves falling in love. How will they be able to express their love when they are disguised? Their adventurer father also comes to town with a new plot in hand.While I was a bit confused at the beginning of this novel, I soon found myself swallowed up by the fun. I was unable to put the book down as I really wanted to see how it would all come together at the end. The action sequences of the novel were great with rescues, duels, etc. I could see this book as a great movie. The swashbuckling adventures reminded me strongly of The Scarlet Pimpernel.Overall, The Masqueraders is an adventure not to be missed! It is a fun filled adventure with unique characters. I also love Georgette Heyer's style of writing, and like seeing a slightly different setting for this work."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"If you loved Jane Austen's novels, you should give Georgette Heyer a try. She also writes novels set in the Regency period, and they are all wonderful. The Masqueraders involves the story of a brother and sister hiding out, waiting to be reunited with their father, who supported the wrong person for king. To make things more interesting, each is disguised as the opposite sex to further aid in their \\"masquerade\\". Another great Heyer novel to enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"what can one say? this is a masterpiece.filled with romance, adventures, danger, intrigue and wild, crystal laughter! the girl masquerades as a boy and the boy as a girl, while their father is trying to make them rich and titled, by uncovering secrets of the past. or are they lies?meanwhile, the brother and sister are involved in romances that threaten to expose them or make them lose their chance of happiness forever.i have read this book about a million times. or maybe more......"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Okay, I think I'm starting to get it. This is my 5th Heyer, and my favorite so far--the first one I've absolutely loved.Prudence and Robin Marriot have returned to England in advance of their father, \\"the old gentleman.\\" Their father is a con artist, and they're used to living a masquerade. This time, Prudence is dressed as a man, and Robin is dressed as a woman. I'm not quite clear what this is supposed to accomplish, but there's some danger relating to the Jacobite rising... Nevermind. It's not important.Anyway, they're in disguise at their father's orders, and the plan was to lie low, but at an inn they run across Letty Grayson, and rescue her from a disastrous elopement, just in time to send her home with family friend Anthony Fanshaw, who she thinks her father wants her to marry.Robin, as Kate, befriends Letty and eventually falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Anthony takes young Peter (Prudence) under his wing, and she falls in love with him, but she's apprehensive because he seems all too perceptive.And they're thrust into the middle of London society, drawing far more attention than they'd intended, and Peter/Prudence is getting into scrapes that Anthony just happens to be on the spot to rescue him/her from.Then their father arrives and announces he's a Viscount, the lost heir to the title, and things get even more topsy-turvy.It took me a while initially to realize what was going on--that Prudence = Peter and Robin = Kate. It's not directly stated in the beginning, and while on the one hand, I was confused when it's first revealed--Peter was attracted to Sir Anthony? I didn't realize Heyer was that controversial--on the other hand, the masquerade was delightful, and once I got my bearings, I liked the way it was revealed.The style is different from modern novels, at least most of the ones I read, and the reader doesn't get much of the characters' internal thoughts. Still, from their actions and dialogue, it's easy to discern what they're thinking and feeling. I'm beginning to see why so many authors love Heyer's work, and that ability to show emotion rather than just telling it.I know I have one, possibly two more Heyers in my TBR pile that a friend gave me. Once I read those, I'm going to have to start buying my own. I surrender--I'm hooked."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Georgette Heyer never disappoints!

Magnificently described outfits which makes any one who is fashion conscious jealous. Great plot!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"The story is developed well enough and the characters are lively. I especially like the fact how the authors uses period appropriate words like \\"ostler\\", \\"dueller\\", or \\"pelluquiere\\" etc and with a thought to British words that were said then in salons of the ton. Despite this at first you will find that the story is a bit stiff, and certain words repetitive in their attempts to sound British, \\"Egads!\\" \\"Aleck!\\" and I do mean like from one sentence to another for several paragraphs however this soon tapers off into a well-constructed story with piquant dialogue. The romance is actually anticlimactic, however the story and mystery in itself is interesting enough if a bit tepid.I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a trifle disappointing and I have read several historical romances or simply period fiction from various authors that have been written better. In the end I couldn't even force myself to finish reading the book because I was soooo bored. It did have many plot twists but after a while I simply didn't really care about these twists because they seemed overdone."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"If you like witty fun stories, this is for you!And, as in most Heyer novels, you will get an informative glimpse into the lives of your ancestors in England several hundred years ago."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"I always like all of Georgette Heyer's books, ever since I read 'The Devil's Cub.' This book was not as good as 'devil's cub'. It's just not plausible. I mean, in this book there are these 2 people(brother &amp; sister), Prudence &amp; Robin Merriot &amp; they exchange roles &amp; change names. i.e, Prudence becomes a man, while Robin disguises himself as a woman. And then the story unfolds. I won't bother repeating the whole story, but it just wasn't upto her usual standards. But I'll say this for her, she sure writes well &amp; her description of the people &amp; their dresses etc are given so vividly that u can almost see them."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"For over a decade now, my mother and I have shared a passion for Heyer and her magnificent works! Each of us has different titles and we each enjoy the marvellous stories. Not only does Heyer have an amazing grasp of the period; she also has smart, infectiously funny dialogue. I have been reading Geogette Heyer novels for years, and I have to say that The Masqueraders is her best. Set in the period immediately after the failed Jacobite rebellion, Prudence falls in love with a staid, sober Sir Anthony. However enchanting the central love tangle may be, like all of Heyer's other novels, the secondary characters steal the show! I keep having to replace my rather tattered copy, because I re-read this one every year or so!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Another one of my favourite Georgette Heyer romance novels -- though truth to tell I have so many favourite Georgette Heyer novels that I've begun to think that it may be actually more enlightening to list the ones that I believe only merit 3 1/2 stars! But, with a plot can (successfully) boast of possessing the elements of romance, adventure and intrigue, &quot;The Masqueraders&quot; definitely does merit a 5 star rating.Prudence Merriot and her brother, Robin, are back in England again because their father (affectionately dubbed by his children as &quot;the old gentleman&quot;) has a plan to restore their fortunes. Used to a life on the run (the Merriots, or rather Robin, were involved in the most recent Jacobin uprising) and of adventure, both Prudence and Robin are beginning to find such a life chafing, esp now that they've met the elegant Sir Anthony Fanshawe and the enchanting Miss Letty Grayson. Both Sir Anthony and Letty are members of the ton, and would look for utter respectability from their potential spouses. Would either ever contemplate tying themselves to Prudence or Robin with their shady pasts and their rascally father? And on top of it all there is a further complication: Prudence is masquerading as a man, and Robin as a woman! How on earth can the Merriot siblings hope to woo and be wooed when they're both pretending to be something that they are not!What I rather liked about &quot;The Masqueraders,&quot; aside from the cleverly done cross dressing subplot, was that Ms Heyer showed us that a hero and heroine could be sensible, quietish and pleasantly good looking and still be the kind of hero and heroine that most readers would thrill to -- heroes and heroines didn't always have to be devastatingly good looking or rakish. Prudence and Sir Anthony are (both) my type of hero and heroine, and are the perfect foils for Letty and Robin -- the better looking and more dramatic couple. And really liking both the hero and heroine, I've found, can go a long way to making a novel a lot more enjoyable. So that, even though the language was at times a bit dated, my whole hearted liking of Prudence, Sir Anthony, Robin and Letty, together with a very swiftly paced and exciting storyline, made &quot;The Masqueraders&quot; a thoroughly fun reread."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"&quot;~The Masqueraders was the first Heyer novel I ever read, and it hooked me right away. Georgette Heyer takes the most unlikely characters, situations, and dialogue, and turns them into an effervescent treat. Nothing that happens is believable, but she tells it with such conviction that you don't care! man-mountain with perspicacity, midnight swordfights, masquerades-within-masquerades, and the most high-handed foppish audacity possible embedded in one old gentleman, this book makes for extremely entertaining reading."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Never as popular as Georgette Heyer's classics &quot;Regency Buck&quot; and &quot;These Old Shades,&quot; &quot;Masqueraders is nevertheless one of Heyer's best. Wrapped in a frothy tangle of gender-bending siblings, highway robbery and frivolous court intrigue, this Regency romp is a triumph in the high style fans of the genre prize most. The tender center of the farce is the romance of Prudence, who must hide her woman's form and heart to protect her family, and the one man who could be worthy of her love....if he only would stop calling her &quot;boy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"It might be of interest for readers to know that Heyer wrote this book while she was living in Africa with her Husband in 1927/8. She was only 25, had been published for the last 6-7 years but still had very few novels under her belt (and still had not discovered her talent for Regency period) - and finally she was away from the resources she could use to check out her informationdespite this book is still excellent and is based around the fall out of the second attempt by the stuarts to gain the throne of England in the Mid eighteenth century.It centres on a brother and sister Robin and Prudence, who have been sent to England by their father, 'the old gentleman' to pave the way for his coming home. they have been sent in disguise and the first difficulty in this novel is realising that their father has had them BOTH cross dressing - so Robin is dressed as a woman and Prudence as a young Buck. they are quickly tested in their guises when coming across a young girl Letty Grayson who has mistakenly eloped. They save her and escape and run into the second character who will dominate their future adventures, the Man-Mountain - Sir Anthony.This is Georgian England in all its excesses - the drinking, gaming, sword fighting, derring-do, plotting, conniving and romance. They must survive so that their father can reappear and reclaim his true identity, without being discovered and uncovered as Bonnie Prince Charlie's supporters of the past (which would mean they would need to flee the country for their lives) and must find the letter which condemns their family for its sympathys.Written with alight hand, although I have found Heyer's georgian novels sometimes a little jarring in their use of slang - it is one of her better ones, and this really paves the way for her Regency romances which followed soon after. If you haven't read Heyer before, start with something light and frothy like the Grand Sohpy or The Corinthian - but don't ignore this one if you haven't read it yet - nice good humoured fun"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"This is my very favorite Georgette Heyer Novel... and I do not make that judgement lightly! I've read them ALL and I think Masqueraders is at the pinnacle of Ms. Heyers style and grace! I continually re-read my favorite books, and I re-read this one, at least, once a year"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Brother and sister trying to evade the authorities (they're Jacobites) by switching identities and genders, but they get caught up in the beau monde by coming to the rescue of an eloping heiress with second thoughts. Always a tom-boy, I loved the heroine's strength and non-conformism. The hero is placid and intelligent with surprising depths of humor. As usual, her secondary characters are brilliant, with the heroine's father stealing the show.If you haven't read Heyer this is a great start. If you have, and missed this one, you'll be thrilled."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"10+ &quot;The Masqueraders&quot; is an excellent Georgette Heyer historical romance. No author has come remotely close to the elegence, style, and knowledge Georgette Heyer brought to her characters and the period. She is the standard to which all historical romance writers aspire-or should.I have been re-reading &quot;The Masqueraders&quot; and her other books for over 20 years. If you could but see my poor, beat-up, yellow-paged, cover-torn paperback edition for which I originally paid 75 cents!In an age where sex scenes are &quot;de riguer&quot; (as Miss Heyer would write), it is a true testimonial that I unerringly return to my favorite writer of all time year after year. Nothing steamier than a kiss, but oh, how she entices you with her words!Frankly, I wouldn't go near a deserted island without my Georgette Heyer's!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Born to a father set on having adventures, Prudence and Robin Tremaine have lived a life on the run. They constantly are moving (often fleeing) from one place to another, and often have to do so in disguise. After Robin and his father take part in the failed Jacobite rebellion they split up and flee into the country side. Robin meets up with his sister, who stayed out of it, and they decide to swap genders to thoroughly hide Robin in the last place anyone will ever look - in a set of petticoats - to prevent him from being hanged. Prudence then becomes Mr Peter Marriot and Robin becomes Miss Kate Marriot.Together they travel to London and hope to meet up with their father there. That's when they meet Sir Anthony and Letitia, Letty is currently attempting to elope with a Mr Markham only to find that he is a brute and not worth marrying, her attempt to change his mind on this score proves dangerous though. With the siblings help (a false swoon by \\"Kate\\" and a swift uppercut with the hilt of a sword by \\"Peter\\") they rescue Letty and restore her to Sir Anthony, a friend of her father's. In that meeting \\"Kate\\", er, Robin falls hopelessly in love with Letty and \\"Peter\\", er, Prudence falls hopelessly in love with Sir Anthony. Now, in true Georgette Heyer fashion, the stage is set for a romp unlike any other!This book was one of her earlier works and that definitely comes across in her writing. Her characters, her plot development, and her dialogue is just not as refined and well done, and that little extra twist of humor seems to be missing here. It is a wonderful book though and if I didn't have her later works to compare it with this book would have been wonderful all on its own.I loved reading about a female masquerading as a male credibly and showing that a woman can operate and work in the male environment just as smoothly as if she had been born to it if given half a chance. Prudence is admitted to a gentleman's club, smokes, drinks, takes snuff, plays cards, gambles, and gets into a street fight (through no fault of her own). Robin meanwhile is stuck going out on drives with old ladies, visiting with female friends (one in particular), and sits around in petticoats hiding yawns behind a fan. It is soon realized though that they are not managing to hood wink everyone and that's when things really start to take off.Any fan of historical romance would love this book to pieces. Especially if you enjoy adventures, sword fights, daring rescues and lots of intrigue. Seeing a female in a sword fight, and a male flirting in a dress are just perks to this ridiculously wonderful book. You won't regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"This is the story of a pair of sibling masqueraders and adventurers who, upon reaching London and enjoying the society, have a desire to give up their adventuring and enjoy a more settled--and if possible, respectable--life there. Unfortunately, they have come to London in disguise, fleeing from their treasonous association with Bonnie Prince Charlie, and they must await their father, who started them on their life of adventuring and who, they hope, has a plan to get them out of their predicament. While they wait, Prudence, known to the world as young Mr. Peter Merriot, finds further enticement to stay and further complication to success in the large person of Sir Anthony Fanshaw, and Robin longs to get out of the corsets and petticoats of Miss Kate Merriot, and to begin to court the beautiful heiress Miss Letty Grayson.There is plenty of adventure, from elopements and abductions to duels and highwaymen, in addition to the adventure of each sibling living as a member of the other sex, and there are also balls and parties and even some description of clothing. Plus there is lots of 18th century talk, like \\"Lud!\\" and \\"egad.\\" Basically, it's terrific fun to read, without relying on suspense or being in any way low quality writing. I think anyone would enjoy it.This was the first Georgette Heyer book I've read, and it honestly surpassed my hopes. Most of her books are set in the regency period, a little later in history than this, and possibly a more mannered and sedate time, but I'm sure she will find a way to make them exciting nonetheless, and so I plan to begin reading all her books as soon as I can get my hands on them."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"As a Georgette Heyer fan I loved the book. However there were several spelling errors in the text which were annoying. If I had been reading a hard copy, I would have corrected them, but white-out spoils the kindle's screen!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"I love Georgette Heyer books and this is my personal favourite. I also discoverd a superb book with a similar feel and flavour called The Adventurers by Michelle Martin. If you loved this then I gaurantee you will also love that. Link below...The Adventurers"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"I was astonished reading this book because of its wit, humor and character insights, but the romances in the book aer also first-rate. A brother and sister, children of a renegade, dress up as the opposite sex and have adventures in London, with the added complications of falling in love while being the wrong gender for a good heterosexual couple. The love affair between the young woman playing a dashing young man, and her \\"friend,\\" a giant of a man, takes your breath away because they become friends first as men. No spoilers here, but as their love develops, you can't help feeling that they are perfect lovers for each other. The young man dressed as a woman takes on another secret role to woo the young woman he loves. The entire book is one of the most sweet, funny, deep, rich, and insightfully satisfying romances ever written.The book demonstrates Heyer's adept portrayals of the varieties of human nature. In particular, the young people's father is an egomaniacal a mad genius who uses his children as his puppets to attain the social position he desires. We never know whether to trust him or to fret that his shenanigans will get his children thrown in jail or killed.Finally, the book is laugh out loud funny. You are in the Arden Forest or duelling on the Twelfth Night. The dialogue is on a par with Shakespeare, in my not very expert opinion. Heyer was at her most adept with language in this work, and her loving characterizations soar through the reader's imagination. Pure joy!"},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"I have to admit I was confused at the beginning of the masqueraders. The brother and sister are masquerading as . . a sister and brother. And they're not switching identities either. The spot where Heyer makes the masquerade apparent didn't click for me, because the brother's name is Robin. So I was trying to figure out whether the \\"brother\\" is masquerading as a female and the \\"sister\\" -- well, was the \\"sister\\" a male or female? I wasn't sure. I checked the reviews before continuing reading.My next question is HOW can this be a romance if the \\"brother and sister\\" are actually sister and brother???? But it somehow works. Georgette Heyer is brilliant. The book is very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"Published in 1928 and one of Georgette Heyer's earlier novels, The Masqueraders introduces us to the incomparable brother and sister pair known as Prudence and Robin Merriot.The book opens late one evening, with Prudence and Robin escaping the weather at an inn in the middle of nowhere. They overhear a young girl pleading with an aggressive suitor. It quickly becomes apparent while the young heiress may have willingly chosen to run off with the young man, Letty Grayson has had a change of heart. The suitor is enamored of her beautiful looks and large fortune and does not intend to let her go. Prudence and Robin quickly devise and execute a daring rescue plan. When Miss Grayson's rescuer Sir Tony Fanshawe arrives on the scene shortly thereafter, Prudence and Robin have the situation well in hand.Letty Grayson considers Tony to be the man her father would choose for her and dismisses him as staid and respectable. But the astute Prudence sees something special in Sir Tony Fanshawe. And Letty Grayson finds a mysterious hero in Robin. While Robin and Prudence decide to spend some time in London with their new friends, they are constrained by their past adventures. As their father's mistakes and their escapades threaten to expose them, Prudence and Tony are aware that this time the stakes are painfully high and they are both in danger of losing their hearts.With Prudence dressing as a young boy and Robin dressing as a young girl, the many costume changes, the small deceptions, the abductions, and the threat of exposure, this is a fun escape. Georgette Heyer's The Masqueraders is the sort of lighthearted comedy that I thoroughly enjoy.ISBN-10: 1402219504Publisher: Sourcebooks Casablanca; Reprint edition (December 1, 2009), 336 pages.Review copy provided by the publisher."},{"Title":"The Masqueraders","review":"This is a story you will want to come back to again and again!

It is way different than Fridays Child, The Nonesuch, or Cotillion. I have read many of her books, but this one was more of a mystery laced with romance. Initally the first several chapters in this book were hard to understand, there is a very involved plot, and it was hard to figure out what was going on. So after my intial read, I re-read it and I loved it! Filled with dangerous plots, mystery, a brave heroine, and romance.

This is a museum catalogue that is the equal to any book on photography on the market, not only because of the importance of the concept of the exhibition, but also because of the insightful narrative by Howe that leads us through the earliest forty years of the now prominent art form of photography.The Portraits of the World's Peoples are not exactly superior art works technically, but the impact of the subject matter is compelling. Based of the photographs of mostly unknown photographers, these daguerreotypes (an early form of capturing images on light absorptive material that required enormous patience on the part of the sitter) are of people from every continent of the globe. They include wondrous profiles of American Indians, hooded monks, Victorian families complete with slaves, aborigines, the hairy people of Burma, Japanese ladies - many of the subjects could be replicas of sideshow participants were it not for the fact that they are compliant sitters for nascent photographers who hold them in great respect for their station and patience.The result of this exhibition and catalogue is a reflection of life approaching 200 years ago: people in the now perceived primitive form are actually from a relatively recent past! The other phenomenon generated by this catalogue is an appreciation of an art form and its development to the present stage of highly scientific engineering. The power is in the faces and these faces will haunt you long after seeing the installation or the first reading of the magnificent book. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, September 05"},{"Title":"First Seen: Portraits of the World's Peoples, 1840-1880","review":"It says 'the world's peoples' but in fact it should be called 'People of Middle East, Africa, Asia and The Native Indians of America' There are only few photos that represent the rest of the world at large: 2 Jews, 2 Cossacks, 2 Mexicans, 1 Spanish person, and few others, and the photographs are randomly mixed in with the rest.By randomly mixed I mean the pictures may be chronologically organized but it takes away from the experience when you have a group of Cossacks with a dead tiger right next to a geisha (front/back) who gazes at the celling, in the general direction of an Indian maharaja, followed by 2 faceless bundles identified as 2 women, with a praying Tatar man close up, staring at a family of hairy people. Honestly no self respecting artist (photographer) would mix apples and oranges. The photos should have been organized by kind, region, or nationality.I must also say that the lack of diversity was an enormous disappointment. For example, I saw no Kurdish people, no Slavic people or their costumes (Russian wedding is a specially beautiful) I saw no Hungarians, no traveling gypsies, no Irish and their horses, no nuns, no farmers, no soldiers, no sailors, no... Well you get the picture. It is hard to believe that we are to think that there were no interesting photographs taken by the photographers of their own native surroundings.My other issue with this book is the unidentified pictures (90%). When you name a photograph a 'sitting woman' giving the name of the photographer BUT without at least naming the approximate region or country where the photo was taken or who might be its subject (example how it SHOULD be identified: sitting woman - possibly native Mexican - taken in Mexico City - author....). The nameless person is a ghost of ghost customs, ghost heritage, ghost life, she does NOT tell us any story of her self, her life, her people, she becomes a space filler for some publishing house solely for profit. And I do not like to think that the pictures which were to remind us of other times and other lifestyles should be reduced to that.And lastly, please note that the photos were not remastered or in any way corrected. Their quality (in comparison to others from that period) is poor on most, average on some. For a coffee table book this can be a major problem (a specially in low light) as not all photos are clearly legible.Also there are very few 'stunners' such as the one on the cover. And though I absolutely love about 8 of the photos, I wish I did not get this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I ran across this book at the library one day while browsing the sci-fi/fantasy section and checked it out on a whim. I had no inkling of what I was getting into. That was a few months ago; I've since bought it and read it twice more, along with the sequels, and I'm now reading the series for the fourth time thanks to the recent release of the fifth book (\\"Kushiel's Justice\\").This is one of those rare books that causes me to miss my bus stop even on re-reads. The world Carey has imagined is just fascinating, and I couldn't help but love the characters who populate it. I suppose you could call this book a romance or a fantasy, but it's so much more than the labels suggest. It's got all of the above and more: sex (duh, the main character is a courtesan), intrigue, adventure, friendship, politics, culture clashes, battles, religion ... I still struggle to describe it, and usually just give up trying and insist that people read it so they can see for themselves.I'm not really a big fan of the \\"romance\\" or \\"fantasy\\" genres in general -- or any genre, now that I think of it. I am a fan of creative stories with interesting, believable characters and gripping plots, whether they are set in 14th-century alternate-universe France (which this one might be?) or World War II England or 40th century Mars.I can't say enough good things about this series.

An alternative, Renaissance-esque world where the lead character, Phedre, is sold into servitude to a local temple only to become her country's lead \\"anguissette,\\" a high priestess of pain. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, enough to pick up the others, and while the adventuress masochist-turned-international spy tends to get into more trouble than any one woman should,the writing is solid and Carey's attention to the details that make her world so real are worth it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There's not much more to say, that the other over 200 reviews have not already said, but I just wanted to add my 5 stars, because this is a great, great, great book.

Once I got into it though, I really enjoyed it.The characters were well thought out, and nothing in the book fell flat.The only thing I didn't care for in this book was all the S&amp;M. I could have done without that, but I think it did add to the character of Phedre.

I did hate the writing style, and was amused to see a blurb from Robert Jordan on the cover, as I hate his writing style for the very same reasons: too much description, too many of the same phrases repeated over and over again (\\"You really are one, aren't you?\\" she asked as she tugged on her braids), and general logorrhea. But like with Jordan's books, I liked bits of the story enough to keep reading until the end, although I'm not sure I want to read the sequel. Partly because reading this one exhausted me and I'm not ready for another 500-page story told in 900+ pages, and partly because I personally would prefer it if the story ended where this book ended, and didn't go on to the places it will inevitably have to go in the sequels. Maybe if Phedre's kink were my kink I'd appreciate it, but it's not (not to anywhere near that extent, anyway), and anyway I prefer love over kink, and that's not the direction the sequels are going to go. So, no more Kushiel for me, and I hesitate to recommend it to anyone but those of the anguisette persuasion, about whom romantic books are rarely written, although fans of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander similarly too-long and violently erotic series will probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There are books that are erotic. There are books that are intricately and cleverly plotted. They are generally not the same books. But it is not just that Kushiel's Dart is both engaging and erotic. What makes this book stand out is that its erotic elements are not a diversionary sidebar that could easily excised. On the contrary, the erotic elements of the book are integral to the plot and development of the story. Bravissimo!

She is sold into bondage to the Night Court, first to Cereus House and then to a man named Anafiel Delaunay. Anafiel recognizes Phedre for what she is, an anguissette, one who feels pain as pleasure.Anafiel raises Phedre, not simply training her to become a courtesan, but providing her with a high education and instructing her in the finer arts of espionage. Once coming of age, Phedre enters the Courts with eagerness and elegance. But before she can earn her \\"Bond Marque\\" to free her from servitude, her stylish lifestyle is disrupted by intrigues, which cause the deaths of two very dear to her, and threaten the entire land of Terre D'Ange.It is almost impossible to fully review this book, so richly woven with love, intrigues, lavishness, hardships, and magic, all told in first person by Phedre. The prose is elegant without being pretentious. The colorful characters from royalty to barbarians are full-fleshed and never flat. The plot twists but never dries.Phedre's friend Hyacinthe, her \\"brother\\" Alcuin, her guardian Joscelin from the Cassiline Brotherhood, Queen Ysandre, and Phedre's enemy Melisande Shahrizai breathe life into Phedre's lengthy tale of her efforts to save Terre D'Ange. No shrinking violet is Phedre; she is one of the strongest and most intelligent heroines you will ever encounter in a modern fantasy, a stunning and gentle beauty with a core of steel. Indeed, her determination and willingness to survive, to do whatever is necessary to save her beloved land, is more than simply fascinating: it is riveting.Do not make the mistake of passing off this novel (and the sequels) as fluffy erotica or \\"chick fantasy\\". This lush tale is filled to the brim with action and intrigue; you will not be able to put it down until the end. Best have the sequels handy also; you won't want to let go of Phedre's tale even at the last page. While this first in the trilogy stands alone, enough ties are left for interest in the second book, Kushiel's Chosen.'Kushiel's Dart' is an outstanding piece of fantasy fiction. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If possible, I would give it ten stars. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I ordered based on the www.amazon.com reviews but I was somewhat disappointed. I found it style of \\"olde-Englishe\\" to be unnecessary and a little pretentious. Too many names and references were introduced too soon and too briefly to keep them straight, despite the characters guide in the front of the book. I didn't ever feel very attached to the main character and, consequently, didn't really care what happened to her. It was readable but it was also put-down-able and certainly didn't keep me up at night wanting to read more. And for those of you wondering, the sado-masochistic sex is very secondary, not too graphic and rather off-putting unless you're into pain.

Another thing I will mention is that its not a romantic \\"feel good\\" book... just as bad things happen to good people in real life, Kushiel's Dart runs the gamut of positive and negative emotions... its very telling that I was pulled into the story so much that I was disappointed when negative things happened to the characters (Sorry, can't be specific or I'll ruin the plot)."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up this book to read while on a long flight (my husband always brings several books,and only started to read it out of absolute boredom. And then, I don't know what happened-----I just couldn't put it down!! I have only read a few fantasy authors to date----Tolkein, of course, Raymond E. Feist, and George R. R. Martin, but I have to say that I rank this series right up there with these authors. This story is very complex----I found myself having to reread sections to understand, only to later see the big picture and think to myself &quot;Wow&quot;. I am eagerly awaiting the third book of this series with great impatience!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book. I really did. When I was about halfway finished, I ordered the hardcover copy, and the second book in the series -- it was just that good. I finally finished Kushiel's Dart tonight, and felt inclined to write about it.This is not your typical fantasy. While there definitely are fantastic elements, there is no superhuman sorcery, no elves and goblins. Most of the fantasy in the book is reimagined history -- and that part is superbly done. It takes place in a Europe (Europa) of probably the 1000's, with France (Terre d'Ange) being the most sophisticated country, more Renaissance-like than medieval. Much of the rest of the world, however, is delightfully primitive. Christianity is not dominate -- in fact, only a few Jew-like Christians are around in this world, although it is generally accepted by the French (D'Angelines) that there was a Jesus. England (Alba, which is definitely a well-researched name) is Pictish, and Germany is inhabited by barbarian Norsemen. The names for everything are perfect -- Hellas (Hellenism is the age of Alexander the Great) for Greece, Tiberium for Rome, Aragonia (think Ferdinand of Aragon) for Spain. It feels like she put a lot of thought into designing her world.The plot, too, is excellent. The main character is not your typical fantasy \\"chick\\" -- she doesn't fight, magically or physically, and some things about her are almost repulsive. Pricked by Kushiel's Dart, she feels pain as sexual pleasure -- and, thus, becomes very useful as a bed-partner to those with sadistic tastes. Still, I liked her quite a bit, and found her a very believable heroine. She saves her homeland -- through the use of her sexual skills, her beauty, and her wits.Plenty of people have criticized this book for being \\"porn\\". It really isn't pornographic at all. There are vivid sex scenes, but they aren't disgusting or pornographic. I wouldn't recommend this book to a 12-year-old fantasy fan, but I wouldn't warn anyone away from it due to the explicitness of the sex scenes.And the writing! The writing was just beautiful. Poetic, surpassing even the beauty of Tolkien. The heroine lives in a land of beauty and elegance, where every D'Angeline is descended from angels, and has their beauty. It follows that the language would be beautiful as well.An excellent book. Ten stars out of ten. Recommended without reservation."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is not your fluff romance twisting a world for it's own games. Here we find a world similar to our own Europe set in a golden age of indulgence, political intrigue, and desire.I'm going to safely assume that you can read the back of the book and the few look inside pages, so I won't presume to fill you with plot information as already done.What I will tell you is this is not for the faint of heart - when they discuss the pain & pleasure are felt as one, you will read of acts of pain to incite pleasure. You will read of a brutal murder or two. Don't pick this up if you're squemish.But, if you enjoy books with as much action as romance, a storyline including a love unable to be shared, ones that twist the world we know to fit their designs, and you want a well wrapped tale, by all means, pick it up."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I didn't realize this was the first in a series (of 3) when I bought it, but I will certainly read all of them. Carey's world is that of Europe, physically, but not any recognizable historical Europe. The main character is basically a glorified high class hooker with a sadomasochistic thirst, who partially graduates to playing political games. While the story is often erotic, it isn't usually graphic. Also, though it is a fantasy novel, there isn't too much fantastical about it. Only one event in the whole novel really stands out as being not possible in our reality. There are sword fights, but no dragons. Prognosticators, but no sorcery. All human characters."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was starved for a good book this summer and when I picked up this book the only thing I had liked was the half rose drawing on the front. Then I read the book and I couldn't put it down! It was so great that I would stay up until 4 in the morning to read it! Some may comment on the references to prostitution, but if you look at the character you'll almost forget about it. Phedre seemed so much like a real person, that the fact she was a prostitute hardly mattered. The thing that most caught my attention was the creative way that the author combined christanity and paganism. It was a very new and very thought provoking way to make a new religon. Not only Phedre caught my attention, but numerous others. I was so drawn into the story that in some occasions I almost cried. I am not one to cry at a book and when I come close I KNOW that the book is good. So if you want something new, exciting, and original GET THIS BOOK!..."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I first read this book I enjoyed it, but now I've just finished it for the second time, and I'm ashamed I only enjoyed it before. This is a magnificent story, and Phedre is simply an awesome character."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book. The first hundred pages or so are a little dry with the background infromation and everything and the characters but after that it picks up... and it flies. For such a long book it keeps you sucked in which is an accomplishment for having 901 pages. The plot never thins throughout it and it keeps an interesting array of characters to oppose the antagonist. The characters are almost real people. They're not flat like some novels, but they give them an insight to their thoughts and the way they think. However, younger readers nowadays faint at the thought of reading a book that big. They flipp. People complain about how much sex it has in it, which really isnt' that much compared to everyday life. Sex is a part of life and in our world it is everywhere. This book isn't immoral at all. If you don't like risky novels, too many characters, or deep writing, I wouldn't suggest this book. But i will say you don't know what you're missing. It is beautiful written with deep thoughts and an excellent vocab along with many complex characters. It is an accomplishment for Carey. If you want a good story, not a ideal-world fantasy or a \\"everything is nice and smells like roses\\", or ideal-society but one that has plots, strength, love, fueds, and a little action this is an excellent book. I eagerly look forward to Choosen and the third."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What I didn't like:It was sooo long! I'm normally okay with this, but there are so many names to keep track of and so much action that takes place...I almost feel as if I read three books within the space of one. Then, to top it all off, the ending makes it obvious that there is more story to tell. I knew this beforehand, but after going through so much with Phedre I just felt too exhausted to embark on the next novel!What I looooved (which is pretty much everything else):-The world-building....wow. Seriously you guys, the world building is absolutely top-notch in Kushiel's Dart! I was completely immersed in this strange Europe-like polytheistic world with its various dens of iniquity.-Also, the characters were just so fully-fleshed and amazing! I loved Phedre, Hyacinthe, Delaunay, Alcuin, Joscelin (he's my fave), and pretty much every single character she produced - they were all so real.-Armchair reading (fantasy-style)! You travel to so many lands, meet so many different people/entities, and witness such daring feats...that before you know it, you've chewed off all of your fingernails!-Lastly, it was such an emotional roller-coaster - you never stop being interested. It is such a multifaceted story: friendships, families, romance, betrayal, survival, and above all - hope!What might bother others but didn't bother me:Um, the world in which Phedre exists is one where there is a very casual attitude towards sex and Phedre herself is a courtesan with special tastes. The god Kushiel (her patron god) is the god of pain...so, uh, to sum it up she's into S&M.; For some folks this is an automatic turn-off, but hear me out! While the book does let you know about episodes of er, pain and pleasure...it doesn't go into detail. There are no explicit sex scenes - just a slight description of events without going into too much detail. I thought it was tastefully done, considering the taboo subject matter.So, there ya go folks! I really really recommend this to fantasy fans and to those who love strong female protagonists."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book, and an amazing read.The sheer amount of sex in the book can distract from the story for some people (although it didn't really bother me). Also the book starts off rather slowly, and you have to work to get into it. However, once you get going you don't want to stop. Fantastic plot twists, beautiful prose, deep, intriguing characters, and many interesting settings. Not for people that don't like flowery, wordy writing.One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The Good: Deep and heavy characters, excellent adventure through a memorable world, sex scenes that actually make sense and are part of the story, lots of detail to keep you wrapped in the world and makes you remember weeks after readingThe Bad: Heavy in politics, tests your patience until the story picks up, a few unbelievable partsBeing a successful author these days is hard because of the sea of wannabe authors, has been, and have-nots, but the few that stick out do so for a reason and Jacqueline Carey does with this erotic book of adventure and gripping characters. The story has a huge back story and is all about politics, religion, and it just goes on and on and would take me forever to explain it all. The synapse is that the main character, Phedre, is pricked with Kushiel's Dart and she is his chosen scion and has a red mote in her eye. Her parents sell her to one of the Thirteen Houses of Naamah and she becomes a high-end courtesan who learns this skill at age 10. Yes, this book isn't for the light-hearted and really challenges your moral views. However, the book is very tasteful and she uses her skills in the art of love-making in the book.She gets her marque bought by a man named Anafiel no Dalaunay and his pupil Alciun to use her love-making skills to get information out of lords and kinds. There's a lot more to this and Phedre's character as well as all the others are very strong, but the book itself is an epic on its own and you go through 20 years of her life. The book is heavy in politics and there are a ton of weird almost unpronounceable names and she throws them at you in just a few chapters and I felt this was the weak part of the book. Too many politics at once which makes it hard to keep track of everyone, which name rules what land etc. The politics are deep and eventually come out in the end and untangle, but 900 pages of trying to figure it out is a chore. The book has some bad pacing and doesn't get truly exciting until past chapter 40.This books tests your patience, but if you wait you will be rewarded with amazing and lovable characters that you really get to care for and admire. I can name a whole list of names, but you have to really read the book to know what I am talking about. Not since Lord of the Rings and The Night Angel Trilogy have I read such amazing characters. There's a lot packed into this one book, with a sad and amazing journey that her and Joscelin (her Cassiline brotherhood bodyguard). They go through so much horrible stuff that it really hits you hard. My only gripe about the characters is that Phedre seems to get through the most inhumane things without much of a scratch and makes her seem a little unrealistic. If you can look past this the characters are something you will remember and think about weeks after finishing the book.The world is made up kind of like Lord of the Rings, and she explains the entire epic journey very well, but the best part of the book is the last third because that's when the politics die down and the two go on this impossible journey to save the realm from the Skaldic barbarians slaughtering everyone. Not often is a book to big and full of too much content to explain it all because there is an unreal amount of detail in the book. Day by day events, and she rarely skips these so the whole book flows and feel like an amazing tale.If you have the patience to stomach the heavy politics and tons of detail leading up to the epic adventure then I promise you this will be one of the best books you will ever read. The book does have some graphic sex scenes, but Carey writes them in taste and makes it very erotic and steamy, but they are spared and the scenes are actually part of the whole story and not just there to get guys to read it. There are a few unbelievable parts when she starts introducing myth and fantasy because this book seems very realistic until those points. Other than that this is probably one of the best books of the new generation and shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.

I highly recommend it to fans of the genre or author."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It manages to create a completly believable world & a very engaging heroine.It also is very erotic with a S&M flavor to it. For me this was a plus but sensitive readers beware."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre has been marked since birth by a scarlet spot in her eye. At first viewed as a terrible flaw, an more observant and educated man, Delauney, sees it for what it really is. Phedre has been struck by Kushiel's dart, and is bound to feel pleasure and pain as one. He takes her into his household to raise and train. But she is not trained in the typical way. She is taught to use her wits and her wiles to get others to reveal their deepest secrets. But Delauney's game is far more dangerous than any of them imagine. When everything backfired, Phedre finds herself left with no one but her bodyguard, Brother Joscelin, and fighting for not only their lives, but the freedom of the kingdom.A very political book, full of court intrigue and plans. With an aging king and an unmarried female heir, no one is quite sure what will happen when the king dies. Several try to fight for the throne, but are defeated. But the biggest threat is one unseen to anyone. A threat that is revealed layer by layer as the Phedre's story unfolds.I loved everything about this book. The characters, the places, the events all seem to come to life. The variety of scenery and people is just amazing. The story is full of so many people and places, but it moves at a pace that allows you to learn each one's part in the story before moving on, yet never seems to slow to a point that events become dull or repetitive. My only complaint, and its importance can be debated, is that the reader is not given a log of detail on their deities at first. The deities play a major part in how and why people act the way they do. A great read for those that enjoy epic series. I have book two up to read soon.4.5/5"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've have become recent fan of Jacqueline Carey, this book is great for all sorts of types of reader, great combination, of romance, sci-fi, adventure, and some very nice steamy sex...

This is a character I would find myself wondering about as I drove home from work and then had to remind myself she did not exist. Too bad. The next two books in the series get better and better. Hard to put down. The 4th centers on another character and I enjoyed it but preferred the first three. I am going on to the 5th, however."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I started reading this series a few years ago and have become hooked on Jacqueline Carey, she is a true writer who understands how to capture the imagination. What I love most about the series is that it's realistic in the sense that the characters have flaws and not everyone gets what they want making the reader appreciate the difficulty of Phedre's life while finding the beauty in what she makes of it. Also after reading these books I noticed that I hold every other book to these and I have yet to find another writer who can compare and another story that can move me and stay in my heart like this one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is an amazingly different take on the Fantasy genre. It's richly detailed, erotic without being pornographic, and just plain too-good-to-put-down. Set in an alternate land similar to Europe, where the only divine precept is \\"love as thou wilt\\", the heroine is beautiful, strong, sensual, and clever.There is treachery, intrigue, love and war, and high adventure through barbaric lands. In fact, there is so much to this novel, it's hard to believe it all gets packed into one book. And then the best part is, there are two more novels after this one (five if you count the second trilogy.....)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm going to start by saying that pain ain't my thing. This means that the central premise for much of the sex in Kushiel's Dart isn't going to connect with me. Fortunately, there's more to this novel than just sadomasochism, though that seems to be what a lot of people want to dwell on when they talk about it. It's also got a lot of complex political maneuvering, and some good characters. I particularly liked old Delaunay, even though he has some really twisted morals; maybe that's what made him so interesting.The writing is good, in sharp contrast to the other and earlier famous fantasy series about sadomasochism, theGorseries. But ultimately, the end of Kushiel's Dart just takes too long to happen. For all practical purposes, the story is over after the battle at Troyes-Le-Mont, but it just keeps going and going after this. I suspect this is because fantasy novels today are expected to be super-long, and because Carey wanted to set up her sequels. Unfortunately, it undermines this book, and when I looked at the sequels, I wasn't impressed, so I have to say the effort wasn't worthwhile."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I had seen this book in the Science Fiction section of the bookstores for several years and always passed it by. I think I picked it up a few times because the cover reminded me of the Marion Zimmer Bradley Mists of Avalon cover, but then I'd read the description on the back of the book always thought, \\"No, doesn't sound very interesting at all.\\" Huge mistake!I finally bought Kushiel's Dart this past fall after several people recommended it. This book does start a bit slow. There are a lot of pages dedicating to establishing the world that Carey created. It's slow, but still quite entertaining. A slow book to me is one that I don't feel the need to stay up way too late to finish just \\"one more chapter.\\" Once I got about a third of the way through, I couldn't put the book down.The world Carey has created is complex but believable. Her characters grow and mature during the course of the book. And, like one of my other favorite authors, George RR Martin, Carey does not shy away from killing off main characters. A good realistic touch to her novel that I really enjoyed was that not all the important people make it through battles. I've read some other books recently that want to make the reader believe that if you're important, you will survive any battle.I couldn't recommend this book and the rest of the books in this series more!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Words cannot describe how amazing this novel is. Here heraldic courtly splendor and Machiavellian politics that would do credit to Frank Herbert are set in a richly-envisioned alternate Medieval-type world. And did I mention sex? The graphically erotic and sexual scenes are handled with sheer craft and skill--neither over-lurid nor insipid. Phedre is a phenomenal heroine, remarkably accessible and fully realized. The host of supporting and secondary characters are equally well-drawn.This is an absolutely gorgeous novel with something to offer everyone. I have often remarked that if I had to be marooned on a desert isle with only ONE BOOK, I would choose this one. Whether you're a fantasy zealot-aficionado like me or a more casual reader, read it!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love this whole series! Phaedra is one of the best fictional heroines ever created in this novel that is fantasy fiction erotica action adventure romance. Set in an alternative Medieval/ Early Renaissance Europe, Phaedra is a well trained prostitute in a society where the religious dictate is \\"Love as thou wilt\\" and the servants of Naamah are elevated and respected members of society. Not only is Phaedra well schooled in the arts of love and servitude, but she has been also been trained as a spy by her patron & mentor. Both of these skills will serve draw her into the web of intrigue that has been brewing among the Peers of the Realm when all hell breaks loose.Oh!and did I meantion that Phaedra's special gift, one direct from the gods, is that she finds sexual pleasure in pain, and that she is uniquely capable of withstanding much suffering? This series is definitely erotic though not pornographic by my standards. It is delicious fun.The world Carey creates is well though out and peopled with believable three dimensional characters and their stories are rich and engaging. She weaves a tapestry with these characters' stories that I found exciting, intellectually stimulating and of surprising complexity and subtlety. I have gone back to the Kushiel Series more than once for a little guilt free pleasure and escape."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It's such a treat to find a book with so much woven together, and done well. While it's not in our universe, it is in a parallel one that mirrors our own in a beautiful fashion.I found the story just a bit difficult to get into -- the first 50 pages or so were good, but not completely absorbing. Then, suddenly, I found that all I wanted to do was read this book and find out what happened now. The twists and turns were such that you just HAD to know!! I didn't want to work, didn't want to sleep, and discovered that long stop lights and heavy traffic were a good thing. (CAUTION: I do not recommend that.)It's also one of those that has such an after-glow about it that it's difficult to go on to the next book.Highly engaging, but be prepared to lose some sleep over this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the first of three large volumes telling story of Phedre ne Delauney, a courtesan, sexual masochist, and spy living in the fictional kingdom of Terre de Ange which, in Carey's imaginary setting, can be considered roughly equivalent to France. It's an amazing story, as are the sequals. Although I haven't yet finished the final volume, I already feel fairly safe in making a flat statement: this is the best fantasy trilogy I have ever read, including Tolkien.Carey has set her story in a setting fairly close to France at roughly the time of the troubador era of the early Renaissance. But she has varied the historical setting to suit her needs; countries have been renamed and the equivalents for Germany and Great Britain are still barbaric lands from the Roman era rather than the Middle Ages. In Carey's Europa, Christ's successors never preached the Gospel to gentiles; as a result Europa remained a pagan culture and the only people to accept Christianity were the Jews. (The 'Yeshuite' minority is only vaguely mentioned in this book but plays a major role in the sequels.)The story isn't quite a fantasy in the traditional sense; there are no wizards, orcs, or dragons. Rather than a traditional fantasy, you might think of it as alternate history, with a few fantasy elements. There is one character of mysterious origins who has magical control over what we know as the British Channel, and with that control has reduced contact between the islands and the continent to a minimal level. This is crucial to the plot, since Phedre eventually needs to undertake a mission to Alba (Britain) and will have to meet the price he requires for her party's passage. There are some characters with limited ability to see the future, and the heroine is given one special ability: she can recover quite rapidly from injuries, a useful talent given her profession and tastes.Phedre has been marked by Kushiel, the deity who in Terre de Ange theology punishes souls in Purgatory until they are sufficiently cleansed to move into paradise. Her mark, a mote in one eye, means that she experiences pain as pleasure. The significance of the mark is first noticed by Anafiel Delauney, a poet and nobleman with a mysterious background who purchases Phedre and trains her, along with Alcuin, an attractive albino boy, in languages, spying, and sexual artistry. Shortly after Phedre begins her career as an expensive courtesan hired out to court figures, Delauney and Alcuin are murdered. Phedre and her priest bodyguard Joscelyn are sold into slavery in Skaldia (Germany), launching a series of perilous adventures in which Phedre and Joscelyn struggle both to survive and to thwart a planned invasion of Terre de Ange.Such journeys and adventures can be found in many similar books; what sets Carey above the rest is her complex characters, interesting historical/cultural background, and skillful writing. Major and minor characters are consistently interesting and believable. The story gets off to a rather slow start while Carey fills in the background and describes Phedre's childhood, but the quality of the writing makes this section as enjoyable as the later action passages.The many references to prostitution, homosexuality, and sadism make the book inappropriate for some readers. But the content isn't as shocking as it could easily be under the circumstances; Carey uses elegant and delicate language to describe the extremely indelicate acts of Phedre's clients. The book is intensely erotic but not pornographic."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I just finished this book and have to write a review!! I must say that this was easily one of the best books I have read in years.First I must say that this is not a book for the prudish or squeamish. There is some very strong sexual content and violence, however, it is all very integral to the plot.The story is seen totally through the eyes of Phedre, a courtesan and spy raised in the Night Courts of the kingdom of Terre D'Ange, a land founded by fallen angels. In this land, the supreme command of their God is \\"Love as Thou Wilt\\", and there are 13 houses of courtesans, each with a different attitude towards sex, from Joy to elegance to mysticism, and, yes, even S&M;, who support this commandment. Phedre is marked by Kushiel's dart as an anguisette, one who takes pleasure from pain. She is indentured in the service of Anafiel no'Delauny who protects her and teaches her how to use her intelligence and bedskills to extract information from his enemies. Intrigue and treachery are everywhere and Phedre finds herself in the thick of it, when she and Delauney are betrayed by one close to them. Her travels take her from her homeland to the harsh Skaldi northlands to the isles of Alba and back to her beloved Terre D'Ange, accompanied by an ever increasing number of faithful followers, as she races against time to save the land she loves from treacherous betrayers.This book is beautifully written, the intrigues are direly clever, and Phedre, for all her strange quirks, is a joy to read about. I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Unlike some others, I didn't find this book to be particularly sexy. Yes, the main heroine Phedre was born to seek pleasure in pain and yes, there are a handful of scenes of her enjoying pain with her sex. But it's not like this is a Laurell K Hamilton Anita sex-fest. Sex is secondary to the story, although perhaps primary in the main characters motivations and character.This is actually a story of war. And it takes a very very long time to get moving. We start at Phedre's (I was pronouncing her name \\"Fee-dray\\" in my head until at about page 600 I was informed it was prounounced \\"Fay-dra\\"...bit late with that information) childhood and are taken on a very long journey with intrigue and spies etc, eventually leading to the actual war scenes.When I think of this book I think \\"grey, with slashes of red\\". And by grey I mean the book is subdued, controlled, gloomy, with words and feelings unspoken, and grief unexplored. The slashes of red are the rare moments when we get some actual emotion, something real and not hidden.If you're all about searching out the hidden gems in books, and you don't mind large patches of lengthy and overly-detailed story telling, then this is the book for you.For myself, I don't think I'll bother with the sequels. While I am mildly curious about Phedre and Joscelin's relationship, I am not prepared to put myself through 2 more almost 1000 page over complicated and heavily detailed epics to find out.However, I applaud Carey for choosing in Phedre a character that is unique and interesting and quite unlike any other heroine I've ever encountered in a book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It begins in Kushiel's Dart with Phedre, an orphan cast out by her parents because of a peculiar flaw that later became her salvation. Carey's voice is deliberate and seductive as she begins her narration. Ruled by two demi-gods, Naamah, the goddess of sensual love whose creed is love as thou wilt and Kushiel, one of the seven angels of punishment, whose mark, a blood red mote, she bears in her left eye, she is plucked from the erotic Night Court by nobleman Anafiel Delauney at the age of ten. Delauney recognizes her for who she is - an anguissete, born with the ability to transcend pain and transform it into intense pleasure. Under his wing she enters a period of rigorous training in the courtly arts of history, politics and language as well as in the erotic pleasures of the bedroom. Acting as Delauney's pawn in a desperate mission known only to himself, she contracts her body to some of the most malicious noble folk, listening carefully as they spill their darkest secrets in the throes of passion. What she learns casts her into a role of an unlikely yet very intelligent spy who eventually plays part in saving her beloved country's besiegement by a woman she cannot resist, the bewitching Melisande Shahrizai, with whom she shares a carnal bond so intense it threatens to enslave her.Jacqueline Carey spins an astonishing legacy that is worthy of being compared to some of the greatest political fantasy works with her Kushiel trilogy. Winner of the 2002 Locus Award for Best First Novel, Kushiel's Dart begins the journey of Phedre no Delaunaey in a country that is reminiscent of Renaissance-era Europe. Phedre, with all her vulnerability and cunning, proves to be a likable heroine, sharing rank with powerful women such as Morgan Le Fay from Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind and Ayla of Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children series. She is both selfish and selfless, going to great lengths to save Terre d'Ange from collapse while bringing inspiration as well as pain and grief to those around her as a result of her actions. Throughout the story she struggles with her passions, caught in between her loyalty to those who love her and with the demands of cruel Kushiel. In the end, her biggest trial comes with Joscelin, her Perfect Companion, with whom she finds the true meaning of love, sacrifice and devotion.With Phedre, she takes us into depths of a very erotic world few of us see but some of us know - that of the mingling of physical pain with sensual pleasure. While some readers may not wish to venture the depths she goes to describe Phedre's sexual trysts, it is done in a way that is both tasteful and mesmerizing almost to the point of engulfing the reader in rapture. Very few writers have been able to capture this quality of erotica in their writing in such a way that avoids lewdness. Carey gives Phedre very human characteristics in a fantastical world that is disturbingly familiar. Terre d'Ange reminds us of a world long past, where sensual pleasure is reveled in as a fine art and prostitution is a respected and coveted profession.At nearly 700 pages each, Kushiel's Dart and Kushiel's Chosen are certainly worthy of the effort it takes patching together the immense political network Carey has created as well as the many adventures Phedre embarks upon. Romantics will enjoy the pursuit of true love she weaves into the story as well as the shocking betrayals that seem to come from every angle. Sword and sorcerer fans will fall in love with Joscelin, the Cassiel swordsman/priest sworn to protect and serve Phedre at any cost. At the end of each novel Carey is careful to throw around a few loose strands to leave the reader craving for more, which makes Carey's third installment, Kushiel's Avatar, scheduled for an early 2003 publication date, a deliciously anticipated promise.Jacqueline Carey is a delightful newcomer in the fantasy/science fiction scene and has marked a place for herself up there with Ursula K. LeGuin and Marion Zimmer Bradley."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is actually an intense, intricate novel that has a potentially good storyline. The cast of characters are enjoyable, except for the patrons of Terre d' Ange who kept me wondering how Phedre could think their nation blessed. There were some gruesome, overblown details and scenes that are, in my opinion, humiliating and repulsive. Although, it just may be the author's way of portraying D'Angelline society and religious ethics/morals.Phedre's character in the beginning of the novel is a little too bold and sometimes, eager. I think being a young female myself, I really couldn't understand the foundation of Phedre's logic. However, her ability to spy, analyze, and translate added purpose and depth to her character. Towards the end of the novel, Phedre's character becomes more likable as she demonstrates her loyalty and love to her country by sacrificing everything she is. Beneath her anguisette exterior beats the heart of a courageous loyalist whose judgment/actions are questionable when it concerns Melisande Shahrizai (whom I absolutely hate). I kept feeling sorry for Hyacinthe and Joscelin especially; they always become entangled in Phedre's life-threatening schemes.I cannot help but feel sorry for Joscelin whose Caselline moral of \\"Protecting and Serving\\" only brings him heartache and danger. His character is extremely loyal making him at times, too deserving of Phedre. However, his Caselline vows make their whole relationship more complicated than ever.Overall, Kushiel's Dart is an interesting novel, but the sexual encounters/scenes and the heroine's cursedness of enjoying/wanting all that her profession entails, overshadows the plotline. I would not recommend this novel to judgmental or conservative readers because some parts may be hard to stomach."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; is an epic fantasy saga set in a world similar to Earth, during a period that resembles our early Renaissance. Author Jacqueline Carey weaves an intricate tale, a tapestry of adventure, political intrigue, love, friendship, trust and betrayal. She creates an enormous and varied cast of characters, as well as a variety of religions which motivate them - one resembling Christianity, another, a form of Judaism, and others where gods and demigods are worshipped, similar to those of ancient Greece and Rome. A most unique and unusual young women, who helps make history, narrates this story of a world in upheaval.The main setting, Terre D'Ange, is a land of extraordinary beauty and grace, where it is said that the inhabitants, Angelines, are part angel and part mortal. Phedre no Delauney was sold into the service of Naamah, the honored profession of the courtesan, as a young child. She was a beautiful girl who will grow to be a magnificent woman - not unusual amongst those who are part angel. However, she was kissed by the god. There is a tiny crimson mote in the white of her left eye, (Kushiel's Dart), marking her as an &quot;anguisette,&quot; one of Kushiel's Chosen. A true &quot;anguisette&quot; is extremely rare. Perhaps one is born every 4 or 5 generations. Anguisettes find pleasure in pain. She says of her fate, &quot;When Love cast me out, it was Cruelty who took pity on me.&quot;Phedre was bought by a wealthy peer of the realm, Anafiel Delauney, master spy and beloved of a King. When she was ten years-old he began to train her. She was to become the most famous courtesan in the realm. Prostitution is legal in Terre D'Ange and there is much cachet in belonging to an excellent house and/or in receiving exceptional schooling in the arts of love, letters and conversation. Delauney took her schooling one step further and taught her to gather and interpret intelligence.A young queen is about to be crowned but there are others who vie for the throne. Delauney is sworn to protect the young princess and insure her reign. Thus Phedre is pledged to do the same. As she entertains and serves her patrons, Phedre learns dangerous information - secrets and lies - that set the wheels of adventure rolling. Her world is turned upside down, as friends turn foe and masters becomes pawns. All are somehow involved in plots and subplots, pieces of a large puzzle which she must solve to save her future queen.I really enjoyed &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; the first book in Jacqueline Carey's trilogy. This is probably the only one of the three novels that can stand alone. The ending is a satisfying one, although it leaves more than enough loopholes to make one want to read more. There are some major flaws here also. The novel is much too long. There is a huge cast of characters and I had difficulties remembering many of them, although there is a key which is helpful. The dialogue is too flowery at times. But the principal characters are fabulous. They are very well developed, exciting, diverse - just plain fascinating. And their adventures, intrigues and battles are breathtaking. This epic adventure, part erotic odyssey, part chronicle of a land and its people will Wow you! Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What an epic adventure! This book starts out slow and I was tempted to stop reading it often during the first 300 pages.It is a hard book to read. There is a six page Dramatis Personae that lists the major characters and it can be very confusing at times. The second half is easier as less characters are introduced and the action kicks in big time.The author sets up an alternative historical France that she calls Terre D'Ange, the Land of Angels, at around the time 800CE. There is a whole alternate theology based on the son of Jesus (Yeshua in the book) and the Magdalene.The book reminds me of The Hobbit in the sense of it being an epic adventure through many lands and past many challenges, but the hero is a woman and a masochistic prostitute at that. The book is more sensual than explicit with a free love theology as a theme. However, the emphasis is on the machinations of courtly politics and war.Once the action starts, it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"..and that's no exaggeration.Frankly, I don't understand why some people think that Carey is attempting to sound over-intelligent at her reader's expense. Sometimes, Phedre's diction is a little archaic, that's all: it doesn't impede understanding, and it adds to the atmosphere over all.This is a wonderful book, a rich tapestry of a fantasy novel, with a multitude of multifaceted and diverse characters, each one with their own views, motives and beliefs. Carey does an excellent job of blending the real world into the fantastical in her books, making countries that are remarkably like ours ((and sometomes even using their names.. ie Venice as La Serinissima.... which is really another name for Venice, you know?))The book begins the story of Phedre, (...)cast off in a Court of courtesains, unfit to serve, due to a single flaw -- a red mote in her left eye. It's not until she is adopted by the powerful Anafiel Delaunay that her true worth is revealed. An 'anguissette', bearer of pleasure through pain, the fist in hundreds of years, with stuning beauty and the capacity to look, learn and remember. She is cast into the net of political intregue, seeking out answers through her unique talents. Answers to age old feuds, and traitorous plots. It will lead her farther than she could have ever imagined....Carey creates very realistic and deep characters, that you'll begin to empathise with as they endure hardships, and come out more experienced. My personal favourite is Joscelin, but every character plays a vital part to the story : the mischivious Hyacinthe, the beautiful and cunning Melisande, the clever and noble Delaunay, the kind Alcuin, the willful Phedre and the exasperated Casseline priest (...)>The best part? it's only the beginning...."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Well, the sex is definitely the gimmick in this book. The main character has been marked by an angel (per the theology as described in the story), which makes her an *anguisette*, or female masochist. I didn't find the sex or the concepts especially offensive, but I also didn't find them wildly original. It's reasonably standard S&amp;M stuff. When Phedre's emotions get involved, as with her bete noire Melisande, things become somewhat more engaging.The world in which this story is set is a pastiche of early-medieval Europe. It's reasonably well done, but could have been much better developed. I found the concept of the physically beautiful, genetically &quot;pure&quot; d'Angelines boring and verging on offensive. The theology which allows d'Angeline culture to embrace sex in multiple forms seems a bit scantily founded. Personally, I would rather read a book set either in medieval Europe as it was, or in a world of original fantasy.The editing is appalling, with &quot;mendicant&quot; consistently misspelled and &quot;brethren&quot; treated as a singular noun. And I'm not sure if comments on cover art really belong here, but the woman pictured on the cover of the hardback edition is strangely proportioned indeed -- look at the length of her upper arms.Having said that, I found this novel essentially fun and readable. The characters are appealing enough to keep the pages turning, and the political twists and turns, while not very well developed, keep things moving outside the bedroom. Occasionally lush imagery isn't anything Tanith Lee hasn't done better, but lifts the text above the mundane level."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The most controversial aspect of this novel, and what will most likely determine whether somebody enjoys it, is the main character's sexuality. The red mote in her eye, Kushiel's Dart, marks her in her people's mythos as a born masochist. Sold into indentured servitude at a young age, she grows up to become a beautiful spy-courtesan whose kinkiness gives her access to the top political figures of the country.The concept may sound somewhat tawdry, but Carey takes the story very seriously and the heroine, Phedre, turns out to be a very believable character. For that matter, all the other characters are credible as well, from the warrior-monk Joscelin who provides a foil for Phedre to her mentor Delaunay and her friend Hyacinthe.Where the novel falls short is its plot and the depth of the writing. The character conflicts that develop between Phedre and the others are a little predictable and mechanical. The epic part of the epic fantasy is fine stuff, but Phedre often seems too removed from it. Carey obviously wrestled with the problem of how to involve Phedre more directly in the plot, given that she is eternally a noncombatant. (To her credit, the author does not make Phedre a credible warrioress in addition to her other talents.) An expected confrontation between the heroine and her nemesis never occurs, too transparently postponed until a sequel. Put simply, Phedre's life doesn't seem in very much danger most of the time.This seems a bit odd, given Phedre's nature. Even the sex / s&m; scenes seem a bit uninvolved; though Carey seems always conscious of Phedre's masochism, she doesn't delve very much into it. Honestly, she could have told exactly the same story but just making Phedre really good in bed. In this sense, the s&m; elements seem a bit artificial.The bottom line is that Jacqueline Carey has some strong characters and an effective setting (a reimagined Europe with just a hint of the fantastic), as well as the willingness to tell a serious story with a controversial edge to it. However, it seems that I will have to wait at least until the second novel to see what she can do with these elements."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a very interesting book, and it has a lot of things to love within it, but as a whole package it wasn't amazing for me. This is a very unique book, where the sole viewpoint character is a woman that really has no power other than her sexuality and her brain. Phedre is essentially a high class prostitute/sex-slave who has been trained in espionage, and uses her training and her innate ability as Kushiel's Dart, where any pain or abuse she suffers results in exquisite pleasure. This results in many sex scenes in the book that would probably rival the mundane (I assume) BDSM scenes in the 50 Shades of Grey books. This book really serves as a coming of age story (especially the first half) along with a court drama, a fantasy adventure story, and a bit of a war story at the end. The book is very long, and with the strong differences between the first and second half of the book it could have definitely been two books. What is great though, is that while this is the start of a longer series, the story is very self contained. There is a bit of goofiness in the end which I'm sure will lay the ground work for the sequel, but the story of this book is finished at the end, and I really have no need to read the next book except just to continue another part of Phedre's story.The world building in this book is pretty interesting, it is a second world, but it has a decent amount in common with our world's history. The origin story of the people and city mainly featured in this book, is essentially what could have happened in our world after Jesus was killed if God actually existed. It really plays out the same, where a the son of god was born and went through life performing miracles, until he was crucified and stabbed with a spear. However, when the blood of the son of God touched the ground, Mother Earth accepted it and gave birth to Elua, the grandson of God. Then essentially (I'm paraphrasing from memory of course) Elua traveled the world looking for a place for him and his people, along the way fallen angels left God and became Elua's companions. On their travels one of the female angels slept with kings and even people on the roadside to help their company survive another day, this provides the impetus of the very different sexual world Phedre is born into. There's also some interesting stuff where I think the god figure Elua had a male lover, and consequentially there no one really seems to be hung up about sexual preferences in their part of the world. So in this world, there really isn't any magic, but some of the people apparently are touched by God (or the fallen angels that are essentially worshiped as gods in their culture). There are also other powers in the world, but to talk to much about it might be a bit spoilerish. There are many different cultures, and many of them take a part in the story, but probably the biggest are essentially the barbarians, where the many tribes are brought together by an intelligent barbarian, and they pose a huge threat to civilization.The writing in this book is both a big selling point, but also my biggest problem with the book. I'm generally a fan of a single first person viewpoint for the whole book, and in Kushiel's Dart is does really make it unique, but it's odd. Phedre is so powerless, that it always feels like the action is going on around her (and consequentially around the viewpoint of the reader) instead of her being a part of it. Maybe I'm just too much of a heroic fantasy character fan, but I multiple times wished that I could have instead seen through the eyes of the other characters at certain parts of the book. This is made even worse with the occasional very odd narration performed by a future version of Phedre. It only seems to come into play in the most important moments, and every time it really broke me out of the story. From the frequent usages of \\"later I would look back at this point and regret so-and-so\\" to a complete detachment from the present when most of the main characters from the first book are killed off completely randomly (this scene should have been really powerful, but because of its delivery all I felt was annoyance), to all of the huge important battles later in the book being described from what the narrator learned after the fact. Because of this, I found it difficult to get into the book, and it took me a bit longer to get through than a book usually does. The main story itself in the book is relatively basic though very epic, but it is very well done, and there are a lot of interesting scenes and side-stories.In the end, I did enjoy the book, and I would recommend it if you aren't faint at heart. I'll probably pick up the second book of the series at some point, but I'm not in a hurry. I have a feeling that people who read this book could come out with wildly different opinions, for me I just found it to be a good book, but nothing absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"restored my faith in authors, this book is so interesting that you can not put it down until it is done."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"So I purchased this audio book because my whole family loves this series.

I will be able to put them on her mp3 player, but I am rather annoyed that it was not a regular CD especially when the seller had no where on their description that it was not regular audio cds. Fantastic book though!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a wonderful and provacative series. You will get swept up by the characters and plots. Not for kids."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The story is set in a kind of alternate Europe, primarily in an alter-France called Terre d'Ange. In this world, Christianity never got much of a foothold, because in this world God had a red-headed stepchild, so to speak. Basically, everything's the same as in our world until the crucifixion of Christ (called Yeshua in this world). At that point, Mary Magdalene wept at the cross's feet, and her tears mingled with the blood of Yeshua and produced a kind of angel/god creature called Elua. Some considered Elua an abomination or a mistake, but thirteen angels decided to follow him, reckoning that he was a child of God whether God chose to acknowledge him or not (and God didn't). Also following Elua was a woman named Naamah, a whore who decided to protect and care for this innocent creature by selling herself for his needs---to buy food, to bargain for his life, etc. Elua wandered for a long time and then found the land of Terre d'Ange, where the people there welcomed him, and he and his angels settled down there.Now all the people of Terre d'Ange are known throughout the world for their beauty and grace, since they're all the descendants of angels. And because of Naamah's sacrifices, a sort of &quot;blessed whore&quot; belief has perpetuated itself into the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers---thirteen whorehouse-temples whose prostitutes are all sworn to the service of Naamah (who has the status of the Virgin Mary in this land) in various ways. Some houses specialize in fair, delicate types who blush and faint; others specialize in clownish types who make their patrons laugh; still others specialize in darker arts.Into this mix is born Phedre, a child who's rejected from the house she's born into (the fair-fainting house) primarily because she has a &quot;flaw&quot;---a tiny blood-spot in one eye. In Terre d'Ange, this is called &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; and it's the marker of one chosen by the cruelest of Elua's Angels, the one who administered punishments to sinners. It marks Phedre as an &quot;anguissette&quot;---a masochist.Phedre is sold to a man deeply involved in the politics of Terre d'Ange. He understands immediately what her potential is, so he tutors her in languages, histories, all sorts of things, while she grows up and awaits her debut to the service of Naamah. Once she starts her work---making assignations with the wealthy and powerful of Terre d'Ange society (who seem to consist of an awful lot of sadists) and spying on them---she becomes embroiled in the politics of the land. These politics lead her into an extremely complex and unbelievable series of events, taking her into alternate versions of the Nordic lands, Scotland and Ireland, gypsy country, and beyond. Ultimately she is the only person who can save Terre d'Ange from a terrible invasion---and she goes about it in her own unique style.What I love about this book is its protagonist. Phedre is witty, sensual, cultured, and haughty, and although she enjoys being bound and tortured during sex, she's by no means a subservient character. Indeed, that's a theme of the novel, repeated several times--- &quot;That which yields is not necessarily weak.&quot; She may play the servant at times, but she's always looking out for her own interests, and those of the people she loves. She can be downright ruthless, frankly, and she manages to bring about the downfall of a number of powerful people.I also love the sensuality of this book. This is a world where all of the whores have spent years studying the erotic arts; they even have a textbook whose title translates, in the faux-French of this world, to &quot;Three Million Joys&quot;. And Phedre knows every technique in that book. =P Phedre's assignations are described in delicate but powerful detail---not crude or extensive, but clear enough that the reader sees both how much pleasure she gets from the act, and how she wraps her patrons around her little finger in the process. It's not always pleasant, and those who are repelled by sado-masochism or bondage might find some scenes disturbing. There are also some scenes when Phedre is forced into unwilling slavery to a Nordic lord, and is raped (although because of what she is, she enjoys even this---and hates herself for it). But overall there's more than enough good sex to make up for the not-so-good. Including several female/female scenes; Phedre has no preferences, and her greatest lover/adversary happens to be a woman. (That's another thing I like---there are very few weak women in this novel.)Aside from the lack of m/m stuff, the only other thing I could possibly call a flaw is the absolute complexity of this novel. And I'll qualify that by saying it's not really a flaw; I just prefer not to have to *study* when I read a novel for fun. There are dozens of characters in the book, all from different houses of nobility and different bloodlines of angels and different duchies and so forth, and even quite a few from different countries. And all of them are interwoven in a tapestry of intrigue so deep I almost got lost in it. We discover the threads of this tapestry as Phedre does, and we understand the whole of it only when Phedre comprehends, so for at least half the novel all these characters and all these events are a confusing jumble. Several times I was forced to look at the glossary of characters, thoughtfully placed at the front of the book rather than the back---it's a necessity. However... when the tapestry begins to come together, it does so masterfully, and I realized at that point that all of the layers of detail were absolutely necessary. This is a completely realistic conspiracy, and by the end it's completely realistic that a masochist-spy-prostitute would be the one to foil it.A definite recommend. =)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"...and it was a shame that a book with so much potential should leave me exhausted from laboring through the last 300 pages instead of rushing out to buy Kushiel #2.The story is built around the intruiging concept of an alternate renaissance world (with a religion that coincidentally dovetails with themes from Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code)--and is the only fantasy novel I've read with a map of Europe in the front. Although the names of countries and cities have been changed, they all still had historical roots (in OUR world!) and can be deciphered by any reader with a slight classical background. Kudos to Carey for the obviously extensive research she conducted to give her setting authenticity.The main character Phedre of Terre D'Ange (Land of Angels...aka France) is bought and raised by an erudite nobleman with a hidden agenda of espionage. He has Phedre trained as a courtesan, but in this alternate world the &quot;arts of the bedroom&quot; are related to religious zeal--and the detailed cultural picture of Terre d'Ange painted by the author had me believing it, too. In her acceptable role in society as courtesan, Phedre aids her master by collecting information from her various high-brow clients. Treason and political intrigue gradually sift to the surface...and suddenly Phedre's world is turned upside-down.This is where the book gets very good. I loved watching Phedre and her uptight body-guard named Josslin come to terms with Barbaric Skaldi tribes. And with eachother. Here the characters were at their fullest and held my concert. But what goes up must come down, as the saying goes. Once this major plot point is resolved, the rest of the story drags on, a 300 page anticlimax. The emotion I had felt as the story unfolded suddenly faded.One aspect of the book that jarred me was that for the most part, the story is rooted in the realism of alternate history. For more than 600 pages, the laws of physics etc. are obeyed. Then towards the end several undeniably *magical* occurances were so out of place that I could no longer suspend my belief, and my faith in this beautiful alternate world sprung a leak.It also got annoying the way the author repeated herself, describing the same thing over and over (300+ pages could have been omitted!) Yes, I know that kneeling &quot;abeyante&quot; was the first thing Phedre learned at the Night Court...I don't need to be told every single time she kneels (and she sure kneels a lot)!To sum it up, Kushiels Dart had all the political intrigue, spies and plots I had hoped for, but for all the plot complexities and researched background, didn't have the depth and belivability I'd hoped for."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"If you'd like to skip the review, just know that I recommend this book, ardently. I won't summarize, but here are a few of my first impressions:Yes, it is fantasy, and no, there is no magic. Mostly, anyway.Carey takes a hundred or so pages to set everything into motion. Generally it's a letdown when authors invest so much time on the setting, as most of them don't efficiently use the information set forth there later on (rather, they are just warming up to their own story). You will see Carey, by contrast, relying heavily upon this information all throughout the series. Don't doze through the beginning--though to be realistic, it's hardly trudging reading. I was very entertained.The fighting scenes are incredible. ...The best, I think, out of all fantasy I have read thus far (including such big names as Modesitt Jr., Jordan, Brooks, Williams, Martin)--and I am not saying this out of the bias one incurs by freshly completing a novel. I will enjoy Carey's fighting scenes until I find an author who is better at writing them.As for Carey's writing style: It's very concentrated. She wastes no words whatsoever (unlike, i.e., Robert Jordan). Oh, you'll see Carey have Phedre--the main character--ramble occasionally, but it's evident that this is intended to color her personality and is not due to lacking on Carey's part.This brings me to Phedre. Wow. Suffice it to say that Carey has shown me that I do indeed have an imagination. On a sidenote, I am especially impressed with Carey's understanding of mens' misunderstanding of women. I am male, for the record.As for the other characters... I have truly connected with them. Upon completing this book, I have felt the hallmark sadness we all feel when abandoning characters we have grown attached to. I usually don't feel this. For comparison's sake, I have not felt this attachment with characters in Jordan's or Brooks' books--since ALL of Jordan's characters become permanently annoying at some point, and Brooks' characters are saturated in cliche. With Modesitt Jr., I have felt the attachment fairly so, and Williams and Martin, very much so. I think I am most attached to Carey's characters, though.I notice that, like Martin, Carey is not afraid to kill her characters. Fantasy authors generally don't like to do that, both because of time invested and, more importantly, because the prophetic nature of typical fantasy allows for (requires, even?) all the Good characters to go through hell and come back alive. Carey not only kills important characters ruthlessly, but makes excellent use of their deaths when she does. Everything changes once a character dies--and change, of course, is good. And even then, after all the major change is through with, you will see dead characters having an impact on the story at hand.Perhaps the best thing about Kushiel's Dart is its emotional intensity. True to its theme, when the book is not climaxing, it's sinking--always, always there is the undertone of intermingled pleasure and sorrow. I really, really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am not going to write a plot summary as many readers havedone so already.Why is it a must read? It passed my midnight test - which means that I could not put it down at midnight even though I had to get up early next day. Few books did that for me. Another test it passed - 'common sense' test. That is, if you buy into the writers' premise, settings and characters, do they behave in the manner consistent with the author's world.Pros - Intricate plot, interesting fully fleshed out characters, wonderful flowing language.Cons - Very few and minor. Some unnecessary repetitions.Another that has been brought up, is that some characters are too perfect, or at least better than the rest in some important attribute. Joscelin is the best fighter, Skaldi king is a head taller than everybody is and the smartest one around; Delaunay is best poet and I am not going to even bring up Alcuin, he isso annoying in his perfection.I want to address some reviews that gave this book a low rating.1. People who complain that names are too complicated: you want everyone to be named John Smith? (Or Rand, Mat and Lan?)The setting is alternate France, guess what, they have French names!2. 'Book is too long' - no, it is not. It has something for everyone - love scenes are as important as battles and battles are as important as journeys. All serve a purpose, and the bookwould suffer if you cut any of them out.3. Flowery language - did you read Lord of the Rings? If not, what are you doing reading fantasy?4. The sexual (submissive and homoerotic among others) context - I laughed when I read that one guy, a high schooler, no less, found it boring. To him I say - wait a few years.I also feel some reviewers missed what I consider an absolute main theme of the book: triumph of the heroine over her nature. It is easy for a Conan-type to confront his enemies - it is much harder, if one look at your adversary buckles your knees and melts your heart. Yet, the heroine perseveresand triumphs (and if you think I gave away a major part of thestory - with books two and three to follow, do you think heroinewould die at the end of this one?)In conclusion: Is this the best fantasy/sci fi book I ever read? No.I would put at least Tolkien 'LoTR', George Martins' Song of Ice and Fire, Herberts' 'Dune' and first three of Jordan'sbooks on a level above.However, 'Kushiel's Dart' stands proudly on the next level."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was asked by Tor to review this book a couple of months ago - now I regret that I took so long to pick it up!&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; is a stunning book - the fact that it is a debut novel makes it even the more remarkable.

It makes it sound like it's going to be mostly painful (both for the character involved and the reader to \`view) sex.When I stumbled across the title in my local library therefore, I was predisposed to hate it, so it turned out a surprise when I actually really enjoyed it!All the previous reviews have explained the plot out several times previously, so I won't waste any reader's time regurgitating it in my review.Sure there's a lot of painful sex, but it's done in a strangely tasteful way and it all adds in meaningful ways to the plot, unlike other fantasy authors who simply use it as an obligatory scene to spice up a dull area in the book. The blend of mythic traditions (Norse, Pictish, Celtic) had the potential to turn very, very nasty, but Carey handled them with care and respect, and they've rewarded her by blending seamlessly into the storyline. Some of her new elements, such as the novel \`night court' sub-society, I predict are soon going to be picked up and reused by other authors as being far too good to leave well enough alone.The wanderings of the central character are compelling, the detail is believable, and the writing itself is polished and fluid. If you liked \`Daughter of the Forest' then this is the next book on your reading list."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Four stars may be an ooch on the generous side, but since it's Ms. Carey's first novel, and since about halfway through it got to the point where I couldn't put it down, I don't feel too badly about rounding up the score. Although this novel does fall into the \\"fantasy\\" genre, it's a rather aypical example, with the first half especially almost having a romance novel type of atmosphere. For the most part the mix works, and despite its flaws, this is still an entertaining read.My biggest complaints about the novel are pretty much par for the course for a new author. This one does start out very, very, slowly, and it was an effort at points to muscle my way through the descriptions of the 'night court' and a lot of Phedre's early years. There's a fine line to be walked between adequate history, building characters with depth, layering suspense, and boring the reader, and while the author is MOSTLY successful, this one does start a bit slow for my taste. Secondly, she does use a lot of repetitive language that becomes trying after the first few usages... as another reviewer noted, repeatedly saying \\"If I only knew then...\\" hurts rather than helps the sense of foreshadowing.On to the positives.... and there are many. The second half of the book really, really rolls. What starts out as a rather tedious exercise in court/palace intrigue turns into a fast paced fantasy adventure, almost at the turn of a few pages, and from that point on I simply couldn't put it down. I like the fact that none of the \\"heroes\\" are singularly overwhelming/powerful, and that everything doesn't end up working out perfectly... i.e. victory has a cost. This novel does have more of a flowery/prose feel to the writing, and contains more sexual content than what I normally read, but I can't list these as weaknesses to the novel, as it's clearly what the author intended. Fortunately, those aspects don't take away from the overall plotline, but be forewarned, as they may make this book unacceptable to some readers.Overall... this is a better than decent fantasy novel, pseudo-set in Renaissance europe. Bear with the mythology the writer creates, and it's very easy to become engrossed in the plot. Since this is only the author's first novel, I have hopes that she can clean up some of the imperfections in her future efforts, and am looking forward to picking up volume 2 to see what happens next."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The Dowayne of the Cereus House first called her \\"a whore's unwanted get\\" when she was just a babe. Phedre grew up in the night court, surrounded by the ways of the courtesans, but because of a flaw in her left eye she knew her future would not be among them. It wasn't until a nobleman out of favor with the court identified her as one blessed by the hand of Kushiel that she began to find who, and what, she really was.After her marque is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay she begins to understand that there are plots everywhere to be unearthed. He teaches her to observe and to detect what lies underneath, as well as the arts of the night court, especially that of Phedre's lord Kushiel, who teaches his own to experience pleasure commingled with pain. With her true gift she uncovers a plot to dethrone the current monarchy of Terre D'Ange, a plot put into action by a peer of the realm and the only patron that Phedre has ever truly desired.Phedre must be gotten rid of, for she is the only one who can prove of the horrible deceptions leading up to the demise of the kingdom. And with the aid of a stoic clerk of the Cassiline brotherhood she must find her way back to her home to prove not only the underlying plot, but that she is not a murderess as well. And she must do it in time to stop an impending war with the neighboring nations.I thouroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the others in the series. Some might find it a touch long in some areas, but I found nothing that detracted from the basic story of a young woman who must prove herself against all odds and finds love in the strangest of circumstances. I encourage anyone who enjoys intrigue, mystery, romance, action, fantasy, humor, and one of the greatest villainess of all time to read this book. My only gripe was that two of my favorite characters fell to bad circumstances (one was killed early in the book and one fell under a yeshuite curse in the end of the book) but these elements added to my interest rather than subtracted. Read this book, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I will admit it, I was getting bored with fantasy. It just seems that recently, things have been getting too predictable to care about. Then I picked up Kushiel's Dart. I can't begin to tell you what a breath of fresh air this was, and how relieved I was to find an author worth looking up on the internet....I will say that this is not a book for children. Age limits are irrelevent seeing as how every person is different, so just make sure that your child is ready for the content of this book.Phedre is right up there with Lessa and Rowan as far as my favorite heroines go. She is amazingly deep and introspective without being sappy. Her trials and tribulations don't just make her grow as a person like so many others in fantasy, they add layers of personality, both good and bad, that you don't find very often in contemporary fantasy. For character development, scene setting, politcal intrigue and above all, exquisite culture building, I recommend this book to everyone who wants something different, or just to anyone with an open mind!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I finished Kushiel's Dart, I found myself annoyed at the prospect of reading the sequels. I probably won't. Ultimately I just didn't care about the main character Phedre. And even the idea of following her through two more lengthy sequels is just tiresome.While reading, I was particularly bothered by a couple of things. Off the bat, the \\"prose\\" that many readers have been enamored by put me off. The story being told in first person, the \\"beautiful\\" writing style makes Phedre come off sounding like somebody's arrogant grandmother. And although I never really hated her, I never really liked her or cared what happened to her. At one point Phedre experiences a very big personal loss and becomes a helpless victim, and it just didn't bother me.Now, there are two kinds of people who complain about the SM and sex in the story. Some people were offended by it (too much, too explicit), and others felt disappointed by it (semi-graphic descriptions disappear a third of the way into the story, and Carey tries to describe all of her explicit sex scenes \\"tastefully\\"). It seems that Carey was trying to drive a fine line between too much and too little in the sex department. So, she gives a glimpse of what some of Phedre's sexual encounters are like, and then it's like \\"now, that you know more or less what it's like, we don't have to talk about it any more.\\" And it's understandable that Carey didn't want to over-emphasize sex in the book, didn't want it to come off as straight-up pornographic, but the fact that many of the greater plot complications are more or less resolved with Phedre's sexual encounters makes that seem somewhat hypocritical. And that's one of the other things that really bugged me. No matter how bad it got for her, Phedre always happened to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time in exactly the right capacity (usually as the result of a sexual encounter) to ultimately save the day. So, you'll see a lot of complaints in the critical reviews about how Phedre is an annoying Mary-Sue character with little to no significant faults. She's too perfect to be likeable or even believable. She faces no really hard choices, just rides along with the Plot and experiences very little discernible growth.Didn't have a problem with all the \\"made-up world\\" words. Didn't have a problem with the \\"alternate Europe\\" universe or the Nephilim-based theology with the \\"god\\" Elua being born from the blood of Jesus on the cross and the Magadalene's tears in the earth. Though the sex-based theology did strike me as pretty shallow.Didn't buy how the antagonist Melisande was supposed to be so much more beautiful than the already superlatively beautiful Phedre and the other D'Angeline people--the most beautiful race on the planet. Didn't buy how Melisande supposedly made Phedre's knees weak, etc. Just wasn't convincing.Well, there are a number of other nitpick things I could say, but there are at least 60 other 1, 2, or 3 star ratings for you to temper the glowing praise with. So, have at it!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A racing novel by Jacqueline Carey, 'Kushiel's Dart' is the first in a thrilling trilogy. The heroin, Phe'dre no Delauny, is a sexual masochist, one struck by Kushiel's dart. In her world, politics and religion are two high ranking things.I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of the exquisite writing; deep, intricate plot, and lovely characters."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This was a very good book and definately different. By the time I was done reading this one, it felt like I had read 3 book's worth of information, as this one is very involved and will take you through many different tales. The descriptions were very good, and even if you're a bit shy reading about an anguisette, the writing is fabulously done and the visions are created with great care. I am anxiously awaiting the 2nd book!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is intriguing. The characters and society are richly layered and compelling. The addition of the pain/pleasure aspect to Phaedre's personality as well as her position in society made for an intriguing main character. During the second half--the book begins to drag and become increasingly repetetive, but it picks back up once Phadre and Jocelyn begin their quest to clear their names. There are elements of cheesy romance novel and fantasy interwoven in what is truly an elaborate and fascinating novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A story well told, wrought with intrigue, betrayal, passion and lust. Don't be daunted by the length of the book. It may take a wee bit to get a feel for who's who, but well worth it. Highly recommended, particularly for those who thrive on the sci fi/fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed this book. It held much old mythology and interplayed it with a twist. I found this book to be written for those with intelligence and imagination. For a book whose main character is a religious prostitute the is sex without the book being about sex more the politic and dynamics of the world this character finds herself. I am working on the next novel Kushiels Choosen and it is as intriguing at the first."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a fascinating portrait of a young woman coming into her strength. From humble beginnings, Phedre no Delaunay is transformed by the meeting of outside forces with her own personal choices into one who is only reluctantly aware of the power she wields over others. The book is a political journey more than a physical one, which probably earned it the comparison to Dune. The Hero's Tale is here, though it lacks Dune's wanderings into areas of contemporary concern. We learn much about Terre D'Ange and its sea of characters, but outside the tale itself, there is little. Alas, this lack is aggravated by the Europe-ish world, with nary an attempt to make it someplace truly unique. That and the overwrought language made for frustrating reading at times. Overall, however, I found I was caught up in the inevitability of events enough that Phedre's journey and her progression of relationships was surprisingly believable.I would recommend this title as a study of personal transformation more than as an adventure novel. While exciting things happen, the pace is never breathless, and one feels (too much) as if it's all in the past anyway, and by the very fact that Phedre is narrating the book, we know she'll never die no matter how close she describes herself having come to it. I will read the following installments with interest."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have to admit I was skeptical when it was compared to Dune. But it does not disappoint. Plan ahead to have plenty of spare time to read, because Carey has created a page turner."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What a phenominaly different read. It was a chance buy that really paid off; and though it took me a little while to get into it, I was well and truely rewarded. I have never read a book where the development of the character(s) was the plot in and of itself; leading to an enchanting book and memorable personalities. I have also never been so challenged linguistically during a reading. It's been a long time since I had to pull out a dictionary to look up a word here and there. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book, but some people may be put off by the S&amp;M scenes. The heroine is an indentured prostitute who enjoys pain mixed with sex, but who is also trained as a spy. The descriptions of her encounters with her &quot;patrons&quot; are a little graphic, but you can always skim over them. It is definitely not your ordinary alternate history story line, which makes it a fresh and intriguing read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was FANTASTIC! I could not put it down. Jaquiline Carey refines the art of vastly intricate plotlines made famous by Robert Jordan, and combines it with intrigue, romance, magic, and paints it against a race to stop a war and unite two great lands. Each thread of the story ties in delicately and exquisitely into the larger tapestry, without overly confusing the reader. The first person narrative offers an incredibly unique perspective, and it flows seamlessly throughout the entire book. The heroine Phedre is superbly written, following her life through from birth to about age 20. Her profession as a god-marked dominatrix dream colours the book with sensual and erotic interludes that are neither trashy nor vauge. There is mystery, intruige, pleasure, passion, pain, and a SUPERB love story running underneath it all. I'm drooling in anticipation for the companion to this enthralling novel. You won't be able to put it down. Kudos and standing ovations to Carey; she will be one the giants."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"One thing that can be said for most readers of fantasy/science/ speculative fiction, is that while we generally like to be entertained, we also love to be challenged. We're not tied to hidebound notions of &quot;the way things should be&quot;; rather we are far more interested in the way things &quot;could be&quot;, or &quot;might have been&quot;.Kushiel's Dart is part alternative history, part romance, and part (albeit small) magical journey.Phaedre no Delaunay is one of those intriguing heroines who stretches the limits of what a heroine should be. Is she merely a passive plaything at the hands of a master manipulator, or is she a subtle player in a larger game that even the reader is unaware of? Like Michael Moorcock's intriguing albino, Elric, Phaedre is also blessed/cursed with a rather interesting &quot;gift&quot;, and it is the use of this &quot;gift&quot; that forms much of the crux of the novel.There is a rather intriguing take on the Christian faith, and one that may incite hyper-sensitive readers. All others will find it thought-provoking.This is author Jacqueline Carey's first novel, and she is to be commended for writing a multi-faceted novel that takes the reader beyond what a fantasy book can be. This is a huge and lush novel that is to be savored in small bits, and enjoyed like a box of truffles. I am left wanting more from this author, and I am certain that any first time readers will be feeling the same way."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have read a lot of fantasy and a lot of political intrigue, however, I have always shied away from the romance/sex genre. For some reason I decided to try this book, and I am so glad I did. If the description of masochistic sex doesn't offend you, then I highly recommend this book. I will not go into great detail, but I felt the book was superbly written, and exciting to read. (I have to admit, I did get lost a few times, it is very complex.)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I absolutely fell i love with this book. From the day i bought it until i turned the last page i could not put it down. It is so nice to see a fantasy writer, writing political intruige at such a mature level. Kushiels Dart is also many other things; a coming of age story, a love story, a war story, historical fiction, and an interesting look at human sexuality. This book had me guessing until the end, and thats another rarity in fantasy. After finishing this novel i wanted to run out of the house and tell everyone i knew to read it...instead i used the phone."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a sumptuous, sensuous, sophisticated book; it's magnificent.

Her books immerse you and keep your firmly entrenched within her surreal but realistic and delicious worlds regardless of where or what your body and grey matter are currently invovled in and when the book is done it is like it must be for an addict to go into painful withdrawls. Keep these delightful books coming Ms. C. As I am a fan for life. To all others, do not let her series, in all of their glory and heartbreak go unread by thine eyes.

Yes, I know, that doesn't sound romantic, but reading is believing! It is set in a fictional interpretation of medieval Europe. The protagonist is a child who is trained in her youth to become a courtesan and who ultimately rises in ranks to become personal friend and protector of the queen. FANTASTICALLY WRITTEN! If you love fantasy fiction and have an open mind, you will find it difficult to put this book down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book. To be honest the first thing that attracted me to it was the length. I'm one of those readers that like really big books, I don't know maybe it's because I like the most bang for my buck, maybe it's because I just like the metaphorical weight in my hands, whatever the reason, I tore through this book in three days. It's one of those books that you just can't put down. I don't think I understood what that meant until I read this novel. And let me say this, the villain in this book is one of the best antagonists I have encountered in a long, long, time. She will truly send shivers down your spine. The prose is truly lush and decadent, and within the setup of this world, that really works. This novel really does have something for everyone, and while the political rigmarole can at times be hard to follow, that by no means deters the book from the larger course of telling its story. Reader beware! You will become invested into these characters and you will lose days of your life to this book. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the kind of fantasy I like, with tons of intrigue and behind-the-scenes machinations. Swords & quests & dragons & elves don't interest me nearly as much.It's been in my TBR pile for a very long while. Partly because it's a big fat doorstop of a book, and partly because of all the raves surrounding it. Since mostly everyone focused on the erotic aspects, I was expecting something like LKH's Anita-Does-Everyone books.It wasn't. At all.The heroine is a born masochist (which is what \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" refers to--she was born with a red speck in her eye, the sign of someone for whom pain = pleasure), and a trained spy.I docked it a half star because the story meandered around for the first quarter of the book (and at 900+ pages, a quarter is a lot) before it settled down into something coherent, and several times I was tempted to put it down.Books like this are a major reason why I don't quit reading if I don't like a book at first. I'm hoping that now that the character's introduced, and Carey has some more experience, the sequel won't have the same problem."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and didn't really like it afterwards. I picked it up again when several people recommended this book. I gave it another try and found again that this book is lacking.I picked this book because I was intrigued by the BDSM theme of the book. I am very much interested in Alternative lifestyle books especially in the realm of Sci-Fi/Fantasy.I stand by my first impression. My first impression was that Jacqueline Carey liked the idea of having her main character like BDSM but she never gave the reader BDSM. It was more like a tease fade to black. We are told that Phedre like pain with her sex but every time that the book comes close to showing a BDSM it falls short-it paints a negative view about those who likes BDSM with the only one that is not painted as \\"evil\\" is Phedre herself because she wasn't raised \\"in\\" the proper school and wasn't taught anything about her unique gift from her god. So we get an typical romance heroine who likes a little pain with her straight up sex.The plot was typical and boring. A young girl forced into a life of prostitution because her mother was one before her. She is \\"rescued\\" by a good man who raises her in order to use her. She then sets down the road of court intrigue which is a typical of many books in this genre.As far as the sex, it's fluff, it's nothing to do with the BDSM culture. Not that I expect Jacqueline Cary to use crude language but the language in the book is very archaic and a bit out of place. She uses Phallic for a male sexual organ. And she use similar jargon to describe the sexual act it's self. It comes out flat and disjointed.I expected to pick this book up and have a world where BDSM was an acceptable way of life, or a lifestyle choice, but Jacqueline Carey painted a very misguiding, un-research, incoherent, and silly picture of people who live in this type of lifestyle.Carey villains seemed a little to contrived, to formulated and too stereotypical Machiavellian. (and too easily defeated and defeated in a stereotypical bland way) and not in a good way. The enemy in the book is clearly marked in the beginning of the book, and gets the to break Phedre - but again it's the stereotypical and a little boring.I would defiantly check this book out in the library, before you buy any books in this series. I bought the whole series because of the recommendation that I received. Don't take my word-I am just venting an alternate view of the book. Judge for yourselves."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"....if you are not one of them, however, may I recommend something else? ANTHING else, in fact?There is something unduly sad about reading an author who might be a talented wordsmith if not for the fact that this is one long playout of her warped sexual fantasies. I don't demean or condemn this kind of literature; certainly it has its place among people who get off on scenes of cutting and abuse, rape and torture. How lovely. The involvement of children is quite disturbing to me personally, but again, I guess if you're into erotica, you will love this book. I just expect a little more high fantasy and less sexual leather fantasy from Tor. Perhaps they should rename the publishing house TORE."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This review is for the price of the Kindle version.I've read this book. I've read the sequels. I enjoy this author and her characters.I bought a Kindle to hold a number of books in one area without taking up the space that even one paperback does (I'm in the Navy; I don't have room to take too many books on deployment) AND because in my mind, ebooks should be cheaper than physical because there are less producing costs.So why on earth is the Kindle price for these books the same as a paperback? What is the point of buying a $150 electronic storage for books that don't have any further content than the words on the screen, to pay a price for a physical copy that takes up more storage and can be lent/resold/given away, etc? Wouldn't publishers make more money by supplying more ebooks and cheaper costs since it's harder to transfer those files than a physical book?"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"For how popular this novel and it's sucessors are, I find it hard to believe that all the people seeming to be reading are really understanding it. To put it simply, this book is more difficult to read than Guy Gavriel Kay, and that's saying something. The intricate language and complicated situations would normally be fascinating to me, but in this instance, the author comes across as not sounding intelligent, but trying to sound impressive. I thought the purpose of writing a novel was to entertain your readers, not confuse them and to try and sound smart at their expense. Right now I'm not trying to represent those of lesser intelligence, because seriously, this book is very hard to read. I found myself zoning out as I tried to stay focused. Also, though someone thinking about buying this book probably would have already figured this fact out from reviews, this book basically deals with a woman whose occupation is prostitution, and in the fantasy world in whcih she lives, it isn't a career that was frowned upon. Another thing to be wary of- if the very erotic bothers you, skip this book. The author really gets into the varied S&M forms of sex in Kushiel's Dart. The biggest problem I had is that it seems to be the norm that with these complex stories, many extraneous characters and events are introduced into the plot- and then never have any significance later on. Well, why is that? To add more color to the story? It's just exasperating. I've spoken with several of my friends to whom I've passed my copy of Kushiel's Dart along to, and when I mention the length and difficulty of reading the language, there is the common reaction of looking embarrassed, and then saying something like, \\"Well, yeah, it was hard to read... but everyone says it was so good!\\" Well, the storyline was definately interesting, and the fact that the author could write an entirely fictional story with governmental intrigue and the like is most impressive. I'm not adverse to books that are of complicated material- I think it adds spice to overused cliches of storylines. However, I was suprised that no one else mentioned in their reviews how hard this book was to read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I did not like it.

I found myself bookless at my boyfriend's house & he suggested I pick this one up. The first third of the book (I still can't believe I stuck it out that long) was PAINFULLY slow. Too many characters and lands with unnecessarily long titles, too many wordy explanations. I couldn't stop squirming as I read.But then...It got GOOD - REALLY GOOD. The story hit it's stride, developed tentacles and sucked me in; I couldn't put the gosh-darn thing down. Invariably, I had to check that I was still breathing after each intense twist and turn. Read other reviews for character and plot details. This reviewer's intent is to simply encourage that you READ ON! It's very, very worth it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is seen totally through the eyes of Phedre, a courtesan and spy raised in the Night Courts of the kingdom of Terre D'Ange, a land founded by fallen angels. In this land, the supreme command of their God is \\"Love as Thou Wilt\\", and there are 13 houses of courtesans, each with a different attitude towards sex, from Joy to elegance to mysticism, and, yes, even S&M;, who support this commandment. Phedre is marked by Kushiel's dart as an anguisette, one who takes pleasure from pain. She is indentured in the service of Anafiel no'Delauny who protects her and teaches her how to use her intelligence and bedskills to extract information from his enemies. Intrigue and treachery are everywhere and Phedre finds herself in the thick of it, when one close to them betrays her and Delauney. Her travels take her from her homeland to the harsh Skaldi northlands to the isles of Alba and back to her beloved Terre D'Ange, accompanied by an ever increasing number of faithful followers, as she races against time to save the land she loves from treacherous betrayers.This book is beautifully written, the intrigues are direly clever, and Phedre, for all her strange quirks, is a joy to read about......... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Price Of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock.............."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to take a chance and buy Kushiel's Dart(it was hard cover and not cheap), but it was worth it. I was unable to put this book down, as I was drawn into the detailed web of beauty, power and intrigue. It is amazing that this a debut novel as it is stunningly written, with flowing descriptions and imagery and unforgettable characters.As it has been said in previous reviews, the novel does focus on the arts of pleasure which Phedre employs, and that some are violent and rather disturbing. However this is part of the character, the pain of these acts is almost a neccessity for her. She may despise the reactions of her body in certain situations but it an integral aspect of her which makes her who she is. Carey uses her skill for vivid imagery to describe some of the scenes, however it is not porn. Instead she describes the situations with rich words which cover more than graphic blow-by-blow accounts do. The novel is not masochist porn, but rather a different aspect to such actions.I will admit I did not care much for the protagonist at the start of the book, she was rather willful and self-centred instead I preferred the surrounding characters who are just as important and as richly described. You will love some and hate some, but they will remain vividly in your mind long after reading. Whether it is the subtle deceptiveness of Delauney, the cruel cold beauty of Melisandre or the heoric stubborness of Josclin, they will stay with you long after you have closed the book.Take a chance like I did and buy this amazing book. It will spellbind you with its intricate plots and wonderous people. A true gem to fantasy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I enjoy Storm Constantine, so when I heard her quote on this, I picked it up. I hate typical fantasy - magick, witches,elves, etc. Especially women's fantasy - usually too romance oriented. However, I fell in love with this book from Chapter 1. Watching the heroine grow up in this strange religion of holy (prostitutes), courtiers, and royalty. It mixes \\"Dangerous Liasions\\" with \\"Braveheart\\" The battle sequences are action-packed, the sex scenes tinged with S/M. It was just really original, fun, and emotional. I even got tears in my eyes in parts. Some people might find it too dark and too weird, but if you're looking for something completely new - try this. And the ending is such a cliff-hanger you'll scream in frustration, and probably keel over of impatience waiting for the second! Read this NOW!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"KUSHIEL'S DART is an extraordinary epic set in a re-imagined medieval Europe. This is one of those rare books that combines an intricate plot with extremely well developed characters. The story is told through the voice of young Ph&eacute;dre n&oacute; Delaunay, a courtesan and spy in the country of Terre d'Ange but the supporting &quot;cast&quot; is given full attention as well-without bogging down in minutia.Throughout the sweeping epic, Jacqueline Carey never loses sight of the arch of the story so be forewarned: everything she writes is significant. At the end, you will see how she's tied all the pieces together into a tightly woven whole. Oh, but there is a window left open for a sequel. Whether you read this book because the characters are fascinating, the story fun and nerve-wracking, the writing exceptional, or the sense of place and religion so believable, I know you'll be satisfied. This is my new favorite book!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book had me from page one. Though I must admit I was quite apprehensive at first, due to the synopsis of the book (it isn't something I would normally read even if it is of the Fantasy genre) and because it was written in first person. I have this great dislike of books written in first person, and have always said that a book in the Fantasy genre could not be written in first person, there are simply too many characters involved to pull it off. Well, Jacqueline Carey proved me wrong in this.I must admit that I found the first four hundred pages or so a bit slow, not enough to turn me off reading but enough that I will willing to put the book down at any moment, the middle of a chapter or the middle of a paragraph it didn't matter, I could set it down. But the moment it left my fingers I was reaching towards it again, I just had to know what was going to happen next. The thing that really kept me glued to the pages was the intrigue of the book, the various mysteries that surrounded the numerous characters, the bits of information that trickled in taunting you with the possibilities of answers but also leading to even more questions. And then of course there was the mystery surrounding Anafiel Delaunay. I kept wondering just who he was and what his true purpose was.Even as some of the mysteries came to light, revealing answers I may have guessed at, and in most cases did not see coming, I was still enthralled with what would happen next. After the first half of the book there was nothing that could make me put it down. Each paragraph, each chapter had me begging for more. Phedere is a strong character who kept surprising me along the way, I knew she was clever and well versed in many things thanks to the training Delaunay saw her to, but even then I was impressed by the things she pulled off.The sex scenes, if I can truly call them that, were, well they were somewhat what I would expect out of this sort of book, considering what Phedere was. However I did find them also disappointing. It seemed that they focused so much on her pleasurable torment that it was added as more of an afterthought at the end of \`oh and they also had sex'. That being said, I have never been a fair of reading sex scenes, but I felt that this book somewhat needed them, or at least needed better ones. The one scene I was dying to have better detail of was between Phedere and Josceline. I saw it coming, was glad it was happening, but again found myself disappointed at what was actually played out in that scene.With all the characters in this book I was very interested in their role among the puzzle pieces. How would they effect the next piece? Would they reveal who they truly were or continue to wear a mask that hide things? So many questions and as the book came to an end I realized how many are yet to be answered. Those answers will of course come in the next book and perhaps even the third book in the series. One thing I am looking forward to is the finding out what will happen with Melisande, a character I both hate and love."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was first recommended to me by a friend who was serving oversees, who convinced me to read it after he threw me the tantalizing bait that the main character reminded him of me.OK, I don't necessarily buy into that either but it was enough to get me to go against my better judgment and read the novel. I'm so glad I did.My fears prior to reading this were:1. It would be some cheezy romance with a thin plot strung through.2. It would be some cheezy erotica with a thin plot strung through.3. It would be some cheezy teenage boy's fantasy with no real character development and a thin plot strung though.4. It would be nothing more than torture porn with a thin plot strung through.I was wrong on all accounts.From the first few paragraphs, beginning with the heroine recounting her early childhood and discovering her position in society and to the royal court, I realized that this was a novel with actual, three-dimensional characters who learn and grow throughout the story. This isn't just rare in \\"dark\\" or \\"erotic fantasy\\", it is rare in most works of modern fiction. Carey did a superb job of developing not only the history of the characters but also a fascinating, alternate history for its setting.I read with dismay some other reviewers who were put off by an \\"Anguissette\\" (a woman who takes pleasure from pain) being the heroine. My response to this would be to further explain that not only are the sex acts entirely consensual, they are met with absolute enthusiasm by a heroine who was literally born to do just that. Enthusiasm is the polar opposite of forced or unwilling sex. There is more to complain about regarding many \\"romance\\" novels (especially \\"proper\\" Victorian romances, as well as those written in the 70s & 80s) where heroines need to be raped in order for them to experience the \\"pleasure\\" from sex. I can appreciate that not all readers may wish to identify with such a heroine. This does not mean we cannot appreciate the story, even if the sex acts are not our cup of tea. There is plenty of mystery/espionage/adventure/drama for many appetites. For those of us who may understand that the lines between pleasure and pain can often be blurred, this story is a welcome relief to both the torture porn and the vanilla \\"erotica\\" which saturates our culture. It is everything it claims to be and more.Still, this novel is not for everyone. If you are someone who:1. Thinks \\"erotic fantasy\\" includes the Star Wars scenes between Han & Leia / Anakin & Padme;2. Thinks that the only acceptable sex is vanilla sex, regardless of the desires of those involved;This book would not be for you.However, do not begrudge those of us who find Carey's work absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Plot Summary: A beautiful baby girl with a scarlet mark in one iris is deemed damaged goods, and thus sold to a brothel. Ph&eacute;dre grows up training for whoredom, and in her early teens she is purchased by a scholar whose political game runs deep. He trains her mind to complement her body, and uses her to gather information from horny aristocrats. From there, the story turns into an epic saga of slavery, escape, diplomacy, and battle. Supporting Ph&eacute;dre is a woefully small cadre of friends, but foremost is a conflicted warrior-priest who becomes her greatest protector and love.I was really close to giving this my top rating, but I can't ignore some pressure points that bugged me along the way. Since this is a hefty series, I'll save my raves in the hope that the next book(s) blows me away. I think it's accurate to call this story an epic, and during the days I spent reading it (yeah, it's a big one) I ran a whole gamut of emotions from boredom, to anticipation, to disgust, to admiration, and finally satisfaction.Jacqueline Carey's pseudo-European fantasy land feels comfortable and exotic at the same time. Staged in the era of horses, sails, and swords, the climate, tribes, and religions closely mimic human history with a few twists. The list of characters must number over 50 (and yes, there is a list a the beginning), and to be blunt, I did not find it encouraging. The sheer amount of information that the reader needs to absorb to understand the plot is intimidating, and I found the first third of this book to be tedious as a result. Fortunately there is a dramatic turning point that kicks off a never-ending series of adventures that carried me to the end.The crux of the tale rests on Ph&eacute;dre, our unlikely heroine from humble beginnings. I don't feel the need to couch this in polite terms - Ph&eacute;dre is a whore, and she was trained to be the ultimate pleasure servant from her childhood. This is fairly titillating in itself, but it gets even better, since she's also an anguissette (someone who derives pleasure from pain), so Ph&eacute;dre is the perfect plaything for men and women who get off on S&M.; The sex scenes manage to be both shockingly graphic and obtuse at the same time. Carey shows just enough to give the reader an understanding of Ph&eacute;dre's gift, curse, or whatever you'd call it, but it's usually just a passing glimpse. I for one am grateful, because I happen to be a big fat wimp when it comes to pain, and I won't pretend that I understand how whips and flechettes enhance sex.Ph&eacute;dre uses either her brain or her body without compunction throughout the story, and if I didn't always admire her, I didn't begrudge her drive to survive. I absolutely hated her sick, twisted, and desperate relationship with the nemesis of the story, and I'm still having a hard time believing that Ph&eacute;dre could love and hate this person in equal measure. Those were the moments that made it hard for me to admire her, since I didn't understand this strange sexual, mystical compulsion that manipulates Ph&eacute;dre without needing her consent. It was weird, to say the least.There are many characters that demand attention throughout this narrative, but I found Joscelin to be the most interesting of all. He's a warrior-priest who is constantly battling himself regarding his vows, and his development is like watching a bone break and grow back even stronger. Joscelin's relationship with Ph&eacute;dre was definitely a highlight for me, and it's one of the reasons I'm interested in continuing this series. It's not every day that I read something as grand and ambitious as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and I tip my hat to the excellent storytelling that had me hooked from the first crisis onward."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend initially because he thought I would like it. From reading the back cover I was a little dubious. It sounded like erotica thinly veiled as fantasy. But I was deeply impressed by this book. There are scenes that are erotic, but they are backed up by a plot and a world that is rich and full of depth...which is exactly the sort of thing I love in a book. If you are looking for straight romance, then you might not enjoy this book as much as I did, but if you are looking for a complex world and an interesting plot, then I think you will love this book.My favorite aspect of the world is the religion Carey creates that is a spin-off of Christianity, with the main precept of \\"love as you will\\". I just find the notion to be very intriguing...especially since \\"love\\" can and is interpreted in many different ways in the book (so it's not just one mindless sex scene after another).I actually enjoyed this book so much that even though the hardback is over 700 pages long, I pulled an all nighter and read it in one sitting. I have since purchased the entire series because these books are the rare ones that I will want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey, Kushiel's Dart (Tor, 2001)After my first day on Kushiel's Dart, I tallied up the pages I'd read, extrapolated, and budgeted a month for finishing this nine-hundred-page doorstop. It's now five days later, and I finished it last night. There's a lesson to be learned from this: sometimes the pace of the opening pages of a novel do not prepare the reader for what is to come. (Not that I advocate dropping the fifty-page rule, by any means, but just something to note.) I really should know better; Martin's now-iconic A Song of Ice and Fire has one of the slowest first hundred pages I've come across in a modern fantasy series.Kushiel's Dart is the story (or the first bit of it, anyway) of Phedre no Delaunay, who lives in an alternate-world France during what would seem to be (and my apologies if I'm showing my ignorance of European history here) an era roughly akin to the reign of Louis XIII. This land of Carey's, though, is about as different from Earth as could be. Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a son named Elua, and it is he and his disciples who form the basis of civilized religion in this world. France (Terre d'Ange) and England (Alba) are not trade partners, nor are they enemies; the English Channel is uncrossable, thanks to a figure named the Master of the Straits, capable of whipping up storms to sink any boat that tries to make contact with the other civilization. Italy (Caerdicci) is a land filled with plotting slithery-type folks (okay, so that doesn't really differ from Alighieri's description of Italy a few centuries before all that much). Everything from Germany eastward, as far as we know, is ruled by the Skaldi, northern barbarians. Terre d'Ange is not, to put it mildly, in a terribly strategic position. As if the threats from the outside weren't enough, politics is waged like war within the kingdom. Phedre's patron, Anafiel Delaunay, is one of the combat's most adept players, and he brings Phedre-- born into a house of courtesans-- up to be not only the courtesan she was born to be, but a spy as well. And while the first half of the book seems nothing more than Phedre's memoirs, eventually the plot is revealed in all its glory. And then the real adventures begin.That the second half of the book is good is, to be fair, not much of an accomplishment. Once you start packing in the action, it's pretty easy to make just about anything readable. What truly impresses me about Kushiel's Dart is that, even with the slight pacing problems of the first fifty or so pages, the first part of the book is just as good. I should mention at this juncture that I don't really do memoirs. Why bother, especially in an age where one can become a star by writing a memoir (rather than writing a memoir because one is a star)? Writing of the \\"and so it went\\" variety just doesn't normally work for me. Unless you've got a really good, solid writer on your hands. And the first half of this book is constant, unrelenting \\"and so it went,\\" to the point of the phrase \\"and thus it was...\\" being used multiple times. And I still lapped it up. Why? Because, unlike most of these wannabe memoirists writing actual memoirs these days, Phedre no Delaunay is actually an interesting character. Which, I guess, is easier to do if you're fictional, but Phedre's voice reads real. She's nave in all the places you'd expect, with a gradually increasing sense of wisdom (and somewhat unavoidable cynicism, given her various plights). These characters interact with one another well, and they're very well-drawn. They could just move around and talk, and it would be interesting. (Oh, wait, that's the first half of the novel.)There are a few weak points in the novel, most of which are first-novel-blues kinds of things. Chief among them is repetition; the repeated piece that stood out most to me was everyone's wryness. And I mean everyone. They all had wry grins, or spoke wryly, or what have you. I don't think I've seen the word \\"wry\\" that much since my last kosher meats convention. (I hasten to add that bad puns are entirely the fault of the review author, and the book is not cursed with them.) That said, such things are certainly not going to keep me from reading what promises to be the rest of an absorbing, fascinating series. ****"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have to say I had really low expectations going into this book. I bought it to read to my wife, who has a vision disability, but loves the fantasy genre, and there is very little serious romantic fantasy out there, even less available on audiotape. I reluctantly chose this one, figuring I'd suffer through it for her entertainment. From the premise of the book, described on the back cover, I expected it to be a practically endless sequence of raunchy sadomasochistic sexual encounters weakly tied together by a paper-thin plot. Can you blame me? Here's what it says of the main character: \\"chosen [by some divine power] to forever experience pleasure and pain as one.... trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bed-chamber...\\" How could that possibly have prepared me for the depth and skill of storytelling I was in for by reading this book?We hear the story as told by Ph&egrave;dre, who bears the mark of \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" as the scarlet mote in her eye is referred to. This first volume in the trilogy starts with her humble beginnings as the \\"unwanted get\\" of a woman of little social consequence, her indenture into the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers, and her rise into the highest social circles of the city. That's merely the first act. The trilogy is set in an alternate history of Europe, where the principal difference seems to be that in this novel, the French may actually be justified in their claim to divinity. The story's main location is geographically analogous to our world's France, but in Ph&egrave;dre's world, it is called Terre D'Ange (Land of Angels), because the inhabitants (D'Angelines) are descended from divine beings who left the holy land over a thousand years previously. The religion is explained early on in the story, and is close to, but not quite, real-world Christianity. The story takes place some time in the late middle ages or the early Renaissance. Carey uses real-world societies from various time periods to model her world upon. The names of the nations are changed to older, variations on, or more obscure references to those regions they describe. Spain is Aragonia, for example, England is Alba, and so on.The stage thus set, Carey proceeds to weave an intricate story of politics, love, betrayal, and adventure. One of the strongest points to recommend this story is the cast of characters. The many political figures who take a role in the story are all well-developed characters, each illustrated in great detail in the story, each with their own multifaceted personalities, desires, merits, flaws, and distinctive habits. There are erotic episodes, as the summary implies, but they are woven into the story so seamlessly, and in fact essential to the plot, so that to dismiss this book as merely common erotica is selling it far too short. To begin with the concept of a main character whose uniqueness is based in the erotic, and to build such a full and complicated story, Carey shows a skill with the written word rarely seen in fantasy today, and in fact in most genres of literature.No work of fiction is perfect. This book was not without its flaws or idiosyncrasies. Many of the reviews here complain about the overly flowery speech, indicating that the telling detracts from the tale. It depends a bit on personal taste, but I didn't think that the narration style was too far over the top, and it was entirely consistent. What did become tiresome in this first volume is that the \\"voice\\" of the narration is as if these events happened long ago in Ph&egrave;dre's life, and she is telling this as if looking back through the years. The consequence of this motif is that the first 400 pages are rife with this one clich&eacute; that began to get frustratingly repetitive. She is constantly saying something to the effect of, \\"...if only I had known then what I know now...\\" It did lend a foreshadowing of tragedy to the telling, but was used much too often. Fortunately she lays off that clich&eacute; about halfway through the book, and while it does rear its head occasionally after that, it is nowhere near as pervasive.So much happens in this one book that it would use more words than I'm allotted to describe all the various plots, subplots, and cliffhangers and give my opinion of each. We are treated to vibrant descriptions of many of the locales of Ph&egrave;dre's world, traveling through D'Angeline cities, barbarian villages, rough wilderness, high seas, and palace halls. Ph&egrave;dre finds and loses friends along the way and each one she comes to know, we know through her. Her enemies, as well, we come to know, and find that they are not the typical cardboard cutout villains that one typically finds in tales of love and magic. These villains have motivations that one could even sympathize with under the right conditions, and this use of moral shades of gray heightens the complexity of the work as a whole. The 900 pages pass in the blink of an eye, and I couldn't tell you the number of times I finished reading a chapter aloud, and my wife and I looked at each other and could say nothing more than \\"Wow.\\"One of the writer blurbs on one volume of this series says that the trilogy has \\"something for everyone,\\" and I think that's the best description I've heard yet. Complicated political plots within plots, a multilayered back story that could support a novel or two of its own, fantastic swordfights, massive army battles, erotic sex scenes, fascinating personal relationships... I could go on. I consider this book one of the nicest surprises I've had in a while, in that it was a totally unexpected enjoyment. After reading the entire trilogy aloud to my wife, we look forward to anything else Jacqueline Carey publishes in the future."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a first-time novel by Jacqueline Carey, and honestly---it's books like this that restore my faith in the publishing industry. =P I have read novels by long-time writers which were nowhere near as richly detailed, powerfully written, or just plain interesting. Now I know that publishers aren't just looking for the next Robert Jordan or Mercedes Lackey. They *do* actually care about quality.Anyway, enough babbling. The story is set in a kind of alternate Europe, primarily in a pseudo-France called Terre d'Ange. In this world, Judeo-Christianity never got much of a foothold, because in this world God had a red-headed stepchild, so to speak. Basically, everything's the same as in our world until the crucifixion of Christ. At that point, Mary Magdalene wept at the cross's feet, and her tears mingled with the blood and produced a kind of angel/god creature called Elua. Some considered Elua an abomination or a mistake, but thirteen angels decided to follow him, reckoning that he was a child of God whether God chose to acknowledge him or not (and God didn't). Also following Elua was a woman named Naamah, a whore who decided to protect and care for this innocent creature by selling herself for his needs---to buy food, to bargain for his life, etc. Elua wandered for a long time and eventually found the land of Terre d'Ange, where the people welcomed him, and he and his angels settled down there.In the present time of the novel, the people of Terre d'Ange are known throughout the world for their beauty and grace, since they're all the descendants of angels. And because of Naamah's sacrifices, a sort of \\"blessed whore\\" tradition has perpetuated itself into the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers---thirteen whorehouse-temples whose male and female prostitutes are all sworn to the service of Naamah (who has the status of the Virgin Mary in this land) in various ways. Some houses specialize in delicate beauties who blush and faint; others specialize in clownish types who make their patrons laugh; still others specialize in darker arts.Into this mix is born Phedre, a child who's rejected from the house she's born into (the delicate-fainter house) primarily because she has a \\"flaw\\"---a tiny blood-spot in one eye. In Terre d'Ange, this is called \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" and it's the marker of one chosen by the cruelest of Elua's angels, Kushiel, who administered punishments to sinners in Purgatory. It also marks Phedre as an \\"anguissette\\"---a masochist.Phedre is sold to a man deeply involved in the politics of Terre d'Ange. He understands her potential immediately, so he tutors her in languages, histories, all sorts of things, while she grows up and eagerly awaits her debut to the service of Naamah. Once she starts her work---making assignations with the wealthy and powerful of Terre d'Ange society (who seem to consist of an awful lot of sadists) and spying on them---she becomes embroiled in the politics of the land. These politics lead her into an extremely complex and shocking series of events, taking her into alternate versions of the Nordic lands, Scotland and Ireland, gypsy country, and beyond. Ultimately she is the only person who can save Terre d'Ange from a terrible invasion---and she goes about it in her own unique style.What I love about this book is its protagonist. Phedre is witty, sensual, cultured, and haughty, and although she enjoys being bound and tortured during sex, she's by no means a subservient character. Indeed, that's a theme of the novel, repeated several times--- \\"That which yields is not necessarily weak.\\" She may play the servant at need, but she's always looking out for her own interests, and those of the people she loves. She can be downright ruthless, frankly, and she manages to bring about the downfall of a number of powerful people.I also love the sensuality of this book. This is a world where all of the whores have spent years studying the erotic arts before they ever lose their virginity; they even have a textbook. And Phedre knows every technique in it. Phedre's assignations are sometimes described in tactful but powerful detail---not crude or pornographic, but clear enough that the reader sees both how much pleasure she gets from the act, and how she wraps her patrons around her little finger in the process. It's not always pleasant, and those who are repelled by sado-masochism or bondage might find some scenes disturbing. There are also some scenes when Phedre is forced into unwilling slavery to a Nordic lord, and is raped (although because of what she is, she enjoys even this---and hates herself for it). But overall there are more than enough good scenes to make up for the not-so-good. Including several homosexual encounters, as a warning to those with more limited tastes. Phedre has no preferences, and her greatest lover/adversary happens to be a woman. (That's another thing I like---there are very few weak women in this novel.)The only thing I could possibly call a flaw is the absolute complexity of this novel. And I'll qualify that by saying it's not really a flaw; I just prefer not to have to *study* when I read a novel for fun. There are dozens of characters in the book, all from different houses of nobility and different bloodlines of angels and different duchies and so forth, and even quite a few from different countries. And all of them are interwoven in a tapestry of intrigue so deep I almost got lost in it. We discover the threads of this tapestry as Phedre does, and we understand the whole of it only when Phedre comprehends, so for at least half the novel all these characters and all these events are a confusing jumble. Several times I was forced to look at the glossary of characters, thoughtfully placed at the front of the book rather than the back---it's a necessity. However... when the tapestry begins to come together, it does so masterfully, and I realized at that point that all of the layers of detail were absolutely necessary. This is a completely realistic conspiracy, and by the end it's completely realistic that a masochist-spy-prostitute would be the one to foil it.A definite recommend. =)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Others have written about the plot, so I'll concentrate on who would probably like this book best, and who should probably avoid it.Fantasy readers who like magic-focused stories---there's not enough magic here, except in the symbolic and vaguely mystical sense, to interest you. This world's magic is all psychological. Anyone looking for standard fantasy or sci-fi---avoid this book. There's nothing standard about it. The story is set in an alternate version of Europe, but this is just a trick to allow the reader to more easily comprehend the cultural and political complexity that Carey has written into this novel. Once the reader figures out that the Skaldi, for example, are basically Scandinavian/Vikings with all the attendant cultural tropes, that saves the necessity for tedious culture-building and lets the author get to the real meat of the story---the characters. Speaking of which, people who like a world-focused story should also avoid this. This story is not about the decadent country of Terre D'Ange and its people and troubles. The story is about a very complex woman who lives in this world, loves it, suffers for it, and ultimately triumphs. A key theme of the novel is, &quot;That which yields is not always weak.&quot;And---it must be said---people who have even the slightest unease about reinterpretations of the Christian faith, or people who are even slightly squidged by alternative sexuality of any kind---this is not the book for you. You'll find yourself wondering why the author is spending so much time on the sex, or why she's chosen to reinterpret Christianity in this fashion, and frankly---if you have to ask, you shouldn't be reading this book. Might as well ask why Frank Herbert chose to reinterpret Islam, Catholicism, and gender politics in &quot;Dune&quot;. Speculative fiction doesn't always speculate only about science or history or the macabre; sometimes it speculates about human society, and I've personally found this to be the best speculative fiction of all.As for who *should* read this book... Well, the opposite of the above, for starters: fans of religion in fantasy/sci-fi (particularly alternative religions), fans of alternative sexualities, fans of mysticism, fans of avant-garde fantasy. To add to that, fans of star-crossed traditional romance will find something juicy here, too, in the danger-filled relationship of the seductive Phedre and the celibate warrior-monk Joscelin. Fans of excellent writing should definitely read this, just to be treateed to some of the most artful and elegant prose I've read in a long time. Fans of strong female characters--- the strength of this character is far more subtle than what you'll see in most books, but undeniable nevertheless. Fans of mystery and intrigue, a definite recommend, although I found this to be the one weakness of the book. The intrigue is sometimes *too* dense (for this reader to comprehend, at least), and its revelations were sometimes too subtle for me to interpret. I think sometimes Carey forgets that not all readers are trained to this, like Phedre!Not everyone will or can love this book, and if you don't love it you'll probably hate it, with no middle ground. The styles are too unusual and the themes too strong for the least common denominator of fandom. But for those who can appreciate it... this is a real gem."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is a fun, different, sensual historical fantasy/romance. I didn't find it really &quot;big&quot;, though, not epic or mythic the way George RR Martin's or Frank Herbert's books are. It's really a personal adventure, the story of a woman with extraordinary gifts and problems who manages to find a place in her world and save her country as well as herself along the way.This book reminded me at times of Guy Gavriel Kay's A SONG FOR ARBONNE -- but with a lot more sex and S&amp;M, and with a heroine who is definitely one of a kind. Fantasy/romance readers who don't mind explicit sexuality, say fans of Storm Constantine or Laurell K. Hamilton, should love it.Phedre, our heroine, is born an &quot;unwanted whore's get&quot; in a nation sort of like medieval France, and raised in a society of courtesans. She has the curse (gift?) that she enjoys being made to suffer, and enjoys pain. Naturally, she's trained to serve as a prostitute for men and women with sadistic tastes. But she soon becomes more than that. From prostitute she becomes a court intriguer, from court intriguer she becomes captive and spy in barbarian lands, from captive and spy she becomes a wartime ambassador, and by the end she's become a noblewoman in her own right, come to terms with her taste for suffering, and found True Love. Oh, and she saves the kingdom from treachery and invasion, too.Phedre is what makes the book worthwhile -- watching her grow into herself, celebrating her victories, rooting for her when she's in evil hands (which is often). Phedre is almost never safe, but she's always growing, so to speak, always becoming stronger, and the challenges she faces keep changing. She certainly earns her victories. She's both the most distinctive and the most real fantasy heroine I've read in a long time. Other fantasy heroines are too often generic &quot;compassionate women&quot; or &quot;warrior women&quot; or (still worse) &quot;universally perfect women&quot;, but Phedre is both unique and completely believable.The writing in the book is very good. The setting and the other characters are fine, they seem quite real, but the interest of the story is always Phedre. That's my one complaint. Unlike Zelazny's Amber books or Herbert's Dune, I can't say the _world_ of this book fascinated me. I don't find myself yearning to know more about most of the places the author describes. I can't say I cared too much about what happened to the people who weren't in Phedre's personal struggle. For me this book was all about the heroine, and the world and the plot were just stages (if well-written stages) through which she moved. So whether you love or like or hate this book probably depends on what you read fantasy for: the world and the story, or the hero(ine) who leads you through it? I fell in between on this one.If you're a &quot;world&quot; person or a &quot;plot&quot; person, you might be happier elsewhere. But if you read for the sake of a main character you hope to fall in love with and suffer and triumph with, and if you don't mind a book with a lot of sexual content, Kushiel's Dart should delight you."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey has written a beautiful novel that is hollow at the center. The main flaw is her central character, Phedre, who spends most of her time reacting (submitting?) to events as they happen, rather than risking more to overcome increasingly negative events. In summary, a typical scene is as follows: Phedre goes to a patron, gets tied up and flagellated, has rough sex, then collects information which is used to further the plot (such as it is). Now as this is a fairly quiet novel and primarily a character study, we need to see inner conflict, hopefully manifested as outward events that are directly influenced by the character. Other than acknowledging Phedre's inherent conflict between pleasure and pain, and realizing that both drive her, we don't really learn much else about her, nor do we care.For some readers, the BDSM angle will seem \\"new, daring, pushing the boundaries,\\" etc. and that's great -- if you're looking for literature that echoes your own inner thoughts or fantasies. It's just not enough to drive a character, though, and while I give Carey plus points for using beautiful language to describe what some readers might find disturbing, it's not enough to sustain a novel-length work.On the plus side, the pseudo-Europe is well-researched, crafted, and described in beautiful detail; for me it's one of the more memorable fantasy worlds to come into print recently. But a travelogue can hold attention for only so long, then readers need to see something more.For those of you on the bubble as to buying this book, I'd suggest borrowing it from your local library or waiting for the paperback, then deciding whether to spring for the hardcover. Interestingly, there seems to be a cadre of seven or eight Carey fans who downgrade any review of less than four stars, and uptick only the five-star ones. If nothing else, this should be a caution sign that you should consider carefully the bad reviews along with the good before you make your buying and reading decision."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Rather a good find, especially for a first novel...I picked up this novel on a sort of whim, it looked detailed and filled with shallow intrigues, the kind of thing I like for light reading. Carey takes her time in establishing the setting, and at first I wondered if I had picked up a piece of erotica masquerading as fantasy. I read with trepidation through the first 200 pages or so, noting how the author was taking her time and setting up what seemed like several plot strands, prepared to groan when she did not develop them completely. But, much to my pleasant surprise, I was disappointed in that expectation.The plot follows Phedre, an indentured slave and courtesan, through her training and into the polite society of the D'Angeline court (which claims its bloodlines from the descent of angels), where she becomes embroiled in intrigues while following her own path, that of an anguissette-- one born to the spiritual line of Kushiel, her patron god, and one destined to find pleasure in pain. This is the first part of the novel, and I would definitely point out that a large portion of it is set in a boudoir, or &quot;pleasure chamber&quot;-- not to the point of being tasteless, but I was at times speculative as to whether or not there was some larger plot at work at all.But then, somewhat abruptly, there was, and that is where the novel proved interesting, when those intrigues Phedre had been somewhat unwittingly involved in become larger concerns and she is forced to survive and engage herself in a much larger game.Though the novel is engaging and I recommend it, I will note that one of the most annoying aspects of it is that it is told by Phedre herself, from the vantage point of a later date. Her commentary as a narrator tends to the dramatic and highly romantic-- which can be annoying, but as the reader comes to know Phedre through the story, it actually becomes rather endearing. From the comments of other characters we come to realize we are perhaps not the only ones annoyed and amused by her dramatics.Don't go into this book expecting anything radically different in terms of plot. Yes, there are interesting and unique elements here, particularly the acclaimed celestial heritage of the book's people, and interesting depictions of religion and culture.I recommend it highly to those who enjoy high fantasy, meaning fantasy including the likes of princes, priests, and courtesans. There is little overt magic in these books, which I missed, but there is ample mythology and intrigue. The structure of the book is solid, and once you get past the first 200 pages or so, it's nearly impossible to put down-- each time I got even slightly bored or thought of stopping, something dramatic or particularly twisted would happen and I would be forced to keep on reading-- forcing a couple of very late nights, which is always a good sign of a book's enjoyability.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Many reviews here present what is good about this book. And, I did like it. However, I found that there were some flaws in it that were so jarring that I haven't yet decided if I want to continue the saga. The three that prompted me to write this review are these:1) In the first third of the book, Carey overuses the technique of \\"foreshadowing\\"..... The structure of this section of the book is Phedre recounting her youth and she often says things along the lines of \\"....if I had only known that going to the Valerian House would have had such an important consequence.... \\" Use this technique once. Maybe twice.... Or even better --- not at all! But to use it over seven times in the first third of the book. I found that very amaturish and it so jarred me out of the storyline, that I started counting how many times it happened. I don't think the author needs to point and go: \\"LOOK LOOK! Look how important this is going to be!\\" Or, at least, not in such a contrived way.2) The eroticism in the book was such an interesting part of it --- again, in the first third of the book. You were right there with Phedre and her patrons, and the writing was very evocative and I liked it a lot. However, after the first third, Carey suddenly changes her technique and the sexual interludes are handled by Phedre saying something like: \\"And I am not going to go into the details of that night.\\" WHAT??? Why not? The details were cool and interesting and erotic and evocative. Granted, this is not a book of erotic literature -- but why write it one way for the first 100 pages and then change afterwards? Again, I felt this was amaturish and I felt a little manipulated....3) I, personally, didn't like the use of slightly-bastardized medieval history and places and people and things. The Picts and the Vikings and ancient Europe and Jesus and the Magdalene. The Irish mythology of Cuchulian and the Black Boar. Again, I thought it amaturish. Maybe even a bit like stealing or \\"sampling\\". The idea of the Night Court was so interesting and unique and unlike anything that I had ever read before. And, then, to plop it down into Bizarro-History-Land? Other authors have created worlds from whole cloth. Carey would have been better served to do that, in my opinion.All of these points, to me, detract from what would have been a top-notch, A-one fantasy saga. The characters in the story are interesting, and they grow and develop and change. And you understand their motivations. Argh! This could have been great! Up there with George R.R. Martin's Songs of Ice and Fire, or Rosemary Kirstein's Steerswoman Saga --- if only it had been handled with a bit more maturity.After writing this review, I am almost convinced that I won't be reading the second book of the saga. However, maybe that book has the maturity I am looking for.... because authors *do* grow and change......Hmmmmm..."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Two days ago I walked into my favorite bookstore and was greeted with shouts and a rather heavy book tossed into my hands. The owner told me that this book \\"had my name written all over it\\". So I shelled out my money and took it home.Wow! I cannot say that I ever imagined such a book as this existing. With today's society being as obsessed and disgusted with taboos as it is, the fact that a book that combines S/M, fantasy, erotica, slave literature, political intrigue, and incredible battle scenes is out there, it's just too lovely.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has a penchant for the interesting, but not for those who are light of heart. Phedre's scenes with her patrons are often more in depth than the average \\"spanking scene\\" that books incorporating S/M contain. Kushiel's Dart also maintains an impressive ability to be pansexual. No matter what sexual orientation or proclivities it's readers have, they will find something to interest them.The best part of this book, as far as I see it, is the fact that the villainess is not 100% loathsome to the protaganist. In fact, it is the love/hate/fear relationship that really sends the plot running.This is a great book, and I'm still trying to figure out how this is a first novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the story of Phedre, marked as a masochist by the angel of pain and punishment, and trained from youth as a courtesan and spy. The book follows her through her childhood and then the vicissitudes of one fateful year, in which Phedre learns more about pain and love than she had ever dreamed possible. Tragedy strikes her comfortable life, and she is sold into slavery among the Skaldi (Vikings), and must use her talents and her wits to survive. The Skaldi plot to take over Phedre's home country of Terre d'Ange, and Phedre is stunned by the fact that several nobles she knows are complicit in the plot. She escapes to warn her Queen, but finds herself assigned to a dangerous mission in Alba (Britain), which will further test her skills and her emotional strength. The climax comes with a battle scene almost as adrenaline-laced as the siege of Minas Tirith, and _Kushiel's Dart_ ends with the aftermath.I don't think I understood the depth of Carey's novel until I finished it. Pleasure and pain are forever mingled in Phedre's life, but it goes far beyond the bedroom. Terre d'Ange may have won a great victory, but we are never allowed to forget those who died to make it possible. Many fantasy novels focus on the triumph of the nobility while seeming to forget the commoner blood spilled to achieve the nobles' goals. This is not one of them. War in Carey's world is always a tragedy, no matter who wins, because there are good and bad people on all sides, and because the dead are made real to us instead of just pawns on the chessboard. Love, too, is a double-edged sword. What if you found the bravest, kindest, most loyal man you could possibly desire, but could never be satisfied with him because he could not satisfy your darkest proclivities? And what if you knew you would forever long for a cruel traitor who had the blood of your family on her hands, but who was the only one who truly understood your cravings? Love and pain are never far apart. By the end of the book, we've all been pricked by Kushiel's dart.One caveat: Before you read this book, make sure to check out the number of pages! _Kushiel's Dart_ is forbiddingly long and relentlessly serious; I could only read a few chapters at a time before becoming overwhelmed and setting it aside for lighter reading. However, Carey's plot was interesting enough that I never left the book sitting idle for more than a day or so. Very good, though long."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Overall this was a good and entertaining book. It has lots of political intrigue, so if you enjoy that, you will probably enjoy this story. I felt that at the beginning it was quite cumbersome to learn and remember all the different characters. I kept forgetting who was who, and who was related to who. Carey drops little hints through the observations of her main character, but most of the time I was unable to pick up on them simply because I couldn't remember who everyone was or where they were from. Towards the end of the book this obviously got easier as she narrowed down her character cast, and also made them a direct part of the story, rather than having passing comments about them.My favorite character in this book was Joscelin. The main character, Phedre, is interesting, but I felt I enjoyed the characters that were around her more than I enjoyed her.There is some strong sexual content in this book, though I think it is more prevalent and in more detail at the beginning of the book then the end. It might be offensive to some people, but check out some of these other reviews to see if this book is for you.For the most part the writing style is good and keeps you hooked. The only thing that bothered me were the constant one liners for dramatic effect. For example:\\"...We raced desperatly across the ruined earth, my lungs burning for air, each step an agony of blossoming pain.That's when the skies lit on fire.From atop the battlements...\\"This seems to be a favorite literary device of hers, and for me it got old by the end. Thankfully it didn't ruin the story. I did enjoy this book and plan to continue on in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was interesting and very well written. I enjoyed reading it and I can not wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Was referred to Kushiel's Dart by a friend who referred me to Fifty Shades of Grey - was intrigued, and so dived into Kushiel's Dart after finishing Fifty Shades Trilogy - I must first say that the books are nothing alike except in the fact that they both contain the theme of darker side of sexual appetites-however I LOVED Kushiel's Dart even more than Fifty Shades-thank goodness there are sequels to Kushiel's Dart! If you love reading and loved Fifty Shades then try Kushiel's Dart on for size - i'll bet you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is the debut novel of Jacqueline Carey, and the first book of the Kushiel's Legacy series.Ph&egrave;dre has been raised in the Night Court since being sold to them as a small child. She is marked with a small red mote in her eye - an imperfection that seems to render her too imperfect to be a Servant of Naamah until the wily noble Anafiel Delauney adopts her because he has recognised her for what she is - a god-touched anguisette, destined to take true pleasure in pain. Under his tutelage, she learns the art of spying and political intrigue as well as the arts of the bedchamber, and realises too late what a deadly game she's playing. I won't go into much more detail for fear of spoilers, but schemes and plots abound, and Ph&egrave;dre gets to see a lot of the world.Most fantasy books are set in imaginary worlds, but Kushiel's Dart is set in an alternative history Europe what seems to be the Renaissance era. Elua, the son of Jesus's blood and Mary Magdalene's tears, settled in Terre D'Ange (present-day France) with his angel Companions. This changed the course of history in Europe, and although we see some familiarity in the naming of countries, most of it is pretty unfamiliar. The world of Kushiel's Dart is touched by gods and angels, and there is subtle magic related to their gods in every culture.This book is not for the prudish - the country of Terre D'Ange has only one religious commandment: Love as thou wilt. All forms of loving are sacred, and the Night Court is the most honoured of all. Marriage happens, but people are expected to follow their own desires, regardless of gender, number or manner. Our protagonist Ph&egrave;dre is a courtesan that specialises in receiving pain, and Carey explores every facet of this in full detail. Ordinarily, I don't really care for sex in books, but it is so unabashed and straightforward and well-written that I actually enjoyed it.Overall, I really enjoyed this book - the plot, the characters and the world. Every character was complex, every relationship layered, every motivation deeper than suspected. Ph&egrave;dre was the tinest bit annoying towards the end, but the ending was pretty terrific, and I couldn't wait to read Kushiel's Chosen."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I went in expecting a bondage romance novel, I ended up with a highly addictive plot. If court intrigue is your thing don't hesitate to pick up this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An excellent read, be prepared for all 9 books in this series though once you start you wont stop! Kindle version does have some *typos* but nothing to bad."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting when I started reading Kushiel's Dart. I definitely wasn't prepared for the intensity or the burning desire to keep reading.Let me start by saying I read this on the kindle and so had no real idea of how long it was. But the book just kept on going and going, and I never wanted to put it down. The characters draw you in, flaws and all, whether you like them or not. The machinations of the characters are only surpassed by those of the author, who dots the beginning with gems of information which come relevant at the end, just like the glittering world of the characters who gather scraps of information for a web of politics and intrigue which only at the end seem to straighten themselves out. And of course I didn't realize it was a series until the very end where I was left with another breathtaking cliff-hanger.The plot goes a little like this: Abandoned child raised to be a courtesan is taken into the household of a kind and Machiavellian poet-scholar and trained to be a tool in his political arsenal. And she's a masochist. The tale starts in a city and spreads to encompass foreign lands and a little bit of strange magic. It's not always a comfortable story, but it's one of those epic tales which spans genres and reader bases.The only thing I didn't like was how self-referential the narrator is about her own story. \\"If I had known then what I know now,\\" \\"I had no idea how important this piece of information would later be,\\" \\"I ignored this other thing with the naivet&eacute; of a child\\" and similar phrases litter the first half of a book like road bumps in a residential area. The author might have been trying to direct the reader to pay attention to side plot so it would not have to be regurgitated at a later time, but I found it clunky.Some novels are like cinnamon rolls, fluffy tarts, or little bon bons of brief enjoyment and entertainment. This story is a rich stew which will sit in your stomach and stay with you for a while after you put it down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I rarely give up on books. I made it through 652 pages before I finally called it quits. Something about the universe just didn't gel with me, I just couldn't care about the intrigue between houses or any of the characters who were still alive at that point. Maybe I shouldn't have read it so soon after Game of Thrones, who knows? But it's not for me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"From the very first pages I was completely drawn into the world that Ms. Carey creates in Kushiel's Dart. Yes, some might say it gets off to a slow start, but the writing is so beautiful and the mythology and sense of place she creates are so wonderful that I barely noticed. This book was a real page-turner for me -- I just had to know what happens next! I could see why some people might be a little turned off by the BDSM elements in this book, but they weren't there for titillation but as an integral part of the lead character's personality. I'd give it six stars if I could."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A little too long generally, the beginning is too dense especially with regard to the world building in the beginning. But after the beginning and aside from the length, I loved this book. It is beautifully written, the main character is inspiring, the side characters are fun to read about, the romance is very sweet, the world created is enormous and creative. I love how the author pushes beyond what is comfortable for many people in terms of relationships and sexuality. Unlike other reviews I have read, I disagree that this involves children employed in sex labor or child abuse. I understand where their percetpion comes from and respect it, I just disagree."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"At first, I thought I'd never be able to get into Kushiel's Dart. There were far too many characters, strange geographical names and areas, and exotic social castes to follow. But I immediately fell in love with the heroine, Phedre, and eventually was grateful I stuck with this book.Once I started to become familiar with the intriguing new world Carey had created, I was consumed by it. Phedre, along with the massive cast of secondary characters, is vividly portrayed, pouring from the intoxicating words like a real-life person. I laughed, cried and suffered with her through all the events in her life, whether they were great or small.The plot is full of political intrigue, at once both intimate and grand, sweeping across countries and seas and leading to a deadly war in which Phedre finds herself caught in the thick of it. Carey portrays it all with a lyrical, mesmerizing voice. Even violent, savage acts are written with beautiful luxuriance, making the heart ache fiercely.Throughout this sweeping saga, Phedre deals with many hardships, dedicating and sacrificing herself all in the name of her love for her Gods and her country. And this, I think, is the greatest part of the book. Phedre is a strong, brave heroine whose tenacity astounds me at its greatest heights. I can't wait to read the rest of the series and see what adventures Phedre will encounter next."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am seldom moved to write a review, even for books that I love. I've discovered some fine authors recently in the sci-fi/fantasy genre--particularly in the contemporary vampire fiction sub-genre--including Laurell K. Hamilton, Charlaine Harris, and MaryJanice Davidson. Each of these has her charms as a writer, and brings a distinct voice and style to the table.Amazon recommended this book for me, and I almost didn't buy it, based on the blurb. If I hadn't gone on and read the reviews, I would have passed it up. I don't always agree with the common wisdom of Amazon's fan reviews; I quite liked Hamilton's \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" which it seems most of her hardcore Anita Blake fans loathed, but then, I think I'm giving her credit for a complexity that others don't. The reviews for \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" were conflicted, with some loving it and some hating it, so I decided to take the risk and decide for myself.I was flabbergasted by this book. Carey writes with a confidence and clarity scarcely credible in a debut novel. It took me a while to make the connection, but it finally dawned on me that Phedre's voice harks back to Pip, the narrator of Dickens' \\"Great Expectations.\\" Her tale is at turns epic, pathetic, heroic, erotic, but always narrated with sadness, frankness, and detachment, as if over a great span of years. The detail of the narration is consistent with the character; she was trained in the art of observation and information-gathering, in the making of connections and the discernment of patterns in political intrigue, and the clarity with which she recalls the events in her life inevitably manifests itself in the rich descriptions some critical reviewers have labeled verbose. Far from it, in my opinion. Rather, the descriptions are vivid and evocative, the characters limned with subtle judgment and the events often with heartbreaking honesty.Phedre is one of those protagonists one might dismiss or disrespect out of real world distaste. After all, most of us are not comfortable with the kinkier aspects of human sexuality, particularly with the taboo of true masochism. Phedre's world, however, not only condones her proclivities, but elevates them as noble and exalts them as divine. \\"Not all that yields is weak,\\" she reminds us. Phedre plays a complex game of political and sexual intrigue, at first as a pupil of her string-pulling master Delaunay, and then as a master herself. The sexual encounters are pervasive, but not overbearing. Although capable of more \\"vanilla\\" affection and pleasure, Phedre must also satisfy her god-driven need to be dominated and abused, during which her release is far more intense and profound as compared to more mundane couplings.One of the earlier reviews complained that there wasn't enough sex, and that the torture scenes were not explicit enough. Other reviewers claim that the subject matter is merely tawdry. I believe both sides are rather missing the point. More explicit tales of sexual sadism and masochism are readily available for download on the internet, without the burden of a masterfully told story. There are other well-crafted romantic fantasy epics out there that don't ask us to reserve judgment based on personal choices of sexual morality and taste. The sex scenes here are quite specific enough to show us the depth of Phedre's need to be hurt, the extent of the physical damage to which she is driven to subject herself, and the sincerity with which she believes that her pursuits not only fulfill her personal sexuality, but also glorify her patron dieties. One other criticism I've seen is that the sex scenes are merely a device Carey uses to add information to the plot. This I find to be a nonsensical criticism. As a courtesan, sexual assignations are by definition one way in which Phedre collects information, and if Carey did not use them as a means to advance the plot, they would be merely licentious. As it is, each scene reveals something about Phedre and her patron, as well as advancing the plot by revealing some new strand of the political web.In addition to a remarkable heroine in Phedre, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" gives us one of the most intriguing villains I've run across in a lifetime of reading sci-fi and fantasy. Melisande Shahrizai is the treacherous, traitorous noble whom Phedre loves, hates, fears, and desires, all at once. The first half of the book builds a steady anticipation of their inevitable sexual encounter, and the rest of the story is driven by the fallout from it. Though Phedre hates her, Melisande is the only person ever to take her to her limits physically. Though they are fated to be deadly opponents in the politics of nations, Phedre knows that Melisande's death would result in the loss of her truest soulmate and deepest sexual fulfillment.This is strong praise from one not generally inclined to give it. I recommend this book to all who are not offended by the sexuality of its main character."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"As many reviewers have remarked, the last three hundred pages are so painful to get through. Absolutely painful,mind numbing rubbish. Watch as our perfect heroine saves the world and displays an array of talents and skills a super hero in a comic book universe wouldn't even have ! This is too bad because for the first part of the book we see Phedre develop in her training, master some of her demons, and show just how fallible she is as a human. Her interaction with Joscelin I really enjoyed. Out of all the characters I enjoyed Joscelin the most actually. The sexual content of this book is mentioned by many who have read the book. It's there in varying degrees, especially in the first part of the book. The author did a good job of making such scenes interesting, though erotic is not the word I would use to describe them. Apparently many people would. I finished this book out of determination and not much else, and I have no intention of reading the rest of the series. Where the sterling reviews come from I can't say. Though Phedre starts off as a unique and interesting character, by the end of the book she is similar to so many others: perfect, beautiful and destined for both glory and self sacrifice."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of the more difficult reviews I've ever tried to write. Reading Kushiel's Dart I found myself torn over how I felt about the book. The reviews here are mostly highly complementary and praised Jacqueline Carey for the artistry of her writing. And yet, I feel obligated to rate this story at 2 stars.To be honest, if the claims of the positive reviews had been a little less overblown I might be inclined to have pushed this up to 3 stars. The story is not horrible, and I was more disappointed than upset, but the flaws are obvious and definitely impacted my enjoyment.The book does have good points. While I disagree with the \\"intricately plotted\\" claim, it does have a solid plot thread carried through the entire story and the story is coherent around the single plot thread. The character development Is limited, but solid and as many positive reviewers point out Jacqueline Carey is very skilled at painting with words. Her descriptions of a fanciful land of beautiful people who are commanded to \\"Love as you will\\" are stirring.Unfortunately, many of the virtues became vices when taken too far, and that happened here.Intricately plotted is one of the common comments, but the basic plot is not very intricate. The story plays out as a tale of national politics and the succession to the throne of a country. I found the rest of the plot neither intricate, nor unusual. I've read many mysteries that were far more confusing and clouded. Here everyone's motives are rather transparent, even the one villainess that Jacqueline Carey clearly sees as the Moriarty of the tale. And while there are a number of factions, none plays a true doublecross. Each moment of the plot occurs in sequence with almost no simultaneous actions. After reading stories like George R.R Martin's epic, the plotting here is actually rather pedestrian.The character development is one of the largest drawbacks. Each character is lovingly described by Jacqueline and I'm sure that many readers will say that they \\"loved\\" one or more characters. The problem is that after one clear description almost none of the characters change. Even Phedre remains much the same at the end of the book as she was in the beginning, and she grows the most. Many of the other characters are introduced once and then barely seen again.My biggest complaint has to be the same flowery and vivid descriptions that many reviewers loved. They did help bring parts of the story to life, but they also slowed the story down. The whole first third of the story is backstory. When the first major plot twist finally occurs it not only isn't a surprise, but its almost a welcome relief from the chapters of descriptions of Phedre's service to her master. Not that the later chapters necessarily change much. I could use a simpler description of how Phedre solves many of her problems, but it would be perhaps a bit unfair to future readers. It was less imaginative than I would have expected and after a while definitely more than a bit repetitive.In the end I did not dislike the book, but after having my expectations raised so high by other reviewers I was extremely disappointed. The feeling I got was that this book receives its reviews partly because it was rather unique. Before this book was written, few authors tried to write a romantic tale of political intrigue in a world where prostitution is a religious event and have the heroine be not only a pseudo-priestess, but the chosen of the demigod of masochists. Its definitely a titillating idea and had to influence many of the reviewers.I will not tell anyone not to read this book. In fact, if you took the time to read to the end of this review, I'd say that you probably will enjoy reading the book. It's not a bad book, just a bit overhyped. The flaws are there, but so are the virtues that brought many to give the story five stars. I just will not add this book to my collection, nor do I expect to go out of my way to read it again. It is what it is, a decently written first novel that managed to find a spot in literature that was rarely used, and it struck a chord with the reading audience.I do suggest that people checking this review note that over time Jacqueline Carey's stories have been seeing their ratings slide. Her third trilogy in this universe has more than a few fans saying that they are dropping her as a favorite author. I actually came to start reading her work her through her third tiloguy and the overall quality of the writing is higher in those later books. However, by that time many reviewers are complaining about the same issues I see in Kushiel's Dart. The scanty plots and overwritten descriptions were always there, but many reviewers did not notice until they started the third trilogy. Sad, because Jacqueline is a very talented writer, she just needs to put a bit more time into building the plot before publishing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book on a whim. I have seen it for years at the library, and finally bought it when I was in need for some summer entertainment. I was excited to find the first installment in a series that spent time on developing complex story lines, deep characters, awesome sex scenes and heart pounding adventure.A few words of warning:1. Complex story line: It is a bit difficult to get pass the first 50 or 100 pages, as the fantasy world is so complex. Carey weaves this story to contain political and religious intrigue in a fantasy world where is can be a bit confusing at first. If you are not an avid fantasy reader, and thus are not used to being thrust into a completely different world, this book might be a bit difficult2. Sex: The sex is great! However, Phadre is a courtesan, so don't be shocked by all the people she sleeps with. Also, the whole concept is she feels pleasure and pain simultaneously. Therefore, there is some hard core S and M stuff. The important thing to remember is that SHE LIKES IT. Some reviewers were disgusted with this concept, but it is further developed in later books in the series to show that there is a deeper meaning to this.3. Adventure: A lot happens, and rather quickly. For the first 250 to 300 pages, the scene is set up. We learn about the world Phadre lives in, her courtesan work, and her learning to be a spy. Then suddenly, she is thrust into a twisting and turning adventure. This is a book for readers who are in for a long, but worth while book.Yet with all this, I LOVED IT! I highly recommend it to any fantasy reader, romance reader or all around hard core reader (who is excited by 1000 page books)."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Beware readers the plot in this one is quite complicated and because of this there is a large cast of characters whom we are required to get to know. Some will be quite overwhelmed in the first few hundred pages, I nearly packed it in frustratedly near to 100 pages after being introduced to seemingly endless names of the lords, ducs, kings, queens and massive families of the books world. You will probably need to glance over the extensive character listing at the start of the book several dozen times. Thankfully by the end you will find you can recite the character listing by heart and you can read through without interruption.So do not under any circumstances stop in the first quarter of the book and make sure you are well rested cause the book doesnt just slide into the story once the vast character list is introduced it will explode. Its fast paced till the end, no time is ever wasted on the unnesesary, if Phedre needs to move through a country it is done in a page or two, no frivilaties on what she wore each day or how many rabbits she saw.Phedre is a prostitute (glorified in this world thanks to there religion) and an anguissette, someone who gets pleasure from pain, Phedre is the only one there is so its very rare. She is taken in and is trained to be a spy, shes given knowlegde aplenty and taught how to use it to listen, learn, think and manipulate. With her formidable array of talents she plays a large part when her country reaches the brink of war and its leaders are to busy stabbing each others backs to stop it.The sex is mostly of the violent persuasion but it very tastefully done and not once was it without reason. It tapers off greatly in the second half when the action picks up so even if you find it offensive not much detail is given after the first few scenes so be strong and endure.Also I woudnt say this was the first part of a trilogy cause the story does end the next book would be more like a sequel, though it doesnt really matter if you finish this book you will read the next most happily.4 stars for the first half, 100 stars for the rest so an easy 5 stars for a brilliant read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It is difficult to classify this book. It borrows tools from many genres (Romance, Mystery, Historical Fiction, to name a few) while being true to them all. The main character is a \\"legal courtesan.\\" I agree with the previous reviewer that I thought this would be an endless tale of sexcapades. There was great sex, but also a rich tale of mystery and tragedy. Characters were fleshed out, even secondary characters. This entire trilogy was deeply satisfying, and I am delighted there will be a second trilogy about Phedre's \\"son.\\""},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is not my first book by Carey. I read Banewreaker and Godslayer first and I must admit that I liked those better. They are, however, very different so there's no point in trying to compare them.For one thing, it is really beautifully written. I can easily say that Carey can create believable characters and at least she offers some surprises so we don't find ourselves in the midst of a cliche. The setting is remarkably well painted - though I must say that the dozens of names and characters flying towards the reader is more than a little confusing. I understand that she meant to write intrigue, but one can write about deception and throne games without staging hundreds of actors - see George Martin's Fire and Ice series, for instance.Now to the part I didn't like - I agree with those who said that Phedre was too 'perfect' and that she solves almost every problem she comes across by sleeping with someone and endowing her 'gift'. Sure, she has a few flaws, but even those are easily forgiveable and more cute than despising. She comes across so self-sacrificing and incapable of jealousy or greed that it's hard to feel symphathy for her suffering. Not to mention that there isn't much of that, anyway. Undergoing torture and hardship is not much suffering, in my book. Going through some personal dilemna would be far more convincing, I think.I have to admit that I could not understand why she was throwing herself into bed with almost every male -and quite many female- characters she comes across in the story. Sure, Carey strives to make it look like its for the best and a good reason and all that, but I think she fails badly in that. Especially once Phedre begins to have some emotions for another, I think it's rather unbecoming that she can still go around giving herself so freely and not feeling at least a little bit abashed at the whole act. As far as she is concerned, she is doing some service to the world. If that is service, all whores are semi-goddesses. I understand that Phedre's culture encourages this and that she is brought up to do it. But as I have said, this action is plausible before she loses her heart. After that it seems like a far less graceful act to me. She may be enjoying pain with pleasure but human beings still have the ability to show some pride, too, and reject some of the offers thrown their way. Apparently Carey wants us to believe that the sexual pull and need is so strong that it is excusable to make yourself a public toy.In short, although the whole story is based on revering the act of casual sex, I still found Carey's excuses simply that - excuses to introduce eroticism into a book. If Phedre had been more selective and if she had undergone some mental or spiritual change in the course of the book due to her actions, I would have thought different. But a woman who solves problems in this way and this way alone is not much interesting to me. That might symbolize a sort of strength to some people, but I like women who deal with matters outside the bedchamber. That is not to say that she doesn't show wit and courage - she does. But those acts hardly lead to anything unless they are sealed with an arduous endeavour.It is not a bad read at all. I think one could enjoy it if one can cast aside some female pride and the belief that there is more to the world than just sex. If you can't -and Carey couldn't persuade me to- than you're looking at an impressive novel with a weak base."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There are few things in the world better than a book with teeth. I read it first with Anne Bishop and her Black Jewels trilogy, which can't even compare with this. Kushiel's Dart is a reading pleasure that is most aptly described as decadent, alluring, and intriguing. It's like that chocolate mousse cake that gives you shivers just thinking about it.Carey holds nothing back in this, a tale about a courtesan whose greatest pleasure is pain. But Phedre is more than a courtesan; she's a spy, a tool, and a weapon of a god.The author does an amazing job of presenting the character. Phedre's life, from a very young age, is generally centered around specific things, like servitude, her education, or her assignations. For a character who is tightly controlled by those around her and given little space to develop as a person, she has a lot of depth. Aside from being at constant odds with her own masochistic nature, Phedre also struggles daily, in very human ways, with her various relationships. Through her eyes you see just how thin the lines between love and hate, and friend and lover, really are.And you DO see the story through Phedre's eyes. Very few authors write in first person--mainly because most can't. It's often difficult to keep your character from meandering aimlessly in their own head, when you write in first person. Phedre does a little of this, but Carey keeps it mostly in hand. The world narrows down to Phedre's point of view, so we see only what she sees, and we learn of the things happening elsewhere in the world only if she does. This narrowing of vision may cause some to feel like conflicts are resolved too easily, but generally it is simply that our heroine is not the driving force behind all resolutions.Aside from writing well in first person, Carey pulls off another writing style that, quite frankly, is impressive. It's what I like to call PWS (Pretty Word Syndrome). It's amazing the amount of books that are considered wonderful simply because the author writes like an overly flowery thesaurus. Pretty words do NOT a good book make. More often than not, I find such flowery language annoying to the point of potential book throwing.Carey pulls it off with astounding finesse. Somehow she manages to be consistent with her language and yet not overbearing. I can't put my finger on what, percisely, makes it work--perhaps the D'Angeline society itself--but it does work.The world is fascinating, too. It's a sort of mythological alternate history in some ways. The mythology itself feels sort of Greek, such as the story of the creation of Elua, patron god of Phedre's home country. But it is different enough from the mythology we know to keep the world from feeling like a simple slightly altered copy. Plus, since it unravels outward from Phedre's vision, you see it as she sees it.One thing I must say, though, and this is no reflection on Ms. Carey: TOR needs to stop being such cheap b-----ds. They need to stop using cheap ink that comes off all over my fingers. They need to construct their books better so the things don't practically come apart in my hands. And they HAVE to be more considerate of their authors and start getting them REAL editors. Carey holds her own very well, proving that she has great talent. But did an editor go through this book? I have my doubts. Never mind other examples of atrocious editing jobs I've seen out of TOR books...there were simply some mistakes in this book that NEVER should have been. Things a three-year-old wouldn't miss. TOR, just because you have a monopoly on bestselling fantasy authors doesn't give you the right to be lazy and cheap!Even if the masochistic angle appeals to you not at all, you might want to give this a shot. It's an oasis in the middle of the desert, compared to the many, many books about stupid farm boys, magic swords, and wise old wizards. Three cheers for books that bite!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The lead character in this epic novel uses the above line to describe her own lot in life. Phedre is an apparently cursed orphan who is adopted by a mysterious nobleman and trained to be an erotic spy, gleaning empire-shaking intelligence as she services the wealthy and powerful of a renaissance kingdom. Jacqueline Carey has created a rather imaginative setting for this epic - a medieval Europe enveloped in an alternate history in which the far-flung cultural influence is Celtic and Gothic rather than Roman, while Christianity has followed a different course and developed into a set of sensual and erotic oath-making. Phedre is a very impressively well-drawn heroine, and Carey obviously put a lot of work into the creation of this deep and complex character. Phedre's two closest companions are equally interesting - the valiant but confused bodyguard Joscelin, and the mischievous but perceptive gypsy traveler Hyacinthe.Sadly, the fascinating backdrop and intriguing lead characters are often lost under wave upon wave of unnecessarily complex writing. The story is centered in a France-like kingdom full of unbelievably beautiful noblemen and duchesses, surrounded by realms of crude barbarians, all of which are predictable fantasy stereotypes. Political shenanigans are enacted by far too many minor characters who blend together into sameness. As the story (very) slowly unfolds, Phedre works her way through repetitive palace intrigues and political treachery, while later she embarks on an adventure through a never-ending succession of exotic locations and strange foreign peoples. This is all mostly much ado about nothing, and only illustrates an author's exercises in impressively intricate writing, but without much reward to the reader as the plotline is stretched out to interminable lengths. The valiant war of freedom at the height of the novel offers much page-turning action, only to devolve into even more unnecessary palace intrigue at the close.This is a highly intriguing novel that is fascinating at the surface, though with far too much detail that adds little to the overall plot and theme. Also watch out for the graphic descriptions of Phedre's assignations on the job, if you don't happen to be turned on by large amounts of masochism and bondage. But this epic is still recommended because of the great lead character of Phedre, who is surely a heroine complex enough to inspire many large literary epics."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I realize that I just finished a review for this book, but after reading some other reviews, I wanted to add another thought.Jacquline Carey is a new writer on the level of Guy Gavriel Kay. I am highly surprised that anyone would compare her to Martin or Jordan--neither of them could approach the quality and complexity that infused Kushiels Dart. I have read widely in both the science fiction and fantasy genres, and only Tolkien and Kay have displayed the talent and lushness of description possessed by Carey.While Martin certainly has talent, don't try to compare him with Carey--there is no comparison. Don't get me started on Jordan. Besides, a real Jordan fan probably wouldn't like this book anyway."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first half of this book is dry, lots of mapping out the geography, family lines, who's who, history, and introductions. It gets textbooky at times, but if you can stick with it, you find yourself definitely immersed and knowledgeable of the setting. Which makes the story all the richer when real plot twisting events start taking place.There is some serious storytelling going on here, and I found that once I got past the first 200 or so pages, I couldn't put it down. The next two books manage to get even better. The characters are very well fleshed out, and I found myself loving Phadr&eacute;, her experiences, antics, highs lows, and everything in between.I'm not a real fan of the fantasy genre, but this does not dissapoint. Multilayered, complex fantasy for adults."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Confession time: I am leery of fantasy that deals with the erotic, mostly because I got burned to a crisp by Laurell K. Hamillton's badly pornographic dreck. Thus, I've been skirting around this one for a long time, but finally took a bold step and read it...I was not pleased with what I read: No, I am blown away by it! The writing is lush and evocative, reminiscent of Tanith Lee but less meandering, the characters well-drawn and very human. In the hands of a less capable writer, they could easily collapse into cliches -- I shudder at the things the under-aged and less-creative fankiddy fanfiction writers could twist Phedre no Delaunay and her companions into (perhaps Ms. Carey's ban on fanfiction based on her work is for our protection as much as the protection of her intellectual property), bur Jacqueline Carey masterfully keeps their personalities and voices consistent. The sexual content is always handled delicately and deftly, even in the more cringe-inducing moments, never devolving into cheap pornography, but always remaining elegant and erotic.I'll admit that, aside from Tolkien, I'm not a big fan of epic fantasy, but Ms. Carey manages to break out of the too-often copied Tolkien tropes and breathe new life into a genre in need of it. Her world-building is excellent and makes you wish you could live in a place like Terre D'Ange, that our world really had a parellell twin just like it. The mythos of Elua, the angelic offspring of Yeshua and Mary Magdelen, at first glance might seem yet another spin on the already beat-to-death Dan Brown cliches, but she manages to make something lovely and breath-taking from it. This book is a joy and a delight, and for all its length, you catch yourself wishing it wouldn't end -- which leads you to reach for the follow-up volumes."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"this book about about a girl who was born with the mark of a god on her and the story basically follows her life and the trouble she faces because of this mark.the girl is intelligent and she uses her intellect as her weapon. i'd classify this series as an adventure, but phedre doesn't 'fight'. in fact when she's in physical trouble someone has to go save her and she can't really help herself, but that's not to say that she's a wilting heroine. she earns her own respect by acting on her own and overcomes situations by using her brain. quite the odd heroine by the norm's standards.the author's pretty good with words and has done a bit of research (winning combination). many things in the novel have a real world reference.it's adventurous, erotic and suspenseful, and i'd say one of those stories you'd call epic. it's around 900 pages, but you'll get through it and be grateful you went through the trek. when i first bought this book i delayed reading it. i didn't think it'd be that good and it was close to 900 pages, but i finally bit the bullet and got into it, and i don't regret readng a single page! this is a book that should be experienced!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I hated this book. I wanted to forget I ever read it as soon as it was over, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. (Though probably not as bad as some of the tastes Phedre's had in hers.)This book was recommended to me from several sources and I finally gave in and bought it. My mistake. The characters are flat and mostly uninteresting. No one in this book has any flaws, not even the villains. Drustan was the only character with any kind of physical imperfection, but guess what? Having a club foot no way impeded his ability to walk, run, ride, fight, or even dance. He seemed like a desperate attempt by the author to show some kind of range and she failed miserably.Everyone is beautiful, because \\"they're descended from angels\\" and while that is an interesting plot point in theory, it was executed terribly. The author's writing style is overly flowery and pretentious. It seemed at times as though she was just grinding the readers nose into her book going \\"look at all the big words I know!\\" The beginning of the book was the most annoying for me, because she was constantly alluding to things that would happen... eventually. I don't need to hear about things that may happen some point in the future, that's why I'm reading the book. To find out what happens next.Her fascination with Melisande seemed contrived and didn't fit with the setting. If everyone around Phedre is beautiful, including herself, then why did she swoon every time this one woman walked in the room? It seems to me like a gaping plothole that the author covered with the same curtain Sirius Black fell through.What I found funny is that towards the end I got the feeling that even the author was bored with her book. The book is about a courtesan, and yet she didn't bother with the effort of describing any of her liasons after the first two or three. The people that aren't interested in the erotic part of the book have already been scared away and the people that are will be disappointed by the second half. If you're going to write an erotic dark fantasy novel, at least commit to it. Don't cop out halfway through.In the end, my biggest problem was Phedre herself. I didn't get any sense that she evolved throughout the book. She was the same obnoxious, shallow whore that she was in the beginning of the book. Her only character flaw is that she likes sex too much? That's her character flaw? That's what is supposed to make me care about what happens to her, the thing that makes her human? Sorry, not buying it. Also, that whole episode on the Master of the Straits' island? Where she felt the need to rub in how terribly beautiful she was, when compared to those poor plain peasant girls?Nice that you're so pretty. Too bad you are also shallow and useless. Like this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is probably nothing like what you expect. Certainly, I avoided it for years because I didn't want to read some bad BDSM fantasy romance novel tripe. The thing is, that's not, despite any plot summary anyone could possible give you, what this book is -- at all. It's about spies and elitism and a really fascinating spiritual mythology. Sure the main character can be a bit of a Mary Sue since she's the best at everything ever and even has weird eyes, but at the end of the day the main character here works because she has a sense of humor about herself and the book manages to work because it takes its narrative entirely seriously. Weird thing. Often surprisingly moving. Not as smutty or as silly as you think."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It took a while for me to be able to keep all of the characters straight, but around 1/2-3/4 of the way through the book, everyone was FINALLY becoming familar enough to me that I could really get into it. Maybe I found it so hard b/c of the derivations of the names, but overall, I loved this book and can't wait until I read the next one!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There are many sci-fi/fantasy books out there that are compared, in the review blurbs on the covers, to Frank Herbert's DUNE. DUNE is my favorite book, and so naturally I sigh whenever I see the comparison. But this book is the first I've read that deserves it. No, it isn't as good. But the world it creates is convincing, and it does tangled politics almost as well as DUNE does, though the human element is lacking somewhat, because there are too many characters.Many things are striking about this first novel by Jacqueline Carey. The first is the sex, which is everywhere and explicit. I didn't find it offensive, but some might. It's certainly different than any other fantasy novel I've read.The world the author created is my favorite part. This is an alternate-history Europe, but much of what we recognise as our world can be found. My favorite creation are the Yeshuites, who resemble the Jews of our world, with the obvious difference that they follow Yeshu ben Yosef. The authors use of languages is excellent, and I like that she invents words. She does this rarely. More often, she just uses words that not everyone knows.My only complaint is with some of the writing. This is a first novel, and for all its intricate, well-laid plotting, there are some gaps in the style, where the book is too wordy, and the love story at the end does seem to come out of nowhere. Two people end up together because, I guess, they're what's left.But this book is good despite these quibbles, and I look forward to reading the sequel. Check it out at your local library if you're a fan of fantasy, adventure, or alternate-history."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" details court politics and barbarian customs before rambling through an unrealistic conclusion.The orphaned heroine Phedre is raised as an indentured courtesan. Carey's social structure for this organized prostitution feels completely natural. Early chapters drag with exposition, but they reveal the depth in Terre D'Ange, Carey's alternate-history Renaissance France. The backstory also establishes Angeline theology, a strong element throughout the novel.Phedre glides through the opulent society as a courtesan and spy. This section of the novel flourishes in Phedre's relationships. She learns from Delaunay and Cecile, she shares with Alcuin, and her service begins. Carey shows high society clothing and behavior in vivid detail. A jarring shift yanks Phedre into the second section, an exile among barbarian tribes. She uses her courtesan skills to survive and to uncover a scheme for the throne.The third section of the novel turns Phedre into a royal agent. Here, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" stumbles. Phedre seducing barbarian chieftains and a provincial lord feels completely appropriate. Phedre convincing two foreign monarchs to launch an invasion, devising the plan that stops a rebel army, and infiltrating siege lines feels ridiculous. Carey's realism and detail also falter. The sea god feels inconsistent in such a realistic fantasy novel. Sailors fight land combat for no apparent reason other than to name a military unit \\"Phedre's Boys.\\" The Angeline name for Greek fire is just translated French.Carey's narrative is dense. Antiquated words and verbose phrasing set the Renaissance mood, but they also impede the flow. Some paragraphs contain only one huge sentence of independent clauses linked by semicolons. At approximately 300,000 words, the novel runs extremely long.Despite these flaws, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is the most rich and original fantasy since George R. R. Martin. Carey's alternate-history Renaissance France and her realistic characters are a welcome departure from stock medieval settings and epic quests."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I finally read this book when a friend recommended it to me, and I was amazed. For a first novel, Kushiel's Dart is epic, thrilling and cunningly plotted, not to mention well-crafted. Some of the scenes were agonizing in their intensity, and it was great fun following along to see who was plotting with who to do what. Although the book does have some shortcomings, they are eclipsed by a magnificent overall story by a gifted storyteller. I will wait, though, to read the next installment, as I am so used to living in this fantasy world I need some time to get used to living in the real one for awhile."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Just finished this book and though it's been a while since I've read fantasy, (though this is borderline fantasy), it reminded me how much fun this genre can be.I must admit that when I started it, I felt a little intimidated when I discovered the pages and pages of character profiles. LOTS of characters. But, you end up grateful for all those profiles and really get to care about most of them.The plot is very intricate and unpredictable.

Oh yeah...and the S&amp;M element is interesting, too!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have read hundreds of fantasy novels...Kushiels Dart springs to the top. Elegant, finely crafted, unique and beautifully written. Rarely is the fantasy genre presented with such a gift. And it's a first book. I am blown away and very eager for her sophomore debut."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; has some intriguing ideas, but unfortunately, most of these are contained in the first three chapters. What follows is a tired rehash of Harlequin Romance plot conventions with the occasional fantasy twist.As far as Romance heroines go, Phaedre no Delaunay isn't a bad one. She's smart, strong-willed, stunningly beautiful (of course), nauseatingly talented, and apparently dynamite in bed.This comes in handy, given the amount of political crises threatening her country. In the world of &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; there isn't a crisis too big that can't be solved by Phaedre hopping into bed with someone. And if simple sex doesn't suffice, well, she sings. Phaedre, you see, has a very impressive set of vocal cords. With sex and song, she accomplishes what highly trained diplomats cannot. Dump her in Afghanistan and she'd soon sort those pesky Taliban out.The plot of &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; not only strains credulity, it takes it out into the street and shoots it. Don't get me wrong. The characters, while stereotyped, are likable enough, and the plot moves fairly quickly. The sex, while kinky by your average Harlequin Romance standards, is well-written and fairly soft-core. If you're looking for a nice, predictable romance with fantasy trappings, this is the book for you. If, on the other hand, you're looking for genuine political intrigue in an original fantasy setting, I suggest you check out Guy Gavriel Kay's &quot;Sailing to Sarantium.&quot;Carey writes well, and her work contains flashes of brilliance. The author herself seems to be having fun when she's being original (the Kushiel's Boy's rhyme comes to mind) which gives me hope that in her next book she'll dump the cliched plotlines in favor of a more original story. In the meantime, if you're looking for a rainy day Romance read, you won't go wrong with &quot;Kushiel's Dart.&quot;"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading all the great reviews, I paid for the hardcover expecting a great fantasy read. However, I was disappointed overall. While I admire many of the descriptives - the author has crafted some beautiful passages, I think this book is very similar to Richard Adams' Maia. It is difficult to read Kushel's Dart and not compare it to Maia. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to Maia in the comparison. What I look for in a good fantasy read is a believable fantasy world. I don't think the fantasy holds up."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Very disappointed...got it from the book bin at the local thrift store. I thought to myself, why would anyone give away such a seemingly good book. But I now see why.......very wordy. Author obviously was never taught that less is often more. Though the story had lots of potential, I couldn't force myself past chapter 6. I kept hoping it would get better and it didn't."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have heard of this series of books for years and never read it until I went into a book store to pre order a book and never one to walk out of a book store empty handed came out with this book, figuring it was time to give it a try. I wish I hadn't waited so long, there are few books that I absolutely love this one joins that short list. I could not put this book down and for those like me who held off because of the fact Phedre enjoys being bound and tortured during sex a genre of books I don't enjoy reading. Well skim them if you must its easy enough because thankfully they are not so bad the detail isn't there she fades in and out on the sex scenes so they have no meat to them this is not an erotica book. So trust me don't skim them because in doing so you lose out on an important part of Phedre personality and the strength of her character. But if you must you must, I understand this kind of stuff isn't for everyone, me included but you'll love this book trust me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I don't give out five stars lightly, but I really enjoyed this book and I'm glad I have two sequels to read. This way I won't miss Phedre. I'll see her in the next book.One thing I liked almost immediately is that some of the main characters die. It seems odd to say, but think about it. Who dies in Lord of the Rings? Against all odds, nearly every major character survives. You have no guarantees here. Your favorite character may be killed. So you have an appropriate sense of danger and uncertainty.It reminds me of the game Dungeons and Dragons, in which your personal character could well be killed, and if he or she is ... then sayonara, make another one, that one is kaput, and it gives more meaning to the game.The book's hero is the most unlikely one I've ever come across. It's rare enough that the hero is a woman, but this one is a prostitute, and if that isn't enough of a surprise for you, she is an intensely masochistic one.Your first reaction may be similar to mine. Madonna performed a song about spankings and had a major hit with it, so a little masochism is mainstream, and what is so special about Phedre's masochism? It's an accepted form of foreplay these days.But in Phedre's case, the intensity of pain that pleases her is far beyond Madonna. No, you probably have never met an \\"anguisette\\" like Phedre.Now that we are given an extremely erotic leading character, a second surprise is that the story is not porn. It is about war and politics, about love and loyalty, with just a bit of sex thrown in. It's not a sex book masquerading as sci fi fantasy.I think my biggest complaint with the writing is that some of the characters don't stand out for me. There are a lot of somewhat royal characters, or \\"peers\\", and I sometimes have trouble attaching an individual character to them. Who was Barquiel again? What did he do?There is a pretty picture of our darling and heroic Phedre on the paperback cover, and there is a list of the main characters in the front, as Tolstoy includes in War and Peace. What I really would have appreciated is a drawing of many of the main characters, so I could attach a face, a uniform, something, to each of these people, instead of just a name, because there are really a lot of names to keep track of.In this Republican era of ours, nobody is going to turn this into a movie, or a trilogy of movies. That's our loss. I'd love to see the movie.One of the things I like best about this book is its free attitude towards sexuality. Bisexuality is the norm, and isn't even frowned upon. Good. Although I'm not gay, some of my friends are, and they are as good as anyone else. I like the respect that their lifestyle is given in this book. Nothing to be ashamed of. If you disagree, you are an ignorant bigot, and that's that. It's not an issue to debate. It's a right vs. wrong issue, as direct as two plus two.The Nazis would have a hard time with this book, because their favorite victims, Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals, are all treated with kindness by the author. But this book is much too Francophile. The French, here called D'Angelines, are really just too smug about their good looks. They are so superior. Come to think of it, that's a weakness of the book.We even have a French version of a Shaolin monk as one of the stars of the story. In the Shaolin tradition of the fighting monk, we have Joscelin, the samurai superstar with swordplay, the Musashi of France, practicing his katas every morning and nearly unbeatable against multiple opponents.The author had to wrestle with the problem of what a \\"happy ending\\" would be for our darling Phedre. Should she get married to her true love? But she is so promiscuous, so masochistic, and her true love is not the Marquis de Sade. She'd be bored and frustrated with him, no?Well, I'll start on the next book and see what happens to my Phedre. See you soon, honey."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I cannot remember the last time a book grabbed me so hard and so fast I read the entire 600+ pages in two days. I then read the next two books over the course of the rest of the week. What a treat! The writing is more than capable, the premise well set, the plot well thought out and not contrived at all, and the characters developed so well you feel you know them personally. This may well be the best first book I've ever read. As such, it's so much better than most author's any number book, you should read this just for the sheer pleasure. Do yourself a favor, though, and don't read the jacket. It does not do the book justice and will only mislead you into thinking the book is as tawdry as the jacket. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"To be brief, if you want fantasy without the fluff, Martin and Carey are where it's at. \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is rife with intrigue, sexuality, battles that have a point(not just filler), and characters you come to care about.It is pleasantly long, with the only slow period in the beginning.Fill the long wait until \\"Feast of Crows\\" with Carey and her marvelous heroine, Phedre."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading the summary of this book I thought I was really in for a treat, but I think the author made the mistake of taking her story a bit too seriously. I got so tired of stumbling upon more and more bits of history with names that didn't matter and events that played no part in the story. With such potential for action and danger she treated it like a history lesson with characters who fit into stock molds rather than having distinct personalities. I think the editor is at fault mainly-- he or she should have realized the potential the actual plot had and told the author to rewrite it in a different style, because it might have turned out something really great. At it is now, though, it's far too wordy and serious. Even the darkest and most dangerous stories need a hint of humor. Get rid of all the flowery descriptions, the boring history lessons, and add a little dirt into the mix. Everything and everyone was too perfect to make me think that this world could be real. I couldn't even finish it, even after getting to what is supposed to be the \\"exciting\\" part. I just didn't care to know what came next."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have been looking for quite a while to find another series to keep me going while waiting for the next work by George RR Martin. Even Martin's 4th Book, didn't live up to expectation and I am still waiting. I tried Weeks, Ruckley, Williams, Marco and nothing has lived up to Martin, again not even Martin. Weeks almost pulled it off.I really enjoyed the first 600 pages of Kushiel's Dart, unfortunately it really lost my interest in the remaining 300 pages. Some people have been critical of the books beginning saying it took too long to get started. I liked the slow beginning and enjoyed the back stories...infact to me the best stuff in Martin's works are the back stories.There has been a lot of attention drawn to the sex in the book. I found it tastefully written and not nearly as graphic as in some other books. Even Martin's sex scenes I felt were more rauchy than this book, the sex in this book was not over the top or shocking and handled quite nicely.The author can write and the world she created is interesting, but for whatever reason, it lost me around page 300.I will wait a while before I try some of the sequals, I hear they are good, but I am a bit Kushieled out."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In Terre d'Ange, physical perfection means freedom and anything less denotes some form of bondage. Phedre no Delaunay is born with a red speck on her left eye, which means a life of slavery. Because of he &quot;scarlet letter&quot; on her eye, as a child, she is sold to eventually work as a servant of Naamah, providing pleasures to the free people of Terre d'Ange.However, unlike the rest of the free masses, noble freethinker Anafiel Delaunay, upon seeing the red spot, feels Phedre's mar is not a flaw. He believes it represents a greater perfection. He buys Phedre's marque and begins to educate her for more than the art of pleasure. She begins to spy for him, but soon becomes embroiled in a dastardly plot to dethrone the King, in which she struggles to warn His Highness before doomsday arrives.KUSHIEL'S DART is a powerful, extraordinary exotic political fantasy that never slows down yet fully develops the key cast and the culture. The epic fantasy story line is loaded with action that flows due to the characters seeming genuine while providing a deep look into a different culture and way of life. No one will believe that this is Jacqueline Carey's debut because her first published novel has to have come from someone with at least a five-book resume.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I found this book incredibly annoying. It was recommended to me by several friends and I ploughed through it in hope the story would improve. It never did.First, the author's style is excessively verbose. Throughout the book, you'll find phrases like \\"I measured my length upon the ground.\\" What is wrong with saying, \\"I fell\\"? Another aspect of the author's style is to overly-beautify *everything*. Nothing is *ever* dirty, or ugly, or rotten, or bad.Second, the only character with some depth, personality, and motive to him died less than a third of the way into the book. I almost gave up on the book there. I should have; it would have been a better ending.Third, as if the main character was not enough of a perfect doll-puppet, the author chose to pair her up with a perfectly devoted ideal and idealistic warrior-paladin.For me, this book offered disappointments at every turn."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is a book that exists primarily for the kinky sex scenes. To their credit, the folks at Tor never tried to pretend otherwise; more than can be said for certain other alleged fantasy novels I can name. Phedre is chosen by the God Kushiel to \\"experience pain and pleasure as one\\", the back cover tells us, and indeed the first four-hundred pages is a profusion of beating, cutting, bondage, and humiliation. Your appreciation of those scenes will depend on whether such kinkiness does it for you. For me the answer is mostly no.On the plus side, Carey puts the greatest amount of effort into that part of the book. The writing is indeed lavish, descriptions are thorough and extravagant. For those who like an intense and very detailed picture of clothing, locations, and personal appearance, this book is tough to beat. The careful attention to details succeeds most noticably in the large number of minor characters: poets, fortune-tellers, guards, and others all stand out from the crowd.The books starts to go off the rails shortway before the halfway point, and just keeps getting worse until the end. The story diverges to the wilds northern Europe, where the barbaric Skaldi are plotting an invasion of Terre d'Agne, Phedre's homeland. The plot becomes a mess of narrow escapes, last-minute rescues, idiotic blunders by the bad guys, and repetitive emotional blather from the good guys. It's bad enough rehashing the idea that one man can single-handedly wipe out whole platoons of well-trained bad guys while barely suffering a scratch. It's worse when Phedre has to spend several pages cowering in fear and anticipating her own doom and then bowing in awe at Joscelin's skills every time it happens. Wrose still are the parting scenes. Whenever characters separate, they first spend half a chapter weeping on each other's shoulders and trying to avoid the inevitable. This book is sprawling enough that it probably contains twenty parting scenes."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Having purchased this book on the basis of the reviews I read ,I'm sorry to say I just could not stay with it , I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of buying this to read a few sample pages before purchase , the names given to the kingdoms,the countries , and the characters made it impossible for me to follow , I can only presume its a slow burner , I could find no empathy with any of the characters , no sense of a plot developing , and by the time I had read about 30% no interest in turning the next page ."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This story, a dark beautiful tale about a girl.

Awesome series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you with the feeling that it had to be written, that all the characters really exist \\"somewhere\\", and that the countries are places you could really go. This can only be a little bit because they are based on real countries - this scenery and those cultures begin where our myths and histories leave off, and owe more to imagination than reality. It is the author who is to be thanked for her magnificent contribution to speculative literature. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The ingenuity and imagination of Jacqueline Carey has raised the bar for quality in fantasy fiction for generations to come!After the mediocrity of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind I was beginning to think that this is the fantasy fiction I had to look foward to: endless series of unlikeable, unrealistic, and unentertaining characters and stories that will NEVER END!!The world of Terre D'Ange and the teleogical magnificence of Naamah and Blessed Elua are a triumph. Fantasy and alternative history perfectly blended to produce a series which I hope does go on forever. It will be a pleasure I look forward to eagerly."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Although the main character and the overall plot are pleasing and well developed, the main storyline is too crowded by pointless details. Carey adds too many political people with complicated histories and backgrounds for one to even follow it. I found myself constantly forgetting who was who and what they did 5oo years ago with this person who was the son of this person who did whatever. On top of that the main character, however likable, is a prostitute that does some pretty graphic things just to please her patrons, all in the service of her \\"godess\\". In the end she sells herself for for money towards her freedom. It doesn't exactly send the best message out to young women. After the first book I was so overwhelmed with the amount of rather pointless information that I couldn't bring myself to finsish the series. However, for people who have the patience to remember overwhelming detail and believe prostitution in the name of an idol is fine, this book is great."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"**I intend to warn readers that if you find sexual abuse disturbing, there are several scenes described in this book that will be very off-putting.**Since the book was presented as the tale of someone who actually finds pain pleasurable, I began reading it tentatively at the bequest of a good friend of mine who really enjoyed the story, and gave me her copy to peruse. Halfway through, I seriously regretted ever opening this book. I finished it anyway, not sure if I will read any more of them. I enjoy the eloquent writing style, but find it hard to reconcile with the macabre nature of the story itself.That aside, the one and only issue I find with this book, is that Carey is inconsistent with the psychological profile and development of her main character, who supposedly loves feeling pain(--only not really).Now, keep in mind that although very, very rare, there is actual recognized medical condition(s) that cause people to either feel no pain, or to associate pain with pleasure... But from a psychological point (as in, NOT having a medically-defined origination in an abnormal nervous system, but instead a purely mental reaction), there are only unhealthy methods of associating pain with pleasure, not the least of which is the direct result of prolonged neglect and abuse.Carey at first seems to be presenting her \\"anguissette\\" as the former, a rare person who has NOT been conditioned to associate pain with pleasure, but who does so naturally, automatically. This would have been truly interesting.However. As her character shows more and more of her inner thoughts and reactions to the sadistic sex she is subjected to in the book, it becomes blatantly obvious that it is the latter, and isn't a genuine anguissette at all, but a victim of unfortunate chance and circumstance, who is trying to cope the only way she knows how.Carey's heroine has masochistic tendencies which are the direct result of a childhood of emotional traumas: Abandonment; being sold into slavery at the age of six; the consequent sexual conditioning of being raised by others who are indentured consorts; combined with a deep inner sense of inadequacy. Her low self-esteem is directly due to her one physical flaw: A red splotch in her left eye, marking her as less beautiful than all of her physically flawless peers, and which she is told as a child is the mark of the God Kushiel, who has chosen to doom her to a life of pain and suffering.It reads like a classic case study of a self-destructive, objectified, abused adolescent in foster care. Add in the fact that she is being trained as a spy, so that she will allow herself to be abused and debased in order to gather information for her \\"owner\\" and... its just so icky.Since her only alternative is being kicked out and living on the streets, or worse, it seems to be a situation of obvious coercion, which would be considered criminal by today's standards.Frankly, I love erotica, but I have no desire to read about the sexual exploitation and abuse of anyone, least of all a young girl who has been sold into sexual slavery long before she would have had the psychological maturity to decide if this was the life she actually wanted for herself. (As if \\"slaves\\" have any choice? Seriously.)This is no elegant portrayal of Courtesans or self-possessed Companions, but rather a tale of a young girl being pimped out to a rival gang of politicians, along with her foster-brother, by their \\"protective\\" foster-father. She supposedly can choose to decline any of the \\"patrons\\" her master chooses for her, but is NOT allowed to choose any sexual partners for herself. Yes, Freud would have a field day.Given Carey's actual degree in psychology, it is hard to determine if she is trying to make a convoluted, cynical point regarding the hidden dangers in these practices, or if she is actually exploring her own dark fantasies, or something else entirely. Either way, to anyone with any degree of empathy, it is a very disturbing situation being described, sometimes in great detail.Additionally, Carey mentions the children being raised/fostered in the Mandrake and Valerian pleasure houses--dedicated to Sadism and Masochism respectively--they are catatonic, fear-ridden, and broken. These are young children, we're talking preschool & kindergarten aged. Carey is careful to say that the pleasure houses don't actually use them, since they do not start sex-training until the ripe old age of 10, and each house wants to secure a high Virgin Price at the age of 16, but whatever these young children are witnessing, Carey is clever enough to suggest.Again, very disturbing.There is something quite unenlightened in this Utopian fantasy world.\\"Love As Thou Wilt\\" would be fine and perfect, if it were mutual, and if that was really what was taking place, but it isn't. Raising and training someone from childhood to be a sexual plaything, to \\"Be Used As They Wilt\\" is VERY different than embracing sexuality from a healthy, albeit adventurous, place. Pointedly, rape by its very definition is NOT mutual. And a child is incapable of making that kind of choice, without being manipulated and exploited, which is exactly what happens in this story, again and again.If the main character was truly an anguissette, she would enjoy every minute of what is done to her, including being sold into slavery a second time and raped by her new owner--instead of the shame, humiliation, guilt, and hatred which she experiences in these situations. These are normal feelings under such circumstances; there is nothing unusual, nothing defining of an anguissette herein. A healthy masochist is pretty hard to find, but they do exist. I would presume that is what Carey was \\"trying\\" to portray... It really seems to me that Carey just doesn't quite understand this type of person--and projects these negative emotions into a character she has no idea how to authentically express on paper. So instead of depicting someone who enjoys rough sex, she is only describing a young girl who is forcing herself to deal with circumstances beyond her own control, and resenting it.I am no prude, and would have found it interesting to explore this sexually open society right alongside Carey, if she had managed to actually present such a thing.But this book was ridiculously inept at portraying healthy sexual proclivity, no matter how \\"alternative\\" its style. Instead, it presents a cornucopia of human sexual failings, combined with yet another system of dogma excusing them and trying to justify them, without actually doing them any justice.Utterly disappointing, and left me feeling like I had just witnessed crimes, not mutual acts of sexual fulfillment."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Someone wrote:\\"I have to admit that I could not understand why she was throwing herself into bed with almost every male -and quite many female- characters she comes across in the story... as far as she is concerned, she is doing some service to the world. If that is service, all [hookers] are semi-goddesses... She may be enjoying pain with pleasure but human beings still have the ability to show some pride, too, and reject some of the offers thrown their way. Apparently Carey wants us to believe that the sexual pull and need is so strong that it is excusable to make yourself a public toy.\\"This is completely untrue. First of all, Phedre is extremely selective about who she is with. This is emphasized over and over in the book, and I don't understand how you could have read it and missed that. I also find it ironic that you say that if her acts are truely good in this world, then \\"all [hookers] are semi-godesses.\\" In the world of Terre D'Ange, they ARE. This is not historically unprecedented either. In many cultures, women have prostituted themselves as an act of holiness. In some temples of the goddess Aphrodite in ancient Greece, pristesses of them temples were indeed [hookers]. Your critism of the book is simple not factual."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love to re-read these books because there's always a new understanding to be found in them. Her plot is gripping, her characters are memorable, and the places the main character goes! The rest of the series is amazing and the transition in writing from Phedre's point of view to Imriel's is nearly flawless (and not as verbose).Very much looking forward towards more from this author. She is one of my favorites. I love these books."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I write this review after having read both Kushiel trilogies and I will agree with some other negative reviewers that the beginning of the book was hard to get through, it took me some time to get used to the flowery writing, large cast and the teen-angst of young Phedre. But then there's a pivotal moment that turns Phedre's life around very severely and the epic adventure starts...and never stops. This wasn't my favorite but it's still wonderful and necessary to learn about the world they live in."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read this book almost two years ago and boy was I in awe of the storyline, characters and world that Carey created! I can't get it out of my mind! I really liked the Skaldi! A jovial, but hard people-modeled after the gallant Vikings of the past-that were an honorable and ruthless band of warriors.My only criticism of the book was that it took all too long for the action to come together. The book should have been edited down by some 100-150 pages. Despite this, the action came together and culminated in an exciting battle! Boy was I enthralled! I can't wait to read more of Jacqueline Carey's series!A.

If you're a commuter, try it in audio book format - my one-hour, one-way drive has been enhanced tremendously!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Overall, the book is really good, except for the main romances of Phedre: Jocelin, Melisande, and Hyacinthe. I think that the Hyacinthe love affair really took away from the building romances of Jocelin and Melisande. It makes love all about sex, which can be part of it, but it doesn't always have to be that way. Overall the world building is great, but the fact that Phedre is in love with everyone that she sleeps with is really annoying."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An interesting book and one I wasn't sure, half way through, if I was going to finish it. It has a few themes I wasn't sure how they would play out and if I would like them, but I am glad i stuck with it as the themes ended up working with the story line instead of being for shock value only. This book ended up being a real joy to read and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is an introduction to a parallel world in which things accepted and tolerated include prostitution. The author does a beautiful job of creating this world and through her main character explaining the beliefs of her people versus other cultures within this parallel universe. At times the author boarders on being cliche in describing the more erotic scenes, however how many different ways can you illustrate intimacy?Another key element to this book is the polytheistic approach to religion created by the author. I feel the main religion creates a different perspective on Christianity without being disrespectful. The author provides a balance in creating her deities by acknowledging both the feminine and the masculine.Overall, for the genre I think Kushiel's Dart is excellent in that it touches on so many themes without being chaotic and difficult to follow. If you enjoy reading about love, adventure and life I recommend this book make your must read list"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I Loved this book and the entire trilogy. Phedre has become my favorite heroine and I have read so many books I could possible make a list of it all.It is a spiritual, loving, passionate, creative, and very inspiring trilogy that brought me to tears and created a need for more that is hard to find another book to fill. I bought three different trilogies after I read that and honestly none did it for me and I am still hoping to find more.It is the story of a woman marked by a God that is a very hard one, Kushiel. Kushiel is a God that cleanse the soul with pain. He is the punisher of God. Therefore, she will find pleasure in pain and the book will have some s/m parts in it. But it is so beautifully weaved in the context, that it enlates you. Kushiel requires a lot of her, he sends her into many ordeals to protect those she love. She enters an spiritual journey, a love journey and a painful one. I couldnt stop reading. I was barely sleeping and I re-read it all again when it was done.What I love most? Love as thou wilt - The teaching that the most powerful thing in the world is love. Not romantic love, but love and there is no law for love, there is nothing that teaches you how to love, but if you give in to love something with all your heart, you will find grace in the end of a hard journey.Every knowledge is worthy having - You learn that if you pay attention in the life around you and learn, many of what you learned will be able to help you when you least think of it.Hyancinthe - I wish there was a note saying and she got his message sent by the winds and went for him every once in a while. That would make it all complete. He totally deserved it after what happened.It was the first time I wrote to an author congratulating her for her work. Honestly, it is worthy reading."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I had this book sitting on my shelf for a long while. I finally pulled it out, dusted it off and decided to read it. Within the first page I was wondering if this was a mistake. I felt the writing was kind of \\"flowery\\" and I wasn't used to that so I was a bit discouraged. I kept on with it though and decided if the first chapter didn't hold my attention I would just donate the book. Well by the first chapter I was hooked. I loved this book. I am now an overnight fan of Jacqueline Carey. This book blends in betrayal, battle, love, loss, sex and much more. The landscapes, costumes, people were so vividly captured in my mind. I would say that the only two downfalls to this book for me were that there were a whole lot of characters that I had a hard time keeping up with them and at the end Phedre just came off as too \\"perfect\\". Everything she did was without a flaw it seemed. But that's probably because she's Kushiel's Dart and meant to be that way. I highly recommend this book and will not hesitate to read her others."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is so good. A wonderfully inventive, enjoyable adventure. Endearing, unbelievable, and character-driven with a juicy plot. I can't add much to the reviews that have already been written. But Phedre was a surprising heroine indeed.My only con: the fabricated names for vikings (the skaldi), jews (yeshuites) and many other ethnic or racial groups was somewhat immature and annoying to me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An unusual and charming heroine, a complex, multi-faceted world, a byzantine, well-crafted plot and a writing style that combines touches of hard realism with an almost mystical sense of prose make this a most brilliant, engrossing book. No short review can do justice to the allure of Phedre, the heroine, and those who surround her; from her companion the warrior-priest Joscelyn to her nemesis the high-born Melisande, taking in a varied, fascinating melange of gypsies and courtiers, courtesans and queens, soldiers and sailors and diplomats and priests... The story manages to combine the best aspects of thrillers, fantasy, high adventure, suspense and wrap them in a most original blend of exotic sensations and smooth storytelling. I most highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a superb tale and writing so good as to be, in parts, almost glorious."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre was born with a scarlet speckle in her eye, known as Kushiel's Dart. Those marked by Kushiel's Dart are cursed to always feel pleasure and pain as one. Using her skills learned in traing with Anafiel Delaunay, Phedre uncovers a plot that will lead her homeland to war.Hate to say it but, I love this book like whoa! It's incredibly well written and draws you in from the first page. The world and the society is incredibly well built and seem to be very loosley based on several European countries.Phedre is a wonderful and believable heroine. Although she's intelligent, courageous and strong, occasionally she does something or says something that reminds you she is human after all. Being an anguissette (one who feels pleasure and pain as one) leads to some interesting points of the story as well as adding an interesting exploration on what being an anguisette means for Phedre. There's lots of BDSM and same sex pairings as well, if you like that kind of thing. ;)I found myself crushing on Joscelin. I love it when a book character comes alive so much you get a crush on them. And Joscelin certaihnly comes alive! Boy does he ever. :)The real triumph in terms of hot characters, though, is Melisande. She's a cold hearted vixen but so seductive that just reading about her I had the hots for her. If she were a real person, I'd fall to pieces if I were ever in the same room with her.I thought the story was well paced and thought it was good that the time was taken to build each character and allow you to get to know them. I also loved the developing relationships Phedre shared with Joscelin, Hyacinthe and Melisande. They alll had great chemistry and played off each other believeably, especially in terms of her relationship with Joscelin.Overall, just a simply fantastic book and I cannot wait to go out and get the next one!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I kept running across this book in bookstores but it just looked too weird for me, so I always passed it over. Finally, after reading the reviews it got here I decided to try it. I don't think anything could have prepared me for a book like this.This book made my heart ache, it made me laugh, and it brought tears to my eyes. Each character is a complex, multilayered creation, neither good nor evil, but driven by passions and ambitions to do the things they do. Phedre's development from rebellious, observant child into an accomplished adult is believable and incredible to watch. I was as in love with Delauney and Joscelyn as she was. All of Carey's characters demand respect, from Melisande all the way to the minor Tzingano characters and the Skaldi.In fantasy it is rare to find a world that is totally complete in every way. Often worlds lack complexity, peoples lack culture, and relgions are dubious. Carey's world, however, is so rich in detail one can almost picture oneself in Phedre's place as she describes places and people. And Carey's language is beautiful. Poetic and flowing, but never becoming to flowery of difficult to read. She has a knack for catching the mood of a moment while adding insight as Phedre looks back on the event.Often, it seems, political intrigue books lack action- and action books lack any sensible politics. Carey has blended the two seemslessly. There is mystery, betrayal, romance, slavery, sex...so much that one would think the book would be too much. But it's not. It's real. It's dramatic and emotional and so vivid I feel as if I'd experienced Phedre's adventures myself.I can't say how good this book is...I simply can't do it justice. All I can say is that I loved the characters, and hated them, and my heart caught in my throat for fear at their fate, and that of their land. It's a beautifuly written book, but more than that, it's a lovingly written book. I loved it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was quite prepared not to enjoy Kushiel's Dart once I realized where the author was heading on the S&M; theme -- I tend not to enjoy graphic descriptions of sexual-related violence. Yet somehow Ms. Carey pulled me in spite of my reservations. The parts that could have upset me were brief, and were required for the plot.The book is not perfect -- I got lost quite a few times with the intricate conspiracy because of so many names and titles. Sometimes you'd hear a first name, a family name, or a title. I am usually quite good at keeping up with complicated plots, but a few places I missed important things that I usually wouldn't miss.Yet in spite of these flaws, I still give this book 5 stars, which I rarely give out in my reviews ... -- the book was compelling, unique, and I in particular enjoyed the alternative history of the scion's of half-fallen Angels."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've read through the reviews here, and noticed one thing - either you LOVED or HATED this book. I loved it. It was, in fact, one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. I took a chance on it --- and was well rewarded. I won't get into details of the plot (there are already many in-depth reviews here..) But I will say - to those of you out there who enjoyed Kushiel's Dart - try author Tanith Lee. I am a huge fan of Lee's and her work has the same dark, sensual and engrossing quality as Carey's book. I can't wait for the next one! Bravo, Tor!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've been recommending KUSHIEL'S DART, a pseudo-historical fantasy, by Jacqueline Carey. It's over 700 pages and is the projected first book of a trilogy but the book is complete in itself. This book has really fascinating and detailed settings, intricate and complex plotting and an unusual and compelling heroine. It's dark and very intense, sensual and exotic, unpredictable and exciting and yet also romantic and totally involving. I'm thinking that readers of Anne Bishop may like this book. The heroine's homeland, Terre D'Ange, is being beseiged by a number of internal and external political threats. The heroine, both a court spy and a courtesan, is instrumental in courteracting the numerous threats to her homeland. She's tough and intelligent. She's also unapologetically sensual with a sadomasochistic streak, which may not appeal to all readers and although I had some initial misgivings, this didn't bother me in the end, because it's part and parcel of who the character is and where's she's coming from. None of the sex and violence of the book is gratuitous - it's just part and only part of the story. If you like adventure, love, political machinations, heroism and treachery, I think you'll find KUSHIEL'S DART highly compulsive and completely absorbing reading."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Unlike some, I wasn't put off by the flowery prose -- I thought it was beautiful -- and the slow beginning didn't bother me, either. I actually enjoy books that allow you to immerse yourself in them slowly instead of being hit in the face with action on the first page involving people I don't know or care about. The worldbuilding here is lovely, complex, and believable. You can see where the author got her inspiration, but she gives everything its own unique twist. My main reason for giving the book four stars instead of five is that, by the end of the novel, I had gotten frustrated with Phaedre for several reasons. For one thing, she became (to me, at least) more and more Mary Sue-like...she seems to be able to vanquish every situation she's put in, even it means using a talent or skill we haven't really even heard of before. Also, I got annoyed by her apparent weakness with regard to the main villain of the story. If Phaedre is so smart and talented, why can't she show a little more backbone in those situations?Even though I enjoyed many aspects of the book, my frustration with the main character meant that I knew I wouldn't go on to read any more of the books in this series. It's too bad, because I did think the writing was beautiful, but life is too short to read (very) long books that I know are just going to end up pushing the wrong buttons. I'm sure other people will have a very different response to this book, but that's how I felt about it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Nothing but praise for this masterpiece of psychological realism, with its dancing plot and convincing pantheon.The heroine grows from a child tossed around by fortune into an agent of fate, while saving a country from treason and invasion. Chance turns into destiny as the background of her tutor unfolds. When she applies her skills of stealth and seduction, she enters a court of intrigue and violence.We are stimulated by a constant supply of surprises and fresh characters.Jacquline Carey's fantasy world is rich and detailed. She never abuses the genre's license to break the laws of physics; the magic in this story never touches the decisive plot points. No convenient dues-ex-machina super-powers, but clairvoyance-type skills to enhance foreshadowing.The rest of the \`magic' is interwoven with the pantheon. The world in this story resembles our own in the time of Renaissance, with the best of paganism added. These people have no shame of love and pleasure, and their gods keep a close watch and light touch on their history.I'm guessing the fantasy ingredient is only used to free the characters from the boring bits of actual history. The stripping of puritan values enables characters to pursue high and low passion unhindered. The first half of the story is a chess-like game, played by courtiers who are of the Balthasar Castiglione type on the outside, and Machiavellian at heart.Just before the civilized big-city dynamic begins to wear out, the sophistication is balanced by icy peaks under a blue sky and barbarians with simpler drives.Whatever the drives of the characters, no one escapes the consequences of breaching humanist ethics. The heroine is an instrument of the angel that punishes the sinners, and they all get their due in this story, as a side-effect of destiny, with their honor and free will intact.The flavor of the story hints at modern science and philosophy. Carey sees how psychology is grounded in biology. The beauty of people is fostered by rearing pressures; she knows good breeding makes good character. The open elitism and aristocracy is grounded on materialism, and the semi-pagan gods are the biological ancestors of the main characters. Likely these hints are not accidental. Blessed Elua, the principal god in this story, was born out of Mother Earth, when the blood of \\"Yeshua\\" dripped from the cross and mixed with the tears of \\"Mary Magdelene\\"."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When my friend pushed me to read these books I thought to myself 'another porny book? Do I really need to?' I had picked up the books, or seen them around, but never purchased them. However once I got around to it, I was glad I had. This book is fabulous. Looking at the map it didn't take me long to realize Carey had based her fantasy world off of the real one, adding touches of realism to her story that are always enjoyable. Phedre is a believable and likable character, starting off stubborn and more than a little self centered and evolving from there. It's one of those stories where you hate the bad guy, and love the good guy, but you're not really sure who is on what side until the very end. (And even then, there is a twist.)At the end I found myself falling in love with all of these characters (and buying the next two books)."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have never read such a beautiful piece of work. I recommend it for anyone who loves beauty, intrigue, love of fantasy...I can't explain it...I am in love! I love the next book as well, but I am still waiting on the last book because I am poor! I need it in paperback!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It's a truly amazing novel. An adventure unlike any other. Jacqueline Carey invites us in a wonderful world of alternative religion, based on Christianism. Elua is the son of Christ, born from his blood upon the cross and from mother Earth.He founded a city, or is it a country? Regions depending on which of his disciples' views you follow.Phedre no Delaunay is an amazing person, with a will of iron, great determination, and a student of the arts of Naamah.The book is her life's adventure. How she was born and bred, where and how she was brought up, an adept of the Night Court in the city of Elua. A magical story!!Beware : you will not sleep to live through her eyes for an hour longer. Phedre is an obsession. I am in love... :)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When first recommended this book I was a bit questionable as I normally prefer more of the Sword and Sorcery type fantasy. Through about the first fifty pages or so I was still quite questionable. As I was reading it had my interest, though I had no idea what was really going on. Though after about the first fifty pages it stopped with a lot of the background info that was needed and started the proper story. Once things started to get into the masses of court intrigue I was hooked. The story moved along at a great pace making it hard to put the book down much of the time.Carey places you into a world of fantasy that is heavily based around ancient times of Europe. While it pulls from the fantasy some with placing it in the normal world it also added a great deal of interest in the book with figuring out the places and religions that were being described. This book takes you through mounds of royal court intrigue along with a nice blend of erotic fantasy.This book had my attention from the first page and the same day I finished it I went and bought the second book Kushiel's Chosen. I have highly recomended it to my friends and family."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book, the story of Phedre no Delauney from childhood until her early 20's, is a story of an amazing, capable woman, stung by the Dart of a fallen angel to forever feel pain as exquisite pleasure. Carey manages to write the scenes of Phedre's sexual torture in a surprisingly ungraphic way, and the twists and turns of her amazing life made me laugh, think, and even cry.One of the best points I can make about this novel is the depth of feeling that the characters both exude and evoke. The pain of the little girl who was sold into bondage by her mother for being imperfect, and thereafter never legally having a mother again, is a poignant scene. And when Phedre is forced to leave behind her best friend Hyacinthe, one of the men in her life who truly made her feel safe and she truly loved, I admit that I cried. Carey, even for a novelist who is just starting on her writing career, is an amazingly talented lady. If I were to have to guess, I'd have thought this was her 5th or 6th book, not her first. I'm amazed at the level of talent in such a new writer!I can hardly wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up this book simply because it was the first thing that came to hand while looking through the book shop in a train station. I read a little of the beginning and then had to buy it just to finish it.While I loved it and was happy to see that the sequel had been published, there are something that I wish had been done differently:The S&amp;M scenes are glossed over and yet the writer still constantly refers to them. I would have been interested in hearing more about Phedre's patrons and her private indulgences. I think it would havehelped flesh out the emotional life of the character more.The court and political intrigue were amazing, but I was left frustrated by the lack of a resolution to the tension between the main character and her nemesis. It did leave me with baited breath for the next book, which I guess was the point, but it was still a bit frustrating.All in all, a very good and worth while read! I like books that can take me out of my life and surroundings and place me in the shadow of its characters and this book filled that requirement nicely!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am not one for words....read this book...and let it speak for itself...You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book, but some people may be put off by the S&amp;M scenes. The heroine is an indentured prostitute who enjoys pain mixed with sex, but who is also trained as a spy.

This novel took me from the peaks to the shadows and back again. I found the vivid imagery exciting. I await with anticipation Jacqueline's next book. I purchased this book after a chance encounter with the author on a plane after I relenquished my seat to accomadate a childs wish to sit by her mother. I never dreamed I would be sitting next to a world class writer when I did so. Jacqueline, kudos to you for creating a book with so much depth, and passion.

I put off reading it for a month or so, while I read other novels, I can't even remember what they were about, I think Kushiel's Dart will stick with me for a while.

I bought this book on a off chance that it would be great, and IT was. I got all 3 at the same time and read them back to back. My husband asked me if I was married to him or my books...LOL (though he loved the results of me reading this...LOL), I told him hush and kept flipping the pages (Then used his body shamlessly..LOL). Make sure you have lots of time and read it all (And have a partner to work the steam off with..LOL). This is a great page turner and gripper. WOW at plot, sex, and climaxes, relationships scenes. I cried, laughed,panted, got hot and wet all at one time. (I wish I could become part of this book. I have read them over and over again). It is so great when the author pulls you in to their stories so that you lose track of time, feel the emotions of all the characters and forget all wifely duties until you need to release...LOL. I am waiting for the author to get another one out there. It is so sad when they do a big hit then stop, I am left drooling and waiting for more.

Thanks to all of you who take the time to caution us and warn us on buys.I GIVE THIS OVER 5 STARS but it only allows me to give 5."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This series got such great reviews, I decided to give it a try despite some misgivings from the cover - yes, I was judging the book by its cover. Sadly, I should have stuck to my first impression.The overall story is engaging and well written, with an interesting main character and fairly well-developed world. Descriptions are generally effective without being tedious, and the dialogue is handled smoothly. So technically speaking, Carey's writing was inoffensive. Sure, the love interest was blindingly obvious from the moment he appeared, the characters are two-dimensional, and the plot got hopelessly bogged down mid-book, but it could have still been an interesting read.What I found completely off-putting were the repeated graphic, violent sex scenes. As you learn very early, the main character has been blessed/cursed by the god of - evidently - sadism, and she craves pain. As a costly prostitute, this is what she receives from her clients. While that could have led to an inventive story by itself, Carey finds it necessary to describe in intimate detail virtually every sexual encounter. The plot effectively becomes a bland distraction between ridiculous soft porn episodes of cruelty and violence.If sadism is your schtick, or you're looking for porn-with-a-story, this series will probably be up your alley. If you're looking for a good fantasy read with robust characters, tight plot, and a great story - keep looking."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I haven't read anything like this since the Angilique novels of the early 70's. Our heroine is both slave and independent female. She likes both roles.This was not a fantasy, it was a cheap romance with a formulaic plot set in a quasi mideval world. I will pass on the sequel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I find first person writing hard to get into in the first place. Now I have to wonder what is up with Tor. Child prostitution, rape, and all other forma of perversion seem to gather great reviews but left me with my stomach turned.This is certainly a carefully written book, so I gave it an extra star, but the plot is dully buried under the titallation and I did not find the characters appealing. I guess sex sells."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"[Some spoilers below]I don't know how I got through this book. In paperback it's over 900 pages of torture that is meant to be pleasant. Which it would be, if I was an anguissette, like Phedre. Except I am not.First things first, my edition had a blurb on the cover, by the late R. Jordan. \\"Intricately plotted\\", the man says. The same man who wrote 11 books of the dreaded Wheel of Time cycle. I should have realized what I'm getting into right when I read the blurb. Alas.Kushiel's Dart is about as intricately plotted as the latter installments of Wheel of Time series. And that's no compliment. The entire plot dumbs down to the protagonist being thrown around various locations in order to save the kingdom. I say \\"being thrown\\" because Phedre herself has the ambition of a blow-up doll. Human size one. Nudge-nudge.Many reviewers mention that the sex drives the story. Umm. Phedre goes someplace. She needs someone to do something. She sleeps with that someone. Another obstacle overcome, yay!Drives the story? Delaunay could have been Kasparov and she could challenge people to chess to get what she needed. Heck, it would probably make the story more exciting.Oh, there is pity sex too. Like after someone pointless dies pointlessly.Did I say pointless? Pretty much every character outside primary five or so is pointless. By the end I didn't know who \\"Percy\\", or that \\"D'envers\\" guy were. Sure, they are all nobles and all important and stuff, but it's like they all became this single mass of dudes who do stuff. For all I care, she could have a single guy called \\"Noble\\" do all the tasks like discuss tactics and give commands and chuckle and nod.Oh, there are villains too. One is Melisande who is so OMG beautiful that Phedre practically loves her. Did I mention they are all really beautiful? Carey reminds us about twenty five thousand times. In case we forget. There is also Selig who wants to enslave all the beautiful people. \\"Who wants to enslave all the beautiful people?\\" he yells. And like ten million barbarians (Skaldi) go \\"We do!\\", yay! That's how grand villains are made right there, woohoo! All villains are given about 50 pages of action in the entire book. The rest is about Phedre being thrown through places. With a chapter for each day. Mhm. There are also entirely pointless plots like with Albans battling some usurper guy. I cared so much. No wait, I didn't.Probably the most exciting thing would be Master of Straits. There was alot of talk about him which got me all pumped up. Until Phedre actually meets him. And he is just some guy. Who talks. And then leaves. And that's it.I liked most of Carey's language. What ruins it is constant description, often of thing I absolutely don't care about. If this book is of any indication of the series as a whole, I think she could condense 3 books into one.In conclusion I can see where Carey's fans and accolades are coming from. There is definitely some originality in the setup, if not the story itself. There is also the whole sex thing. Is this enough to entice me? It did somehow, when I was ignorant (only read good reviews, alas). In retrospective, however, I find it insulting to my intelligence. For books like Kushiel's Dart there should be an injection to immediately get the entire plot into the receiver's brain. Otherwise it's just a waste of time."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The characters seemed flat, almost stereotypical. The religious aspect didn't help.The world, based on medieval europe, wasn't imaginatively constructed. This itself isn't so bad, but the lack of imagination seemed to spill over into other parts of the book as well, such as the characters and religion, which were at most variations on various well-known, standard forms.The prose seemed ponderous to me. I also didn't like the foreshadowing aspect.On a normal day I would give the book a 2 as it had a (very) few redeeming qualities, but seeing all the 5's, I have to say \\"Why?\\" and give it a 1."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book because it was so heavily hyped, but it turned out to be mess of stilted prose, overly demanding plot details, and bad sadomasochistic porn. Every sentence rings of foolish bombast, the characters have no emotional appeal, and I felt so manipulated I had to throw the book across the room. I have tried to pick up the book again, being a third of the way through, but it repels me again and again. I am no literary snob, I read science fiction and some fantasy all the time, and I am no literary lightweight, enjoying Henry James as much as the next guy, but this piece of marketing mush failed to appeal at any level. The book reads like it was started on an alt.sex newsgroup."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have literally been excited to read this book now for quite some time and finally this weekend I went and purchased the book at a local bookstore. I have read the first one hundred pages of this thing thinking.....what the hell is going on here. I mean I understand the dialogue but the book is literally making me fall asleep. I know that many people have rated this with 5 stars and that is another reason why I thought I would give it a try, but I have been severely disappointed. I thought this was going to be book with strong female characters and possibly even something with a religious overtone, but the whole thing falls way short. Sure there is something of a theological aspect with the correlation to Christ but you ask yourself why. Maybe that's the problem with the book is that there is absolutely no reason for anything the author is writing about and she gives you no explanation as to what the things are that she is talking about. It's like walking into a 2 hour movie 15 minutes before the thing ends. Personally I would save the money and if you were looking for something fantastic with more of an edge and definitely easier to understand an apply then try Ayn Rand.

She is anguissette, marked by Kushiel's Dart, forever cursed and gifted to be pleasured by pain. The book is bursting with detail, bringing together a strange mix of Christianity and erotic paganism along with a sardonic and sometimes dark humor. If you don't mind the sex, it's an addicting read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is truly an epic, not just in length (700 pages!) but in quality and content. Jacqueline Carey has gone through much time and effort in this book to construct a world so alike and yet so different from ours. There is a fundamental difference in most alternate-universe books; the difference here is that when Jesus (or Yeshua, as they call him in this book) was crucified, his blood mixed with Mary Magdelene's tears and begat, on the fertile soil of Mother Earth, God's unwanted son, a whore's unwanted get--Blessed Elua, who makes his home in what we call France, and they call Terre D'Ange. Thousands of years later in Terre D'Ange, another whore's unwanted get is sold into slavery--the heroine of this story, Phedre no Delunay.Phedre is bought by the Night Court, which consists of thirteen houses of prostitutes that all specialize in one area or another. One concentrates on grace, one on artistry, one on beauty, and so on. They do this as a service to a goddess of theirs, Naamah, who was a companion of Blessed Elua and prostituted herself so that Elua might eat. Phedre grows up in this world with an unusual gift/curse--she is marked by the lord of pain, Kushiel, and feels pain and pleasure as one. Because of this unusual trait, she is bought out of the Night Court and into the household of Anafel Delunay, who becomes her foster father and trains her to spy and politick until she is a master diplomat.But what are Delunay's motives, and what does he have to do with the ruling house of Terre D'Ange? Phedre doesn't learn until it's too late, and is caught up in a web of mystery and intrigue that she has unwittingly played a part in. When she is sold in slavery again to the wilds of Skaldia (we call it Germany) she must rely on her skills as a diplomat and her skills as a Servant of Naamah to get back to her homeland and warn her Queen of the plot to overthrow her--and indeed, the entire nation of Terre D'Ange.There are twists and turns at every angle in this book; undying friendship and ancient feuds, unexpected love and unrelenting desire. It is truly an epic, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I had difficulty with this book, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I have enjoyed epic fantasy in the past (e.g. George R. R. Martin), but this dragged massively in the beginning and a little at the end. It's written in first-person from the POV of the courtesan Phedre. I just didn't like her that much, and 901 pages is a long time to have to listen to someone like that.Plus I didn't buy that time and time again things hinged on Phedre sleeping with someone. That just gets predictable in a novel this long. In fact, it was a little frustrating that through the first half the eroticism was so elegantly written and in the second half it was hardly mentioned in favor of exploring the inner thoughts of Phedre which weren't as interesting.That said, I couldn't really find fault with the prose itself. The other characters were elegantly sketched, and the mythology that Carey created was amazing. I wished I could hear even more of the angel Elua and less of his scions. I might actually pick up the next book in the series just to hear more of the mythology, but it will be after I recover from this one and without such high expectations."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have read many novels where the main character has been god touched, and uses his or her skills as an emissary of the gods to help save the lives of others but never in this way. Kushiel's Dart a novel by fantasy newcomer Jacquline Carey is a unique story. I can seriously say I have never seen anything quite like it before. It tells the story of, Phedre, a girl born with an ill luck name and a scarlet mote in her left eye. Considered to be cursed, she is sold in indentured servitude into the Night Court where she hopes one day to become a servant of Naamah, the goddess of sexual pleasure. Her life is changed forever when she is taken in by Anafiel no Delauny, a courtesan and spy. He sees her for what she really is, an anguissette, a child touched by the God of punishment Kusheil. This means that she is forced forever to feel pleasure and pain as one. As she begins to train for Naamah's service it is Delauny who teaches her the skills she will need to know to survive. He teachers her languages, history, and how to listen and pay attention in a world of dangerous politics.There are so many good things to be said about this novel and I cannot possibly list them all here. One of the most attractive things about this book, in my opinion, is the elegant prose it is written in. Certainly not for everyone, Ms. Carey writes in a very descriptive manner filled with beautiful picture of the D'Angeline world. Although some would consider this to be too drawn out and lengthy is fits the character, a strong woman who is taught to listen and pay attention to every detail, perfectly. Another strong point would have to be the instantly likeable characters. Phedre for all of her strengths is a wonderfully flawed character. Even though she is intelligent, beautiful, and skilled she also falls victim to too much pride, impulsiveness, and often not thinking about how her actions will affect others. You will find yourself completely enthralled in her world from first page on and eager to find out what will happen to her and the other characters such as Hyacinthe and Joscelin.The setting is another strength of Ms. Carey's writing. Although the map in the beginning of this book may look familiar (Central Europe) she manages to create interesting cultures that resemble there real life counterparts and, at the same time are very much different. Terre D'Ange, where much of the novel takes place, is a passionate world filled with beautiful people, the descendants of gods, and complicated politics. Carey also shows a skill for creating interesting religions, although the reader will not completely see that until the second book in this trilogy, Kushiel's Chosen.I've honestly never thought a 900 page book could be called a page turner but this certainly was. I read it in under a week and immediately went out and bought the sequel. Although many readers may be put off by amount of sex and violence (sometimes in the same scene) I urge you to look past that and see the novel for what it really is, an amazing story about a strong woman and the adventures she has."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I enjoyed this book. At first I was disturbed by the allusion to Christ as the \\"father\\" of Blessed Elua, founder of Terre d'Ange. Then I remembered the book is a work of fiction and moved on. That said, I found a very enjoyable book that I have read three times since receiving it in December.Phedre is a very intelligent and resourceful young woman who uses everything about herself: her mind, her political training and her sensual training to discover a conspiracy to invade her country and overthrow the throne. That the conspirators move in the highest circles of the land of Terre d'Ange (Land of Angels) helps to make it more interesting.Kushiel's Dart is a novel about the making of a spy. Phedre comes from a line of people who have chosen to become courtesans (whores to the untutored). She is gifted/cursed with the ability to find pleasure in pain. Phedre's life is forever changed when she is whisked from this sensuous world into the far more interesting world of politics and intrigue by a very skilled tutor. From there on, even though her sexuality is not covered over (it is \\"out there\\" for us to see), and she weilds it and her honed intelligence and observation skills taught her by her mentor like a sword against her country's enemies both within and without.Very much worth the price."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book has all the earmarks of a first novel: Mary-Sue heroine, unnecessarily elaborate plot, self-conscious narrative mechanics (the wordiness and repetition others have commented upon), and pacing problems.Phedre is an interesting premise in an interesting setting, but as a character she's quite one-dimensional. After spending almost a thousand pages in her head I still don't know anything about her other than she likes pain and those who can give it to her; and worse, she never grows or changes or learns anything from her adventures. I don't think anyone in this book does, they just suffer and struggle and have kinky sex. And while I am not bothered by kinky sex, I did have to say \\"ew\\" at the various examples of emotional and/or sociological incest. Furthermore, it gets pretty silly when every complication, every roadblock, can be overcome by Our Heroine going to bed with someone. Surely there are some folks in this land who can't be led around by their girdles?The political stuff is too subtle and too awkwardly handled to make much of an impression until late in the book, by which time it seems like an afterthought. There is such a pronounced difference in style and pacing between the first third of the book and the last two-thirds, that I wonder if the training-and-growing-up sequences were written first, and then had a larger plot grafted on when Carey realized she had to take the story somewhere. I skimmed past the clumsy infodumps in the first third of the book, because they had no apparent bearing on the present action, but then when I reached the part where those names _were_ important, I'd forgotten who was who and had to backtrack. In my mind, any book that needs a dramatis personae is not a well-written book.Another reviewer said Melisande was an inadequate villian and I have to agree. Though we are told _ad nauseum_ how cruel and manipulative she is, the author never really SHOWS her being cruel or sadistic--except when she and Phedre are having sex, and since only Melisande can hurt Phedre the way she needs to be hurt, it's okay. But the whole emotional aspect of their relationship was lost on me. I could accept that they had the hots for each other, but late in the book when Phedre says, \\"Yet I had loved her once,\\" I went, \\"Say what? When? Why?\\"I had the same problem with most of the relationships in this book. I couldn't see why Phedre and Alcuin would be so devoted to their mentor, I couldn't see why Phedre fell for Jocelyn or he for her--although I smelled _that_ one coming from the moment he appeared. The obligatory bodyguard--and a vow of chastity to boot! Is this really a surprise to anyone? The characters are all described in exhaustive visual detail, but I never felt any resonance from any of them. They are character _types_ rather than fleshed-out personalities.I resisted reading this book for a long time because I knew it couldn't possibly live up to all the hype. Finally a friend gave me her half-read copy and made me promise to tell her how it turned out because she couldn't stand the Mary-Sueness, either. I did enjoy Phedre's voice and descriptions of things. The world-building is distinct and thorough, I'll give it that. I also enjoyed Carey's toying with familiar languages--she's obviously very literate and uses language effectively.After a while, though, I started to feel cheated about the whole skewed-universe approach. Why bother making up a whole new world and culture when you can just rip off history--especially when the author has gone to such lengths to show us every single corner and culture of her knocked-off world? On the one hand it adds richness, on the other hand it's exhausting. (Another reviewer made an interesting point about how the D'Angelines seemed to be in a Rennaissance while the rest of the world was stuck in the Dark Ages; however I read it more like the arrogance of the Romans during the height of their Empire, when they assumed everyone else were barbarians.)One thing I haven't seen anyone comment upon was the inconsistency of the magic in this land. For the first 60-70% of the book it seemed that the myths of Blessed Elua and his consorts were just that--myths. Nothing magical happened, and although certain aspects of daily life were explained in terms of religious doctrine, and Hyacinthe was rumored to have psychic powers, everybody seemed to treat the supernatural aspects with the same half-seriousness we extend toward ghost-hunters and John Edwards. But then Phedre and crew have to cross the sea, and suddenly run into wind-and-water controlling demi-gods who walk and talk and cut deals just like the Olympians? And nobody bats an eye or says, \\"We thought you were just myths!?\\"That was the point where I stopped taking the story seriously, and it was all downhill from there. The rest was a rushed hodgepodge of names and battles and running to-and-fro, with occasional pauses for jumping in the sack with one noble or another, in order to keep the plot grinding forward.Needless to say, I haven't felt inspired to read the last two-thirds of the trilogy. Still, I know plenty of people like this kind of thing, so if you're into atmosphere and glamorous, unambiguous characters, then grab a box of bonbons and dive in.If you're more intellectually driven, picking out Carey's literary and historical influences may keep you diverted for the bulk of the book. Sure the plot is stock, but there's some mighty nifty wrapping paper around it. I suspect Carey spent several years elaborating and decorating and revising, when she should've chucked it in the drawer and written something new."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am a fantasy reader and not a romance reader. However, I bought this book years ago at the recommendation of one of my favorite authors (Steven Brust). Once I started reading, I was hooked. Carey spins a grand tale full of intrigues and gets you caring about the major characters so much that you can find yourself clutching the book as you read on to see what happens to them next. And on top of that, the book gets quite erotic at times. It's not for the feint of heart though, no little girl's romances with soft kisses on satin sheets. Phedra's experiences explore the edgier side of erotica, so don't bother reading if you require tender sweetness when reading about erotic moments. After this book, I was hooked and eagerly awaited each of the remaining D'Angeline novels. Not all were as good as Kushiel's Dart, but I sure was disappointed when Carey decided to stop writing any more of them."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"No time to say anything else, I'm off to the bookstore to get the next one.(Sorry Amazon, sometimes you just have to have something now.)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've been a fan of the Kushiel series ever since I came across it a few years ago. Recently, I re-read this, the first book of the series. I had hoped that this was a series that wouldn't diminish with multiple readings (as sometimes happens when suspense at what will happen is no longer present) and happily was proved right.I've recommended this book and series to friends many times, and they inevitably ask me 'What's it about?' With a story of such depth, range, and intricacy, that question is nigh impossible, so I merely tell them 'Just read it. You'll see.'In the Kushiel series, Carey has created an alternate version of our world filled with people, places, and events just as complex as any in the real world - they are believable, they are intriguing, nothing is cookie-cutter black/white or good/evil as is found in so many fantasy books. She tackles three giants of the fantasy realm (political intrigue, religion, and war) and shines at all of them, still while maintaining an amazing level of characterization and originality. This series is like nothing else I've ever read, in the best way.This series really does have something for everyone, as another reviewer mentioned. Love stories and sex? Check. Fights and battles? Check. Political and social intricacy? Check. Mystical happenings? Check. Mystery and intrigue? Check. And unless you are completely robotic reader, I warn you - you will get drawn in. This series has made me laugh, cry, gasp, cluth something in suspense, wince, sigh, etc. And that is not limited to this first book. I've read all 5 books in the series now, and all have kept up that level of quality.So, as I tell my friends when I recommend this: Just read it. You'll see."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've read many great modern books, but this is the first novel that has actually compelled me to write a review about it. Kushiel's Dart, part of the Kushiel Legacy Trilogy is so profoundly rich in culture and intellect that a simple mind will have a lock down.Pros:Kushiel's Dart has a new twist on historical facts as Carey invents her own stable and unique religion based off common knowledge of Christianity, Judiasm, and paganism, all of which have a focus in the Trilogy series. Also, instead of inventing a whole new physical world, she overlaps her world onto recognizable geography which makes for a fun guessing game of which culture she has renamed, but still portrays. For me, those were my favorite aspects! A gold mind for people who have a broad range of knowledge and like to fit pieces into the overlaying patterns.As for characters, Carey's Phedre is both a femme fatale and a compassionate martyr. She is a spy trained courtesan, in a culture where sex has no shame as long as it's participated in consentingly. Phedre is not so far off the mark that modern women cannot relate to her, but they can still envy her adventures and dramatic escapades in love. All of Carey's vastly concieved characters have both undeniable strength in various areas, and human weaknesses that liken them to their earthly realm.By the middle of the book, the compounded adventures and interlying, hard to forsee, patterns will have you glued to the pages, unable to put down the novel. 900 pages will fly by and barely keep your reading appetite at bay!Cons:Carey uses a very high vocabulary count, and I found myself with a dictionary all too soon. However, that could be because I crave to fully understand and recognize every word my eyes take in. Still, for someone who wants a quick pleasure in reading, this is not for them.This is also a \\"blusher\\" so conservative and sensitive audiences should be advise, though Carey displays this sensual language with style and class.It also takes a bit of time for the plot to build in the beginning, but every seemingly mundane detail is used later on during the rush of the climax of the story. There is also a huge cast of characters, which can be hard to keep straight. However, Carey tends to repeat certain material often so as the reader does not forget.Overall:I bought this novel on a whim, and at first didn't think I could see past her strong vocabulary use. But then as I became accustomed to Carey's language style, I was quickly swept away in Terre D'Ange and the web of mystery and intrique. As soon as I was done, I went out and bought Kushiel's Chosen and didn't regret that purchase either. Carey is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors based on her writing style and creativity, and is certainly making her way to becoming the next Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"You might well think, when you first encounter Jaqueline Carey's \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" a long, languid alt-history historical fantasy whose heroine, Phedre, is among other things a sexual masochist. that you're about to embark on a guilty pleasure. Well, it's a pleasure alright (the plot twists surprise, the characters are hard to forget, the prose is elegant), but when you close the book 901 pages later, you probably won't feel guilty at all. You may even want to applaud.The setting is an alternate early-Renaissance Europe (France is called \\"Terre d'Ange\\"), in which early Christianity has taken an odd turn and for some reason there are three islands (as the helpful map shows) in the English Channel called \\"the three sisters.\\" (It takes a while before you learn what they are, and what their significance is, but it's worth the wait.)Phedre, bisexual courtesan-avid reader-linguist-slave-spy is thrown by fate into a grand tour of this world and she helps to right some wrongs along the way--and rather cleverly at that; her methods are never out of character.And then there's the style: Quite daringly, Carey has Phedre tell her long tale in a first-person narrative. And that's a difficult thing to do. Authors less skilled than Carey who use the first person to describe a \\"built\\" world often resort to conventions to disguise the fact that the narrator, there in the built world, is writing for you, here in the early 21st century (\\"I have heard that in some worlds there are strange beasts upon whose backs people ride\\"). But Carey avoids this convention entirely. Phedre's narrative simply assumes that you are part of her world and that you've picked up her narrative some time in _her_ future (not ours), and as a result everything is left shimmery, impressionistic, as foggy as John Jude Palencar's amazing cover. It may take you a while before you slap your forehead and think, \\"oh yes. Now I see what those 13 houses of the night court are!\\"A stunning novel, superior in every way. And there are two more, ready and waiting."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have now read all three books in this trilogy, and if you are considering reading this first one, I envy you the treat ahead of you. These books as a whole story are deeply satisfying, and each one stands on its own as well. The world that Carey has created is strangely familar... the shape of the continents is the same as our Europe, but something different happened to the history, around the time of the crucifixion. Out of the mingled tears of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, the god Elua was born, and he wandered the world, joined by seven angels with different attributes. Today the descendants of Elua and his seven companions rule France, only the name \\"France\\" is never heard. Instead we have Terre d'Ange and its six provinces. Our England is named Alba, and the Romans (called Tiberians) never conquered it. And so on. By this device, Carey is able to draw on the richness of human history and her own fertile imagination, and the result is a world of great beauty.We follow the life of Phedre, sold into indenture by her profligate parents, and bought by an erstwhile poet and spymaster who is involved in a mysterious way with the royal family. Phedre has a special talent--she takes pleasure from pain. Where this destiny takes her in the three books is a masterpiece of storytelling, and has a message for all of us: you are needed exactly as you are.Above all, Carey is a master storyteller, with adventures, twists, and sexy romances that will keep you turning pages, and gorgeous language that will keep making you want to slow down! (The names alone are luscious: Ysandre de la Courcel, Melisande Sharizai, Anafiel Delaunay...are just a few.) Luckily for me, the books can be re-read with pleasure; they're that good. If six stars were possible, I would give them."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. I reccommend it highly to lovers of fantasy, erotica, mystery, romance, and/or historical fiction. The characters are so very human, flawed and conflicted and beautiful and deep. Be warned, the book is full of S&M, \\"alternative\\" sexualities, and religious beliefs that would sound heretical to many conservative Christians (the savior in this series is a child born of the blood of Christ, and the tears of Mary Magnalene, birthed from Mother Earth's womb, and cast out of heaven by God, with a scion of damned angels, who create their own Eden). The plot is sufficiently complicated, as are the characters, and the book paints detailed pictures of the geography of this alternative Europe/Asia, the gods/goddesses that rule over them, and the peoples that live there. Unlike many fantasy authors that attempt an alternative Earth, Carey does not get too caught up in the exactness of parallels. For instance, the people called Yeshuites are much like the Jews of Europe in culture and language, but in Carey's world, they are the only believers in Yeshua (Christ) as the savior of mankind. Nearly all others from Phedre's country follow his son, Elua. This novel pulls the reader into exotic and savage lands, tantalizes them with rich tastes and sights and sensations, exposes them to a variety of cultures based on everyone from the Rom (Gypsies of Eastern Europe) to the French and Russians, and allows them a window into the mind of a delightfully willfull and passionate courtesan. Dramatic sword fights, sex-art training, royal spys, traitors, priestesses, courtesans, fortune tellers, voyages, slavery, assasinations, and trysts all find easy niches in this lovely book. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I inadvertently started reading the second book before I knew that it belonged to a trilogy, and had to backtrack to read Kushiel'd Dart before I could finish. The world Carey has created -- an alternate-reality of the middle-european Renaissance (sort of) -- is detailed and full of interesting cultural conventions and social rules. Without being overbearing and obvious, she builds the rules of this world through the observations of Phedre, the spy-cum-courtesan who drives the convoluted but well-mapped plot.This is primarily the story of political intrigue in the class of a good Ludlum or leCarre novel -- just enough twists and turns to be very interesting, yet not require re-reading to figure out all the puzzles. Setting the novel in this mythic world populated by the offspring of fallen angels and other christian icons lends a lush feel to the novel that Carey pulls off without being corny.I literally could not put this one down, and moved from the end of Dart to the second book, Kushiel's Chosen, in one sitting. It is, obviously, for mature readers -- a masochistic courtesan is the main character -- and not for the easily shocked or overly religious, I think. All in all, worth every minute."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I picked up this book in the bookstore, I read the jacket and was immediately intrigued. I bought the book in hardcover, which I rarely do, and when I sat down at home to check out my new acquisition, I read the whole thing in about eight hours, which I do quite often.I loved this book. It was set in an almost alternate Europe where people worship \\"Blessed Elua\\" who reminds me of Jesus, and many other gods. Look carefully, and, if you're Jewish, or know enough about the Jewish faith, you will find many references to Judaism and to other cultures. It is a hodgepodge of realty and fantasy that, if for no other reason, keeps you reading just to find out how much of reality is truly present.Phedre no Delaunay is called an anguisette, basically a fancy name for a masochist. Yes, she enjoys pain as much as pleasure, and in some cases, pain gives her pleasure. The sex scenes are graphic, but not tasteless. They are all done with some decency in mind, and never once was I horrified enough to put the book down.The book takes Phedre down the road of life in many unique ways. Not only is she a courtesan, she is also a spy, using her skills to gain information on the intrigues of the court around her. There are 12 courts in the land of Terre D'Ange, land of angels, where Phedre lives. Every court has certain qualities that allow them to become distinctive, and each court conspires and conives to bring down the others. Phedre, using her talents as the only anguisette in a hundred years, gains information and passes it on to her mentor, who tries to untangle the mysteries of the court.This book was fabulous in all ways. The land is clearly detailed, the people are all unique, and Phedre is a heroine that you will NEVER forget. This book is the epitome of all fantasy, and the sequel is even better.... but that's another review."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm immediately distrustful of erotic fantasies and my suspicious mindset wasn't improved by the cover of the book (a half-naked girl with eyes cast down, standing in front of a group of columns). I made the decision to buy the book in part due to the collection of rave reviews in the front of the book. There were, in short, enough comparisons to Tanith Lee and George R. R. Martin to spark my interest.While I have to say I don't think that Carey's written a book that can equal one of Lee or Martin's creations, I did find it readable and well-crafted. Moreover, while there are sexual elements, Carey does a marvelous job of keeping a book about a masochistic prostitute from descending into soft-core._Kushiel's Dart_ is best compared with _Maia_ by Richard Adams in which a prostitute can have a priveledged role as a witness to power. Through the lens of Phedre no Delaunay we get a rich look at the game of houses played in this fantasy land of Terre d'Ange.Interesting mythology with enough fantasy elements to make it an alternative world but resists using stock magic elements to carry the plot. The only fault is in the seeming lack of flaws in the main characters-- and I also get tired of races where everyone is unnaturally beautiful, but I guess that goes with the genre.I suppose it's worth repeating the obvious-- not designed for the younger fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Wow! When I picked up this book, I thought it was going to be something totally different; but it was still the best book I've read in a long time. The plot and the place is so interesting, how and who they worship as a religon is very new to me. When I first found out about the romance part I thought it was going to be a hokey book like Fabio or something. But the book just captured me and kept me going to the very end. The descriptions are very powerful and real, I felt like I was in the book. And the other aspects, the love Phedre feels for both her companion and Melisande is so intersting, and the best part is that people don't look down upon the fact that Anafiel loved prince Rolande and Alcuin.All in all this book was very well written, it even made me cry at some points, and the ending was so sudden and it just left you hanging! It makes you scream for the sequel, and I will get it as soon as I can!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Most of what I have to say, people have already said, so I'll forebear gushing and keep it short.The subtitle for this book could well be a line that reappears frequently throughout: \\"All that yields is not weak.\\" (Or something along those lines -- I just finished Kushiel's Chosen, and have forgotten the exact wording.) Phedre finds pleasure in pain and submission, yes, but she rules her patrons through that same submission. It takes an incredible amount of talent to make this concept believable, but Carey more than acheives it. Some of the scenes are shocking -- this is not a book for the faint-hearted -- but they are never inappropriate or even overdone. The sex is integral to the plot, and after a few initial moments of revulsion, I was able to accept that Phedre truly enjoys and needs this. The mix of real and fictional cultures is engaging, and Carey's language is lovely, although in Kushiel's Chosen she becomes a little too fond of \\"'tis\\" and \\"'twas\\" for believability.I've noticed a few reviews complaining about the length. Grow up, people. This story is no longer than it needs to be -- Carey could not possibly have pulled it off in less than 701 pages. Seriously, I read it in three days -- you can't put it down. If anything, I wished it would last longer. Kushiel's Chosen is 700 pages exactly in hardcover, and I'm dying waiting for the third book! Also, someone was complaining that the names are incomprehensible and unpronounceable. I think the term was \\"jumbled up letters.\\" Huh? They're French. Some of the names later in the book are Germanic or Gaelic. There's nothing jumbled-up here. Sheesh."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I debated for months as to whether to buy this - especially as it hasn't been released in the UK yet - but i decided i had to read it the moment i saw the cover art... absolutely stunning. I finished it today, and i can say it just restored my faith in the fantasy genre.As far as characters go, Phedre is intriguing. I loved that nothing in her life is ever simple; that she can accept what she is, and yet hate herself for it, whilst acknowledging that it is a weapon she can use effectively. She gets read-out-loud dialogue, and the kind of self-confidence that drags the reader right in alongside. I got lost at times - i got completely confused as to which noble was which, and what they were doing - but in the end, it doesn't matter. Political intrigue never really grabs my attention, but so long as the characters do, all is forgiven. It isn't fantasy in the usual sense, although there are fantastic elements; i suppose it's really alternate history, although i usually steer clear of that. I wouldn't call it a romance, though. The romantic elements are no more pronounced than in many fantasy books i've read, and i can't stand slush. While i suppose you could term the sex element romance, i really don't think it applies...I've been trying to describe it to people ever since i started reading, but i wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. The sex scenes are integral to the plot, and to the characters, and i can think of a lot of people who won't like that. Some of the reviews here have said as much, but you need to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate exactly what is going on. None of it is gratuitous, exactly - Phedre uses her gifts and her training to gather information, and as bargaining currency, and boy, is she confident that everyone in the entire world wants her in their bed. Usually they do, of course, cos she's the heroine. It's only fair. It reminded me in many ways of Laurell K Hamilton's 'Kiss of Shadows', except far less supernatural stuff. Lots of similar elements; infact, for anyone who's read LKH's work, i'd say this is the direction she's going in. As far as the Tanith Lee comparisons go, this is far more accessable than her similar works, in my opinion.Highest praise? I turned the last page, and wanted to start writing myself. Only very bad or very good books make me want to do that, and this was very, very good. It has a cliff-hanger that you can live with, and i just found out there's a trilogy planned. Not sure how that's gonna work out, but on the evidence here, it should be good!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is simply fantastic. The story is set in a world that is basically Europe, called Europa, but with a few changes: countries' names differ, yet remain related to the model, such as Alba for England, Eire for Ireland, and Terre D'Ange, for a France-like nation; a pantheon of gods and godesses rules Terre D'Ange, the main setting, whose leader god is the union of the Mother Earth and the tears wept by Magdalene for a Jesus-like Messiah.Into this world Phedre no Delauney is born, sold into indentured servitude but raised in the Night Court, a group of Thirteen Houses, which are bascially high class brothels, whose adepts can only be called courtesans, though that does not quiet define the service these men and women perform, for they serve the goddess Naamah in their doings, the goddess of prostitution and sexuality, and retain a degree of respect that is not usually associated wiht prostitution.The books runs through several facinating plots. When each ones ends, what comes to mind is what can possibly come next? Being raised in the Night Court and being a bond-slave, is one; another, plots of treason, conspiracy, war and betrayal. Being sold into actual slavery to a barabarian tribe, and escaping that situation and fleeing through impossible weather and terrain; becoming an ambassador to a hard-reached nation and fighting for two seperate thrones. All this with threads of sexual wiles accomplishing more than imaginable; all this with love, friendship, romance, and passion.All said, an incredible mix of everything one could wish for in a novel; impossible ot put down. And best of all, the story ends with another implied to follow. Do not overlook this first-time author's novel, for it is a true gem, the magnificent tip of potential great iceberg."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first part of the book, when Phedre is in training, is wonderful. Had the book stopped there, it would have gotten a 5.The action continues to be wonderful, but the secondary characters start getting confusing. (There is a listing in the front, but it only gives basic information.) If you read this book, do not take a break of more than a day or 2 (unless you have an amazing memory), else you run the risk of not remembering all the political factions once you start up again."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I did not know much about the book before I began reading it, and at first I was annoyed about the political details within the story. I wanted more erotica! After a hundred pages, I was hooked on the whole story. It is a unique storyline and offers a look inside a rich, vibrant culture that is alive and unbelievably detailed. The story is woven intricately and you are left guessing where the plot will turn next. Aside from my initial irritation about the detailed political climate, the humanity brought to life by Carey in this novel is worth the time investment. I even grew to love the complex story that fed my creative mind.Of the three books in the series, this is by far my favorite. But if you read one, you're sure to read them all!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I did read this book in 2 maybe 3 days. And I loved the ideas behind the world building...ie, Elua, his Companions and the strong religious sentiment of the book. The alternate Europe was well drawn but for a book this long I wanted much more atmosphere than is given.Carey gives us a lavish society and interesting characters, but the interuptions from Phedre as narrator are prosaic and distracting. Mostly she says things like I don't have the craft to drecribe what happened, and then proceeds to do so. Which, if we are to believe her studies under Delaunay, she must be very equipped to describe her experiences.And her sexual experiences are not develed into emotionally enough, nor with the true detail (not pornographic mind you). I think Carey strives to accomplish much with her descriptions of these sequences but I might suggest she look to Tanith Lee's Tales From the Flat Earth, Secret Books of Paradys, or Vivia for examples of really subtle yet vivid sexual descriptions.The end of the book left me disappointed, the characters that are poignant to the story loose more and more focus, mainly Joscelin, and I felt as if I'd just finished an intriging Romance novel, rather than a work of Fantasy.More of the Religious experience of the character, as a servant of Naamah and Kushiel would have filled out the flatness of Phedre as the plot progresses.Not a waste of time definately not, and as a first novel, very ambitious and quite an accomplishment. It will be interesting to see Carey progress and if she polishes her craft to live up to the goals she seems to have set for herself in Kushiel's Dart."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I found this book to be excellent - very intelligent, well written, and intriguing.

There is, so far as I can see, only one thing to quibble about. In the land of Terre d'Ange, the ruling commandment is to &quot;love as thou wilt.&quot; The principal deity of this land, Naamah, sold herself to any who wanted her. The heroine of the book, Phedre, was brought up, first in the Night Court, then by aristocratic Anafiel Delaunay, to be a cultured and highly skilled courtesan. Such courtesans are highly prized, acting as both servants and incarnations of the deity. Yet every now and then, a disparaging comment is made about &quot;whores.&quot; Yet this is, in the end, only a quibble, and hardly detracts from what is, all-in-all, a superb first novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"One of the best books I've read this year.

They are, first and foremost, storytellers. They write in a very straightforward way, the primary goal being to \\"spin out a good yarn\\". And to make that \\"yarn\\" accessible to just about anyone. They captivate you with their creativity, drawing you into their world of epic-sized action, violence, political intrique, romance, thrills, mysteries, and suspense.Jacqueline Carey is an author from a different mold. Kushiel's Dart is well-written. Jacqueline Carey spends more effort making her words and sentences \\"beautiful\\" and elegant. Her writing is not as accessible as the aforementioned authors. And you won't find epic-sized violence, action, thrills, or suspense in Kushiel's Dart. What you have is an elegantly described account of Phedre's life. Phedre is a young woman who was sold into the services of Anafiel Delaunay. Delaunay is a powerful courtesan, who trains Phedre not only to become a skilled lover, but also to become skilled in matters of espionage. Kushiel's Dart is basically Phedre's journey from childhood to becoming one of the most sought-after pleasure-givers in the city. Using what she learns from her \\"pillow conversations\\", she helps Delaunay further his own political machinations.There's really not much story in Kushiel's Dart. Certainly nothing close to the likes of The Eye of the World and The Game of Thrones. Jacqueline Carey is more of a writer than a storyteller. Now, I realize a lot of people will appreciate that. The elegant sentences and all of that. However, that is not what I like. I much prefer a storyteller to a writer. Tell me a story! Spin me a good yarn. And say it plain and straightforward. I'm not looking to critique your sentence structure. Not at all. I just want good plot, deep character development, exciting action, etc. No flowery writing is necessary, nor desired, from my perspective.But, I cannot really knock Carey for writing elegantly and flowery. There's a place for that. What I can criticize her for is the lack of \\"story\\" in the novel. What is the point of a novel that doesn't have much of a story? That's like serving a hamburger on an elegant platter, on freshly-baked bun, crisp lettuce and tomato, but the actual beef itself only fills up a quarter of the bun. Not enough to make a meal out of, in my opinion. And that's the problem with Kushiel's Dart. Yes, it is elegant, but there's not enough story to make up a novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book! Rich in detail and characterization. It has passion, intrigue and betrayal, with plenty of plot twists. Don't let the warning scare you off, the sex scenes are tastefully done. The author only goes into detail the first time Phedre has sex with another character and even then the detail is not over done. I found the look into a masochistic mind most intriguing. This is funny because I almost didn't buy the book because of the masochistic theme. The only thing that ticked me off about the book was no fault of the author, the cover art doesn't represent the character in the book. Phedre was clearly described as having a massive amount of long curly hair and pale skin and her marque (the tattoo) ran up her spine from the top of her tailbone to the nap of her neck. The cover art shows her with straight hair (that just touched her shoulders, in the book it was past her shoulders so she would have to move it to show her marque.) and her marque is clearly to the right of her spine and finished below her shoulder blade. The placement (and the length) of the marque was right on the second book only to be screwed up again on the third. And none of them have the blood red drops that she loved the most of the details on the marque. I know this is nit picking, but I think that when the cover art doesn't match the description in the book it throws off the visualization of the character."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I chose this book based on the reviews and several listmania lists that convinced me to at least give it a shot. Not normally the type to pick up a fantasy novel, and especially not one where there's a half naked woman on the cover (I admit, I'm a book snob), I was wary.And very pleasantly surprised.Carey puts together a story over the 904 pages that absolutely draws you in. The mystery of who her master really is and what his purpose is draws you in...you hope for Phedre to find happiness somehow, with her master, her friend, her protector, or her housemate, anyone. Even though this world is not ours and definitely a well thought out one, you believe in it.My only complaint is actually minimal. I didn't like the religon of the book...to me it somehow seemed too corny...a man who walks around singing and says \\"love as thou wilt\\" just annoys me. But there are only a few pages directed to him, even though everyone runs around saying \\"blessed Elua\\".I will definitely be buying the sequels, and I've heard even more good things about them.Great book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is phenomenally crafted. Once you get over the initial shock of massachism (spelling?), you realize that the story wouldn't be the same without it. The romance of Joscelin is real, and thrilling. Every character is brought out with vibrant beauty, although some may seem one-dimensional. Carey illuminates the complexity of human relationships, especially those involving sexuality. Carey delves into a subject most authors stay safely away from, or dance around with cheesy euphemisms. Sexuality is a powerful force our society likes to deny, and this novel explodes with blatant examination of the touchy subject. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and its sequel, and am anxiously awaiting the third."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"OH my I LOVE this charecter and this book. I actually bought Kushiel's Chosen the second of the trilogy first, by accident. Due to my obsession with reading things from series or trilogy in proper order I sought out Kushiel's Dart to read first. And I am now on 3 waiting lists for Kushiel's Avatar the final book. I have never been able to get into fantasy and sci-fi reading being an Old English Literature lover, and student.It always seemed to out there and random. Though catagorized as Fantasy i prefer romantic history, yet this series is so many different genre's all rolled into one, fantasy, history, literture, poetry romance, adventure and a heroine the likes of which I have no comparison. This will appeal to Darklings, Lit buffs, Romance lovers anyone who likes to read will find something to love in this book. If you like the concepts of Old english lit or history you have touches of the Romans, the Picts, ancient Spanish and Germanic tribes and small religous touchs easily parraleled into many of our modern cultures.The ideal of the heroines lifestyle is appealing to many, she is known as an anguisette AKA masochist of sort but it is done so beautifully and sensual it is not in the least bit off turning or crude. The ideas of her culture are to &quot;Love as thou Wilt&quot; and love is, as always the bottom line of any beautiful story. This one is no different. I hope to read more of Carey's works and hope that they all remain as well done and beautiful as this triology has turned to be."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was skeptical at first, thinking this was purely a smut novel like so many fantasy authors have begun to write (ahem, LKH); however, I was amazed to find myself engrossed in the world Carey created. A true epic, the novel extends over a period of time that allows us to watch Phedre grow from a confused child into a skilled and intelligent adult. Carey created a world similiar enough to reality that the reader doesn't get completely lost when the characters travel from one land to the next, but the cultures of each place visited are very new, rich, and well thought-out. The book portrays characters with real depth, including a villian that is the definition of Machiavellian. This is the first fantasy novel I've read that completely turned me on to alternate worlds and histories. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to escape reality for a few days."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book. My friend recommended it to me, and I was a little hesitant. However, once I actaully started to read it, I really liked got drawn into it. I like how the politics were used in the story, because, truely, it is the main plot. It is all about politics. My one complaint was that there were so many important and semi-important people in the book. And normally I don't have a problem with this, but some of their names are very similar, and I kept getting confused. Also, minor charactures, suddenly become important several hundred pages later. And unlike some author's, Carey doesn't keep re-stating the same information about the same person over and over. Which I must say is a fresh breath of air. I also like have the people actaully develope through out the story, and aren't just the same through the whole book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am desperately in love with this book. It is intoxicating, intriguing, and intricate. The plot involves sometimes very confusing political and social twists and turns. It is certainly not an easy read, nor one that you can put away or return to the library as soon as you're finished. Kushiel's Dart requires going back and rereading sections for the simple reason that the characters cling to you. Phedre and her companions might very well be the most wonderful and flawed I've ever experienced. The book constantly wrenches a new set of emotions from the reader. It is long, yes, but certainly not tedious. It is extremely confusing, but keep going and you'll figure it out. And, though some may rail against the sensuality, Kushiel's Dart is a novel of faith and love."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Carey did an excellent job in Kushiel's Dart. The reader really comes to see the world from Phedre's perspective. I am an avid reader and just pour through this genre; however, the world of Terre d'Ange is simply captivating, while the characterizations are nothing short of marvelous. I find it wonderful that a strong female character has been used in this book, in that this book really breaks the barriers of sexuallity for women. Kusiel's Dart never once makes the fact that Phedre is a courtesean a debasing fact, rather a liberating reality. Indeed, it seems that I felt every emotion and sensation that Phedre felt from arousal to cold to hunger and to, most importantly, pain. One must be advised that this book is not for the faint of heat, while many would term Kushiel's Dart in many instances sexually explict. The book also has many instances of graphic violence of a carnal nature as well as more generalized war-type violence and on occaison, torture. The brave will definitely want to read this book, though for the plethora of sensations and feelings that it allows the reader to vicariously partake."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am constantly reading, but it has been a while since I have truly gotten in to a book. I picked up Kushiel's Dart in a book store one day before going in to work. I read the first few lines and knew that I had to have it. I went without dinner that night because I had to use my dinner money to pay for the book. I don't regret it in the least.Although the lenghthy list of characters and houses in the first few pages seems incredibly daunting, especially to one who occasionally has trouble keeping track of relations, you are gradually able to connect everyone and their positions as the story unfolds to Phedre. It was an exellently written and and conceived story idea. I absolutely loved the intricacies of the plot line and the use of the melding of different religions and mythologies to create one society. I enjoyed this book more than any other I've read in a long time. I can't wait to see how it all ends."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was hooked from the first paragraph, which is not an easy thing to do. I'm actually considering buying the second book in hardback, I am so impatient to read the next story.Phedre is an intelligent, sexy, sensual woman, who finds herself used by her mentor, Anafael to learn more about plots against the throne of her world. After several traumatic events, she must use all her wits to save herself and her bodyguard Josselin from slavery, then from being branded traitors and murderers. How she succeeds and yet fails at the same time is the heart of this wonderful story.It is epic in its setting, tale, and delivery. I found myself comparing this book favorably to several by my favorite authors. I can confidently say if you're looking for the dark sexiness of Anne Bishop's Jewels series and the epic political plotting of any of Melanie Rawn's works, you'll LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up Kushiel's Dart in the bookstore one day and flipped it open to a sex scene that made me . . . decide not to buy it. A few months later I learned that the book won the Locus Award for Best First Novel. That got my attention. So I got Kushiel's Dart (at my library) and was very pleasantly surprised. Not by the BDSM scenes (if you don't know what BDSM is, ask someone to spank you), but by the excellent writing style -- it is much superior to a lot of what I pick up in the fantasy aisle. What a pleasure to read! No clunky phrasing or bad mechanics. No fluff. She doesn't tell me what I'm supposed to be thinking and she doesn't over-explain. It was extremely well-written, especially for a first novel. The first few paragraphs had me hooked:\\"Lest anyone should suppose that I am a cuckoo's child, got on the wrong side of the blanket by lusty peasant stock and sold into indenture in a shortfallen season, I may say that I am House-born and reared in the Night Court proper, for all the good it did me. It is hard for me to resent my parents, although I envy them their navet&eacute;. No one even told them, when I was born, that they gifted me with an ill-luck name. Ph&egrave;dre, they called me, neither one knowing that it is a Hellene name, and cursed.When I was born, I daresay they still had reason for hope. My eyes, scarce open, were yet of indeterminate color, and the appearance of a newborn babe is a fluid thing, changing from week to week. Blonde wisps may give way to curls of jet, the pallor of birth deepen to a richness like amber, and so on. But when my series of amniotic sea-changes were done, the thing was obvious. I was flawed.\\"BRAVO! Beautiful! As you see, Ms. Carey writes in the first person, and it was mostly effective here. However, occasionally I felt as though I didn't understand Ph&eacute;dre as well as I understood some of the other characters -- maybe I just couldn't relate. But I fell in love with Joscelin (she did a great job with him), and she's got some very appealing villains, too (I love very appealing villians -- is that so wrong?). Her plots move along at just the right pace for me. Her world is complex, but not as highly textured as Kate Elliott's, which is so complex that it moves (as my grandmother, who's from Alabama, says) like molasses in January.Besides the BDSM and bisexuality, Ph&eacute;dre's religious beliefs may be an obstacle for some readers. As a Christian, I would rather read about completely made up gods and religions (since we're in a fantasy world, right?) than bastardized (literally) Christianity. Her version made me uncomfortable. But, I'm willing to overlook that because her characters are so compelling and the writing is so beautiful."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A good adventure/fantasy read from Jacqueline Carey.I've decided to do a review of all three \\"Kushiel\\" books,(that being \\"Kushiel's Dart', \\"Kushiel's Chosen\\" and \\"Kushiel's Avatar\\") as one review; all three books are connected with the same ongoing story line, quality of prose and a consistent level of interest and intrigue.This is a story of Phedre, a heroine who is blessed (or cursed, depending on your point of view) with some special talents and skills; she rises from obscure beginnings to queens' favorite over the course of the three novels.The books were well written and gripped one's interest from early on. There is travel, love, betrayals, unexpected enemies and friends, and a few situations where magical qualities are displayed; but my favorite scenes were those of the battles and escapes. You should also be aware that there are some very intense, sexually explicit encounters in these books.All in all, I enjoyed this trilogy very much; while not deep or philosophical it was easy to read and found myself looking forward to finding time to return to these books when the opportunity arose. The only negative, (and this is purely a subjective, personal opinion) was that I found the areas involving travel within the book a little long and dragged out; but this is a minor complaint compared to the overall quality of the entire trilogy. 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey's \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is set in fictional Terre d'Ange, populated by a race descended from the Son of God. That's an interesting concept in itself. But the conceit this book turns upon is its protagonist, Phedre no Delaunay, a young woman born with a scarlet mote in her eye--\\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" a mark designating her as one who experiences pain as pleasure.Before you think this book is soft-core S&M; porn, consider the editorial praise Carey has earned. They don't hand that out for Gor-like novels.\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" opens with a phrase that was either lifted from Mary Renault's \\"The Persian Boy\\" or a deliberate homage to it. But it works in drawing you into this story that is easy to predict but delightful to read. Phedre is sold into slavery in childhood, only to be redeemed by her strange imperfection; taught the erotic arts and educated, she is unleashed on several political figures as a player in a game of intrigue that touches on Terre d'Ange's royal line. Of course, she soon runs up against Melisandre Shahrizai, a major if shadowy player on the political stage. Melisandre gets Phedre exiled and sold into slavery to the enemy Skaldi, whose leaders plan to take Terre d'Ange for their own.Although the book is written along familiar lines, the writing is paced quickly enough to keep you reading, and the characters are likable. One of Carey's strengths is that she never loses her narrator's \\"voice\\" in anachronisms, be they idioms, metaphors, or syntactical structures. Her villain Melisandre just skirts the edge of excess, but exudes a charm and charisma when she's on the page. Phedre's uncertainty and regretfulness are annoying at times, but at least she never drops into mawkish sentiment. And Carey's dialogue is quite eloquent, a cut above most romantic fantasy where the characters usually express themselves in Hallmark-ian language.It's always good to see fantasy go in a direction that's not all about elves, dragons, and McGuffins. For this and for the book's other qualities, I heartily recommend \\"Kushiel's Dart.\\" It's as familiar, and enchanting, as a fairytale."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading the summary at the back cover, I decided to buy it. From the first page I was hooked. Not a boring moment despite the political intrigues and the building up of the alternate world, Terre D'Ange (situated about France nowadays). The culture society is described well, given little by little along the way, not in a full history lesson, except for explaining the religion foundation of The Blessed Elua and His Companions. The story about who was Elua itself is a new thing for me and close related with crucifixion tale.Against the strong religion and political background, Phaedr&eacute;, a whore's unwanted get, adopted by Anafiel Delaunay and raised as the rarest scion of Kushiel, in other word, an anguisette, the right hand of the Punisher Angel and also as a spy. In the end of her lessons, she found herself in the mist of political turmoil, with the Princes of Blood trying to take the throne from a very old King and his young granddaughter by way of marriage or force.Who was Anafiel? Why was he so interested in political game and using Phaedre and Alcuin, his other student, both as pawn and spy? Befriended from childhood by Hyacinthe, a Tsingano boy who could see the future, Phaedre tried to find out the truth which only made her rue the day she found it out.Spiced with 'chaste' romantic relationship between Phaedre and a Cassiline brother (though I'm sure will develop in the next book), this dark romance novel is a hard-put to be put down. A sensually engrossing story."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Warning: If you're a single girl and, erm, frustrated, take heed. This book is quite explicit. Amazingly, I didn't feel like I was reading Penthouse Letters. Carey words these scenes in a very poetic way, but, well, they're still explicit.That aside, this isn't your usual fantasy novel. There's no dragons, or anything really magical (well, at least in the first book). It is filled with, however, political intrigue, romance, and even a smattering of biblical and European history.We follow Phedre from being really nothing to working her way up the societal latter. She's got the mark of Kushiel, which basically means she likes pain. Really likes it. As a courtesan, this makes her particularly special, and people pay a lot of money for someone who likes to be beaten. Thats the blunt way of describing it, but Carey makes this interesting trait sound much more romantic.I don't need to give you a synopsis, since those are already available to you, but I can give you my opinion. This trilogy is amazing. You will fall in love with the characters (in fact, a friend of mine would just love to name her first-born after Phedre's love interest, because he's simply that amazing), and the plot is filled with adventure.I used to only recommend this book to girls, simply because of its explicit nature, but suprise, a lot of men enjoy this too. You don't have to be a fantasy fan to read this, honestly. Just try it- you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is an astonishing debut fantasy. Jacqueline Cary matches Robert Jordan and Tad Williams in sheer number of pages and characters, and a political by-play to equal Melanie Rawn's Exile's series (who also has a lot of pages). She also isn't the first to jazz up fantasy with erotic episodes (for that, read Jean M. Auel who also writes lots of pages).And on top of it all, Carey displays tremendous originality - a world loosely based on old age France, the Roman empire and the barbaric northern races, but layered with its own history, philosophy, mysticism and love of ... well, love.Our heroine, Phedre no Delaunay, is a high class courtesan, trained to be a spy by Terre D'Ange's most respected \\"spider\\" (spy master), Anafiel. Phedre and her counterpart, Alcuin, are played by Anafiel as pawns. Using their skills as \\"entertainers\\" they accept assignations from patrons influential among elite society to uncover elements of a plot unknown to anyone but the spy master.Whereas Alcuin is every woman's (or man's) dream come true of sweet, pure, innocent love, Phedre is cursed to be a masochist who can only find pleasure in pain. Her patrons are somewhat more obscure than Alcuins, but between them they unwittingly uncover elements of a plot that fit together neatly as a game of chess - all the more dangerous to the spies, as one of Anafiel's counterparts, Melisande, begins to move her pieces.All of these elements set the stage for what could be a truly stunning piece of fantasy writing. Nevertheless, something is lacking. The elements are there, but the sum does not equal to all of the parts. And it is difficult to pinpoint just exactly what the problem is.Perhaps the lack is due to the somewhat limiting perspective of the heroine's first person point of view and her lackadaisical story telling. Readers follow Phedre's story, and it takes some time for all pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. And yet, even when they do, the revelations do not appear that original or extraordinary. They don't even seem to be so unusual to Phedre, judging from her tone of voice.Phedre's life and world are undoubtedly different, and have a certain mystic appeal. Yet, the elements don't seem to flow. The reality of Phedre's life jars with the reality of her surrounding world, giving the book something of the surreal. The reader cannot quite dispense belief properly.It appears to me that in searching for the holy grail of fantasy books Carey has tried to implement too many unusuals, and the outcome is a court jester's apparel rather than a magic carpet."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This ambitious novel blends the erotic and sadomasochistic with a tale of political intrigue and for the most part handles all three well. Carey's imaginary world is well thought out and amazingly complex, filled with intricately described plots and settings, a feature common to many fantasy novels published today. The religion of Elua, who preaches \\"love as thou wilt,\\" provides an interesting view of sexual morality that makes Ph&egrave;dre's occupation as a courtesan seem a natural part of her world.Courtesan here, of course, is another word for sex slave, which despite all the rationalizations provided, Ph&egrave;dre quite clearly is for most of the book, whether in the cultured world of Terre d'Ange or as a captive in the hands of her enemies. That she enjoys pain is an interesting idea that brings to mind Anne Rice's \\"Beauty\\" Trilogy or Pauline Reage's \\"The Story of O.\\" As a feature of Ph&egrave;dre's character this would be interesting to explore further, but it is decidedly a secondary feature of the plot.There are two reasons this book rates four stars rather than five. First, it is so complex that the political machinations are nearly impossible to follow; Carey's skill as a writer makes it an enjoyable read nonetheless, but to be honest I was lost as to who was who and what they were doing almost from the beginning. A second and more serious flaw is the book's length. At 901 pages it tries too hard to do too much, and the ending, by the time you get there, is so long and drawn out that it becomes anticlimactic. I was left wondering if this wasn't a marketing ploy, with the idea that people would be more likely to buy a thick fantasy novel than a thin one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"How to review this book? It has something for everyone. There is a great storyline, based on an alternate reality Europe, with enough of real history thrown in, to keep you trying to guess at the final outcome. The writing is elegant and baroque. The plot, has been well described by others; no need to delve into it.Phedre, our heroine, is a servant of Naamah, or in other word a sacred prostitute, indentured into the service of a nobleman, who is half spy, half poet. From this unauspicious beginnings, she will go on to become a heroine of her land.There has been meticulous research done, in the writing of this book. The language of the Tsingani (The gypsies) does approach the Romani that real gypsies speak, and the Habiru (Hebrew) that the Yeshuites (the Jews have accepted Jesus (Yeshua) as their Messiah in the story, go figure) is indeed Hebrew.There is erotica and S&M; in the story, but it is unobtrusive, and should not offend anyone, unless he is a real prude. Ms. Carey smartly uses French terms for some of the erotic terms, such as \\"languisement\\" and this, not only keeps it exotic, but probably prevents some of the more easily offended readers from taking real offense.The cultural research is accurate, the plot moves along, and I felt drawn into it from the beginning. The large number of characters, and the complex relations between them do not pose a problem; there is a dramatis personae at the beggining which is helpful, if you get lost.If you like high fiction, you will love this. If you are looking for an erotic kick, this is not for you.I would not recommend this book for anyone under 15-16 though. (18 if you are really conservative)There are some homosexual scenes in the story, elegantly related, and non-explicit, but be warned."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I cannot compete with the lengthy review already posted for this novel. I just want to tell you I picked up this novel on Wednesday and could not put it down.Phedre is a very compelling character. Despite her bizarre gift that makes pain one with pleasure and her consequent role as an exotic plaything, the reader empathises with Phedre. The author cunningly sets up Phedre's world to make it perfectly clear an adept of the Night Court is not the same as a prostitute and so sidesteps the reader's automatic stereotype of Phedre as unclean.The only negative thing I would say about this novel is about the excessive use of foreshadowing at the beginning of the novel. I found it quite annoying and distracting. This novel chronicles the maturation of Phedre. At the beginning she is a child, but I did not hear the voice of a child. The narrative voice of Phedre the adult gets mixed in and quite negates the impression I am sure I was meant to have of the headstrong young woman eager to try her new skills or the awed little girl at her first Midwinter Mask. It would have been much more poignant if all the foreshadowing had been left out. I would have been drawn into Phedre's world from the onset instead of waiting until Delauney's death to become fully immersed in her world. I would have better appreciated the scale of the gilded trap created by all of the political intrigue. This is why I give it four stars.I look forward to picking up the next one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love it! When I started to read I it didn't want to put it down because it just captured my complete attention. With it being in first person it feels as if you are the character and not just the reader sitting in the comfort of your own home.Phedre, the unlikely herione of the book, is Night-Court trained until she is ten. She is then sold into servitude with Delauney who teaches her (along with another student, Alcun)languages, intrigue, the arts of passion, and most impotantly who to listen, analyze, and remember. The levels of intrigues are so in-depth that I had to reread someparts to understand it.A great novel, and hard to believe first! Miss Carey did a wonderful job!A definate read!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"while this book starts out with names and titles that are initially difficult to remember, you start to learn and love the characters; their tragedies are your tragedies. The plot of the book is deliciously twisted, and leaves you breathless. The main character, Phedre, is dark yet innocently sexy. The plot of the story is not like the repetitive stuff churned out in mass, it is different in that the hero, or more triumphantly, heroine defeats the bad guy using not strength or magic but the gift of her sexuality and knowlege instilled in her. She is obviously sexy, but thankfully she is intelligent. She is not perfect, in truth her flaws are shining marks that make her human."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"First, the bad news: I had a hard time slogging through the first hundred pages or so that describe the history, setting, and character backstory (which didn't see enough payoff later). If an author is going to go into that much detail about fantasy brothels, I expect them to feature prominently throughout the book, but they don't. They disappear and instead, the heroine becomes apprentice to a spymaster. Once I got past that unexpected twist, I was still slightly bored for the next hundred and fifty pages as the heroine completes her apprenticeship. It's okay, but not that compelling.Now for the good news: once the heroine is forced to go on the run (around page 250, IIRC), the story takes off like a rocket! From that point on, the author delivers a wonderful, epic romantic fantasy adventure for the 650 or so remaining pages that serves as a sort of travelogue for the kingdom and its closest neighbors. The setting is a stand-in for medieval Europe with the serial numbers filed off (concentrating mostly on fantasy versions of France and England), but that made it easier to relate to, much like Joe Abercrombie'sThe Blade Itself (The First Law: Book One)and Robert E. Howard'sThe Coming of Conan the Cimmerian: The Original Adventures of the Greatest Sword and Sorcery Hero of All Time!. I also liked how there weren't a bunch of stupid orcs and elves and wizards like so many fantasy novels have; just humans with the high fantasy, magical elements kept to a minimum. This makes for a grittier story and the kind of fantasy I prefer.However, one thing that struck me strange was despite the fact that the heroine is some kind of magical BDSM prostitute who can endure incredible amounts of torture without batting an eye, the book does very little to deliver on that in an erotic context. Frankly, I expected something much more BDSM along the lines of John Norman'sTarnsman of Goror Sharon Green'sThe Crystals of Mida: Jalav - Amazon Warrior #1, so I was a bit disappointed when it became clear the author was not going to deal much with that element. Seemed kind of weird to me, though I suppose that choice did make it more mainstream . . . but then why have that character as the heroine? It didn't really make sense to me, except to have the most unlikely heroine possible save the world.Flaws aside, Kushiel's Dart is still a great fantasy that could have been dang near-perfect had it not taken so long to get the epic part of the adventure started."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"While this book might not be for everyone due to the BDSM eroticism, it is superbly written. The geography and cultures consist of both fantasy and historical elements blended very well. Clearly the author has traveled and researched.For anyone interested in historical fantasy not afraid of sexual elements, I strongly recommend this book.Also, I would have to add that the author uses suggestion more often than graphic representation on the sexuality end, which I feel is a much better way to approach the issue."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is very different from anything I've ever read before. It's a book that is at once enthralling yet overwhelming to the point that I think that I only understand the over-all big picture of the plot but the details have completely lost me. This is the story of Phedre no Delaunay, the first anguisette to be born in the blessed land of Terre D'Ange in nearly three generations. This is an epic story about a woman who started life as a \\"[prostitute's] unwanted get\\" and became something more than she ever imagined.Carey has crafted a world that is so detailed that you could almost reach out and touch it. It found the descriptions of the lavish excesses of Night Court and the D'Angeline nobility absolutely riveting and the religion of Blessed Elua facinating. The politics add a lot of depth to the world, but it is so complex that it is also very hard to follow. From the beginning to the end, there are a ton of details to keep up with, about the internal working of Terre D'Ange and the surrounding countries.See, Phedre is a Servant of Naamah, who pimped herself out to save Blessed Elua's bacon, making prostitution a holy act. But she's also been pricked by Kushiel's Dart, the scarlet mark in her eye. Kushiel is Elua's angelic companion who inflicts pain on sinners. As such, Phedre finds pleasure in pain. Phedre is made the bond-servant of Lord Anafiel Delaunay because her particular skills may help him in his political intrigues by gathering information from his rivals and enemies. However, Phedre learns to much and becomes enbroiled in a fight to save her Queen's throne from a cunning traitor, her country from a barbarian army, and her own life.Much has been made about the sex because of the BDSM and homosexual elements, but that this is an overrated aspect of the book. Phedre describes her early assignations in detail, but it's too clinical to qualify as erotica, which is fine since my limited experience with such is to find them hilariously stupid. It seemed like Carey was going for shock-value first and formost becuase as the book gets past page three hundred, Phedre starts to slam the bedroom door in the reader's face. Even the tender, emotional sex scenes and their aftermath are only mentioned in passing.One thing I found very jarring was the Master of the Straights subplot. Up until that part of the book, the world of Terre D'Ange had no fantastical elements or magical beings and such. Then all of a sudden this aquatic super-being just shows up. Very out of place considering that everything that happens before and after is realistic.Overall, I really liked Kushiel's Dart and plan to read the others in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This was truly a great book. However, I have specific reasons for giving it four stars instead of five.The bad:The complicated names, combined with the deeply woven political plot is a really bad combination. The plot would not have been so hard to decipher if the names were not so complex. Besides for complex names, each person has about three different names they are referred too. This causes a gigantic stumbling block that trips you over as you try to sail smoothly through the story. Constantly, I had to go back and look at the name chart at the beginning of the book to understand what was going on, and even that took awhile.2 - There were segments of boredom, the first 250 pages is a real drag, I had to push myself through these pages in hopes the book would get better, fortunately it did.3 - The last three hundred pages could have been told within the span of 100-150 really. Pages 600-900 was a forced read.The Good:Besides all that I have stated above, Jacqueline Carey's prose is beautiful, and underneath the beautiful prose lies an AWSOME storyline, and an AWSOME protagonist. Also, the setting is so perfectly clear, the images are vivid and dance in your head. Thus, you have a solid storyline and great prose, I do not regret buying this book at all, and I will read it again someday."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Just finished this book and though it's been a while since I've read fantasy, (though this is borderline fantasy), it reminded me how much fun this genre can be.I must admit that when I started it, I felt a little intimidated when I discovered the pages and pages of character profiles. LOTS of characters. But, you end up grateful for all those profiles and really get to care about most of them.The plot is very intricate and unpredictable. I loved it!At the beginning, there is a sharp learning curve to absorb all the history and politics but it's well worth it. Oh yeah...and the S&amp;M element is interesting, too!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first volume of a trilogy, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is an epic example of world-building fantasy at its best. Loosely based on European Renaissance culture with an admixture of an unusual religious mythology, Carey's world is one of highly paid courtesans, powerful nobles, and deep intrigue. The heroine, Phaedre, is a courtesan, a spy for her master, and eventually a political player in her own right. The narrative alternates between the intricacies of court politics and rousing action. Carey's characters are complex and well fleshed-out.What makes \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" unique is that Phaedre is a sexual masochist who hires herself out to clients with very special and perverse tastes. In the hands of a lesser author, the sex scenes might be merely prurient. In Carey's, however, they are neither overdone nor gratuitous; rather, they are an integral part of the plot. Phaedre is who she is--a women for whom sexual pleasure involves physical torture-- because she has been marked by a god. Within the world of the story, that is neither good nor bad (although it does cause complications in her love life)--it just is. Phaedre's unusual nature puts her in a prime a position to observe the political intrigue going on around her.\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is an engrossing book and much better than most of today's fantasy series. Its thickly-textured and complex narrative provides a great way to while away the day. And yeah, the second volume is just as good."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am a lover of fantasy and an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction alike. About this book, all I can say is:OhMyGoodness!The other reviews will give you a sense of the book. I would agree that the first 100 or so pages in this book was a wee bit tedious to get through, but Ms. Carey is laying the foundation for an amazing trilogy, so the reading time is WELL worth it.Ms. Carey's inner world must be phenomenal to give birth to such a story. And I can only begin to imagine the joys and difficulties that writing such a trilogy would offer the writer.So - on behalf of fantasy lovers everywhere - thank you, Ms. Carey for bringing forth this trilogy"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey's debut into fiction with Kushiel's Dart puts her on top in fantasy writing. Carey's characters are unique, inventive, and very believable. The world in which her novel takes place, an old world- fictional- Europe, has an engaging culture and an amazing religion that is based on Judeo-Christian traditions and Carey's own creative mind. An absolutely original heroine completes the fabric of wonderful tale. This is one of my favorite books, and defiantly worth reading."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is an amazing book. The sheer imagination required to come up with the world in which the main character, Phaedre, inhabits is simply mindboggling (check out the details as written by professional reviewers). Ms. Carey writes with a skill I've rarely come across in this genre. The depth and breadth of her story which spans three books, ingnites a compulsion to read all three in one fell swoop. What I like best is the very humanity of the characters. The good guys have flaws and the villians have their sympathetic moments. Most important, I never once went &quot;Oh riiiggghht, like THAT could happen&quot;, even though the most fantastic things do happen. Ms. Carey manages to infuse realism into every situation. I'm heartbroken that the series appears to be finished. I could do with more of Phaedre's adventures. Read these books!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love this book because it brings such intelligence, depth, and intrigue to the art of the courtesan. I love it because it is more of what you want historical chick fiction for. I love to travel vicariously and the novel's heroine is all about travel. The cast of characters is totally entertaining. It's not for everyone...but if you like adult fiction, it's a great long ride."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Things I liked about this book: epic world-building, some beautiful and insightful lines of prose, and a portrayal of the life of a masochist that makes them understandable and human to me. I felt for the main characters, and cared what happened to them. The political scene was believable and interesting.Things I didn't like about this book: heavy-handed foreshadowing, unnessesary archiac and french-like words, too much &#34;telling&#34; and not enough action. It was too long - especially the first third, which was slow. This book would be better at about 70% of its current length. Also, does this world not have any form of birth control? If not, why doesn't Phedre have 10 kids? I also would have liked to have read about other sado-masochist relationships in Valerian House, so I could see what exactly was so rare and different about an anguissette."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Thanks for a great book. Does great to find obscure books. This is a great series. Bought the set and love them. Great author!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book! It took a little to get into, the world building is quite intricate and quite a few different characters to remember. However this would have to be the best fantasy book I have read in ages. If you like epic fantasy with some naughty romance you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The starter to one of my favorite fantasy series. Carey dispenses with a lot of the normal fantasy tropes for \\"what is a hero\\" and develops a very interesting, very different protagonist. Phedre uses her sexuality as a weapon instead of a sword. The world is also very developed right down to minute little details.Having reread this again recently, I'd say the only real negatives are that the author is sometimes heavy-handed on exposition (this bothered me more a second time through) and the language may be too flowery for some. Also the sex...not that it is bad, but some people probably want more of it. lol!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Another book club pick, this one was a gentle foray into the world of BDSM. Yes, you read that right. No, it's not graphic at all. It's probably the most gentle BDSM ever. Mostly it's an epic fantasy complete with army battles, political court intrigue, and oh yeah, a religion based on sex. Yes, there are some sexy scenes but they don't go into a lot of detail. I've seen and heard worse on HBO.I had a hard time reading this one. At first, it took me awhile to get used to the voice. The language is rich, lush, and a bit flowery. The narrater is the main character Phedre, and the story is told as though she's writing a journal. I got used to it fairly quickly though, and by the end of the book I couldn't imagine it any other way because it simply was Phedre's voice.I didn't like the politics when it was just a list of names and happenings. There was a lot of backstory and world building at the beginning, and I just couldn't wrap my brain around all the name dumping. I started skimming the long paragraphs and stopping for the dialogue. The dialogue indicated something was actually happening with the main characters, and those bits were interesting. Then it would go back to court intrigue in the year dot, and who slept with who and did what, and my eyes blurred. I was about to give up when I asked others why I should keep reading. They told me \\"it gets really good about 40% of the way in.\\"That's a long time to wait for something to get good. Especially with a book this long.However, I toughed it out. Why? Because I really did like the main characters. I wanted to know what happened to them. I just didn't care about the history behind it. I don't even like learning about my own history, much less anyone else's. So I persevered, and continued skimming.And then it started to get juicy. There was murder, intrigue, accusations on all sides, some sex of course, a kidnapping, barbarians and slavery. And all of it happening to the main characters. Finally we were out of the history lesson and on to the good stuff! They were right, it really does get better about 40% of the way in (if you read on a Kindle). I stopped skimming and started hanging on every word until the battle scenes, which I also skipped because that's just not my thing.First Line: \\"Lest anyone should suppose that I am a cuckoo's child, got on the wrong side of the blanket by lusty peasant stock and sold into indenture in a shortfallen season, I may say that I am House-born and reared in the Night Court proper, for all the good it did me.It is hard for me to resent my parents, although I envy them their naivete. No one even told them, when I was born, that they gifted me with an ill-luck name. Phedre, they called me, neither one knowing that it is a Hellene name, and cursed.\\"I think this gives the flavor for the language of the entire book, and it's a stumbling block for some. But for me it helped build the world, and Phedre's character along with it. The first line did draw me in, because I wanted to know exactly what the Night Court was.I enjoyed the world she created, which seemed to blend a lot of Christian, Muslim and other religions along with a good bit of Greek mythology. I liked the basic story. I found the idea of the religion they follow fascinating. Sex is a holy, serious thing that is meant to be enjoyed any way you like, no stigma attached. Those who practice the \\"art\\" are revered and respected, for the most part. It's refreshing to see a world like that.For those who like Game of Thrones, this has a lot of the same epic feel, especially during the battle scenes. Armies are moving and aligning, war is waged, power changes hands. And through it all, court intrigue. If that's your kind of thing you'll probably like this.If it's not, skip over the bits that bore you and hang on for the good bits. They are worth the wait."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 9/10PROS:- The world-building is incredible, with a mythology that has parallels to those of various existing belief systems but is unique overall, and the plot is intricate and fast-paced, even during phases when Ph&egrave;dre spends her time in seemingly idle study and extended periods of time are passing.- Carey's descriptive language is varied and beautiful, bringing to life both magnificent and horrifying settings in equal splendor. This is one of the first descriptions that caught my attention: \\"The adepts of Cereus House followed them, a white-and-silver fantasia of creatures and wintery spirits; I lost count, with the froths of silk and gossamer and silver piping, horned and hooded and masked.\\"- I've read quite a few books that contain characters with masochistic tendencies, and this is the best I've encountered at describing the physical melding of pleasure and pain as well as the psychological longing for the release brought about by that pain.- The number of three-dimensional characters here is astonishing. Even those who play only minor roles in the story have well-formed backgrounds and intricate personalities with complex motivations for their actions. Ph&egrave;dre is as strong and admirable a female character as any I have ever seen portrayed, and the other primary characters--both friend and foe--are worthy of their positions across from and alongside of her.CON:- There are so many characters and place names, many of which have a foreign sound and are thus difficult to distinguish from one another, that I had to consult the map and the list of \\"dramatis personae\\" at the start of the book a great many times to keep them all even remotely straight in my head. In some instances, this task became quite onerous given how many characters are mentioned in such quick succession. (Here's an example: \\"His blood-father had been among them, slain at the hands of the Tarbh Cr&oacute;. Maelcon's mother, Foclaidha, was of the Brugantii, who followed the Red Bull; it was her kin who came, overrunning Bryn Gorrydum, starting the bloodbath.\\")Overall comments: This is an excellent choice for fans of fantasy romance. The characters are well-formed, the plot is gripping, and the writing is good. It may not be for everyone, with its descriptions that detail Ph&egrave;dre's love of erotic pain, but I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Summary: Ph&egrave;dre's parents gave her away to the service of Naamah when she was just a child. Along with a home full of other children, she will be taught the arts of sexual pleasure until she reaches maturity at the age of 16 yrs old. At that time, her virginity will be sold to the highest bidder and she will be an indentured sexual servant until she has earned enough money to pay off her marque and be a free woman. In the land of Terre d'Ange, this is a common practice. They live by the precept \\"Love as thou wilt.\\" It is considered a great honor to serve Naamah, and Ph&egrave;dre is looking forward to her future.Her path changes when a mysterious man named Anafiel Delaunay purchases her indenture to take her on as a student and foster child. From this point forward, she is known as Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delaunay. Anafiel recognizes the blood red spot in her eye as Kushiel's Dart, a legendary physical brand that no living person has seen in their lifetimes. Kushiel is one of the original fallen angels to wander the Earth, and his mark on Ph&egrave;dre indicates that her sexual appetites and talents will be extraordinarily unique. Ph&egrave;dre's greatest pleasure will be achieved with physical pain and mental torture.Delauney's intentions are not to use his two apprentices for something has mundane as profit. Ph&egrave;dre and her foster brother Alcuin are being trained to spy on the nobility they will be servicing. Their skills in strategy, observation, and analysis are being honed to perfection. Their education and linguistics rivals that of scholars.When the two apprentices finally begin their service, neither is quite clear about what Delauney is looking for in the information they are bringing back to him. But they do discover quickly that there are many secret meetings and alliances going on behind closed doors. It seems that the failing health of the current King is drawing the attention of those who would like to take the throne. When people begin to take sides, violence comes to their beautiful city. Delauney will take no risks with Ph&egrave;dre's safety, so he makes arrangements for a Cassiline Guard named Joscelin to be her constant companion.When Delauney is betrayed, Ph&egrave;dre and Joscelin are kidnapped and sold to a warlord from another country. Their situation is dire, but their focus is as much on the future of their beloved country as it is on their own situation. They have finally unraveled the plot against the throne, as well as the identity of the traitors. They must find a way back to Terre d'Ange to save their country from an imminent demise. This begins the journey of a lifetime.Review: I had moments when I both loved and hated the predominant element of this story: Ph&egrave;dre's destiny to be a sadomasochistic servant of Naamah. In layman's terms, she is a prostitute. On one hand, I thought it was really interesting and unique to feature such a person as the protagonist in a fantasy novel. This kind of originality is one of the first things that die-hard fantasy fans look for in their favorite series. Ph&egrave;dre's profession is the reason she has access to the people who create the story's conflicts. And, because she is the only person in this service who has been marked by Kushiels's Dart, she is revered in a way that allows her to both influence people, and be in a position to manipulate those whom she would bend to her wishes.On the other hand, it's risky to use this profession as the thread that ties all of the characters and plotlines together because there are so many cliches and stereotypes revolving around this role in any society. Yes, the author goes out of her way to make Ph&egrave;dre something different: the passion she can only experience with pain, the vast amount of education, culture, strategy and cunning she learns from Delaunay, her acceptance among the nobility, and her unabashed love of and craving for her job. But when you are using \\"the world's oldest profession\\" as the story's catalyst, it is not enough to make Ph&egrave;dre a unique character - her actions need to be just as unique. After all, to stand out in the land of Terre d'Ange, where prostitution is considered a sacred service, she can't just stand out against the general public, she has to be unique compared every other prostitute as well. This is where the author made a few blunders.Although it was predictable, I didn't mind that Ph&egrave;dre's life was spared on occasion for the sole reason that her enemies were simply too curious to pass by an opportunity to experience her talents. She was considered a treasure of sorts, and even the most evil villains will want to acquire a few treasures. The story fell short in a few scenes where Ph&egrave;dre's behavior was vapid and unimaginative. Why give this woman the education and training of a world class espionage agent if she is going to choose to solve her problems with a roll in the sack? Sometimes it was just too easy. I was very disappointed when these scenes occurred because it was so contrary to how her character was developed. Her power didn't come from giving her body away, it come from the lascivious anticipation and greed she elicited in people. It is human nature to want what we don't have more than we want what we have.Aside from these few disappointing scenes, I enjoyed the rest of the book. The supporting cast of characters was phenomenal. Delaunay had a fascinating history that probably could have been a book by itself. And from the moment that Joscelin Verreuil was introduced to the story as Ph&egrave;dre's Cassiline bodyguard and companion, I couldn't get enough of him. He had to make some of the most difficult and life-changing choices throughout the book, and I loved that he followed his own mind and heart rather than following the rules. There were other characters who were introduced so mildly that I was caught by surprise later on when their roles became pivotal to the plot.In spite of the fact that sexuality was such an important part of this culture, the number of graphic sexual scenes are minimal and relatively short. I would recommend this series to fans of medieval fantasy with strong female leads. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey is enchanting. Part of the reason I re-read this series is because I want to go back to the land of Terre D'Ange.

Love."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have been avoiding Jacqueline Carey's books for years for no reason I can recall except that I think I disliked the name Kushiel for some reason or other. Well, no more. This books has it all, writing, plot, action, sex (albeit not 'straight').I will not detail the plot. Suffice it to say that it was complex with a goodly number of characters. The editing was excellent as one naturally expects in a printed book. The action was fast and interesting. The sex was unusual but it was interesting so keep an open mind. The author knows the sexual activities she is writing about perhaps from her psychology major, perhaps in some other manner.The book is well worth the reading and the time. I am sorry that I waited so long to read it but I console myself with the thought of the others in the series. The book is heartily recommended.This review also appears on LibraryThing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved the first 300 pages or so of this book. I thought I'd be bored or embarrassed by all the bondage sex or whatever. actually it created a very interesting set of tensions. the quasi-historical setting hints at commentary and allegory -- it's blunt enough to be provocative, yet subtle and invigorating. the protagonist's a submissive yet assertive character in this phase.but the book later turns increasingly daft and self-indulgent. this is where my expectation about being bored or embarrassed came true -- both parts of it -- but the sex wasn't even the stuff that turned boring or embarrassing. it was everything else -- the narrative, the characters, the setting, etc. -- it all fell apart, devolving into childish stupidity, almost as if the author wrote the first half of the book when she was in grad school, but somehow time-travelled backwards and wrote the second half in junior high.I suppose it's a bit obvious to say that this book's narrative turns masturbatory towards the end, and I realize for many people that might in fact be the whole goal, but it would have been better had she kept the level of quality high from start to finish. or, if you're going to write a book which has stupid parts and smart parts, put the stupid parts in the beginning and the smart parts at the end. if she'd done that instead, it would have been more fun."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An interesting read., yet I was not blown away by the book.

The first book is Careys best. I've read them all. None of her others come close, but they try!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I generally read books that can be consumed in a few short hours. I tend to avoid anything involved, involving a language, a people, or species with which I am unfamiliar. The Kushiel series came highly recommended to me, so I purchased them years ago. I tried a few times to read Kushiel's Dart, but was unable to put the time and effort into it, and would give in easily and set it aside. I finally picked it up a couple of months ago, and determined that even if it took me a year, I would finish the book. Despite not having more time to read than the 20 minutes a day, I FINALLY made my way deep enough into this book that I understood the heart of it, and aligned myself with the characters. I was hooked, and anxious for my next few moments of stolen reading time.I cannot express enough how lovely and absorbing this book becomes, how much you'll want to walk beside Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delaunay in her journey, or watch the morning routine of Joscelin Verreuil, or witness the contagious smile of Hyacinthe.Fantasy is not my genre, but I am hooked.

Make-shift worlds are presented cogently: unlike other fantasy yarn where half the pages are scripted with invented non wiki words, here we have a world which is totally believable and accessible, and a heroine who is powerful and charismatic. Intrigue, politics, familial relationships all intertwine to create a credible thread of otherwordliness.

A couple of summers ago, I read the first book in the latest trilogy, Naamah's Kiss, and really enjoyed it. This first book in the entire series showed me that I have a lot to look forward to.Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delaunay's world is one that is both familiar and not. Carey has given us a reimagined Earth with elements that are familiar. There is a lot of known religion and mythology in her fictional religion and mythology. The countries are almost recognizable as Scandinavia and the Middle East and parts of Europe. The problem is timeless - who will rule Terre d'Ange?(As a side note, when I read Naamah's Kiss, I compared Terre d'Ange to France, but after reading this book, I thought it was more like England. Anyone else have any opinions?)Ph&egrave;dre is not your typical fantasy heroine. She is a courtesan, and an unusual one at that - her specialty is pain, and the scarlet mote in her eye makes her unique in her time. The first third or so of the book is really about her and her journey from a young child sold into indentured servitude to a young woman who has earned her freedom. Once her real quest begins (along with her companion, the religious warrior), she finds out just how much she has learned along the way, and that she'll need every last tool in her arsenal in order to survive."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"not all fantasy novels are created equal. i found this series of books to be so satisfying that i have plans to read them for the third time soon. i believe the series gets better as you go along though i admit i prefer the stories told from phaedre's point of view. the books that come later (though beautifully written) are missing the constant presence of phaedre."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am an avid reader and tend to collect books by the author.

Phedre is an unexpected yet truly gripping heroine that brings a dimension of reality to the overall epic story that takes place. Although there is an erotic element to the narrative, Carey seamlessly ties it into the storyline without hindering the main action or making the novel pornographic in nature through relating a series of unrelated sexual events. Carey successfully overturns traditional gender roles through Phedre's character and proves that: \\"That which yields is not necessarily weak\\". Beyond a doubt, an entertaining, suspenseful and beautifully written first novel. I couldn't put it down and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"So, after reading the reviews for Kushiel's Dart, I was really expecting something great. I mean, a book jam packed with eroticism, political intrigue, bondage!!!! What could make for a better book? Haha, I kid, but in all honesty I was expecting a very exciting book. Anyway, as soon as the book was purchased and in my hands, I set to reading it. What really annoyed me at first was Carey's intensely flowery prose. At the time, I didn't think it flowed very well, but after a while I got used to it and even came to quite like it. There is no doubt in that Carey is a good writer-she's amazing!-I just felt like she over did it with the wording at times.But anyway, continuing on, during the first 300 pages or so, I was thinking to myself \\"How in god's name did this book get such good reviews? IT'S SOOO BORING!!!!\\" I presumed to stick to this incredulous appeal for another 30 pages or so, but then, I realized, I was enjoying it! And as I got further and further into the book, I became crazily obsessed! I even took this book with me to a concert; I was so incapable of putting it down! Once you get to the middle, this book becomes SO addicting. Near the end, I felt the book was dragging a bit again, but it was still VERY good. This was... a fantastic read. I love, LOVE, Phedre and Joscelin's romance. Though, I must admit, Phedre annoys me at times. What is not wrong with this woman? Um... lets see. She's beautiful, supposedly to a startling would-go-to-war-for-her, worth-20,000-ducats-to-sleep-with-her degree, she's GREAT in bed, she can learn a language in like...2 days, she is super duper intelligent and a sure genius when it comes to political intrigue, everyone loves her, she's never scared (at least not very much), etc etc etc. I think it would be a lot easier to like her if I wasn't so ENVIOUS of her.Anyway, all in all, this was an AMAZING book (not to mention trilogy)!!!!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The one thing you have to understand about Carey, whether or not you can appreciate the story or relate to her characters; the woman knows how to write. Kushiel's Dart is such fun to read, so effortless, that I went back and reread it before giving it a rating. I absolutely love Carey's style, which is extremely elaborate, with a rich setting and detailed characters.I understand this book isnt for everyone and I have a few warning's for people before they pick up this book. Understand first that this book deals with highly adult material that is very explicit in parts. However, I dont see how people reading the jacket could have been surprised when reading the book. Also, Carey's main character's have what some author's tend to fall on, which is super hero syndrom. They're pretty much perfect in every way so don't expect to see the harsh realities of human nature in this novel. And finally, Carey's writing style is quite poetic, a little flouncy, tending to forshadow often, but immensley detailed. None of these detracted for me however for the book. It's fantasy and I love it to death =)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love a good epic story but Kushiel's Dart is not one of them. I had to force myself to get though the first 300 pages and then I gave up.There was no excitment and I had no interest in the main character who to me comes off as shallow and emotionless. None of the characters were interesting enough to keep me involved, a page turner it's not.I had high hopes for the book but it wasn't exciting, erotic or an adventure, everyone just seems bored and jaded. Yet I suppose if your entire life worth is based on your skills as a high priced courtesan then you're going to be jaded, but it still doesn't make you interesting."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I don't get the hype. It's wordy and flowery concoction of nothingness. Ph&egrave;dre is little more than a Mary Sue wannabe. Mary Sue (Ph&egrave;dre) does everything perfectly, says the right things, does the right things, and is in the right place at the right time at every turn of the book. The evil characters in this book fall all over themselves to get Mary Sue to bed and have a mind blowing (epiphany) orgasm, and is praised for giving them the best sex they ever had.I agree with the one brave reviewer who calls Ms. Carey on her over used flowery antiquated use of flat prose to describe a sex act, when the sex act is about BDSM. BDSM has nothing to do with romance or flowery prose.I hope the author will reimburse me not only for the 7.99 paid for the book, but for the 4 days that it took for me to read this badly written tripe."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the recommendations here on Amazon and found myself regretting the purchase almost from page one. My biggest complaint? The characters are so hopelessly flat! Real people have flaws, that's what makes them so interesting! In Kushiel's Dart, no one seems to have *real* flaws. For example, Phedre is perfect in every way - she's smart, drop dead gorgeous, everybody loves her and she's apparently irresistible in bed. Her main flaw, the thing that she struggles against? She orgasms too easily and everything turns her on, most especially pain. Wow. That's like complaining you have too much money! Yes, there is plenty of political intrigue, and there are plenty of external obstacles for her for face, but the inner struggle that takes place is just a joke.And that brings up another, very annoying thing about the book. Everybody loves Phedre. Even her enemies can't wait to hop in the sack with her. There is one scene, early on in the book, where this guy *knows* she is laying a trap, *knows* full well she will try to bait him, but he can't resist and has sex with her anyway. In the afterglow of sex, he reveals a pinnacle secret. It's so annoying how the villains are so incredibly dumb!! The arch-villainess is supposed to be this manipulative, brilliant strategist, who incidentally has a weak spot for Phedre and lets her go right when she has her in her clutches. Then after letting her go, complete with her own body guard, she assumes that she is dead because she reckoned no one could survive the cold climate.Sad to say, I read the entire book. Why? Because I actually liked the interplay between Phedre and Joscelin. I wanted to see what happened to them, but I was let down in that area as well. The romance was so anti-climatic, I nearly threw the book across the room out of disappointment.So free book to anyone who wants a slightly beaten copy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was intrigued by the idea of a fantasy novel where sadomasochism was made explicit, rather than an undercurrent, and so I read this. After all, sadism and masochism are well-known themes of fantasy. Why else lock princes in towers, or feed princesses to dragons? Kushiel's Dart began well and that, perhaps, filled me with anticipation for something wonderful. However, the pretty opening is merely an elaborate wrapping around a hollow box. There is nothing good inside. The love, where you can find it, is unconvincing and therefore the sex is less interesting than a romance novel, despite the implements of torture. The story descends from Dynastic stratagems to the tedious pursuit of plot coupons. We toil after the heroine as she achieves one task after another, without her finding any real challenges or growth. The novel reads like a mediocre role-playing log, which I suspect is where it originated. The writer even succeeeds in making erotic torture dull, which is an achievment in itself. As for the other characters, the gypsy is unconvincing, not even suceeding as a sterotype and the most interesting characters are killed off without the reader being compensated for their loss. Dull. Dry. Don't waste any precious time you have on this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is a study in elegant writing and world building. A luxurious read, it tickles the critical intellectual in all of us and tosses in the occasional licentious pleasure. Though not appropriate for young readers or for the squeamish, it's an interesting take on a fantasy story-one with a dusky atmosphere and startling twists on our basic assumptions.It's not a life-changing book. It won't really challenge you or help you grow as a person-but it will expand your horizons and offer you some compelling erotica. Read this one in the bathtub with a glass of wine."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Okay...so I'm writing the 5,00289 review on this book. I couldn't not write it. This is one of my favorite books ever. Dark historical fantasy with an intricate, very deep plot. This is one book you won't regret picking up.High recommend!Along with all the rest of the books in this series. If you like fantasy, you've just found the mother-lode."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading so many reviews for this book w/ Five Star ratings I decided to give this book a try. Sadly I was very disappointed-- I did not like this book.My number one complaint is that the author should have put a Glossary in the back of the book for all the words that she created in her story that the reader had to guess at their meaning. Trust me, I couldn't find much of the words in my Oxford English Dictionary. This annoyed me most of all.The cover art on the book is its best feature...it is downhill from there. I got very aggravated with the author and her writing style..poor sentence structure throughout the book. Perhaps, since many likened this book to the Rennaisance period-- that is why the author wrote sentences that were poorly constructed(?) I just don't know; it just irritated me to have to re-read sentences because of this-- much of the writing did not flow.This book was confusing to read, reviewers state how poetic this writer is--I think the author has a large vocabulary and perhaps a high IQ-- maybe this is why she applied 'big' words everywhere in this story---it did not make the author's writing flow any smoother.If you want to read fiction that reads like a textbook-- then read this book. All the characters are beautiful in this story...the heroine gets her pleasure from painful sex acts; if you are into S&M; then read this book, but be warned, the sex acts and any romance is scarce in this book --this is not Fantasy Romance fiction or Erotica.I realize the author created a fantasy world but they were human; I just don't think that it is human nature to accept the vocation of prostituiton and find it immensely satisfying--I don't care how intellectually educated the author made her characters--it just did not fit.So, you have a heroine who is 'highly intelligent' who enjoys painful sex with either of the sexes and who is stunningly beautiful, etc., etc..There is so much more I could say but my time is too valueable to waste much more on this review--I wasted enough time reading this , \\"powerful, poetic masterpiece.\\" Ha!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What all the reviews say about this book is true--it's something new for the fantasy genre--in fact, it barely fits in that genre at all. I have to admit I've never read anything quite like it. And while many readers will enjoy this very original, senusal, sophisticated book, others who prefer a more traditional kind of fantasy writing (like myself) will find it hard to finish. In fact, at the time of writing this review I'm only half done the book and I don't think I'm going to finish it. Quite frankly, I found the graphic scenes of masochistic ... (both heterosexual and homosexual) quite distasteful. It's just not something that I can relate to, although I will admit it is written in a sophisticated language--no crude language is used. If anything, the language of this book is too flowery. The plot outside of Phedre's career as a courtesan I find both confusing--dozens of names, the Duc of this and the Comtesse of that--and quite boring--it all seems to be about nothing but court intrigue, which is a waste of time for me to read. In a fantasy novel I want to see magic and exciting battle scenes. Although Kushiel's Dart does have many vivid characters, the plot just doesn't interest me. Perhaps it gets more interesing toward the end of the book; but I'm not sure if I can make it that far."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Ok, everybody, calm down. Once again we have breathless abandon of praise that is really very overblown [though explicit sexuality and S$M sometimes does that to people--I'm convinced that's why Terry Goodkind has a following.] To be fair, Carey is a better writer than Goodkind, but she has the same tendency to exploit the sex rather than really thinking out the society. In addition, her heroine has no vulnerability, and it's hard to root for such a know it all on any but the parody level. The &quot;we're Phedre's boys!&quot; song to me was SO anachronistic it made me want to scream.On the other hand, the sex is not the offensive part of this stroy. It's the reliance on it and the fact that this somehow yields praise."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at some scene or event. I liked Phedre, for the most part, but found her love-interest Joscelin to be annoyingly weak. He's suppose to be her body guard, but he's a wimp.Carey created a beautiful society with an interesting culture and completely lost me by using our own world as the setting. Was it just too difficult to create her own version a barbaric society, so she planted the Vikings in the story, instead?I've been told that you have to read the series to understand (\\"love\\") the whole story, but I just can't get myself to pick up the next book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was bored witless after reading the first five pages of this book. I felt like pulling my hair out after forcing myself to read past page 80, and I found myself at a hopeless standstill somewhere around the 200th page.I won't judge the writer based on the one book of hers that I managed to partially read. And on the same subject, I'm not in any position to make judgments towards any person's method of writing. I'm not an English professor, and I'm not here to critique Jacqueline Carey's writing style.The thing about this book that bogged me down the most was the tedious progression through the plot. I've read in other reviews that the real story doesn't pick up until you pass the 300th page, but I honestly don't think it's worth reading that far.The first few pages of the book relayed a sob story about how Phedre no Dalauney (who's name I absolutely can not stand)was born into a world of servitude, surrounded by beautiful people, while she herself is the epiphany of imperfections. From what I forcibly managed to read, Phedre's soul purpose in life is to sleep with strangers for money.I actually stopped and reread the pages on numerous occasions just to make sure I didn't miss anything \\"interesting\\" that may have happened in the story while I dozed off in my efforts to complete each chapter."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Product arrived very quickly and was in fantastic condition. Would definitely purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Not a steamy sex book, so you won't get that if that's what you're looking for, but it's intriguing with a very unusual, but strong heroine. There are some petty hot scenes, but there is SO much more to this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I only have two series on my keeper shelf, the Kushiel's series & the Outlander series. This author is extremely talented. She brings amazing depth to her characters, & I love the parallels between her fantasy world & the Renaissace era. I cant say enough good things about this series, it was a great experience!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I just love this series! It's beautifully written, imaginatively conceived and also just great fun! It also is one of the rare type that gets better as it goes along. It's hard to categorize for me--I usually read UF, and this has somewhat more of a romance angle. but there's so much more to it than that, that I still think a UF genre classification would make more sense. Anyway, readers of romance or fantasy should be very happy with the whole series!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book. At times it was a bit slow but overall it was very good. It was easy to put yourself in Phedre's shoes and relate to her relationship with Joscelin. I would recommend this to anyone, especially if you love romance, action, and drama."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a well written series, with Kushiel's Dart being the first book. This book sets the stage for an intricately connected, beautiful world, with very intriguing characters that will keep you on the edge of you sofa! Jacqueline Cary did an amazing job! It is one of my all time favorite books, with its only rival being other books in this series!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved it. This book was easily the most erotic I have ever read, uncomfortably so. I actually put it down twice but picked it up again both times, and once I surrendered to the content, I couldn't put it down. Surrender is the constant theme through the trilogy -- that which surrenders is not always weak. I am glad that my mind has been broadened and I recommend this book to all who are intrigued by the theme and are not generally turned off by reading explicit sexual encounters."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I passed this book up for at least a year in the bookstore, but always kept coming back. Boy am I glad I finally bought it. The story and writing have made this one of the best books that I have read. I have re-read it 3 or 4 times since and am always satisfied. Although I continued on with the series, this is the best book of the bunch and can stand on its own any day of the week."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It may take a little while to get used to the idea of an alternate European world, but Jacqueline Carey pulls it off like magic. You are drawn into Phedre's life within the first few chapters (as would be anyone with a remote interest in sex), yet to say the novel is the story of a courtesan or prostitute would be folly. Carey makes the sexual encounters in this book more than sensual encounters, and you realize there is so much more to lovemaking than the raw passion we normally experience. Or at least there is for D'Angelines.Political intrigue runs rampant through this romantic fantasy set in a historical world that almost mirrors our own. Her writing is on par with that of Goodkind and McCaffrey and her imagery in character description is phenomenal. I cannot recommend this book enough; though I can strongly tell you that if you do not start off with this first in Carey's Kushiel's Saga, you will not comprehend intricacies of the other volumes."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Did I mention that I love the Kushiel series? Everything about this series of books is well-done--characters, dialog, the world, the alternate reality/history. It's very unique. I think that most people who don't like this series have trouble with the idea of a masochist as a protagonist. Yep, that's dark and twisted. I think it's treated very tastefully in this series though. I think the other thing folks might have problems with is that these books are very sexy. I wouldn't recommend this series to just anyone, but to those who are OK with the two caveats I just mentioned, you'll love this series. It's one of the best fantasy series I've ever read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I started with the 4th one on accident. I loved it so much that I started again with the 1st one. This book was a page turner, it went everywhere with me. Phedre is an unforgettable character that will stay with me forever. I completely fell in love woth Joselin. 'He has replaced my first and only character love Haplo\\" With deep undertones of religion and heavy with politics, there is not much magic. Heroic tales almost out of history, and sex scenes to get the brain thinking;) I absolutely love the way Jaqueline Carey writes. She is very talented, she gets right to the point. These books will always stay in my \\"private collection\\" Its the kind that you want to read slower to make them last longer, and faster to find out what happens. All in all, a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"As a life long voracious reader I can say with authority that you don't come across a writer of Ms. Carey's caliber very often. Her writing is as rich, ornate, and evocative as the Renaissance itself. The world she creates is fascinating and the characters unforgettable. She is truly a gifted storyteller in the truest sense. Even more impressive is her virtuoso use of the English language. Her writing is as beautiful as Shakespeares and her tales every bit as layered and involved with intrigue, suspense, and larger than life characters.So many characters it is difficult to keep track of them but I became so attached that I wept with the first loss of Guy and more with each loss after. I'm glad she gave us a cast of characters at the beginning, I referred to it frequently. It thrills me to know that I have five more books after this one to enjoy the life of Phedre no' Delaunay. I mean to savor them like the rare jewels they are."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Just finished this and as there are many other reviewers I won't go over old ground. Just to note that this is a profoundly well crafted story with interesting and richly painted characters. This is a BIG story, which covers alot of ground as you would expect of an epic. If you like \\"world building\\" stories, like those of Frank Herbert (the ORIGINAL Dune works, not the more recent ones), Larry Niven, Nicola Griffith (Ammonite, great book), Tolkien or even Michael Moorcock, you should read this. Carey has built a very interesting world, borrowing somewhat from European and Judeo-Christian history and myth. Just enough for the reader to have a sense of vague, curious familiarity but not too much. To enjoy this book note that you have to be willing to suspend Western (esp American) values regarding sexuality and male primacy. It's not too much to ask though, and in return Carey will reward you with a deeply, thoroughly enjoyable story of love, intrigue, war and redemption.Cheers,Eric"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The setting isn't anything new: it's almost, but not quite, medieval Europe, and that's been done, and done well (Think Guy Gavriel Kay.) The plot isn't anything new, either: political intrigue, beautiful women, plots to topple thrones, a nation on the brink of war, unlikely heros and impossible quests.What IS new is the focus. Phedre no Delaunay is a child abandoned by her parents, sold into identured servitude at the age of four to one of the houses of the Night Court, an influential network of high-priced and highly trained courtesans. She is trained well, but she cannot fit in because she is marked with a scalet spot in her left eye -- the mark of the Devil, some say. But her luck changes when a nobleman who deals in information recognizes the spot as a sign of the god Kushiel, and buys her marque, taking her into his household and teaching her to listen, observe, and connect. Her special gift, she soons learns, is also her special curse, for Kushiel's dart marks her forever as one who will experience pain and pleasure together.From here, I cannot reveal the plot, but suffice it to say that Phedre is now a courtesan who listens, and who thinks, making her a dangerous political weapon. Her adventures are always interesting, and once you get past the first third or so of the book, it's impossible to put down. Reading toward the end is like running a race: you pull faster and faster, desperate to get there, but equally desperate that it not end. Trust me, it's that good.Carey deftly mixes sex and politics in a way it's not quite been done before, especially with regards to Phedre's particular sexual preferences, and her writing is lovely. She picks up Judeo-Christian mythology, but elaborates upon it for the divine underpinnings of the story, and what she comes up with is quite fantastic: among other things, a fallen angel from the line of \\"Yeshua ben Yosef\\" who wandered the countryside bidding his followers to \\"love as thou wilt.\\"Buy this one in hardback; you're going to read it more than once. It leaves you with a flavor at once harsh and lush, of ripe fruit, steel, and salt...or tears."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey manages to create a new and refreshing work in the sci-fi/fantasy realm. Taking world history and showing reader's a different path from the point of Christ's crucifixion onward. With that concept, she has created a world that is both familiar and new to us and a culture that is as exotic as it is erotic.Carey manages to create a heroine that is intelligent and sexy. Her characterization is well developed and her plot line is engaging and draws the reader into the political intrigues. At times, your head swims with the politics and people of the novel, but that's not a criticism. I took this novel to be an interpretation of the Renaissance/Elizabethan era, and the politics for the era are dead on.The action in this novel, once it starts, is almost non-stop.One criticism I have against the novel is if this is a society and culture that espouses the concepts of free-love (love as thou wilt), where men and women are not judged for being sexually involved with another person of the same sex, then why are there no same-sex marriages? Why are men still viewed as the dominant sex. Why are Cassilines only men and women are subservient, yet Namaah is held with such reverence and prostitution is seen as holy because of Elua (a child of Mother Earth, Christ and Mary Magdalene) and Namaah (Elua's provider through prostitution). Despite its sexual liberty, this culture is very heterocentric and still focuses on the concepts primogeniture and male dominance, which don't make coincide with the establishment of the culture and history of the novel.Another small issue is the repetitive voicing of the future. Phedre often remarks about \\"not knowing then what she knows now\\" which I found distracting to the current action. Another repetitive description the author uses is the term \\"beautiful.\\" The characters all seemed to look the same...\\"beautiful.\\" I wanted more than that. I felt like Carey drew these characters from a magazine, and Carey used the term so much that it became shallow instead of rare and precious or well-founded. What makes a person beautiful? What makes a person ugly? We don't really find out.Nevertheless, this novel is amazing and excellent in its style. it takes only a few pages to grasp the author's vivid use of language that captivates and entralls the reader. I highly recommend it...it is full of depth and intrigue, and despite a highly sexual theme that is ongoing, this novel is successful in not becoming pornographic, but remains tasteful and important to the story."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"For a first novel, Carey gives us a very, very good epic fantasy that build on the tradition recently set by Martin, Jordan and Goodkind but adds her original (and decidedly kinky) twist.I have a fondess for writers who not only develop a complicated world populated by well-developed characters but who also pay attention to the minutia of politics and political motivation. Carey, while not in the same league as George R.R. Martin (yet), does a wonderful job of creating the above and tells a highly entertaining story concerning the transition of monarchs in a world clearly based on middle-ages Europe with much of the action taking place in what would be France.So what makes this so different, you ask. Carey's main character is not only a spy, but a female spy. Not only is she a female spy, but she's also a courtesan in a time when this is an honored profession. Finally, not only is the main character a female spy and courtesan, she also may be the only sexual masochist in the country. Now that's what I call a bit of a twist. There is plenty of explicit sexual material throughout this book. Although all of it is very tastefully written, there is a lot of it and quite a bit of descriptive BD/SM stuff too. If you have problems with this, are a younger reader or the parent of a younger reader, you may wish to take a pass on this one.So why only 4 stars for this book? Carey does a great job of story telling with little or no magic involved (pretty rare for epic fantasy) for the first 3/4 of the book. Inexplicably (and somewhat ham-handedly), she throws in a couple of events that are wholly magical in nature and the novel dives into a cliche for a bit. For this, it loses a star.I heartily recommend this book for the mature reader."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Words cannot describe how truly wonderful this book really was. I have read many books, close to 1,500 if I've kept my tally correct, and not a one, in a long time has affected me quite like Kushiel's Dart did.Every page turned I closed my eyes in anticipation for what was to come, I wept and laughed and got angry with the characters, my two most favorite being Phedre and Joscelin.Being a writer myself, I go through tough times of writer's block or just plain feelings of failure. After reading Kushiel's Dart, the debut high fantasy novel written by a woman, I could only find myself spurred onward to succeed. Superb writing, excellent characters, unbelievable plot.The beginning had me reading with anticipation, the end left me in tears. Thankfully the sequel is my next conquest, but I fear I will go crazy waiting for the finale.If 100 stars could be given, this novel would get them."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Very Good. I was quite shocked, at first. A young girl with a bit of red pigment in her eye enjoying flagellation? And commonly accepting money for it? It was completely out of place with most of what I've read. But Phedre's story was enrapturing. These bizarre attitudes only augmented my fascination with her character. The Political jargon caught my head in a whirl. Sometimes I found the thought process lacking, and sometimes the dialog seemed shallow, but more often than not I could feel, see, and react to a changing character struggling toward a goal and achieving heroic stations through her own credit.The alternate religion and development of Europe really makes the reader attentive to the details. Words spelled slightly different, customs altered minutley, and language hints created a parrallel but diverse world. Phedre is caught unawares, blessed and burdened with education, she tests her devotions, her loyalties, and her heart on an explosive adventure. And the shocks along the way will only make your heart beat faster."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Normally, fantasy novels aren't necessarily my cup of tea. I like a dose of reality in my books. But &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; just barely fits into the category 'fantasy.' It could be more accurately descirbed as reimagined history! There are elements in this story borrowed from everything from ancient Rome to the Bible! Carey weaves an extremely realistic world, Terre d'Ange, with beautiful, passionate characters to go along with it.Phedre no Delaunay, our heroine and narrator throughout the tale, is born into bondage the likes of which will make more conservative readers blush. And when she is bought by her master Anafiel Delaunay at the tender age of ten, her training in the delicate arts of love and espionage begin. Delaunay works to make her his eyes and ears in a world full of scandal, and when Phedre discovers a plot to destroy her world as she knows it, all her skills are put to the test as she becomes the sole person with enough knowledge at her fingertips to save a nation.This steamy tale of love, magic, and betrayal, first in a series of three, will have you hooked in no time, and the cliffhanger ending will leave you begging for more!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I began this novel hesitantly, uncertain what to expect. I was wholly surprised -- and thrilled -- by this unique re-imagining and re-creating of &quot;real&quot; history and the fantasy genre.

It took some time to get into the story but stick with it, it gets good. I'm sad to be done with the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was a great read in a literary world of crud. I had recently gone back to reading the classics due to the complete lack of imagination and originality in most of the books out. This book creates a whole new world with different ideas and expressions of those ideas. Yes, the politics are a bit daunting and seem unimportant at first but with the following books they prove their relevance and are an integral part with in the story. Not as complex as a Robert Jordan novel but quite involving."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Perhaps it is because of the origins of the d'Angelines [from Mary Magdeleine's tears and the blood of Christ] that I started out finding this book offensive. But after reading through it, I decided it is really because it is CHEAP. And there is no reason for it to be.Jacqueline Carey is certainly literate enough to craft a good sentence, and perhaps even build a decent story, though the world she draws is pretty on the surface but lacking depth, like her characters. She could have done this with a lot more class, however, if she had not relied on the gimmicky sex. Yes, those who wish for more BDSM will thrill to it. Good for them. They are the same ones who swear Terry Goodkind is the world's greatest author, but they only read him for the jollies the sex and gore give them too.I can't really see there being much of a call for this sort of story past the trilogy. I hope it stops there, because I for one am really disturbed at what passes for epic fantasy these days. The fact that the reviewers all fell over themselves, without noting that the characters are cardboard and the world makes little sense, proves to me that you can fool a lot of people by appealing to the lowest common denominator, even when you don't have to."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I kept seeing this book everywhere I went, it was always in the shelves of recommended/popular books so I figured I'd give it a try. I was terribly disappointed. While the story itself is entertaining and the world and culture Carey creates is fairly imaginative and beautiful, the language and narration describing it was bland. I kept reading solely to find out how the story would turn out. The narration felt distant and I had a really hard time caring about the characters. And for being a story about a courtesan in a society that is so open about sex, never was there a mention of birth control. We could have had a little more realism with a contraceptive ritual that would have fit in perfectly. But no, it's just a sex laden fairy tale."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I, like a few others out there in the mass of reviewers, just don't get the hype. This book wants to be everything - romance, erotica, fantasy, S&M;, action, battle, history - but it fails on all accounts because it's stretched too thin.The sex/S&M; - for a character who's some rare masochist, there's very little in the way of actual sex scenes. One page of a setting, then the \\"red haze\\" comes over her vision and *poof* next thing you know, it's the next morning. BORING. If you're going to make such a big deal of her sexual aspect, at least show it. Sheesh. I can't imagine how anyone couldn't get past those parts since they're so few and very easily skimmed over.The names/terms/made-up words - UGH. Did they need to make everything sound the same? Or give every single character like a half-dozen different names, titles, nick-names, etc.? And was it really needed to spell everything just slightly wrong? Does that make it different? Or special? It made things annoying and was impossible to keep up with many times.The politics - So. Very. Dull. There was no motivation to care what was going on politically. The (ever confusing and renamed) people involved all seemed thrown into way overdramatic directions or had no depth at all. You really just didn't care. And for the love of all that's sacred, just how many times can you hear \\"We're d'Ange\\" as an explanation or reasoning that didn't make sense and was utterly haughty and annoying?The length - it just went on and on and on and on and on and on... it's not enough that there's like fifty different locations in the book, each one just goes on forever. Too much happens. Too many things try to be incorporated.In all, I found it inspid. I really don't get the appeal. It was boring; slow; the author made up words as she went along (without bothering to inform you of them); used too many characters with too many different (but similar) names in too many different locations. You couldn't care about the characters; didn't feel for them so you didn't care what happened. I finished it only because I can't *not* but ugh, this book was the closest I've ever come to just abandoning a book.It's not any of the things it wants to be. It's a jumbled, obnoxious and yet boring mess. Give it a pass."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love books... old, new, classic, modern... rare to find a written word not worth reading..Until now. Too many words describing nothing. The plots seems like it was thought of over a 12pk and as a way to link bad sex scenes.This is the unfortunate product that publishers are schlepping at us because we want sex and and something to make us feel like our own lives arn't that bad. The ONLY thing that is good about this compared to everything else coming from the fantasy genre is that is DOES NOT have vampires in it.There are some great historical novels out there that are worth every penny. Stick to those and save yourself from tedium."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book I have read in sometime. I quit around page 200, and I commend those that went further.Disguising itself as an erotica book, but failing in every possible way in that aspect? Check. Bland, boring, grating prose? Check. Laughable dreary Mary-Sue of a main character? Check. Raping a major religion because author lacked any creativity? Check! I could go on, but you get the point.This book is bad Alternate Universe Biblical fanfic. I thought, in the beginning it might get better, but it actually got more boring, more repetitive and just downright annoying for me to give it any of my attention any longer. I think I need to read some Nabokov to cleanse my brain."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was lauded by the critics. There is some truth to the good reviews. Ms. Carey has an amazing talent for prose that reads more beautiful than poetry. Her fantasy world is intriguing and the characters are fairly well-developed. So why do I only give it 3 stars? Honestly, I was deeply disturbed by the sado-masochistic sex. Normally, I am not squeamish. I read horror and dark fantasy frequently, and considered myself fairly hardened towards graphic, violent sex. Not so. The sex scenes in this book got increasingly disturbing to me, so that I was skipping the sex entirely (which led me to miss major parts of the plot). Maybe I wouldn't have been as bothered if the BDSM scenes were limited-- but Phedre is a courtesan and therefore the whips, chains, razors, etc. are pretty much every page. Also, as much as I liked Phedre, I found it hard to respect her because she craves all of this pain-- she is a slave to her desire for it. I read one review that claimed this as a \\"feminist\\" novel, but I don't think a woman who longs for pain in sex is a good feminist role model. Most women don't have these intense yearnings, and it's not good for men to think that they do it. So this is just a warning to stand beside all of the praise for this book: it is CERTAINLY not for everyone. I see that there is a sequel now; I wouldn't read it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am an avid reader, most especially of fantasy, and I've slogged through quite a lot of it. So when I say I didn't reach the end of this book it's no mean feat for me.I should have known to beware of a book described as \\"sensual\\" and \\"erotic\\". Other reviewers may have appreciated the sex scenes, but to me they appear more as a shock element, and most of the details are NOT indispensable to the series. Likewise, the so-called attraction between Melisand and Ph&egrave;dre seems to exist for the sole purpose of being shocking. Ph&egrave;dre comes across as a wet pillock whose sole goal is hopping into bed with as many people as possible. Kushiel's dart was a tricky premise from the start, but the author went over the top here.Aside from the sex, most of the \\"skewed\\" Renaissance world went over my head. For one thing, it seems like only the French have achieved civilization (and what civilization: every character in the book keeps saying how unforgettable it is, how beautiful everything is, until I grew sick of it). As a Frenchwoman, I rather hope amorous games are not the only things we are remembered for (I shouldn't complain, since the Brits got the worst of the trade, being depicted as savages). And the rest of the world seems to be stuck in the Dark Ages (while \\"France\\" has attained Renaissance level: how likely is that?). It's as if Ms. Carey stuck together everything she could take from history, and did a very bad job of it.For another thing, was it really necessary to compare Delaunay to Antinous? The moment this was said, any suspense as to the relationship between Delaunay and the dead prince vanished (yes, there are some cultured people out there, and they're rolling their eyes at the massacre). I'm not going to spoil things here, but Antinous was a real, historical figure from Roman times known for one thing only...I stopped midway through, and believe me, I don't regret it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm sorry, but I just don't understand all the praise. I read constantly. I can usually complete a book within three to four days regardless of the size, and I've been known to go on all night read-a-thons (to my husbands aggrivation). Yet, I could not continue to force myself to finish this book even after an entire week of trying to get through the dull, unorignial pages. Out of 925 pages I only made it to 112. I even tried scanning ahead (looking for some sort of action or interest). Needless to say, I found none."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Well, several problems. The first has to do with the length. Look, I read fantasy all the time, it is almost all I read any more. I am used to three-volume novels which are sometimes overwritten because heaven forbid that you wind up with a two-volume series. Even the first volume of this book was badly overwritten. I know the author is aiming to have a complex political aspect in her series, but I don't think the plot was complicated enough to go into such an awful awful enormous amount of detail. I mean, the way some people go on and on, just to have a lot to say and look important... anyway, hopefully my point is made.Second, this erotic series was not terribly erotic. Sorry. It's not that I'm turned off by writings on masochism. As long as I'm sold on an idea, I can accept pretty much anything. But I wasn't. Anyway, either you accept the main character as a beautiful, erotic, exotic, sensual character or you don't, and I didn't. However, I got told about eighty-five hundred times in every book how exotic, sensual, and irresistable she was, and if you don't believe me, just ask the main character, since the whole thing is written in first person.I had a problem with the love story. It is very evident by the way Pherdre describes herself and her relationships that she could have been very happy with almost any of the men in the book. She just happened to be a masochist who ends up with a masochist, and the two spend the almost the entire three thousand pages making each other unhappy. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I like reading about deathless love in these fantasy novels. I was a little creeped out that the two lovers seemed to end up together simply because he was always around. That's a little to real for me. I like fantasy.Last, I had a problem with the religious aspects in the book. I am not a staunch Christian, and I can accept newly-created religions that support a book plot, but frankly Ms. Carey's rewriting Christianity to be offensive, and I would strongly suggest any Christian readers to avoid this book. I know a nice Christian woman who is a fellow fantasy lover, but she couldn't make it through Anne Bishop's Jewel series, and I would never dream of recommending this book to her, or to anyone of even passing faith.I have never ranted on about a series for this length of time. However, I was mad because the book is well-written enough that I felt I had to wade through to the end, without ever feeling fully engaged by it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"All I can say is that this is an awesome book though not for the squeamish or faint of heart. The series is definitely a fresh view in the fantasy universe with by far the most unique protagonist I have thus far met (and I read a lot). Additionally as the series continues it has some of the most unique religious structures I have read about."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"As a debut novel, this one is in a class of its own. Jacqueline Carey starts an epic series with this amazingly addictive, sensual, dramatic story that will keep the reader turning pages, staying up later than planned, and rushing to the store to buy the next book in the series. A word to the wise: buy the first 3 books (1. Kushiel's Dart, 2. Kushiel's Chosen, 3. Kushiel's Avatar) together so you don't get antsy waiting for the next book to come out. I don't like Sci-Fi/Fantasy, but I'm totally in love with Jacqueline Carey's work!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is for the audiobook version.I thoroughly enjoyed the book but I was extremely annoyed by the narrator, Anne Flosnik. She supposedly has 250 audio books to her credit. I thought her accent was a bit strong and had a hard time understanding what she said at times, replaying the section to get a grasp. Her amused voices come out pompous instead. I don't understand how the Skaldi (not sure how it's spelled) have a Count Dracula-like accent even when they're speaking their own language, what's up with that?"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There is so much I could say about this book, but it would be impossible to explain it with complete accuracy. It's fantasy, intrigue, and romance. It's dark and gritty. It's unexpectedly entertaining.First of all, this book is long. The plot elements are too many to summerize, so I'll just gloss over the main points. The setting is a sort of alternate reality historical Europe--most specifically Terre-D'Ange (France). It's told first person from the point of view of Phedre, a young girl who was given into servitude as a child. She grows up being trained as a courtesan and a spy--to pleasure men and women and to observe and interpret the things she sees. Phedre is unique in that she has the ability to yeild to pain, taking pleasure in the process. As a result of this calling she is thrown into a world of intricate political intrigue, tumultuous romance, violence, and war. She is joined by a varied cast of secondary characters and villians, too many to list or describe.There are a lot of great things about this book, and I believe it would appeal to a wide audience. Phedre is a unique character who stands out both by the standards of modern culture and withing her own world. As a result, I found her likeable and for the most part relateable. The setting and culture created is extremely detailed and entertaing--from the political and social hierarchies, to the legends and religions, to the customs and languages. It takes some concentration to keep everything straight. Which is why I must warn- this isn't exactly light reading. Not only is the plot complex and full of politics, mysteries, and secret plots, but much of the content is vaguely disturbing. But if you put the time and thought into it, you will almost certainly find something appealing.The parts that appealed to me specifically were the relationships. Phedre meets and interacts with quite a variety of characters. There is Hyacynthe, a gypsy boy she meets as a child. Joscelin, Phedre's protector who lives by strict priestly vows which are strongly tried by his growing love for her. I could go on, but the point is that there is every character type imagineable and there's quiete a bit of developement for each of them.I had some issues with this book, and the top one is length. I like my books long, yes, but I hate filler. Was there much of it? No. But enough that I had moments of boredom, or later when I thought back on a chapter I realized it could have been cut to no ill effect. In fact I feel there were a few characters that could have been cut out as unnecessary to the plot. The language is very flowery, which is mostly a plus, but at times it detracts from the narrative--sometimes simpler would be better.Overall, this is very impressive fantasy. I encourage readers to try it and draw their own conclusions--most fantasy fans should find something positive."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first book in the series is amazing. I was hesitant at first due to the lack of magic, however Carey weaves a powerful and moving story. ALL the following novels I would rate a 5 the reason the first I have given 4 is the first chunk of the book with all the French style names makes it hard to follow. Once you understand who is who and the groundwork is laid the story takes off. Very mature, I loved it and strongly suggest you try it"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Excellent story, believable and realistic characters. Carey really carves out a reputation for being a good writer with this novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In this alternate fantasy universe we are immersed in a political system that challenges societal views of prostitution, bdsm, and religion. It's a deep dark read that takes you on an epic journey through an alternate Europe (though it's not obvious that this is Europe). Each character works their way into your heart and changes your perspective slowly and carefully. If you want to believe that sensuality should be revered instead of treated like a dirty little secret... If you want to read something that challenges you to combine sensuality and intelligence, subtlety and intrigue, submission and victory ... this whole series is for you. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm a fan of the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. My cousin suggested this book to me a few years back. This is my second time reading it, and it's even better. It's full of political intrigue and sensuality. You'll definitely enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really enjoyed this book. At times, it was a bit hard to keep track of who's who, and who was a friend or not. But overall, a good book. Definetly worth the time.Edited to add: I figured i'd add more detail.Phedre is a child of the Night Court, born to courtasan mother and trader father. Sadly(or not?) she's born with a scarlet mote in one of her eyes. Flawed, she cannot be a part of the world her mother was trained to, and had hoped to train her too.She's left by her mother and her life is uncertain. Until the day she discoovers for herself the full force and meaning of her flaw. Or is she flawed? Turns out, the fleck in her eye means Phedre is a rarity, something not seen for years.She has been struck by Kushiel's dart. She is an anguissette,someone who is doomed to find pleasure in pain. The only one to really see what she is, is a man named Anafil Delauney. He takes her in at age 10, and trains her alongside his other pupil, Alcuin.This is a novel of power, pain,misery and self discovery for Phedre. She goes from a pampered Servant of Naamah, to the bed slave of a Skaldi warrior, and everything in between. She is betrayed, and loses some dear to her.A great start to a series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I will keep this review short and simple, as others have writen enough to let you know what the storie line is. THIS BOOK IS INCREADABLE, it will keep your interest from cover to cover, and the second book in the series is, if possable, even better! I can hardly wait for the next book to come out!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Even before I started reading the book, I was extremely concerned about the level of sexual encounters involving pain. I'm not a prudish person, and I quite enjoy a well-written sex scene, but throw in any kind of pain, and you lost me. Even so, I was constantly encouraged by friends who have read \\"Kushiel's Dart\\", to put my concerns aside and give the novel a try.As it turns out: I couldn't handle it. Every time Phedre was whipped, slapped, burned with a hot poker, pinched, hit, tortured, had her hair pulled, etc, I winced and read faster, willing it to end. It didn't matter to me how much Phedre enjoyed it... the only thing I noticed is how much these situations bothered me. Even this I could have handled, if I had found any of the characters enjoyable in the least. I didn't.I found I could have cared less about the political/courtly intrigue, an aspect of fantasy novels that I normally enjoy greatly. I got 200 pages into the book, and I couldn't find one character I liked. I didn't like Phedre. I couldn't relate to her. Worse, I couldn't understand her motivations - what drove her, what made her the way she was. Maybe all that will be explained in more detail later in the book, but I won't be finding out. I didn't like any of her friends, or influences. I hated Alcuin. He seemed a weak character - one who wasn't developed well enough for me. Delaunay seemed cold, and I also found it hard to understand his motives (again, I assume this will be explained later also). I had no feelings one way or another for the Prince, or Melisande, or any of Phedre's patrons.In short... there was nothing to keep me reading through the torturous sex scenes. This is the first book I tossed, unfinished, in a very long time. I'm normally very stubborn, and I like to finish what I start; but I just couldn't see myself reading another 700 pages of \\"Kushiel's Dart\\"."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Subterfuge and sex.The main focus of this book is a young woman who is trained as a courtesan, but has a minor biological flaw. It turns out that this is important, and a rare sign of her being a supernaturally excellent example of a sadomasochistic sexual servant.Being really good as this also brings her to the attention of spymasters, given that sex and spying go rather well together.Reasonable book, but too long and hence gets tedious for me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I saw this book on the shelves of various bookstores, picked it up and read the back, then put it back down. Something about it turned me off. Then I bought it on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. The book was fantastic! The sex parts did not bother me at all, they fit the book very well and were not overly graphic. Also the twist on the European culture added a special something for me. Whenever she would introduce a new culture I would think of which European nation it emulated and follow on the strangely familiar map. All in all this was one of the better books I have read, realistic characters, villians who are not completely evil and heores who are not completely pure (that is obvious). As for Phedre, I set myself up to not like her and found myself falling in love with her instead. Well written and I cannot wait for the next rumored trilogy, Imriel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey is an excellent writer that captures yourattention in the first few pages. Phedre no Delaunay,the lead female, is a powerful and seductive person who hasvery much intelligence with politics as she does in the bed chamber. Carey captures readers and leaves them breathless.This is a book you won't wantto put down until you get to the last page."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I first started this book....I thought what is this, a fantasy book or a history lesson? This is the most thorough made up history for a fantasy book I've ever read,besides Tolkien. At first it was slow going but then the action picked up. I love this book. It was full of richly written characters and locations that were described like a traveler's log. I want to go to Terre d'ange, I'm pretty sure it exists, I mean nobody writes that much detail about a made-up place right? Wrong, Ms. Carey you are a truly gifted and imaginative writer and I highly recommend this book to any fantasy reader. Phedre' is a strong and sexy woman, with a powerful capacity for both pleasure and pain. A little racy for some tho'. But I AM buying the next two in the series, Kushiel's Chosen and Kushiel's Avatar. Loved It!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A friend recommended the books to me. We both love SF and Fantasy and I found this book definitely great from a storytelling perspective. It reads as a fairy tale and yet manages to maintain a link with reality. The idea of using an alternative history by changing a few events about 2,000 years ago is certainly interesting and a lot of the subplots are well done. The growing up of Phedre over the three books is good.Some people found that the book is over the top is using poetic descriptions and difficult words. The latter I found not at all true and the former I actually found a positive feature. It helps to \\"see\\" the book, but then again I love 19th century literature as well and that is full of these types of things.As for the people that found the names hard. They are not. Most of them are French(ish) with a contineous disrespect for French grammar rules. I do admit having a book literacy exceeding SF/Fantasy and speaking more than one language does help.You may say why then the 3 stars if you did like it? Well for two reasons.I found the Melisande character as the really bad girl very very weak. The so-called attraction between her and Phedre is under whelming. This important plot that goes on for three books is just not believable. But my main criticism lies in the fact that I found the descriptors used for the various people in Europe extremely condescending to the point of insulting. The Germanic tribes are barbarians as are the people living in the low lands. The people on what we know as the British and Irish isles are considered to be warmongering brutes with a very new age slant on the druidic and Celtic cultures. The face paintings described are worse than any Pict ever wore. The Greek are described mainly as day dreamers who live by what their oracles are stating Only the French are worth anything. Don't get me wrong I love France and the French but they are described as if they are the only people in this alternative Europe that have developed a more enlightened society. Certainly the first book as a result gave me a very nasty aftertaste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first of a trilogy about a young and uniquely gifted heroine whose innocence is shattered by intrigue and murder. Phedre is a thoroughly engaging heroine on an epic journey rife with intrigue, betrayal, violence, sexual and erotic encounters and, of course, love. Written in beautiful prose, and set on a grand landscape of Renaissance Europe, Carey's series is an exotic tapestry of sensual images that will linger like a rich coffee brewed to perfection. This is not a typical coming-of-age series and definitely adult reading.Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy by Tor Books consists of three rather large books: Kushiel's Dart (a hefty 910 pages); Kushiel's Chosen; and Kushiel's Avatar, with a fourth and fifth in the saga, based on another character (Kushiel's Scion and Kushiel's Judgement). Kushiel's Legacy is definitely an epic fantasy. But, thankfully for me, it couldn't be further from its stereotype. Epic, yes--in size, scope and granduer. Fantastic, also, in its brilliant imagination and masterful delivery. But it is so much more. According to T.M. Wagner (SF Reviews.net), Carey \\"eschews the mythic aspirations of traditional high fantasy...[and] has created one VLFN that stands above the bloated pack\\", taking \\"Fantasy into shadowy, exotic corners it rarely dares to tread\\" (Storm Constantine). William Thompson (Revolution SF) found this \\"seductive novel...exceptionally well-written, intricately plotted and [displayed] a grasp of language and storytelling rare in fantasy fiction.\\" To be sure, several readers of traditional fantasy complained that the language was \\"too flowery\\" and the books too long and overfull with detail and characters. This is precisely why I liked it. It reads like classic literary fiction. But it isn't!Chapter One of Kushiel's Dart, the first of Carey's three books focussing on Ph&egrave;dre, begins with Ph&egrave;dre engaging us with a conversational narrative that seamlessly and instantly lures us into her fascinating world. And lured I was; by the end of the first page I learned that her parents gave her a name that was cursed and that Ph&egrave;dre, herself, was flawed: by a scarlet mote, a pinprick of blood emblazened in her left eye--which is enough in this land of aesthetics obsessed with beauty to mark her as blemished. She only later learns the significance of the mark; it is Kushiel's Dart, left by a god who has chosen her to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Thus begins our relationship with an \`imperfect' girl who was eventually outcast and sold by her mother--as \\"a whore's unwanted get\\"--into indentured servitude in a House of the Night Court (a bordelo). It was the tag line of the first chapter that convinced me that a stirring tale of breathtaking intensity and shocking beauty was unfolding before me:\\"When Love cast me out, it was Cruelty who took pity upon me.\\"Kushiel's Legacy is set in an alternate quasi-medieval Europe, Africa and Asia of Carey's imagination. For instance, there is Aragonia, Caerdiccia Unitas, and Skaldia, loosely representing Spain, Italy and Germany, respectively. And there is Terre d'Ange (land of angels), Ph&egrave;dre's homeland, a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace, and whose beautiful race, created from angels and men, lived by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. The D'Angelines were descended from the Blessed Elua, an interesting, rather warped, vision of the traditional Christ figure, and his angel companions who abandoned Heaven to follow him as he walked among mortals. Among Elua's companions is the angel, Naamah, who willingly prostituted herself in service to Elua; Cassiel, who abjured mortal love for the love of the divine; and, of course, the mighty Kushiel, of rod and weal, the just Punisher of God, whose blow of pain was the touch of love. Those \\"kissed\\" by Kushiel receive both pleasure and cleansing through the infliction of pain.Early on in Kushiel's Dart, Ph&egrave;dre's bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, an arcane nobleman with a secret past, who recognizes who and what she is--an anguissette, one who can experience pain as pleasure. While his motives elude her, Delaunay tutors Ph&egrave;dre as a spy and rents her out to influential members of the decadent aristocracy to learn their secrets. When one of Delaunay's games gets the better of him, he is murdered and young Ph&egrave;dre is cast on a path of intrigue and treachery that she, as Kushiel's Chosen-Avatar, is singularly able to endure. Thus, she sets off on her hero's journey--aflame with betrayal, sacrifice, scintilating desires, and conspiracy. She encounters a rich and diverse cast of cunning poets, heroic traitors and a truly Machiavellian and seductive villainess. And to balance this is her loyal Cassiline bodyguard, Joscelin, her \\"Perfect Companion\\", who eventually becomes the compass of her heart.True to her heroic stature, Ph&egrave;dre harbours, in both her words (it is she telling us the story) and her mien, no bitterness or resentment for the cruelty and hardship destiny has dealt her. And she does more than simply endure it; she answers the hero's call to play out her role as Kushiel's Chosen. Ph&egrave;dre is a singularly appealing and complex hero because she is non-judgemental, ethical and honourable yet incredibly vulnerable, reckless and stubborn at times. She poses a panoply of opposites. She is, after all, an anguissette: her pain is her pleasure; her yielding is her strength, her wanton behaviour her salvation, her servitude her victory; and her love her courage. Ph&egrave;dre is \\"an unflinching yet poignantly vulnerable heroine\\" (Booklist), whose selfless yielding will conquer the strongest and most depraved of foes. \\"Not all that yields is weak,\\" Hyacinthe, her best friend, tells her. To yield is Kushiel's precept and the moniker of the House of Valerian, dedicated to the just Punisher. And yield, Ph&egrave;dre must--and does; until it becomes her strength and her legacy just as love and honour become her driving force.One is reminded of Christian parallels of yielding, tolerance and sacrifice in the acts of Jesus and his disciples. Ph&egrave;dre walks a balanced moral path, following the precepts of her D'Angeline angels--Kushiel's justice; Naamah's passion, Cassiel's loyalty, and, of course, Elua's love--toward redemption for more than just herself. Carey's exotic blending of Christianity and paganism, daringly poses the question of \\"the sacred potential inherent in every sexual encounter.\\" (Booklist). Wholly embracing her gods, and at great cost to herself, Ph&egrave;dre gives herself away--sexually, and more--in Kushiel's Avatar to rescue an innocent boy and ultimately to save her friend, Hyacinthe, from a wrathful god.\\"Mortals conquer and slay; gods rise and fall. The games we play out on the board of earth echo across the vault of heaven.\\" (Kushiel's Chosen)Some readers have complained, nonetheless, at the inapropriateness of a prostitute as heroine. But, like many heroes with humble often dubious beginnings, Ph&egrave;dre is one chosen by a god, who provides her with the opportunity to demonstrate that her heart and soul are far from base:\\"We pay for sins we do not remember, and seek to do a will we can scarce fathom. That is what is is, to be a god's chosen.\\" (Kushiel's Avatar)Yet for all that, this tale is not for the squeamish or the judgemental. As Kirkus Reviews contends, Kusiel's Legacy is \\"superbly detailed, fascinatingly textured and sometimes unbearably intense,\\" punctuated with highly erotic and, at times, disturbing sexual episodes. The hero is a masochist, \\"whose disturbing sexuality drives the story... [which is as]...delicious as it is unsettling\\" (Emma Bull). T.M Wagner (of SF Reviews.net) sums it up eloquently: Kushiel's Legacy \\"is the real thing, a distaff examination of sex and power, unflinchingly forthright.\\" And, he adds, \\"on no account is it recommended for faint hearts or weak stomachs.\\" Indeed, I was equally spellbound and greatly disturbed by Ph&egrave;dre's last great tryst with evil's desire in a place of true madness where souls are currency (Kushiel's Avatar). Her experience in Darsanga to rescue young Imriel, Melisande's son, will endure in my memory for a long time: the terrible things Ph&egrave;dre endured; the devine way she prevailed. She overcame it all because of the divine love that shone brightly inside her (her name means \\"bright\\" in Greek). It empowered her to shine hope to the hopeless. But the experience left her shattered, in pieces. Make me whole, she later prayed in the Temple of Isis, make us all whole.Kushiel's Legacy is not a romance, although it is a great love story. It is a complex saga, woven with layer upon layer of threads revealed through a metaphoric tapestry, often counterpoint with contradiction and turbulent conflict of morality and values. This journey of self-discovery by a young child journeying into womanhood explores some of the deepest and most cherished virtues of humanity, by courageously dismantling \\"standard notions of...morality\\" (Locus). Virtues like honour and loyalty. Family. And love. Love, in all its aspects:Innocent love--a trusting love for a mother in the act of abandonment: ...She will sell me to this cruel old woman, I thought, and experienced a thrill of terror...My mother stood with my hand in hers and gazed down at my upturned face. It is my last memory of her, those great, dark, lambent eyes searching, searching my own, coming at last to rest upon the left. Through our joined hands, I felt the shudder she repressed.(Kushiel's Dart)Dangerous love--a curious love of forbidden flesh: \\"Ph&egrave;dre.\\" My name only; Melisande spoke it as if to place a finger on my soul, soft and commanding...held me captive and trembling before her...\\"Why do you struggle against your own desire?\\" Melisande lowered her head and kissed me. The shock of it went through me like a spear; I think I gasped...I swayed, dissolving under lips and tongue...my bones... molten fire, my flesh shaping itself to the form of her desire...(Kushiel's Chosen)Cruel love--a sacrificial, yielding love for one's enemy: The Mahrkagir...reached out to touch my cheek and his hand was cold, so cold...I felt his touch like fire, setting me ablaze between my thighs...I shut my teeth on a moan...A strange rill of energy surged between us. I tasted fear and desire, his mad smile, and lost myself in his dilated eyes. His hand trailed down my throat, cupping one breast...pinching my erect nipple as hard as he could. A bolt of pain shot through me and I stifled a moan. \\"Ill thoughts, ill words, ill deeds.\\" He smiled tenderly at me, maintaining a pincerlike grip...\\"Your gods have chosen you for defilement. Is that not so?\\" I closed my eyes. \\"Yes.\\" (Kushiel's Avatar)Tender love--a healing and exalting love for one's true beloved: That kiss, I cannot describe. It was like a poem, a prayer, a homecoming unlooked-for. It was like dungeon walls crumbling to reveal a glimpse of sky. It shook me to the very roots of my soul. All I could do was cling to him and gasp...And that is where time itself seemed to stretch and flow...and everything done by the Mahrkagir was undone, every cruelty, every iron thrust--undone, undone, undone, every kiss, every lick, every stroke, imprinting love upon my flesh, until I shuddered and knotted both hands in Joscelin's hair, calling his name out loud, and my climax followed with the inevitability of the spring-fed waters tumbling over the rocks. (Kushiel's Avatar)Divine love--a selfless compassionate love greater than oneself: It burned in me like strong wine, like the first taste of joie I had known as a child, like Melisande's touch...If I had not brought Imri out of the darkness of Darsanga , this brightness would never come to pass. Truly love was a wondrous force, now that I perceived the complexities of its workings...Joscelin...Every line, every plane of him was writ in an alphabet of flesh and bone, spelling out love. How had I never seen it? And Imriel...a tangled knot of fear and need, achingly vulnerable. It made my heart ache to look upon him. (Kushiel's Avatar)More than anything else, Carey's epic tale is a poem dedicated to love; exalting love in all its facets, from selfless yielding and sacrifice to the harsh lusty desires of a cruel heart. From the last line of Chapter 1 in the first book to the last line of the last book--Jacqueline Carey demonstrates that her Kushiel's Legacy is devoted to the power of love; how love can sustain us, how it shapes our lives, can move an empire, and empower us in our own singular heroic acts.Love as thou wilt."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I hesitated reading Kushiel's Dart for a number of years for that most superficial of reasons: the cover art. Kushiel's Dart looked like little more than a romance novel wrapped in the swaddling of fantasy. This novel, however, has received a fair amount of critical acclaim and good buzz has popped up in some of the online venues I keep an eye on. So, it is with a mild amount of trepidation which I opened the cover.The story begins early on in the life of Phedre, a young girl who would soon to be given over to the care of the Night Court, a group of professional courtesans. After spending several years trained at the Night Court she is adopted, or better yet, purchased by a man named Delaunay. Delaunay purchased Phedre's \\"marque\\", that which Phedre will need to earn back before she has her complete freedom again. She is not a slave, but she is owned. Delaunay has grander plans than just using Phedre as a source of income. Phedre is to be trained to look, listen, and think, to work as something of a spy for Delaunay has she goes on her assignations with the elite of Terre d'Ange.The first hundred pages or so cover Phedre's training, her friendship with a gypsy boy named Hyacinthe, and her training by Delaunay. Jacqueline Carey is setting the stage for what is to come and to prepare Phedre and the reader for the rest of the novel. It would be very easy, however, to close the book any time during the first hundred pages in frustration because while there is quite a bit going on, there is the feeling that nothing actually happened.The second hundred pages or so solve this problem as Phedre is permitted to start earning her marquee back and starts working as a courtesan for Delaunay. These second hundred pages can veer, at times, to soft core pornography. There is a good deal of sex, and because of the nature of Phedre's gift (she is an anguissette, touched by the god Kushiel, which is of a benefit to her \\"work\\" and allows her pleasure in pain), the sex is frequently violent. Carey toes a very fine line in showing the reader the nature of Phedre's work without going into too explicit detail. There are several instances, though, where Carey shows us more than the others so we better know just how violent and sexual things are for Phedre and just how much pleasure she gets from the pain.This is only the beginning of the story, though. There are still five hundred more pages of \\"action\\" and plot. When the intrigue which Delauney has introduced Phedre to but never quite gave her all of the details about comes full circle to threaten Delaunay and Phedre's life, Phedre must choose survival over pride and expedience over her own desires and wishes. Phedre must use all of the skills at her disposal, intellectual and physical, to survive and protect Terre d'Ange from treachery internal and threats external.Kushiel's Dart was a pleasant surprise. The first person narration from Phedre was very effective as Carey perfectly captures the voice of the character and when Phedre declines to graphically explain certain events it does not harm the story, but rather gives the story shading and perspective from the narrating character. Carey is, perhaps, a bit long winded and spends a bit too much time having Phedre dealing with whatever her current situation is. It is all appropriate for the story, but Kushiel's Dart is also a 700 page doorstop of a novel and there is some fat in the novel which could well have been trimmed. In particular, the first two hundred pages had extraneous text, though Carey does a very good job in making reference later to what seemed at first to be padding. This is to say that while Kushiel's Dart is very much on the wordy side, Jacqueline Carey makes even unimportant events early on become important later in the novel. Because of this, it is difficult to say exactly what should have been trimmed, but 700 pages is still a bit much to ask for from the reader for a first novel.With all of that said, Carey does an excellent job making Phedre a believable character and the political intrigue and motivations credible. Phedre's world feels like a place that could possibly exist. As the novel progresses, Phedre still uses the physical tools she has at her disposal (her body), but Carey no longer goes into great detail in what goes on between the sheets. This is to Carey's and the novel's benefit because had the sex not taken a back seat later in the novel Kushiel's Dart would have been little more than a soft core novel with some fantasy elements (i.e. more suited to be shelved in the romance section than fantasy).Kushiel's Dart far exceeded my expectations and while I feel no inclination to rush out and find a copy of the next book, Kushiel's Chosen (another 700 page doorstop), I did enjoy the time spent in Terre d'Ange and will likely return for another visit to the intrigue of Phedre's world.- Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Wow, after getting through the first pages, of difficult names and titles, you just cant stop! It has been a long time that I have read a book this good!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"this was a wonderful book. It enters into the Kushiels Legacy trilogy with Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delauney as a child, and her beginnings of being sold by her parents. She begins her friendship with Hyacinthe, and starts her journey as Naamah's Servant as well as Kushiel's chosen. It is an amazing story that you won't be able to put down, and I would recommend buying the entire trilogy together so you can read them all together!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Based on the ravishing reciews, I thought I was reading the new Great American Novel.Uh, no.It's certainly readable writing, and if you can stomach the sex, and the fact that the author uses S&amp;M as her gimmick, than this book will probably fascinate you. It's a little like watching a train wreck at first; the first few instances can be seen as daring. After a while it gets old.Outside the sex there's little to recommend this book. I found the god imagery unimaginative and the character development lacking.I also want to know why Tor is marketing this as a debut, making everyone say, &quot;WOW! What a wonderful first book!&quot; when it's NOT."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I find all the slathering of praise on this book to be silly. Certainly the author is literate, but the prose is one big self-gratification that I prefer not to participate in. I am not offended by the sex itself--even though all the bodice-ripper descriptions of &quot;hard veined phalluses&quot; hardly impress to the level I expected after a gushing Kirkus review. It is the persepctive that is bothersome. Perhaps few other readers don't take offense at the sort of content that abounds in this tasteless book, but if you put golden wrapping on manure, it's still manure; you can foist it off on a lot more people, however."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of those fantasy novels where the first 10 pages are nothing but a list of characters that seems to go on forever. This is also one of the few fantasy novels where you actually need to look at that list in order to understand anything that's going on for the first 300 pages of the book. I found myself either falling asleep in mid-sentence, or putting the book down because it gave me a headache. Summarized, the first 300 pages of the book are the worst, then it picks up and actually gets interesting for about 200-400 pages, and then it gets incredibly practical and even more boring than the first 300 pages. I will grant that it has excellent use of vocabulary which gives it the perfect disguise for how much it really sucks. The characters names are also almost impossible to sound out. Some sound exotic, the others are just jumbled up letters. I will not torture myself any further by reading the rest of this series yet to come, and I recommend that noone else torture themselves with it either."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up this book because the characters and plot sounded incredibly interesting, and because I had been recommended it since I like Anne Bishop's work.This piece of trash is nothing like Ms. Bishop's work, which was intelligently plotted and complex, a fascinating read. I'm a very competent reader, hardly ever bogged down in a book. However, that's exactly what this book reminds me of-a bog you keep drowning in. It took me over an hour to finish the first chapter, and that's saying something. There's a saying, \\"Don't use a million dollar word where a one dollar word will do.\\" Ms. Carey uses trillion dollar words where fifty cent ones will do. The book is needlessly complex, a futile attempt at creating a richly detailed world, that in the end, simply bores the reader. I gave up on this book about 200 pages in. I kept pushing, hoping the writing would clear up eventually, but alas, it did not. I fail to understand how Ms. Carey managed to cram so much into this book, yet felt the need for TWO sequels. It makes my head hurt. I bow down to those who were able to finish all three, you truly are more patient than I am. I hope Ms. Carey's writing matures, she has a lot of promise. At this point however, her writing is painfully sophomoric.If you're looking for something with an intruiging cast of characters, a quick-paced AND detailed plot, with a hint of dark sexuality, PLEASE do not waste your time with this book. Go for Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book because it was so heavily hyped, but it turned out to be mess of stilted prose, overly demanding plot details, and bad sadomasochistic porn. Every sentence rings of foolish bombast, the characters have no emotional appeal, and I felt so manipulated I had to throw the book across the room. I have tried to pick up the book again, being a third of the way through, but it repels me again and again. I am no literary snob, I read science fiction and some fantasy all the time, and I am no literary lightweight, enjoying Henry James as much as the next guy, but this piece of marketing mush failed to appeal at any level. The book reads like it was started on an alt.sex newsgroup."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"First of all, this is really not a 'fantasy' book as there is very little magic or fantastic creatures. If you are looking for these, skip this book.Secondly, there are only two aspects of which this book is about: The bondage-sex that the main character Phedre is addicted to, and political intrigue.As to the first aspect, the bondage, you may like it or hate it. You may like it because S&M; is rarely done in a mainstream fantasy book, or you may hate it because Phedre is a kind of prostitute who gets turned on by anyone and everyone who slaps her around physically.As to the political intrigue, you may like it if you crave for the Robert Jordan style (past the 6th book of his series) where there are a whole lot of characters each with a whole lot of motives. You may hate it if you hate this writing style because there's way too many characters with different and confusing names, titles, or nicknames who all act melodramatically at every political event that much of the time the reader may not even understand, because it's so confusing in the first place.Personally, I hated the book in both cases. There were so many characters with so many confusing names that I felt I had to take notes just to keep track of the motives of everyone involved. And since there are so many characters involved they all became so shallow that it's difficult for me to care one way or another for any of them. The only way you can give this book 5 stars is if you understood exactly what was going on and who was doing what. And if you could do that on your first casual reading of the book, you are a lot more patient and more intelligent than I."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am always suspicious of books with a billion 5 star reviews that are heavily on the text by authors who have never reviewed anything but that one book. It makes me wonder if the author, and/or his/her friends and writing them all. I suspect this may be the case here.This is not a bad book. It's ok. The sex is overdone as a gimmick, when it could have been handled as a theme, if that's what the author really wanted, without being so gross. Subtley handled sometimes, but gratuitous in many cases. It's not the sex that left me unimpressed. It was the author's reach exceding her grasp. The &quot;dramatis personae&quot; at the beginning of the book, as if we cannot possibly keep track of the characters as we read, made me irritated to begin with. After that, I found glancing characterization of that cast of thousands, not really making most of them necessary to the story.Finally, I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the tendency to promote &quot;debuts&quot; so that it can make reviewers like Storm Constantine say &quot;wow, amazing for a first book.&quot; Unless there's another Jacqueline Carey, this is NOT a first book. I hate being manipulated like this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was one of the greatest disappointments of the year for me. I had read good things about it and bookreaders I respect had recommended it to me. Unfortunately this book is plagued with \\"made up word syndrome\\" where about a third of the nouns are words that have no etymology in this universe. This is further compounded by the use of ridiculous names such as the hero \\"Phedre no Delaunay\\". Yes this is the heroine's name -very annoying to be sure.Now that my personal gripe has been dealt with I should say that the outlined premise of the book is unique... a concubine uses her special \\"ability\\" to withstand pain and other deviant acts inflicted on her from her \\"johns during sexual encounters. She has \\"Kushiels Dart - a fleck in her eye that is symbolic of this unique trait allowing her to turn pain into pleasure. She uses this method to get close to politicians to gather secrets and the game begins. Unfortunately this tuned into one of those 800+ page books that you just keep reading because at some point it must get good -It didn't. I don't use this phrase very often -but this was clearly a \\"chick book\\". And no, that has nothing to do with the fact the lead character is female. (Steal the Dragon and Game of Thrones both have female leads and they are outstanding) No, I call this a \\"chick book because it seemed to read as a soft-core porn/romance novel. I enjoy reading about sex as much as the next guy, but there is no need for an eight page sex scene in a fantasy novel. Make it two pages and get on with the espionage. The weak writing and the made up words and dreadful sex scenes made this book a chore to finish. I am not impressed that there is a sequel for this and I (unlike Phedre) take no pleasure in needless pain, and will not be reading the next book.As For Mr.B.J Wilson: (A reviewer of all of 3 whole books - all by himself too!)This book was terrible - run from it as if it were the Plague!!This book is in fact a microcosm of etiology - I stand by my original assessment-but do thank you for the correction. Yes, etiology is the study of the history of germs and plagues... This book is what is wrong with reading lately. Someone published a book - a book filled with so much nonsense and in this sense it is like a single germ, floating throughout space.But then it spreads. People that don't know about books and fantasy advocate on the germs behalf, many of them becoming like rats; carriers of the germs... More people contract the germs and it kills both time and brain cells...then the book gets popular to epidemic proportions and soon, some people even begin to say its \\"good\\" - just like they used to say smoking was good for you - after all, that phlegm that you are coughing up is really just \\"badness\\" being expelled from your body...That is what happened with this book, my fine readers. It was a terrible thing to begin with and only got worse with time. Like other strains of disease - it has spawned new strains of sickness - coming in the form of bad sequels.So, Mr. Wilson, you may like this sickeningly poor book, or you may just like germs - I hear Etiologists do quite well...As for myself, I guess my immune system was to strong to be infected with this drivel...Relic113"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book after having read some of the review on Amazon. It looked promising, but in the end I was disappointed. This book is rather standard fare when it comes to fantasy. It is overly lengthy and kind of tedious with a straight forward political intrigue and political back stabbing that does not require too much imagination. The positive points are the religions of the book which are images of real ones only with intriguing twists. There are not much in terms of fantasy elements (magic, creatures, etc...), this is more political based, which is not what I was personally looking for. Also the characters are very archetypal (ex: the casselin brother Jocelin is a young man twisted by his desire for honour and duty versus his impulses, the inexperienced and young, yet strong and intelligent queen, the wicked yet desirable and beautiful villainess). By archetypal I mean already seen before and not that fresh and interesting. Why can't there be fresh characters that don't always remind me of books or myths that I have already read in the past?Aside from that I can say that this is a typical \\"girl porn\\" book. It will definitely appeal to women reader much more than to male readers. There is also a lot of gay sex involved (I will never understand why women writers are so fond of gay sex?), which I find kind of annoying. If anything this book has confirmed for me the George R.R. Martin is a genius in terms of Fantasy literature that has no equal.Conclusion: If you are a guy then steer clear of this \\"girl porn\\". If you are a women then you will probably enjoy this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked this book up because of its huge sales and reader reviews and thought it was the next big thing after Martin. Boy was i wrong.One of the main characters early in this brick sized novel is a homosexual who uses his two teenage 'prostitutes' to gather inside information for him. Plus since he is gay he has exquisite taste, is beautiful, and writes poetry. What gay guy doesnt?And the main heroine, if she can be called that, is so 'cursed' that she even gains pleasure from skin seared by a hot poker and rape. Hmm, what a bunch of likeable characters.And whats behind these two role model characters? A plot to overthrow the throne with political intrigue, backstabbing, and deceit. The only thing is, 700 pages in, we are given no reason at all to care for the Queen on the throne or the land she rules. Who is this Queen in danger? Why is she in danger? What is her favorite color?The reader is given no reason to like the Queen and her people but we know that our main character must go on a dangerous mission to try and save her throne. Hmm.Maybe the plot comes together in the later books and explains a bit more but if i dont care about the 'good guys' and the throne after 900+ pages then something is wrong. And am i the only one who thought that the Skaldi 'barbarians' were the most realistic people in the book? Those 'barbarians' seemed a lot less savage then those nympho freak nobles.Its sad that a book like this, and Anita Blake and Goodkind, get huge sales because sex sells. Literature and plot take a back seat because half naked covers and kinky S&M; sell. So while this book had a few things i enjoyed, like Guy and Jocelin, i cannot recommend it in the least."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There really is no way to describe how brilliant this story is in a single sitting, but I can say this: Jacqueline Carey is an absolute genius.I won't sit here and try to describe the extent of the story to its fullest, but it is one of the most intricate tales of espionage and conspiracy I've ever read, especially while so controlled from the point of view of a single character, Phedre no Deluanay.The greatest part about this story is that she takes the first person narrative to a whole new level. She gives Phedre very prominant graces and abysmal flaws to her personality that not only define her as a character, not only define her as a person, but hook you with an emotional attachment and response to her that you scarcely find in any literature. She is beautiful, sharp, quick-witted, and intelligent, and that leaves you feeling proud of her growth as a person. But at the same time, she's haughty, self-centered, self-absorbed, selfish, and a repugnant elitist, and it leaves you wanting to pull her from the book and scream at her, telling her to get over herself, lol.And even with all of the deeply plotted conspiracy and trees of acquaintence and nemesis, even with Phedre's overwhelmingly powerful presence as a character and as a narrator, each individual supporting role is given enough attention to detail as to be convinving and intriguing, each in their own right.The story moves you to the point where you can't put it down, to the point where you actually feel that a 912 page book is actually too short, and rejoice that it continues the legacy in a series of sequels. Even things that might have once gotten a different reaction from you take charge in a new way when told in this story. Normally, homosexual scenes make me uncomfortable, but they were classy, moving, appropriate, and captivating to the point where even I could celebrate their meaning and impact in this context.To put it simply, this is a must read. Carey's genius actually rivals if not dwarfs the great Lord of the Rings fantasy epic, and that's a bold statement, but I stand behind it. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was leery of this book at first, but I was soon surprised. Not only is Carey's novel imaginative and fresh additional to a sometimes forumlaic genre, but it's also well plotted with excellent characterization. This book is low fantasy but epic, set in a world resembling Renassaince Europe. The heroine is a courtesean and spy and the novel follows her growth from an abandoned child to a highly prized lady of the night to an ambassador for the queen.I wouldn't recommend this book to people who are squeamish about sex; the main character is a prostitute after all, and she had an affinity for pain. The sex scenes are well-written and erotic though, and they avoid romance novel cliches. The novel also contains several homosexual characters (in Carey's world homosexuality is not frowned upon), which might bother some readers also. I would also tell impaitent readers to leave it on the shelf; the plot is excellent but takes time to develop and the main character's development is subtle enough to seem slow in places.Overall I would highly recommend this book to any lover of fantasy, historical or speculative fiction. It's engrossing enough to keep you up all night."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Let me first say that \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is my favorite book ever. When I first saw this on my recommendations, I wrote it off as another generic fantasy novella, and thought more of it. Thank heavens I had better sense while browsing around a bookstore one day and decided to buy it.Phedre no Delaunay, the book's heroine, is wonderful. She avoids falling into the trap of being a flat, paper character thanks to Carey's magnificent writing style. Although she may look perfect-gorgeous, intelligent, submissive and persevering-Phedre also has all-too-human flaws. Readers will find themselves loving her because of these flaws, rather than in spite of them.The plot is nothing short of an epic. With an alternative religion, a reworked globe, and a unique society, Carey weaves a spellbinding world of intrigue and lust. Trained as a spy, Phedre wins her patrons' hearts, and with it, their secrets. With one patron in particular, she got more than she bargained for.Betrayed into slavery, her adopted family brutally slain, Phedre is desperate. Using her wiles and cunning intelligence, she learns of a diabolical plot to invade her homeland, the country she loves more than life itself. With her companion at her side, she battles her way through blizzards and mountains, intrigue and treachery, to try to save the only home she's ever known.With \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" Carey takes up a very ambitious role for a green writer. She more than exceeds expectations. This book is one meant to be read over and over, as it never gets old. Long after you've finished the book, you will find yourself imagining the characters playing out scenes in your head. And that is truly a sign of a magnificent book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Simply a wonderful, refreshing read. It took patience to stick with at first since the world of politics is always an entangled one but, it is so important to understanding the intricacies of the plot. It was worth my hanging in as it all comes so much easier as the book propels forward. When I was finished...I simply had to get the others in the series. The characters are uncomplicated and Ms. Carey's weaving of imagery provides a seventh sense of \\"being there\\" element. Phedre is a conceptionally original heroine, she is so unique in this genre and Ms. Carey's ability to write her in the first person is wholly and completely entertaining. The sexual aspect of the story was stirring as it gave a respectful recognition to those amongst us who are more unconventional in our practices. While I tend to be a Science Fiction reader and not a Fantasy reader I can't say enough about this book or this series other than you simply have to read it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This series is by far the best that I've read. I've read several reviews that feel the books are confusing and that the authur is trying to sound smart. I highly disagree. I found that the Kushiel books are very well thought out. They contain a mixture of romance, adventure, political intrigue, humanity and humility that I have found in very few books. I enjoyed the fantasy world that in many was parrelled our own histroy. I found the \\"s&m\\" type sexual scenes were provocative and added to the characters strength. I hope that Carey will give us more books of this caliber and soon! I encourage that those that are interensted in fantasy, romance, and/or historical fiction read these books."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, I bought this becaue I had read it had an interesting view of sex and gender. It does, in spades, but more I liked it for its religion and caste system, it's politics. It's rare in speculative fiction, especially in fantasy for religion to play such an important part. But Phedre is a Servant of Naamah and Joscelin is a Cassaline Brother, both are serving gods with their oaths as best they can. It is a fascinating world Carey has written and I recommend it wholeheartedly.Love as thou wilt."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the first of three volumes (so far) in what has to be the most unconventional fantasy series I've ever read. Unconventional because the heroine, Phedre no Delaunay, is everything you'd expect in a series of this kind - she's beautiful, smart, and intuitive. And she also happens to be a courtesan, trained in both gathering intelligence and in the darker side of giving pleasure. To put it bluntly, she's a high-priced S&amp;M call girl who's also something of a spy.Rather an unusual combination and occupation, but Carey makes Phedre, her world and fellow travellers, and her story entirely believable. She describes Phedre, her companion Joscelin, and all the other characters of her world in great detail without going overboard - and the story she has to tell is just as detailed and believable.What makes this even more incredible is that despite the fact that this is a fantasy, Carey tells her story with a bare minimum of magic. There are only two characters in the story who display any magical talent - Hyacinthe, Phedre's friend from childhood who's clairvoyant (what Carey's characters refer to as the dromonde); and the Master of the Straits - an 800-year-old victim of a mysterious curse who magically controls a vital waterway and whose permission must be obtained to cross it.The history and geography Carey gives for her world is close to our own. She gives her countries different names, and parallels the story of Jesus up to a point - but she then takes a left turn and provides her own mythology, which she makes frequent use of as background to her tale.It took me two weeks to finish this book. Part of the reason was that it's long - just over 900 pages. But most of it is due to the excellent way Carey writes and tells Phedre's story. I hope the other two volumes of this series are just as good."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart began with difficult imagery, but after the second chapter it became a real page turner. I find myself agreeing with some of the other reviewers about its flaws, but if one isn't particularly judgemental about the character's sexual preferences the story stands well on its own.It is true that the story is told from Phedre's point of view in such a manner that one can only discover the plot in written word, regardless of how obvious events may be, when the main character herself finds them. Sadly, it's my opinion that this is a limitation of the first-person point of view, not the author's plot design. Generally the story was creative enough that I did not correctly second-guess every turn of event, and I doubt most people would either.This book, however, was written for a certain type of person. It relies heavily on the worship of forms (Socrates and his belief in a universal beautiful, etc), the idea that the reader hungers to read of a people who are \\"perfect\\". In this manner, I found the book to be more high fantasy than most of the reading I've gotten my hands on in the past five years or so. Though this appreciation extends to S&M;, which I'm sure causes a great deal of the core revulsion in several readers who cannot fit such things into their value systems as \\"beautiful\\", it isn't particularly offensive to the person without prejudice to those types of sexuality. Kushiel's Dart smoothes over literal events in the bedroom and betrays less than 99% of the romance novels I've read.There are always people who walk into reading a book of this nature with previous feeling that the values presented are fundamentally wrong. For this reason, though the book rates high for an overall read, I would caution anyone who actively disapproves of or dislikes S&M;."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read this book after noticing the second in the series, which has a very sexy cover (Kushiel's Chosen), and wondering what IT was about. I'm not a big fan of \\"fantasy\\" novels, but I enjoyed this one. And I kept trying to figure out which real medieval countries and nationalities and people the fantasy ones corresponded with. The story had enough romance, court and political intrigue, and adventure to keep me turning pages long into the night several times. Phaedre is a unique and engaging heroine, although her perfection and zeal was a little hard to swallow sometimes. The author includes an exhausive list of characters and their relationships, and I think it would have been helpful if she had given a little more background on the \\"religious\\" characters and their traits. If you enjoyed the \\"Outlander\\" series by Diana Gabaldon, you'll probably enjoy this book. I can't wait to read \\"Kushiel's Chosen\\"!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The rave on the back cover from Publisher's Weekly compares Kushiel's Dart to \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" while the synopsis immeadiately below compares it with Frank Herbert's \\"Dune!\\" Right then, I knew I had to read it. However, it reminded me more of Mary Gentle's \\"Rats and Gargoyles\\" - a Rennaisance world at once our own and at the same time, clearly not, whose diseased beauty is rotten to the core with human bondage, hedonistic religions, and depraved nobles playing games with human lives. All the more unfortunate since it's a world you don't want to leave once you're there.Carey depicts a kingdom which the locals believed to have been founded by a group of wandering angels who left heaven to protect and serve Elua - a divine outcast searching for his place in the universe. One of these angels -Kushiel- specialized in pain and punishment and every now and then, he will mark a mortal from birth to be his chosen. Such a person is cursed to a lifetime of masochism. Phedre is the latest such individual, and is raised to live a double life as both an expensive prostitute and a master spy. While she enjoys her work, her strange gift and the truly disturbing people who covet her for it quickly catapult her into a series of earth-shaking events and conspiracies which threaten to change the face of the entire world.This is a character driven story and I admire Carey for depicting her eccentric - and often very ugly - characters as completely human. Despite all the kinky sex, murderous betrayals, and courtly intrigue, no one is ever really a shining saint or a cacklin, black-hearted villain. Love or hate the characters she introduces, you understand them and they are all the more beautiful (or frightening) for it.Another thing which kept my attention was Carey's cunning use of foreshadowing. Phedre's first-person narrative is frequently peppered with allusions to peoples' fates along the lines of: \\"He was so happy that day. If he'd known what it meant, he wouldn't have been. But that was later.\\" These warnings come frequently enough to keep suspense piqued, but just seldom enough that whenever the hinted-at event finally does come, the reader is still stunned to see it happen.All in all, this is an amazing and engrossing debut which I could not put down. Anyone expecting nine-hundred pages of steamy, explicit erotica will be disappointed, but less truly is more in Carey's writing, and the sparesness with which Phedre recounts the frequent trysts makes them all the more unsettling. It's not a book for everyone, but neither is it so offensive that I'd tell anyone not to read it. Such is Carey's skill that I found myself judging the characters by their cultural standards of morality, not my own. No easy task for a writer by any means. Definately a worthy read, and likely a re-read as well."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Wow. I think I'm in love. Phedre no Delaunay may be the most unique and interesting heroine ever written. Masochist, bisexual, prostitute, spy, prisoner, ambassador... she is all of these and more.Phedre's world shares our own history right up until the death of Jesus, when Jesus's blood, mingled with the tears of Mary Magdalene and the soil of Mother Earth, gives birth to a new savior, Elua. Together with his seven chosen angelic companions (including Naamah, who prostitutes herself to save him, and Kushiel, a former punisher of sinners) found the kingdom of Terre d'Ange, mingling their immortal blood with humans according to Elua's decree: \\"Love as thou wilt.\\" A beautiful philosophy, and one that creates a land where sexuality in all its forms is holy, natural, and accepted. I found the d'Angeline religion fascinating, and a lovely backdrop for Phedre, who serves Naamah but has been chosen by Kushiel to find pleasure in pain. The first \\"anguissette\\" in three generations, she finds herself first a pawn and then a player in a deadly game of court intrigue.The book is almost divided in half. The first, \\"pawn\\" half, focuses more on Phedre's education, both sensual and intellectual. Her teacher, Anafiel Delaunay, uses her as a spy, for reasons he won't entirely reveal to her. There are some graphically erotic scenes with Phedre's patrons, and whispers and intimations of plots and intrigues both past and present.By the second half, Phedre is on her own, and must use what she's learned as she is cast out of home and country, first as a prisoner to the barbaric Skaldi (Norseman/Viking/Goth counterparts), then as an ambassador to the Albans and Cruithne (Celtic counterparts). This is where her personality finally takes shape, and although, as she laments, Kushiel's Dart never stops pricking, she uses her bedroom skills shrewdly and for a greater purpose.Erotic, imaginative, lushly beautiful, intelligent... all these things and more describe both Phedre and this book. The villainess is seductive, the good guys are all too human, and everyone in between has their own motivations. With both a rousing climax (no pun intended) and enough strings left tantalizingly loose to make you eager for the sequel, it balances perfectly the edge between \\"good enough on its own\\" and \\"set-up for the rest of the series\\". Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In some ways, this is an inventive book. Carey envisions a society that far from denigrating the business of sex-for-hire, instead details one that embraces it; where there are thirteen Houses as an established part of the society, each of which specializes in a different area of sexual gratification, and trains their candidates from a very early age in all the arts of love, entertainment, and impeccable personal service.She places this inventiveness against an alternate history background of Europe, which seems to have as its major demarcation point from our own history the defeat of the Roman forces by a united force of Picts. Within this history, the field of countries and societies she paints is a very standard semi-fuedal middlle-ages level of technology and monarchies, complete with all the standard court intrigues associated with that era. This is probably the main point of failure of this book, as to present the intrigue, she parades a host of characters to the reader's eyes early in the book - far too many of them, with few early clues as to which of these characters are important and which are mere spear-carriers. There is nothing new in this intrigue; it's still the age-old story of individuals grasping for the power of a crown by any means possible. What is new is her use of Phedre, a lady marked from birth as belonging to the House of Kushiel, which specializes in the S&M; brand of sex, as a fantasy incarnation of Mata Hari, using her training and own sexual inclinations as the lever to pry important information about all the various plots from her clients.Phedre, from whose viewpoint the story is told, is a well drawn character. Also competently drawn are those who are closest to her, Delaunay, her patron and owner; Alcuin, her male counterpart; Joscelin, her ascetic martial-arts trained protector; and Hyacinthe, her gypsy-like friend. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters are only sketchily drawn, leaving me with little insight into the motivations of those grasping for power. Melisande, as the chief web-master of all the convoluted plotting, cries out for a far deeper characterization than what is shown, and if she had been so drawn, I think this would have been a much better book.The true fantasy elements of this book are few and don't really play a part in the story until almost 700 pages in; those looking for elves, dragons, and goblins need not bother with this book. Those looking for some titillation may also be disappointed, as Carey's description of Phedre's various sexual encounters are only mildly graphic and have far more emphasis on the use of pain than many people may be comfortable with.I found the prose style to be somewhat artificial, an attempt perhaps to re-create the lushness and verbosity of some eighteenth-century romances. It is this style, more than anything else, which leads to the 900 page length of this book. Far too often, Phedre would state \\"I don't really remember what else happened that night\\" and then proceed to give three paragraphs of description of those happenings. A more direct style would have probably reduced it to 600 pages, made it easier to follow, and held my interest better.An interesting idea, a personable main character that I could empathize with, but a story and setting that are just too commonplace, told with too many words to make this a gripping read.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the best fantasy book I've read in a long time, hands down -- although calling it a fantasy is a bit of a stretch at times. There's very little magic involved and it reads more as an alternate history. So, it kept my attention with a strong narrative and highly interesting characters.The main character, Phedre, who tells the story, is a complex character not always happy (but quite often so) with her lot in life, that of a courtesan who enjoys sex no matter what the circumstances, including extreme pain. Once this &quot;gift&quot; is recognized as a young girl, she's raised to take advantage of it to get information out of high-ranking officials, while enjoying herself in the process.The story winds into many places, eventually taking her all over the known world. But the journey doesn't detract from the story, but rather adds facets to Phedre's personality, also enabling her to make many friends and enemies who enrich the story.I'm sure this story isn't for everyone. The sex is explicit and often violent. While it's more character-driven than plot-driven, there's a definite goal and resolution to the story. I'm very much looking forward to future books from this author and I want to thank her for writing a book I'm not going to have to wait for a year or more for a resolution to."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Ok, yes, I am one of those people who raves madly about this book. However, I would also like to put out a call to all of those who hated it merely for its emphasis on sexuality. The blurb on the book states that Phedre's sexuality is tightly wound up in pain, and yet many readers seem surprised when they learn this to be true! However, just because the sexuality of this world often drives the plot in directions which are \\"not for the faint of heart\\" (I quote the reviews INSIDE the book itself) does not mean that there is nothing behind the S&M; scenes. In fact, Phedre is a cunningly wrought heroine who faces her world with dignity, even when she falls into the depths of utter depression at her failures. And she does fail sometimes, which is part of what makes her so endearing.And yes, this is a feminist novel. Just because many women do not feel inclined to practice BDSM does not mean that such women are not out there. The point of feminism is to teach the world that women can be whatever they feel like being. Feminism is NOT telling women how they should act in order to best represent themselves to men. In fact, that dose of individuality which Phedre enjoys could be said to be a lesson to ALL people, regardless of sex or sexuality.\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is not for everyone. It is at times explicit in its sex scenes. However, it is just as explicit in its heart-wrenching emotions and its gut-wrenching hardships. Carey knows how to bring you into a story and make you care about characters which may be entirely alien to you. SHE never confuses an open mind with an open mouth."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I absolutely love this book and the books after it. I think they're beautifully and eloquently written, and I personally found them easy to read. If you're used to books written on a 6th grade reading level, then no, this book isn't for you. Where some authors use a paragraph or more to describe a physical setting, Carey conveys emotions, sights, smells, etc in a sentence or two. I just really admire her style of writing and how well it complements her story. I feel it's also a well balanced novel. Phedre, the main character, is a highly trained courtesan with a proclivity for pain, but also a keen intelligence geared towards spying for her master and teacher. Some erotic scenes are described in detail, but if you're looking for a trashy novel, this isn't it. Although Phedre is a prostitute, her life evolves around much more than sex, and intrigues are complex and very widespread, requiring her talents outside the bedroom as often as inside."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book has so many different levels that I sometimes felt almost dizzy. On one hand it is a sensual tale set in a place and time where beauty and sensuality is everything and the only rule is \\"Love as thou will\\". The sensuality and freedom that this land offers is heady reading and enjoyable in it's own right. But on top of that the story becomes one of political intrigue, royal secrets and ploys. This adds to the book's excitement and keeps the pages flying late into the night. Then suddenly there is an added bonus of a darn good adventure story, where the sensualist heroine and her moral bound companion must survive through slavery and a wildrness journey of adversity and hardship. AND THEN...the story turns again, now becoming a tale of war and leadership and politics. Yes, it's a dizzying ride, but well worth it for the unique and unforgettable characters and master crafted story telling.Overall, the story for me was one of power. The power exchanges between the BDSM-driven heroine and her patrons, the unifying and sometimes merciless power of leaders, the struggle for power from those who crave it. The book is a beautiful description of protagonists who at first seem to lack power (by circumstance or by choice), but manage to rise well above themselves and become forces to be reckoned with. It kept me reading way after my bedtime and has stayed with me long after I turned the last page.Certainly one that I will re-read in years to come."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Not an easy trilogy to describe. It certainly is not like anything else out there. There maybe comparisons, but nothing is quite like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel trilogy.The words sexy and intelligent come to mind. Elegant. Beautiful, dangerous. Fancy, but also real, because all characters have the capacity to grow beyond the rigidity of their beliefs.Phedre is a woman marked by the gods with a red speck of color in one eye. She is beautiful beyond compare, but the mark is considered a curse upon its barer. It is called Kushiel's Dart. Phedre is the first to be thus afflicted in many generations and, because she is, she is shunned, sold into servitude and raised with the awareness of being marred beyond repair. Until, that is, her path crosses with a person who recognizes the mark and sees Phedre's potential.So what is Kushiel's Dart? It gives one the ability to find physical, sexual pleasure in pain - both physical and emotional. It sets Phedre well apart and gives her a unique place in a society that embraces sexuality, ornamented with religion, ritual, education, art, wealth and status. The society of Terre d'Ange is exquisite, refined - both original and believable.Anafiel Delauney is the man who raises Phedre from indenture. He is an incomparably interesting, complex character. Delauney is a nobleman, but not in favor with the royal court for certain indiscretions in his past. He has an interesting amount of influence over the goings on of the society, yet you are forever wondering why and how. A part of the how is Phedre. Aside from continuing their education in all matters sexual, Delauney trains Phedre and Alcuin, a young man of his household, to be elegant, cultured, intelligent and irresistible spies.There is so much delicious intrigue in this work, so much fun, so much playacting and indulging one's impulses... and so much real danger, real loss, real love. The characters are so well defined, their voices so very distinct. Phedre, Delauney, Alcuin, Joscelin - Phedre's reluctant protector, Hyacinthe - her best and oldest friend, Cecilie - Phedre and Alcuin's teacher in the arts of... Well. There is much, here - too much to tell.The books - all three of them - are lovely. They have complexity, beauty, depth. Carey has that rare gift of being able to fully allow for her readers' intelligence as well as that of her characters. Another rarity - the series begins on a phenomenal note and gets much, much better. Savor it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I first saw this book as I stood in line at the local (bookstore) and the cover immediately caught my eye. Having an interest in architechture, any book with columns on the cover automatically interest me and the striking figure of the nude woman with a beautiful tattoo didn't hurt the appeal either. But the blurb on the inside cover about Phedre, a courtesan with a heart of gold had me rolling my eyes thinking it was another book selling sex rather than substance.So imagine my surprise when I finally picked up the book six months later and discovered that the plot and characters drove the book not kinky sex. Phedre was born with a red speck in her left eye. This made unsuitable to be an adept of the Night Court, which is comprised of thirteen houses of prostitution each catering to a special taste. In the alternate history of this world, the citizens of Terre d'Ange believe in an offshot of chirstianity that worships Elua the child that sprung from mother earth when Mary Magdalene's tears mixed with Christ's blood. Elua preached free love and with the eight angles that were his followers he settled in the country of Terre d'Ange, our present day France.Phedre grows up being the outsider in the Night Court until one day a nobleman named Delaunay recognizes the red speck as Kushiel's dart, a sign that she has been chosen by Kushiel, the angle that inflicts pain on sinners. As such Phedre derives pleasure from pain. Delaunay buys Phedre and trains her to be a spy while making her the most expensive courtesan in history. In her dealing with her clients she learns a secret that threatens her country and before she could inform the King she was kidnapped and sold into slavery in Skaldia. The rest of story deals with her journey back to Terre d'Ange and her role in saving her country. Along the way she relies on the help of her bodyguard a Cassiline priest-warrior, a gypsy like Tsingani, and warriors from Alba (England) and Eire (Ireland).The atmosphere of the court is suitably Machiavellian, the villian and villianess multidimensional, and the customs rich and complex. I could wish the author go a bit lighter on the foreshadowing, since it gives away a lot of surprising turns in the story. Phedre is an intriguing heroine that defies classification. Her story is poigant without being mushy.It is her interesting tastes in sex that provide the book with its graphic moments. There are s&m; scenes that might offend some people, but they are well done and not overly graphic.The book is great as a stand alone but the author has plans for a trilogy. The second book Kushiel's Chosen will be out in Apirl 2002 and she is doing research on Egypt for the third book. I know I'll be waiting eagerly for the second installment."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey has an outstanding fiction debut in 'Kushiel's Dart'. Her plot is fascinating and keeps the reader involved at all times. Her characters are real and believable with a depth that's not often seen in fantasy novels.Her world is a fascinating one. At first it appears to be a world where sensuality rules all. Youngsters are trained in sensual arts to the exclusion of much else (except for the protagonist). Such a striking contrast to our world! Yet as the novel progresses the main character, Phedre, is reviled by many for being a whore. The two views are so different that I found it difficult to believe in Carey's fictional society. But that was a minor quibble and certainly did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.Another thing I noticed while reading the book was its familiarity. At various times 'Kushiel's Dart' read like novels by Lynn Flewelling, George R.R. Martin, Bernard Cornwell, &amp; Anne Bishop. When Phedre lives among the barbarians it read much like Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles. When Phedre was dabbling in political intrigue it reminded me of George R.R. Martin's epic 'Fire and Ice' series. Delauney's tutelage of Phedre was very similar to Flewelling's 'Nightrunner' books.Taken as a whole this is a successful novel. There are no flat moments. As I mentioned earlier, both the plot and characters are fascinating and believable. Most refreshingly, this is a stand-alone novel. There are hints of a future novel, but this is unlike the dozens of interminable never-ending series. This will most assuredly be one of the best fantasy debuts of 2001. Recommended."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"_Kushiel's Dart_ is a very long novel set in an Alternate History/Fantasy version of France. The divergence happens when Jesus (Yeshua) has a child by Mary Magdalene. This child, Elua, believes that the supreme command is to \\"Love as thou wilt\\". Elua and his seven companions, who are held to be angels, wander the Earth, finally settling in Terre D'Ange (France). Carey does a good job of presenting D'Angeline beliefs as real beliefs, while leaving open the likelihood that they are semi-mythological. (E.g., Elua's companions are believed to be angels, but, one might assume, they were actually just humans he recruited.) D'Angelines hold themselves to be preternaturally beautiful -- because they are descended from Elua and from angels.The narrator and heroine is Phedre no Delaunay. She is fostered to Cereus House, one of the Thirteen Houses (a tradition D'Angeline high class brothel), but she is imperfect: the red mark in her eye makes her unacceptable to Cereus for their service. But as she comes of age, she is bought by a nobleman, Anafiel Delaunay, who recognizes that the red mark means she is an anguisette -- a natural masochist, and as such potentially a fabulously valuable prostitute for people of certain tastes. Under Delaunay, she learns a number of languages, and various other useful talents. It becomes clear that Delaunay, for mysterious reasons, wants her to be a spy on people in the highest circles of government. These reasons are surely related to Delaunay's friendship with the late son of the aging King, and to his enmity with this late Prince's also dead wife.The story develops from there, at great length. Phedre becomes famous in her profession, and learns many secrets for Delaunay, some quite tragic. Eventually she is driven to slavery in Skaldia (Germany) where she learns of a terrible plot against the rightful rulers of Terre D'Ange. With her faithful companion, a super swordsman vowed to celibacy, she journeys across much of Europe, trying to find a way to stop the Skaldian threat.The story is pretty enjoyable, and reads quite quickly for such a long book. Carey's prose is rather good, a bit ornate and mannered, but that is in keeping, I suppose, with the image of the people of Terre D'Ange. A number of the fantastical elements, such as the Master of the Straits, who keeps ships from passing between Terre D'Ange and Alba (i.e. Great Britain), are rather nicely imagined. The main fault is that about halfway through the book much of the tension leaches out. It becomes clear that Phedre and her companion Joscelin are superhuman and unkillable, and that really there is no way to stop them. Carey does a lot of things well -- she uses Phedre's submission quite effectively in creating a fairly unconventional heroine. But while for a while, pretty much through her time with the Skaldians, we really fear for her, and we feel that she is being heroically abused and that she is in real danger. After that, the novel moves into an extended sort of \\"Triumphal March\\". It's not that Phedre doesn't get abused some more, and it's not even that she won't suffer some real emotional loss. But the shape of the ending becomes very clear, and there really isn't any believable opposition to her achieving that ending. To complain just a bit more, I felt that the deep mysteries that Carey plants at the beginning were resolved too simply -- that is, Delaunay's secrets were actually kind of trivial, and the political intrigue wasn't quite twisty enough. I also felt that the blatant setup of a sequel, just before the end, weakened the book. The characters and setting nicely support this one long book -- I don't think they will support two more books of the same length."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This novel was amazing, it was thrilling how Phedre\` no Dalunay was a \\"whore's unwanted get.\\" How she came to be the hero of the novel.

These are just some of the elements you will find contained within Kushiel's Dart. I picked this novel up on a whim, as I am forever in search of good fantasy fiction, especially those with strong flawed female heroines.Phedre is a magnificant heroine. She is flawed, tormented by her God's mark to forver receive pleasure from pain, and yet seeking to do good. Her mentor, who bought her when she was but a girl uses her for her special gift and makes her a spy. Phedre and the other characters in this novel are as three dimensional and complex as the novel itself.Jacqueline Carey takes the story of Jesus Christ and transforms it into the story of Emanuel and his followers. The people that inhabit Phedre's world are descendant from Angels, and these Angels play a heavy hand in their life and culture. Phedre herself has been pierced by Kushiel, a mark visible to all because of the red mote in her left eye.Phedre's journey is only beginning in this novel that is full of court intrigue, deception, and betrayal. But even within these cruel elements there is love and tenderness, for sometimes even Phedre herself must use deception and betray those she cares for in order to what must be done.This novel is not for the faint of heart, as it is 800 plus pages. Length alone is not the only challenge this book presents, but the sheer complexity of the story requires excellent attention to detail.

The book is fast paced, and truly a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This well-written novel portrays an early Renaissance world, with a Europe similar but very distinct based upon alternate developments of gods and empires. But the tale is captivating, covering the childhood, education and early career of Phedre do Delauney. No ordinary heroine this, an anquisette, who derives pleasure from love and pain both. In the hands of most writers, this could break down into hokum and bad plot lines. But Ms. Carey delivers a tour-de-force that makes the heroine engaging and eminently believable. The repartes and sardonic humour between Phedre and Joselyn, her bodyguard, about her 'little thing,' add spice and humour to a rousing adventure story. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Up front let me say the first 100 or so pages are a tough read. Lots of history and unusual names to learn. BUT, after that... WOW! This is a fantastic book, that is very difficult to put down. The tale told in this book is enough in itself, I could have been happy with just the one book. But to know that I have two more to look forward too... I'm very excited. Once you start reading this book, don't let anything put you off. It may be a little disturbing to some early on, but once Phedre leaves her homeland for the first time the whole story changes and into a much higher gear.Can I give it more than 5 stars?To Mrs. Carey - thankyou for this wonderful book, I look forward to purchasing more from you in the future."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first almost third of the book was VERY slow, though neccessary to get everything established. If you make it past this point you won't be sorry, for the book (and its sequels) is fast paced from there on out. I usually don't read fantasy but I really liked this book because enough of it was believable and it wasn't too campy or wacky. Not only is Carey a great writer, but her plotline had EVERYTHING in it. Romance, action, adventure, suspense, with some sex thrown in. A lot of these reviews mention the scenes of masochistic sex Phedre (Fay-dra) actually takes pleasure in as maybe being too graphic for some readers to enjoy. In my opinion they weren't all that bad, and lacked the usual corny and pointlessness most sex scenes in books have. I recommend this book and the two that follow! Phedre is such an amazing female, not only is she horrendously clever, but she's like Houdini the way she manages to get herself out of impossible situations. I don't know who would be fitting to be cast as her in a movie, but Orlando Bloom would be the perfect Joscelin (even though this would be like resurrecting Legolas) and I thought of Rena Soufer whenever Melisande appeared."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I bought this book, I was a little wary of it being part of a trilogy. I wanted a self-contained novel. Nicely, Kushiel's Dart stands on its own.Phedre no Delaunay is an anguisette, a spy and a scholar. There is subtle magic on Phedre's world. She makes her way through life with stubborn determination, using whatever fate throws in her path. She is like a much darker &quot;Mistress of the Empire&quot;, the saga from Feist and Wurt.I was engrossed in the story. This is a page-turner. However, some of the scenes it describes are intended for mature audiences.I really enjoyed the characters, and now I am getting the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I personally liked this book. It is the first book I've read containing dark subjects like S&amp;M. However, it is essential to the story. I found the world very interesting. The fact that the world resembles Europe was interesting, and her twist on world history was fasinating. It makes it easier to understand the characters when one can relate them to actual people, something I find laking in most fantasy books.However, it can get a little sappy sometimes, almost to the point of wanting to toss my cookies.It's got, war, intrigue, magic, and romance. A dark fantasy worth losing a little sleep over. If your not frighteed by the darker elements (I've read worse) and are a little on a romantic side. This book is for you."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book, although I think I ended up liked Joscelin more than Phedre. I don't find the S&amp;M off putting at all, but then I write things that are much more descriptive than the things in this book. There were some great battle scenes and dramatic moments, and I felt a touch of true fear for some of the characters a time or two. I couldn't put this book down. Here's hoping certain things work out in the end!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me and, since I am a huge fantasy fan, it seemed like a good choice. I was interested through about two-thirds of the book, and then I just skimmed the last part. While the research and imagination that went into this book is impressive, it is far too slow and filled with all sorts of unecessary events and people. Parts of the book were certainly erotic, if you're into that sort of thing, but, by and large, it makes up a very small proportion of the book. The fact that this is part of a trilogy completely staggers me. I cannot imagine having to read two more of these to reach some sort of conclusion.Having said that, it certainly had redeeming features. The detail that went into the book was quite amazing and the imagination it takes to create a piece of this breadth is impressive. The relationship between Phedre and Jocelin is sweet, very touching, and it was the main reason that I might try to slog through the rest of the trilogy. If you like your fantasy sweeping and slow-paced with lavish detail, then this might be the book for you. If not, then I would try Guy Gavriel Kay, Neil Gaiman, or Laurell K. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Carey glosses over some of the more difficult parts of the book (i.e. battles or combat of any kind for that matter) which is interesting given a storyline that revolves in large part around war. I also got tired of thinking- hmmm it's a good thing this (insert evil characters name here) is totally undone by their lust for Phedre or she might not get out of this one. That happened over and over again, which leads me to the second thing that bugged me. Over the course of the novel Phedre somehow manages to screw virtually every character of any importance inside the storyline with the exception of those unfortunate enough to die early on. Does it ever even explain how she keeps from getting pregnant? Or how she keeps from catching a single disease? I also disliked the enormous lack of detail in parts of the novel where Carey was hurrying things to get to the next major event, usually Phedre having sexual relations or being physically abused with/by one of the other main characters. Anyways... As many of the other reviewers have pointed out the novel has quite a few strong suites as well. The storyline is original if predictable and Carey is obviously a talented writer. I wish Tor Books agreed with me that 90%Romance-10%Fantasy is not a Fantasy-Romance novel. It's a Romance with a few fantasy elements thrown in."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Great epic fantasy is successful when it takes you to places you have never entered before.Authors like George Martin,China Mieville, Robin Hobb, Steven Erikson and Goodkind are examples now add Jacqueline Carey name to this esteem list. &quot;When Love cast me out,it was Cruelty who took pity upon me.&quot; These words help start up this dark erotic epic fantasy that will take you to the kingdom of Terre d'Ange, a country born of angels where prostitution is a holy act and court intrigue is most lethal.You will see this through the eyes of unforgettable heroine,Phedre who is sold to the engimatic Delaunay to be trained as a courtesan and schooled in foreign languages and is to become Delaunay's spy.She will learn her nation's darkest secrets and deadiliest conspiracies.Phedre's adventures will take her to the beds of her country's most powerful men, to be sold to slavery to a barbarian king and savior of her homeland from a brutal invasion! This lavish epic fantasy is filled with scenes of disturbing sexuality as Phedre who gets sexual pleasure through use of pain, court intrigue as she uncovers a treasonous plots to overthrow the king.This novel also boasts casts of characters like the warrior priest,Joscelin who vows to protect Phedre as he loses his heart toward her.The Noble Anafiel Delaunay, Phedre's owner who teaches her to become a master spy for his agendas.Hyacinthe,Phedre's kind-hearted friend who is the prince of travelers and to save his homeland will make a heartbreaking sacrifice and the power hungry Skaldian warlord, Waldemar who seeks to conquer Terre d'ange and the brilliant but utterly ruthless villianess, Melisandre who use machivellian manuvers in quest for ultimate power.Carey has the ability to tell scenes of disturbing sensuality and sweeping battle scenes.Carey's world-building abilities are excellent.So pick up this book and enter Phedre's world of dark desire and darker intrigue.You will never forget the journey!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; at the suggestion of my best friend who was very impressed by it. We do have very similar tastes both in movies and books, so I thought: &quot;What the hell! If it has intrigue, alternate history, low - key fantasy feel *and* lesbian love scenes, it MUST be good! Right?&quot;Wrong. Even with all of this, I found the novel terrible. It drags for two or three hundred pages before the actual plot takes place. During that time, main character - a courtesaine named Phedre de Delauney - beside describing her childhood in Terre D'Ange, rambles on and on about how infinitely beautiful, refined and talented she and other people of her country are. By the 250th page I was practically shouting: &quot;I get it! You're the best damn looking people in the world! Could you now *please* get on with the plot?!&quot;Except that, when the plot starts, infinite perfection of the main characters prevents it from actually becoming interesting. I always enjoy reading about the characters with flaws which, faced with great obstacles, still somehow win the day. Of course, I allways know that the Heroes will win at the end but it's suspense that counts.Not in &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; it doesn't! Author is so in love with Phedre and her bodyguard Jocelyn, that she makes them almost laughably perfect. Phedre is so beautiful that she can make practically anyone do anything she wants, especially if that person - be it male or female, it doesn't matter - sleeps with her. As they usually do. On the other hand, Joscelyn is such a great fighter that he single - handedly and unarmed almost beats a dozen opponents in hand - to - hand combat. I mean, talk about overblown characters! The only part in which there is actuall supsnese is where they get sent to barbaric tribes in Germania and have to escape and find their way home.As for society and people of Terre D' Ange, they sound like something out of teenage girl's dreams: country filled with infinitely glamorous, talented and subtle men and women who like to talk about their feelings, cry when faced with great art and indiscriminately make love to each other. Their beauty is a result of them being the descendants of Blessed Elua (son of Jesus in this world) and his twelve angel companions who came to Terre D'Ange about thousand years ago.As for the sex part, it all comes down from the Elua's only command: &quot;Love as Thou Willst.&quot; What that means in the novel is that the author can happilly describe beautiful people having beautiful sex and still claim that it servers the plot or to establish the feel of that country's culture. No ugly people or ugly sex in this novel, kids! We wouldn't like something like reality to spoil our little fantasy, now would we? Of course, there is some S&M; sex, but it is usually described in very... mellow way and Phedre does seem to like it, so there you go.What we basically have here is a novel about very subtle people that still fails to be subtle itself: main characters are perfect in every aspect while main adversary is evil for pure evilness' sake. It is also a novel about infinitely sexually liberal society that still fails to be sexually liberal: it only describes the forms of sex the average reader would actually appreciate. The worst things are lesbian sex (Oh, the humanity!) and aforementioned mellow S&M;."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There are enough reviews on this product that I would rather push a prospective buyer who is on the fence.The protagonist of Kushiel's Dart is a Mary Sue risen from a sort of poverty (bondage, as it were). She is so beautiful that mortals look upon her countenance with envy, so sexually desirable that every King, Queen, and noble would step over Helen of Troy for a chance with her, so scholarly that she knows more languages and poetry than the actual scholars of the realm, so clever that she never reads another person incorrectly, so physically fit that she can scale buildings and cross countries on foot, so stealthy that she is never noticed when she doesn't want to be, and so hardcore that she need never use her safe word.It is a recommended buy if:- You are looking for a feel good read with BDSM overtones. It might be a nice gift for the sub who has been having a bad week.- You are interested in roleplaying (online or *cough* not) from the thirteen special pleasure houses introduced in this book.- You enjoy the flowery beauty of \\"le France\\".I don't recommend this book if:- You want at least one of over 900 mass market pages to be thought provoking.- Verbose, flowery language with inconsistent narrative tone makes you queasy. (Present, past, and future do not mean much in this narration, and the snarky asides do not help in this matter.)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I saw this on the shelf at an out of the way bookstore and thought, \\"Now that might be interesting.\\" But I wasn't expecting it to be enthralling. The story is wonderful and exciting. Phedre isn't exactly what a person would normal think of as a heroine but she fills the role beautifully. Phedre is a anguisette, meaning that she is person born to bear pain as pleasure. We get to watch this person grow from a small child to a highly paid courtesan, to a comtess. We also get to watch personal struggles between her and loved ones. Add a wild goose chase and a plot against the throne and we have a thrilling read! Don't be fooled by the nay-sayers that have posted reviews. They must not have been reading properly. One such review stated that Phedre's arch enemy revealed a secret to her in the afterglow of sex. This isn't true at all. They weren't arch enemies and he only named his benefactor. The people that didn't take the time to get the facts straight aren't going to like the book. It does require some amount of creative thinking to make sense."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In response to P. Robinson's (\\"Relic113\\") review: first of all, etiology refers to the origins of diseases. The word you want is etymology, and I challenge you to list one word Carey uses in Kushiel's Dart that is not based on an actual word from a living or dead language. Yes, the character's name is Phedre no Delaunay - Phedre of the House of Delaunay. Not a big mystery there. Also, none of the sex scenes in the book are anywhere near eight pages long - most of them are a page or two at the most.Perhaps we didn't read the same book. Or maybe, if polysyllabic words like \\"anguisette\\" and \\"languisement\\" are confusing to you, I can recommend an excellent book that one of your peers introduced me to - \\"My Pet Goat.\\";-)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have not read anything remotely like this, before--except, perhaps, \\"Mia,\\" many years ago, which has a similar feel, to some degree. However, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is so much more EPIC than anything I have read other than Sword & Sorcery type fiction novels.... It seems to be it's own genre.I have been trying to think of how to review this book, and other people have certainly listed the over-all scenario, religious feel, etc.--however, something I noticed, immediately, is that \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" would probably be much more appealing to Thelemites, than Christians. There is certainly a pseudo- Christian (Gnostic Christian) feel to certain religions depicted in the book. Yet, the \\"Love as thou wilt\\" attitude and admonishment speaks of Thelema (Aliester Crowley often used the catch phrase: \\"Do What Thout Wilt Shall Be The Whole of The Law: Love is The Law, Love Under Will\\"). In fact, I felt many scenes of the story depicted a very Thelemic religious context.Regardless, aside from all the pantheons, religions and such, the story is engrossing in its depiction of a young, unwanted little girl rising through the social system and being singled-out by a very brilliant man who teaches her the inticacies of society and intrigue, as she is also learning about the delicacies and torment of the flesh.This lady struggles to rise from the level of slavery, yet craves being a slave, longing for the master's whip. She is caught-up in a world of seeming chaos, that is actually orchestrated by the whims of Nobility. There are many seeming contradictions and plot twists, many names to keep track of, and a few Conundrums waiting to be solved.This book captivated me through many flights and airport waiting areas--it was difficult to put-down and I recall staying in many nights, reading in hotel rooms, instead of going out in a new city. The story pulled me in and I was thankful that sequels are available. I did not want the story to end.This is the only \\"epic fantasy\\" novel (other than \\"Mia\\") I have ever read that did not have the usual Tolkienesque or Terry Brooks style characters. However, there are some surprises, which I will not ruin."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"How can a person's mind and soul be so thoroughly drained and depleted while concurrently being replenished to the point of overflow? Thank you, Ms. Carey for providing this reader with the answer to that question. In this compelling epic, the author draws upon many classical literary traditions and introduces the reading world to her own intriguing concepts and artful methods, the combination of which, leaves the reader begging for more. The language used to bind it together and to set the tempo is one of Carey's greatest strengths. It is as rich and eloquent as it is intelligent and playful. And if the author's command of language is powerful in its own right, then her intimacy with the subtle ways in which it can be used to send the reader on his own journey within the story is a gift as rare as Phedre's scarlet birthmark. With &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; Jacqueline Carey drives toward the very nature of divinity and humanity, her story a celebration of the countless ways in which the two inter-relate. Carey's gift to the reader is not only that of a well-crafted tale. She uses the story to let the reader experience for himself the magnitude of mortality and immortality. Carey draws a map to the place where Art and Beauty are housed, then she leaves the reader with the key to the front door to come inside and explore; to &quot;Love as thou wilt.&quot;"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There were WAY too many names in this book for me to keep track of. I realize that most people don't have as much difficulty with this as I do, which is why I gave two stars instead of one, but I can't help that it colored my opinion. I had an impossible time following who was backstabbing who, which made me concentrate on faults that I normally would have let slide. The sex scenes are boring, the characters are cookie-cutter, and the author rambles on and on and on. It gets some points for having a *slightly* more original setting than many other fantasy series, and for not using magic as a trump card in every scene, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A spine tingling, toe curling, heart racing, tear jerking, novel that keeps you up way past bedtime just to find out what happens next and why. This story runs the gamut of emotions, and makes you feel each and every one with it's intense descriptions of people, places, events, and actions. Definately not intended for the close minded individual. If you think you're open minded, this book could make you rethink just how accepting you are to alternate lifestyles. Leave your inhibitions at the cash register if you take this book home. If you open the cover, you bettter have opened your mind beforehand."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was disappointing.1) Didn't live up to its interesting premise.While Carey's idea of a masochistic courtesan (or bluntly, prostitute), using her \\"extreme\\" charms to lure her victims into revealing her political secrets is interesting, it simply isn't treated well. Either Phedre has some kind of brain-washing pheromone or all the people in the novel who fall under her spell (which would be more or less everyone she meets) are simply... idiots. Grarrr. See beautiful woman. Beat/flay/whip/whatever beautiful woman. Get off. Do everything she wants.Additionally, despite the accoutrements of torture, whipping, flechettes, tying this and tying that, none of Phedre's patrons come across as actually having a great time in the process.Especially compared to Storm Constantine's Calanthe from her Wraethu ?sp? series - Carey's characters are simply depthless projections who fall flat. (Constantine's not for everyone, but even those who dislike her will probably find her far superior to Carey.)2) No engaging charactersI read this book from start to finish hoping that it would get better - simply because a good friend liked it. Not only did it not get better, there was simply, at the end of the book, no one I gave a fig about. Yes, I was happy on finishing this book - overwhelming relief at being done with it!3) Incredibly bland treatment of BDSMCarey's BDSM scenes are so bland that they might as well not be sex. The language is stilted, unevocative and undescriptive all at the same time.For lyrically erotic renditions, there's Tanith Lee's style, for graphically erotic treatments, there's Anne Rice (whom I dislike for other reasons, but at least she can write erotica that fulfills its purpose), for sex (and BDSM, no less) less engaging than doing the dishes, there's Carey.To be honest, you can find better sex in text-based online communities than anything Carey wrote in this book.4) Waste of Nephilim research / references.This one is a pet peeve with me. I've quite an interest in the Watchers/Nephilim, and to see Carey use what is obviously a fairly detailed knowledge of the associated mythology and boil it simply down to 'sex is good and we're the most beautiful people ever to exist because we're descended from angels' breaks my heart. Particularly because it's rarer to use Nephilim references than it is to use the others she did. Irish, Norse, etc.Jim Butcher's fallen angel, Lasciel, in his Dresden Files series, is in ONE SENTENCE, more convincing, more interesting and more real than any single person OR god in Carey's novel when she (Butcher's Lasciel) says to the protagonist whom she's arguably trying to possess (in the demonic sense), (bear with me, it's a paraphrase) 'So you find the idea of being subject to someone's objectives and desires, completely different from your own, of being without free will - repulsive? Believe me, there are none who know this more keenly than the Fallen.'This is not a one track mind sex-puppet of a god/angel talking... But sadly there's not even one line like it in Carey's novel....I could go on and on but - suffice to say this book was a waste of time for me, and I won't be reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Moves slower than molasses! I read a short story by Jacquiline Carey and loved it, but it just doesn't translate into a full length novel. Ms. Carey is constantly hinting at what's to come, but never seems to get to the point, and I feel no empathy whatsoever for any of the characters. I feel like I've been reading this story for months, but am only 30% done on my Kindle - yikes! Unfortunately, this will be a book I'll finish when I have nothing else to read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Pros: Some great characters. Adventure written by a woman. You get a certain excitement with a soft touch that most male writers don't really possess. Its kinda of like reading a pre-raphaelite.Cons: You could have lost about a quarter of this book, tightened up the plot and made it really good. What started out as a minor distraction got really annoying. If you called the people by what they were vikings, French, Italian, Irish, Romans, Greeks it would have been not so distracting. I found myself distracted trying to figure out which group was which, what point in history she was trying to mimic. It would have been better if Carey kept me on the plot. Carey's constant changing of tenses is annoying, but not distracting. She needs to learn to monitor her tenses. When you're in the past stay there, don't shift to future tense when you're trying to do foreshadowing. Also, I'm really tired of the word alacrity.Other: The main characters proclivity for BDSM for pay is probably disturbing for many (if not most) readers. I found the political intrigue interesting, but tiresome at times. Look, I'm a guy....if you get tired enough of it, just smack it with a sword."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart was quite a surprise to me. I was expectiing a lusty novel with little story line to support the book and came to read it only because of a friend. I will say now I will read more referrals in the future and leave my skepticism at the cover of the book.Kushiel's Dart is a well written political erotic fantasy told through the eyes of a female protagonist named Phedre(Faydra). It is vast in scope and can be overwhelming in the earlier chapters, but keep turning the pages because what unfolds is well worth wading through the confusion.Phedre's life is described from child to adult living in the land of Terra D'Ange and through this progression we as readers are rewarded at seeing the changes the lead of this book undergoes.As a child she is sold to a wealthy intellectual that basically makes her go to school each day and learn large array of languages, lineages and history to equip her for the remainder of the book.As Phedre matures to early womanhood the skills of her mark \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" and the knowledge she has learned as a child are woven together to make a very efficient interrogator to the assignations she works with. Through this comes confusion which can dissuade the reader, because her guardian Delanuay lets her know nothing of what the knowledge she extracts means. Soon the plot changes to a faster pace as the royal houses start having turmoil and Phedre becomes free from her bond to Delanuay.Through the turmoil of the royal houses Phedra soon finds herself in the Skaldic barbarian lands which is a well described harsh arctic climate with brute barbaric tribes that reside their. Phedre soon uncovers a plot against the throne of her homeland and escapes to warn her beloved country.The plot is described to the queen of Terra D'Ange and Phedre soon is off to sea sailing to get help from the Draiday. I won't ruin the ending but know it is very climatic.Carey has a winner with this book engrossing the reader for a huge 900 page book. The lead is fantastic, I particularly like the fact it is a female, so many times I read books with women described as weak and helpless leaving the men to be the heroes. Phedre also has an outstanding support of characters that surround her and the reader is able to know each of them personally through Carey's brilliant characterization. I could not put this book down, in fact I would escape to lunch from work just to take time to squeeze in a few more chapters of this incredible book. I highly recommend this book it has something for everyone, even those that normally don't pick up this type book will enjoy Carey's debut."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre no Delaunay is sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond purchased by Anafiel Delauney (aka The Whoremaster of Spies), who recognises that the spot of blood in her eye marks her as one who is pricked by Kushiel's Dart (she experiences pain and pleasure as one - a masochist). She's trained as a courtesan, but is also taught how to observe and analyse what she sees - the tools of a spy. As Phedre's homeland of Terre d'Ange is drawn ever closer to conflict through treachery and betrayal, it will be up to Phedre to use all of the talents at her disposal to save what she holds dear.For me this book has one of the worst beginnings I have ever read. The first time I read it I think it took me over thirty starts before I managed to get past the first page. If you can bear with it this is a story that is well worth reading. I have pin-pointed the spot where I was drawn into the story - page 11 where Phedre finally stops talking about herself. And by page 343 I am totally absorbed in the cruelty and beauty of Terre d'Ange, just in time for Jacqueline Carey to rip my heart out via my throat - metaphorically speaking.I guess my main problem with the book is that I don't particularly like Phedre as a character. She has a severe case of Buffyitis only instead of 'I'm the slayer', it's 'I'm the anguisette'. Get over yourself already!If you haven't read the book you may want to know that most of the love scenes are of a sado-masochistic nature, so if that's not your sort of thing perhaps you should give this one a miss. Though in my opinion these scenes are beautifully written and necessary to the plot.This book has taught me that you don't need to love the protagonist in order to fall in love with the world she inhabits and the story she tells. Jacqueline Carey's worldbuilding is immaculate. Not only does she bring the myths, culture and beauty of Terre d'Ange to life. She takes us to the wild northern lands of Skaldia with a struggle for survival, and over the sea to the barbarian land of Alba and the battle for a stolen throne. This is an epic tale.More than anything it is the characters surrounding Phedre who fascinate me - Alcuin, Delaunay, Joscelin, Melisande and Hyacinthe - and the history of the land that she is witness to and part of. Jacqueline Carey draws us into this world and makes it real, her storytelling has a depth and lushness that pulls you in (if you can just get past those first few pages).Also available Kushiel's Chosen (book 2) and Kushiel's Avatar (book 3)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre no Delaunay is the unlucky daughter of a highborn courtesan and a minor nobleman who married in the face of community opposition. Phedre has been cursed with Kushiel's Dart, a scarlet mote in her left eye which marks her as a follower of Kushiel, a god whose worship involves pain. She is an anguisette, born to find sexual release in pain. Sold by her mother to an esteemed house of prostitution, Phedre's contract is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a mysterious aristocrat who will find a use for Phedre's talents. Pledged to protect the child heir to the throne of Terre D'Ange, Delaunay needs a courtesan he can groom as a spy. Phedre's unique predelictions provide her entre into the bedrooms of the most powerful men and women in the country. But when Delaunay's dangerous game of intrigue goes wrong, Phedre is betrayed into slavery in the distant land of the Skaldi, a primitive but war like country whose ambitious leader seeks to expand his empire. Accompanied only by a reluctant young warrior-priest who disapproves of Phedre's profession, Phedre is at the mercy of Waldemar Selig, the clever Skaldi king who has forged secret alliances with Terre D \`Ange traitors. It is up to Phedre and Joscelin to warn the young Queen Isandre and save Terre D'Ange from invasion. Carey has crafted an exquisite novel that elevates political intrigue to a work of art. Phedre is a fascinating heroine whose penchant for pain is so delicately depicted that the reader can understand her torment. Although the erotic scenes comprise only a small portion of this epic fantasy, their influence permeates the novel with a sensuality that provides an intriguing undertone. This is a magnificent first novel and only the beginning of a series that will fascinate and intrigue readers for years."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This story is an amazingly rich and layered fantasy that will completely suck you in if you give it half a chance.From reading all three of the Kushiel's novels thus far, I can tell that Ms. Carey has done her research about ancient places, languages, myths, and religions to weave her stories into something that feels real even as you are swept away in the fantasy of it all. You are able to see the world that was, yet imagine a world that might have been all at the same time.These are NOT kids books. They have sexual themes that definitly make them grown-up reading and make it necessary to be able to put personal preferences aside and simply go along with the story, but nothing about those situations feel gratuitous or simply placed there for shock value; they actually help propel the story.All in all, I love the Kushiel's stories and am anxiously looking forward to the next books. If you love history and love fantasy, I think you will also find this series facinating."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I probably own over 200 sci-fi/fantasy novels, and have read at least twice that. Carey's trilogy is easily one of the most politically intricate; Kushiel's Dart sports characters that are almost tangible with very human flaws and strengths set in a background with enough similarities to real settings for the reader to feel like he knows the world. While I'm not a fan for Phedre's particular sexual quirks, they did not in any way detract from the book and actually helped her character's developement. Her courage as a writer is to be admired as well; her writing style and level inevitably eliminated a great deal of her potential audience, and it's nice to see that there are still a couple of authors out there that have enough self-respect and respect for their audience to not hold back. Outstanding. Buy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The world she creates is very detailed and sensual. If you can survive past the first few chapters with all their background you will be throughly pleased. Once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"This enchanting book examines the deep influence of Zen Buddhism on the central aspects of Japanese culture and gracefully illustrates that the two are linked in profound ways. Suzuki has that mysterious ability as a writer to explain extremely abstract notions in elegant though simplistic language. Zen is a difficult subject to demonstrate because, by its very nature, it defies normative modes of rational thought.Suzuki manages to gently clear our rationally conditioned patterns of thought like a gentle spring rain, and astonishingly we come to discover that Zen is simpler than anything else we've encountered before. One comes away from the reading with a soothing, calm and certain understanding of the nature of Zen. And one is certain that the man behind the words is a master.He begins the narrative with insightful remarks on Japanese culture, touching on Zen's history and how the military classes, the Samurai, embraced the religion. The discussion moves onto Zen and its relation to Confucianism and the connection with the cultivation of a nationalistic spirit in Japan. The majority of the text is devoted to three central areas: Zen and Swordsmanship, Zen and Haiku, Zen and the Art of Tea, and lastly, the Japanese love of nature and its manifestations through art.Suzuki's argument is that Zen and its teachings have had such an enormous influence on the Japanese, that the culture as we know it would not exist without it. One needs to truly understand this influence in order to have any comprehension of the culture. He proposes that one does not exist without the other:\\"...without a full appreciation of it not a page of the history of Japanese poetry, Japanese arts, and Japanese handicrafts would have been written. Not only the history of the arts, but the history of the Japanese moral and spiritual life would lose its deeper significance, if detached from the Zen way of interpreting life and the world.\\" (P.364)This is an extraordinary book because it opens the way towards a fundamental understanding of Zen Buddhism and the foundations of Japanese culture, illustrating that the two are inextricably interlinked. The text is also beautifully enhanced with poetry, paintings, calligraphy and examples of architecture. If one is interested in either of these subjects, this book is a masterpiece and an important and enlightening experience."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"A towering book of scholarship from the mind of a Japanese Zen master with an almost mystical mastery of English prose. One neednt be a student of Buddhism or particularly interested in the history of Zen and its historical impact to benefit mightily from this book. It's beautiful literature. The passages (in two generous chapters) on Zen and Swordsmanship boast standing with the best in English literature. Suzuki's perspective is broad and inclusive, if entirely his own, and includes the historic relationship of Zen to nature, art, haiku, and more narrowly to the Japanese Tea Ceremony. He remains more bountiful writer than succint personal teacher. It's a great book that can be read again and again. Suzuki's plane is infinite depth and light; he takes us in, for the book of a lifetime. Unconditional recommendation that amounts to urging you."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"I was perhaps, more or less, curious when I picked this book up at a used book store a few years ago. As I read it - this curiosity was very deeply rewarded - and I fell in love with Suzuki's style of writing - and his presentation of Zen - which for me (a westerner) pieced together a rather loose understanding I had at the time and gained something of a background into the great mysteries of Asian (esp. Japanese) culture and ways of life. This book enlightened new ideas of embracing simplicity and poverty - not usually seen in the west (where we long for belongings). Another thing Suzuki stresses is dicipline - something lacking in many western interpretations of Zen."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"For people looking for an introduction to the Zen influences on Japanese culture, one would be hard pressed to find a better, easier to handle book than this. I have just about no knowledge on Zen whatsoever, so this was a book that really introduced me to Zen from nothing. The style is easy to progress through, and Suzuki does not weigh you down with endless jargon that you need to learn.Suzuki covers a wide range of topics, including Swordsmanship, (a detailed 2 chapters on that), Samurai, Confuscian Study, Tea Ceremony and more.His references to sources, however, are far too few for my tastes. It would be nice to know where he is getting his information from, so that we might check up on and follow up his thinking. He does quote a lot of old poems, letters and works, and discusses them in detail. In one case, he offers a largely paraphrased offering, for which he explains he can't accurately translate the original words.On the other hand, he does offer a lot of extra information and explanation in footnotes. I have found these to be absolutely beneficial to the main text. They offer a little bit extra to help add to some interesting points, and they are generally fascinating and useful.I admit, in connection with Zen, I am a complete ignoramus. Now, I am a little less of an ignoramus. This book is excellent and informative. Some of the criticisms in other reviews did not register with me as I read the book. I just enjoyed it, to be honest. Suzuki is certainly not a dry writer, and captures you well in this book."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"If you like me have turned corners with Zen as sign posts and have come away with less than satisfactory comprehension as to what \\"it is,\\" you also may find this book helpful. In college years I read \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle, etc.\\" as well as \\"Zen and the Art of Archery.\\" Both had me wanting to know more about Zen.That said, I do not know what Zen is. I have now read Suzuki's book and I cannot explain it to my friend who asked me what \\"it is.\\" It is a concept very different from the Western Philosophical dialectic tradition. I cannot tell you, the reader, what it is.Suzuki does an exceptional job in presenting the idea framed in terms of Japanese culture. As we learn by comparison, this helps significantly. His scholarship is first rate. He addresses questions such as how Buddhism, a belief that embraces life, can be consistent with kendo, the art of swordsmanship, which obviously must deal with violent death and somehow connect with Zen and the Art of the Tea Ceremony. Moreover, he presents common allegorical tales from eastern texts to illustrate ideas about Zen. This helped me since I had read several of the same or similar tales in various books. (In fact, I suspect some of them may be the same tales, corrupted by time and telling.) One tale, about a Samurai posing as a monk to defeat a kidnapper, appears in one of the first scenes of the movie, \\"The Seven Samurai.\\" I include this to answer one of the other reviewers who questioned the connection between Zen and Japanese Culture.How pervasive Zen is in the culture, I have no idea. I am not sophisticated enough in the matter to definitively respond, but I did find, in my limited experience, a connection of significance. Moreover, I do sense that I know more now after having read Suzuki's book than before.Finally, for those who want to know what Zen is, I would recommend they include this book in their travels. I believe--think is not the appropriate word--that understanding it is a long process. One learns techniques of thinking that inhibit knowing but are necessary. One distances oneself from the techniques for them to become natural. One appreciates the distance and the techniques and becomes entangled in pride. Finally, I believe, one loses all of oneself and is. Now that is what I do not know it is.Be sure to read the tale of \\"The Swordman and the Cat\\" beginning on page 429."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"As a fully equipped trip into spirituality, this book is a beautiful portrayal of Zen and the Japanese culture, written as a scholastic treatise on Zen Buddhism and it's greatest teachers. The author has an in-depth understanding of Western culture and this book is one of a few bridges between Eastern and Western experience that are built to traverse with a joy. From stories of swordless Samurais you will learn the secret of swordmanship art as well as interpretation of haiku poetry while tasting tranquillity of tea ceremonies, quietly accompanied by lovely nature images. Battle between intuition versus intellect in art of swordmanship demonstrates effortless power of the Unconscious while a blossomed cherry tree in haiku leaves you with an image of the truth. After 'experiencing' this book you won't escape the feeling that Zen is even if it is not."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"While some over-intellectualized reviewers are asking for the moon with this book, it delivers a tidy escapade through Japanese thought as seen through the lens of Zen Buddhism. True, there were other types of Buddhism in Japan but it can be easily argued that Japanese culture had a majority of contributions from Zen. In short, because the Samurai class dominated the history of this nation. If the book was titled just Japanese Culture, then I would expect to hear more of Shinto and its role, but its about Zen.I study Iaido and Buddhism in Japan, and this book has been the most helpful in understanding how Japanese think and learn martial arts, especially hard to come to terms with items like Seppuku, ritualized suicide. The chapters on Haiku are excellent also, and should not be missed (even though some martial artists just read the parts on swordsmanship).If you want to understand Zen, then come to Japan and learn Japanese, otherwise this book will provide a glimpse into a vast field of writing, legend, and thought on a contributor to Japanese thought. If you are a Buddhist then be grateful for this gift that the author has given to the world and do not be so hasty to find faults!"},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"Through this delightful and profound text the concept of Zen is presented as the facets in a diamond. Suzuki does so by presenting Zen in a variety of ways: from a swordsman's perspective, painting and other art forms.The simplicity of Suzuki's style never cheapens nor detracts from the teachings; on the contrary, it seamlessly guides us through all the nuances and difficult to explain concepts. His writing style contributes to the \\"feeling\\",if I may say so, of the flow of Zen.It is not dogma. It does not pretend to give answers. It isa guide or portal to the way of Zen and gives us an awareness that may help us find our own way to it.If organized religion does not do it for you this may be the path you are looking for."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"OK, enough effusion from other reviewers. This book is good, but it's not that good. It contains a lot of information about Zen, and I'm glad I read it. Zen was and still is an important aspect of Japanese culture, and Suzuki knew a lot about it. He's a good writer, and his command of English, though nonnative, is still quite good. I learned a lot from this book, as can anyone who's interested in Zen, Japan, or both. However, I'd recommend a few grains of salt with the book, as follows:First of all, Suzuki is a good writer, but he's not writing in his native language and it shows. The prose is informative but often meanders, having trouble staying focused on whatever particular topics the chapter seems to be addressing. Maybe this is &quot;mystical.&quot; Still, Suzuki writes clearly and is easy to understand, even if his digressions often detract from the point he's trying to make.And the points he's trying to make are, well, not always backed up very well. He goes out of his way to show how Zen is intimately tied to bushido and study of confucian classics in Japan, for example. Frankly, though, pure land buddhism was also a powerful force among the warrior classes, and Confucian thinking and study was well established in Japan before the arrival of Zen. That's not to say he's completely wrong: Zen does become identified with these and other aspects of Japense culture. It was a powerful force in Japanese society, but Suzuki apparently wants it to be the only force (and in Chinese culture, too, when he claims original Chinese philosophy began only under the aegis of Cha'an; previously it had been either Indian in origin or the &quot;unphilosophical&quot; thought of people like Confucius or Lao-Tzu).Above all, just don't take everything he says at face value. He's often correct, but he also exaggerates or makes up a lot of the things he says. He wrote the book during the 1930s, when Japan was experiencing a huge surge of nationalism, and it shows. Japan and Zen in this book are apparently responsible for anything of cultural significance that ever happened in East Asia, either originating it or preserving it when its originators (often the Chinese) were too dumb or disorganized to do it themselves. Suzuki was knowledgable, but he wasn't unbiased, and I have grave doubts about his supremely enlightened Zen master status, too.So if you're really interested in Japan and Zen, this is a good book to read, but it shouldn't be the only book. It's filled with too many errors and fabrications for it to really be useful by itself."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"I respect D.T. Suzuki enough, to have visited the Suzuki family graveyard in Kita Kamakura, upon my first arrival in Japan. I say this as a prelude, because I am going to say some critical things about the Ist edition of this book - which contained - in places, unspeakable nonsense for a man who would otherwise have to be regarded as one of the best inter-cultural bridge builders of the 20th c.To get to the point, the first edition of this book was an exercise in Nihon-shugi or 'Japanism' - tinged with blatantlynationalistic feelings, as against the spiritual riches of a study like Suzuki's 'Nihon Teki Rei-sei.' I love the best of Japanese culture, have a Japanese wife - and am blessed with Japanese friends, dear to my heart. The sort of thing found in the Ist edition of this book, would make most of them choke on their rice, because it is dreadful caricature.Like many other people, I owe Suzuki a lot. His other writings are far more meaningful and I regret that he wrote this book at all - if adjudged by the Ist ed. For a while, he was caught up in the Japanese megalomania of the 30's. The glorification of massed Bushido in this book was stupid (nothing to do with the Samurai, anyway). This stuff doesn't scream at you from every page - that's the rub of it. It lurks here and there, among otherwise delightful observations and anecdotes. But you can't help objecting to observations about how the Chinese 'lost' the beautiful culture they had once inspired in Japan, by dint of contact with Zen. In the Ist ed of this book, the mere fact of being 'Japanese' is enough to make culture and enlightenment ooze out of every crack and pore of life. Its a little more sophisticated than that - and, like some Italians, say, who live amid artistic splendours without the least feeling for it, not all Japanese value what is beautiful and good about their country and culture.I regret having to say unkind things about dear old Daisetzu, who has otherwise brought me much inspiration."},{"Title":"Zen and Japanese culture (Bollingen series)","review":"Great book and loaded with information about Zen in Japanese culture.

Being from Greensboro and a golfer, I was extremely impressed by Mr. Sifford's commitment to the game and his determination to play as a PGA professional. You truly wonder what the golfing world has already missed by not allowing Mr. Sifford and other African American golfers to pursue their dreams. When Mr. Sifford was attempting to break the &quot;color barrier&quot; there were more black professional golfers than there is today!

Tiger Woods cannot compare to these men, he has the talent but not the maturity nor seemingly the respect for those that have gone before him. Charlie Sifford and the other gentlemen he knew had to settle for proverbial scraps, my full respect and admiration goes to all of them chronicled here.

The book was just written in a horrible way. Every other sentance starts with the word \\"hell\\". It gets boring afterwards. The first half of the book moves very slowly, but the second half picks up a little more speed. This book will let people know that before Tiger Woods, there was Charlie, Lee Elder, and a lot of other guys too. It is a very good book. What Sifford went through was just horrid, but that's the reality of the world we live in. I could never blame him for being so bitter after all these years of obstacles and not being praised for what he has done. Never mind praise - just for not being allowed to play the game of golf.

S. Marshall at Fort Benton then settles in Yellowstone Valley.This is the stuff Hollywood eats up."},{"Title":"My Sixty Years on the Plains (Trapping, trading, and Indian fighting)","review":"William Hamilton was born in Scotland in 1822, but was brought to America two years later by his fairly well-to-do family and raised in St. Louis. A sickly child, his father sent him west in 1842 with a trapping party headed by Bill Williams (he of later notoriety as the guide on Fremont's fourth expedition) for his health. Hamilton remained in the West for the rest of his life. The fur trade was just about ending when Hamilton entered it, so other employment was necessary; he found this mainly as an Indian fighter, though he was also a US Marshall, town sheriff, and Montana rancher. These memoirs were written in 1905, just 3 years before his death.Hamilton is an adventure writer at heart, and the book relates one escapade after another. Many of these consist of fights with Indians, including Bannocks, Blackfeet, Modocs, and Pawnee. Much of this has the feel of what used to be called \\"boys books\\": lots of action, not too much moralizing, plenty of physical bravery on display. Its single dimensionality becomes a bit repetitious and tiring after awhile, but Hamilton's account of his life does have an authentic flavor and is certainly the \\"real deal\\" of a certain brand, at least, of western frontier experience."},{"Title":"Study Guide to Accompany Maternal-Child Nursing","review":"This study guide makes up for everything that the text book lacks.

Although these stories take place on a world at war a half-million light years from Earth, you will find that there is an obvious subtext to this ERB yarn in terms of Josef Stalin's Soviet Union. The story was first published in &quot;The Blue Book Magazine&quot; in 1942 although the sequel was not published until 1964. Eventually both parts were collected in a paperback volume, complete with a Frank Frazetta cover as I recall. Burroughs wrote the first part in 12 days and the second in only five days, which makes them potboilers to be sure, but the political angle makes them interesting nonetheless.The hero of this two part novel is Tangor, an American airman who managed to end up on the planet Poloda far, far away, after apparently being killed during World War II behind German lines (very reminiscent of how John Carter ended up on Barsoom). He wakes up in a garden on Poloda, which he soon learns is a world that has been at war for over a century. Given the name Tangor, he joins the fight of the Unis against the Harkases. ERB finds Tangor's story mysterious typed on his typewriter (ERB often presents himself as being merely the conduit for his pulp fiction yarns).For all of his science fiction stories, Burroughs was at heart a telling of romantic adventures. However, in &quot;Beyond the Farthest Star&quot; he shows much more of an interest in forecasting what was to come. In this story you will find underground railroads, plastic airplanes, compact cards, uni-sex clothing, bullets that explode, and even solar energy. Burroughs is almost as interested in the strange animals of Poloda as he is in its advanced technology, going into lots of details on the strange fauna Tangor encounters. However, the most interesting prediction given the fact ERB was writing on the eve of World War II was his depiction of not only a world at war but the coming Cold War. People live in underground cities to be safe from the bombing, women work in the factories so that the men can fight the war, and that this state of constant war is just accepted as the way things are.Whereas Burroughs authored an indirect attack on Nazi Germany and the Gestapo in his Carson of Venus series, &quot;Beyond the Farthest Star&quot; is clearly inspired by ERB's knowledge of what was happening in the Soviet Union under Stalin, a time of a one party system, show trials and purges. Anyone who was reading the newspapers as well as pulp fiction magazines at that time would have to be struck by the obvious similarities. Usually ERB wrote of wonderous world like Barsoon, but with Poloda he presents a relatively ruthless depiction of a totally repressive government that makes human existence a living nightmare. With these stories pay more attention to the setting than the romantic adventure to get the most out of this interesting &quot;minor&quot; ERB yarn."},{"Title":"Beyond the Farthest Star","review":"Like all of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books, this story is full of adventure, fighting, and saving the damsel in distress. But the hero in this book is probably the biggest wimp of all of ERB's heros. John Carter could bench press him, Carson Napier could out shoot him, and Tarzan would just ignore him and leave him to the jungle. The hero never gives his name and the reason why is because he is embarrassed to be compared to ERB's other heros. If it wasn't for the superior storyline and abstract scientific facts that cause you to think, I would have rated this book a 2. This isn't his best, but it is one Burroughs fans shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Beyond the Farthest Star","review":"Another fun Burroughs romp, elsewhere than Earth. This time the main character is a pilot, and he ends up on an alien world (not a big suprise, eh?) and proceeds to go about having some Buck Rogers style adventures, getting involved in politics and war. This is made up of two different stories/novellas, or whatever you want to call them. If you like other Burroughs style books, no reason you won't like this."},{"Title":"Beyond the Farthest Star","review":"It's all you expect of Burroughs. The hero was dogfighting over Europe in some un-named war (hint: this was written 1941), when he was shot down. His plane spiraled down while his heart spasmed aroung the bullet lodged in it, then --Sort of the John Carter thing again. He shows up starkers in a public park 450,000 light-years from home - amazing how he worked that out so precisely. After a few misunderstandings, he gets some pants and learns enough language to discover that he's landed on a distant world of perpetual war. Hot dog! What fun! How Manly! Of course, he lands among the good guys, and it turns out that he's just as good in their aircraft as he was back home, and promptly distinguishes himself for the greater glory of whoever and for the hand of the fair maiden. There's not a lot to get wrought up about here, except for a city that pops up and down like a jack-in-the-box and some overheated scenes of air war.The second half of this book was written in the 1960s, during the height of the Cold War. This time, Our Hero infiltrates the enemy, who turns out to be a WW 2.5 stereotype of the Red Menace, stupid, brutal, and run by a priveleged secret police. And with names like Gompth and Grunge. Of course Our Hero distinguishes himself brilliantly and manages a clever escape, somewhat along these lines:Him: Can I borrow one of your fastest fighter planes? You know, just for a spin around the block.Them: Sure, can't think why not. Here are the keys, it's over in that hangar with no guards or anything.Him: And all these secret documents and stuff, can I bring them too?Them: I guess so. We'll flog a flunky until he's got it all loaded for you.Okay, you don't read Burroughs for anything but heroic stereotypes and action that follows inane but chivalrous rules. You get that here. That's about all you get, but there's plenty of it. This is one of Burroughs's less well-known works, possibly for good reason. But it's good anyway.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Beyond the Farthest Star","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. I had recently become quite disenchanted with Burroughs' Princess of Mars series as it seemed to have become by the third installment an endless cycle of fight, win, have loved one kidnapped, rescue them, discover more scary aliens, fight, etc. and I expected this book to be more of the same. Particularly when it began in much the same way: our hero is mysteriously transported via unexplained means to another planet which is remarkably similar to ours in that the environment is hospitable and the natives are pretty much homo sapiens. If one can suspend disbelief enough to buy that, well, there is very little that is still unbelievable. Fortunately, this book diverged from that other series almost immediately. While the culture our hero is thrown into is at war, it is not necessarily because they are a war-loving people. They are forced mostly into self defense by the other society of the planet who are if not all-out war-lovers, are at least in no mood to stop until every other nation is obliterated. As the book was written in 1941, it might not be too hard to guess who this is a thinly-veiled reference to. Our hero is not gifted with any supernatural powers (a la John Carter's ability to jump really, really high because of Mars' lower gravity and his over-developed Earth muscles), he's just an ordinary fighting man who might as well go to service in his new nation. They seem like they have a righteous enough cause. He is extraordinarily lucky, returning from several missions that were expected to kill him.As mentioned in the forward, Burroughs did quite a bit of world-building, note writing, and outlining, probably intending to turn this into a new series. Unfortunately, only two parts were completed, the second of which was not published until 1964, posthumously. I would very much have liked to know what happens to our hero next, and the end of this volume, which contains both parts, definitely set up the sequel."},{"Title":"Beyond the Farthest Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is easy for me to dismiss ERB when I am not actively reading something by him, the man however was just a creative machine. He had worked out a whole new planet and several societies to inhabit this book. Our main character, Tangor, is a little different from Tarzan or John Carter. He does not display physical prowess in the same fist to face way the other heroes in Burroughs books do. He flies planes.He was shot down, and killed while on a mission behind German lines and reawoke, naked on Poloda. He makes friends with a family and learns the language and learns that Unis, the city he appeared near is at perpetual war with the aggressive Kaparas. In Unis everyone has lost many members of their family to the fighting, because resources are limited everyone wears jumpsuits.The first half of the novel (or the first short story) is set in Unis and explores that culture. The second half (or second short story) is set in Kapar. It is reminiscent of1984. Tangor has gone there as an undercover operative. He knows he can trust no one, there are secret police, and even the children are trying to fight there way to the top to survive in the world of intrigue.The introduction of the book mentions that there were tons of notes on the world that ERB made, but obviously, he was unable to get a lot of them out there. The book was published after his death and the story ends rather abruptly. It is still worth reading and shows how in tune with general trends in writing and thought he actually was. His hero and story while always very ERB also seem very much a part of the time they were published in and appropriate shelfmate to other books which were published at the same time."},{"Title":"Beyond the Farthest Star","review":"It's all you expect of Burroughs. The hero was dogfighting over Europe in some un-named war (hint: this was written 1941), when he was shot down. His plane spiraled down while his heart spasmed aroung the bullet lodged in it, then --Sort of the John Carter thing again. He shows up starkers in a public park 450,000 light-years from home - amazing how he worked that out so precisely. After a few misunderstandings, he gets some pants and learns enough language to discover that he's landed on a distant world of perpetual war. Hot dog! What fun! How Manly! Of course, he lands among the good guys, and it turns out that he's just as good in their aircraft as he was back home, and promptly distinguishes himself for the greater glory of whoever and for the hand of the fair maiden. There's not a lot to get wrought up about here, except for a city that pops up and down like a jack-in-the-box and some overheated scenes of air war.The second half of this book was written toward the 1960s, as the Cold War was heating up. This time, Our Hero infiltrates the enemy, who turns out to be a WW 2.5 stereotype of the Red Menace, stupid, brutal, and run by a priveleged secret police. And with names like Gompth and Grunge. Of course Our Hero distinguishes himself brilliantly and manages a clever escape, somewhat along these lines:Him: Can I borrow one of your fastest fighter planes? You know, just for a spin around the block.Them: Sure, can't think why not. Here are the keys, it's over in that hangar with no guards or anything.Him: And all these secret documents and stuff, can I bring them too?Them: I guess so.

However, I was given this book recently and have found myself going to it on a regular basis. This book is not a simple study of GigE.

I would recommend any person in IT or data networking to have this book on their shelf."},{"Title":"Gigabit Ethernet for Metro Area Networks","review":"There's much more to technology than where the bits go. Equally important is the role of the technology in the marketplace, the applications that the technology enables, the economics that underlie its success or failure, and the companies that play in the space. Bedell's book does all of these. Far more than just a &quot;how does it work&quot; guide, &quot;Gigabit Ethernet&quot; provides information that will help corporate decision-makers chart a course of action for Gigabit Ethernet implementation in thir own firms. If you are a middle or senior level manager with GbE on your plate, you need to read this book."},{"Title":"Gigabit Ethernet for Metro Area Networks","review":"A sign of a good writer is when somebody technical can teach individuals at all levels of understanding (e.g. Jeff Doyle: Routing TCP/IP Volume 1). That is just what this author did.He gives a comprehensive view of Gigabit Ethernet and draws relevant comparisons to competing technologies. Not only does he show its current applications, but also explores the pricing and implementation considerations of GigE which are VERY important factor in today's competitive market. I also found it interesting how the author gave an &quot;inside&quot; explanation at how the major service providers are competing for the marketshare.If you are still trying to decide on this book, I think the sales rank tells the story. This book is second in total sales (690,882) compared to all other books on the same topic. Also, some technical books have egregious errors in them which shows poor editing and a &quot;rush&quot; mentality (e.g. Sybex). This author obviously put careful thought into his presentation and organization.

If you are looking for a science book from a Christian perspective, this book may seem like the one for you, but the explanations and the amount of material presented makes it unusable for the average student. As a college graduate, I find the explanations generally understandable, but for an average high school student, they are unclear and difficult. The amount of material presented in each section is unrealistic, as well. Ch. 7, on chemistry, could have easily been divided into three separate chapters. The material has to be broken down more and systematically explained for a student to understand it. The worst part, though, is the lack of resource materials. Each section in a chapter has maybe 10 review questions. There are no chapter review sections except for the two pages in the lab manual. My tutee's teacher has had to create multiple review sheets, questions, power points, etc. just to assist the students. If you are planning to teach with this book, be prepared to create a lot of support materials for your student(s).

A detailed history of the poem's growth from two books during 1798-1799 to 14 books during 1832-1850 is supplied by Reed in his introduction.

The term &quot;soulmaking&quot; is not the invention of a modern author trying to catch the reader with a smart book title. The poet JOHN KEATS used this term to describe the process which CARL GUSTAV JUNG, whose ideas GROSSO obviously admires a great deal, later called &quot;Individuation&quot;. KEATS explained &quot;soulmaking&quot; as quoted by the author on page 31: &quot;There may be intelligences or sparks of divinity in millions - but they are not Souls till they acquire identities, till each one is personally itself.&quot; According to GROSSO, both active and passive experience is the essence of soulmaking, especially but not exclusively in the course of self-reflection, philosophy, arts and paranormal or exceptional human experiences (EHE) which can force us to take a look over the fence of our inherited materialistic world view - as happened to the author more than once, as he tells us confidently in the many anecdotes of his private and professional life. As RAYMOND MOODY puts it in his short foreword, &quot;This book is a good read&quot;. GROSSO succeeded in gripping me with his witty and lively writing style and the frankness with which his anecdotes are presented. Leaving the safe terrain of merely reproducing facts, the author has the courage to share some of the most intimate incidents of his life with the reader, who will feel personally invited to take part in the author's adventure of soulmaking. If GROSSO can be blamed for anything, it is not for fear of the public's reactions. Although they are not a main theme of this book, psychedelic experiences are addressed as possibilities to learn about the creative powers of the unconscious, which serve as a &quot;Soul-Magnifying Glass&quot;, as suggested by the title of the respective chapter. However, the author is well aware of the reverse side of the coin: &quot;Although scholars have studied sacred plants in shamanism and ancient religions, the history of drugs and the soul has yet to be written. (...) The complexion of things has changed nowadays. The demonic side of drugs seems to have taken over. The worst nightmares about drug abuse are coming true.&quot; (p. 71) The interface of psychedelic experience and the nature of a hypothetical afterlife may become clear by going back to the philological roots of the term itself: &quot;In Greek it ('psychedelic') means soul clarifying. It occurs in a Platonic dialogue (...) where it is used to describe what happens to souls at death. Death, said Socrates, clarifies the soul; it reveals the hidden corruption, the secret deeds of unjust men who in life hid behind rank and prestige; it also reveals the beauties and virtues of just souls. Death, in short, is the ultimate 'psychedelic'.&quot; (p. 73) Now, what about the author's personal view of Life after Death? This is indeed the question which led the author to start the journey of his own soulmaking: Is death &quot;the final stumbling block to soulmaking? The main point of this book is that to answer such questions, we should look to experience, not to 'the authorities'.&quot; (p. 163) After all, GROSSO remains cautious: &quot;Given my own experiences - and I know I'm not alone on this score - I can say there are no grounds for being cocksure about what death is.&quot; (ibid.). It is not difficult, however, to discover GROSSO's optimism in this respect by finding him occasionally pointing to the evidence gathered from other sources to date. As far as his puzzling personal experiences are concerned - which may too readily be labelled as &quot;paranormal&quot; (precognitive dreaming, veridical out-of-the-body-experiences, haunting, etc.) by some readers - one might expect that the accounts are followed by the narrator's interpretations or even claims of what &quot;really&quot; lies behind the respective incident. The critical reader will be delighted to find that just the opposite is the case. The philosopher GROSSO never seems content with final explanations and does not get tired of reflecting arguments for and against his own suspicions, always reminding the reader that solving metaphysical problems is not necessarily the aim and purpose of soulmaking, we should rather deal with them in a honest, open-minded and self-critical way. Soulmaking is a fine autobiographical and thus personal contribution by MICHAEL GROSSO, who seems to be well aware of his responsibility as a writer on such a controversial and difficult subject. (This review is published in the debut issue of the HUMAN NATURE magazine, Sept. 1999)"},{"Title":"Avengers Disassembled: Captain America","review":"It's best to, much like the actual issues, contained here, ignore the headline of Avengers Disassembled. For those who don't know, its a poorly written mess occurring in the main Avengers title (500-503) that has little to do with these stories save a scant mention of 'trouble'. Since this trade is composed of two separate stories, from two separate books, I'll break up the descriptions:Captain America 29-32: Captain America and Diamond back go up against Hydra, Mr. Hyde, the Serpent Society, Batroc the Leaper, and Red Skull, all while a coup takes place at S.H.I.E.L.D. The story is by comics newest golden boy, Robert Kirkman (Marvel Team-Up, Invincible, The Walking Dead) and artist Scot Eaton, with the fantastic Drew Geraci handling inking (Met Drew at a convention once, and he's one of the nicest comic personalities in the biz). The tale is a lot of fun, but feels far to cramped to be only a four issue arc. Of course, in this age of story decompression another writer (coughBENDIScough) could have taken a year to tell this much of an adventure. Its goofy in a way that can only be described as Silver Age; there's lots of action, and the plot points make you scratch your head, but when its all said and done you have a smile on your face.Captain America and the Falcon 5-7: This tales a bit harder to describe, since it palys heavily off of the initial arc of the story. But the gist is that Captain America and Falcon are on the run after refusing to turn over an \`Anti-Cap' produced by the Navy. Everything hits the fan here, and Captain America starts having strange visions that may or may not be real (Thuis gets cleared up a bit in the MODOK story beginning in issue 8). There are some great moments found though, including a possible start of a Captain America/ Scarlet Witch romance, and it was a beautiful cover of the two by Joe Bennet that fist drew me to the book.Should you buy this book? If you're a Captain America fan, or a fan of fun-loving stories, there's not a reason not to. This isn't the heaviest or most thought provoking super-hero fare available, but it is incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Avengers Disassembled: Captain America","review":"Collecting storyarcs featured from the last run of the current volume of Captain America and from Captain America & The Falcon, Captain America Disassembled finds Cap a little more than battle worn after what's been going on with the Avengers. Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead) scripts the first arc, which is the main highlight here as Cap fights off against the Red Skull and the usual array of rogues. The Captain America & Falcon story is nothing special though, even though Modok makes an appearance (and every Marvel fanboy knows he's worth a laugh or two). The art in both collections is solid, and Kirkman's story makes this volume worth picking up for Cap fans. Captain America is getting relaunched yet again though, under the helm of Ed Brubaker, which is also worth picking up."},{"Title":"Avengers Disassembled: Captain America","review":"This trade collects two different storylines both somewhat connected with the Avengers Disassembled event. The first storyline collects Captain America and the Falcon #5-7, written by Priest and drawn by Joe Bennett. This story is about a rogue Navy \\"Super-Soldier\\" who the Cap and the Falcon have to bring in to get executed, which of course Cap can't let happen. While in the process of doing this he experiences very weird episodes, getting frozen in the back seat of a cab is one of the best, and Wanda aka Scarlet Witch makes random appearances and kinda starts a romance with Cap. This was the tie in to the Disassembled story and while it was kind of interesting I just didn't care enough about the story to really take it seriously. The second storyline is much better, this storyline collects Captain America #29-32, written by Robert Kirkman (Walking Dead, Invincible) and drawn by Scot Eaton, which were the final issues until rebooted a couple months later. The main part of this story is the return of Diamondback into Steve Roger's life. You find out the why and who was behind it later but to me it was very obvious. Overall this story was fun to read. It featured Cap and Diamondback kicking the crap out of a Hydra cell, Cap in a short fight with Blackroc, and of course a fight with the Red Skull with a cool exo-suit from S.H.I.E.L.D. The only tie into the Disassembled story is that Cap mentions at one point some troubles with the Avengers, thats it. Overall not a bad Captain America story but a lousy tie in and kinda stupid for the final issues."},{"Title":"Avengers Disassembled: Captain America","review":"This features, as previously stated, Captain America and The Falcon 5-7, and Captain America 29-32.The issues with the Falcon, while somewhat off pacing-wise, suffer from being the second half of an entirely different story arc. In these issues, the actual connection to Avengers: Disassembled is made, wherein The Scarlet Witch makes several odd appearances, and some really weird things happen to Cap (like being inside a block of ice after getting into a Taxi).The last issues of Captain America have little to do with Avengers: Disassembled, aside from characters, including Cap himself, referring to his recent Avengers troubles. It does feature the long awaited return of Diamondback, but she's again lost in the ether in Brubakers run, which has both excellent art and story, see the Winter Soldier trades for details. The final issues of Cap are engaging, and an entertaining read, but it definitely lends itself to being an ending.If collecting the entire Disassembled arc, I recommend the Captain America and The Falcon arc is read prior to Avengers: Disassembled, and the final issues of Captain America are read afterward."},{"Title":"A Man Called Wolf","review":"Based on a true event, Parkinson takes you on a roller coaster ride through rough and tumble southwest Kansas in the late 1880's.

You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The tariff idea","review":"The analysis of The Tariff Idea starts with Frederic Bastiat's illustration of \\"the evils of trade restrictions\\" (p. 7) drawing on Defoe's Robinson Crusoe classic. Having recently met a foreigner, Robinson and Friday debate the value of foreign trade. Friday favors specialization in the production of vegetables where the two have a comparative advantage over the foreigner whose comparative advantage is in hunting (game). Robinson would have none of that, for he counts labor as wealth. To give up labor is to give up wealth and along with it self-sufficiency.TheTariff Idea is about how dangerously common the Robinsonesque notion of trade restraints was then, and is still today. The book expounds on the different justifications and uses of tariffs, including exposing their misuses and abuses. What do tariffs really do, and what are the implications of what they do? In the end the book concludes that free exchange tramps restricted exchange, notwithstanding the desire for self-sufficiency.This is an outstanding book, by clearly a very well read person. Curtiss writes well: concisely and clearly. Considering that it was printed in 1953 and it is still readable today, the book has done pretty well.

The book gives you a chance to feel an erie sense of amazement. With plenty of overwhelming photographic evidence and well documented accounts. The reading is quite palatable and always makes great entertainment, even when you may only have five or ten minutes to read. Personally, the most uncanny thing about this book was what happened to me while reading it during a rest-break in the mountains.

An absolute must-read for any one interested in anomalous and/or paranormal occurrences."},{"Title":"Boston (Volume I and Volume II)","review":"This mammoth book covers the Sacco / Vanzetti trial - probably the most tumultuous trial in the early part of last century. Sacco and Vanzetti were two Italian workers who were accused of murdering and stealing money from two payroll carriers in suburban Boston. The story is told through the use of a fictional character named Cornelia, who had lived a life with the rich and elite of Boston. After her husband dies, she wants to live life and takes a tough job in a rope factory. In seeking room and board, she meets and befriends Vanzetti. Experiencing the poor working conditions and associating with Vanzetti, she sees the abuse of the workers by the rich owners and becomes sympathetic to social change.The story turns tragic, though, when the good-natured Vanzetti and his friend Sacco, are implicated in a burglary. The police seeking a guilty party intimidate and coerce Irish witnesses into telling lies about the pair. The Italians have very little hope once they reach the courtroom, when they learn that the judge is clearly against them. Being poor, they are unable to pay the necessary and customary bribe.When they are found guilty, other countries and labor leaders throughout the world became angry with Boston. Freedom and the United States' justice system becomes a laughing matter. Ultimately, the police were called in to handle the riots that almost ensued in Boston when the pair of activists was put to death. Even today, there are shadows of doubt over Boston as a result of this trial.Using part fiction and part history, Upton Sinclair paints a grim portrait of American justice gone awry. Over and over, Sinclair points out where the plaintiff's case was based on non-credible witnesses, a biased judge and jury, hatred of the defendants' socialistic and anarchistic beliefs, and prejudice. While the book was interesting, especially in illuminating the reader of how the system \\"really\\" works, I did find it tiring. The book was long and there were a ton of witnesses and characters that the reader had to remember. Sometimes, the same points and facts were repeated two or three times and the story had a tendency to jump around in time. Overall, though, I found the book interesting and absorbing - like all of Sinclair's works that I have read."},{"Title":"Boston (Volume I and Volume II)","review":"Upton Sinclair was a socialist from Baltimore, MD. He wrote many books trying to bring to light the plight of immigrants, and exploited laborers.In \\"Boston\\", Sinclair focuses on the lives of Bartolomeo Vanzetti and Nicola Sacco, two Italian immigrants. Sacco and Vanzetti were accused of robbery and murder in Braintree, MA, with no more evidence against them than the fact that they were Italian. Their execution caused protests in nearly every major city world wide.So much of this book draws parallels to today. During the early 1900's, it was believed that all Italians were little more than bomb wielding terrorists. At their trial, it was used against them that they weren't \\"patriotic\\", because they had dodged the WWI draft. (Which they weren't subject to anyway, because they weren't even US citizens).I'm from Massachusetts, and found the book particularly interesting in that regard too, to see how things were like in the 1920's. My great-grandfather, Pasquale, was an Italian immigrant who worked with Vanzetti in the Plymouth Cordage Park for a time. It was very interesting, to learn how little he got paid for such dangerous and hard work, and also the challenges he faced as an Italian immigrant.I think it's very important, that we learn from the past, because these types of prejudices still impede justice today. If you've never heard of Sacco and Vanzetti, or don't know very much about them, you *need* to read this book. The audacity of their trial, and the compelling nature of their story, is one that will stick with you for the rest of your life. It's no wonder that they have inspired so many artists and musicians."},{"Title":"Boston (Volume I and Volume II)","review":"Boston, a novel in two volumes by Upton Sinclair, was first published by Albert &amp; Charles Boni in 1928 and is an historical novel about the well documented Sacco-Vanzetti trials. Written in typical Sinclair fashion, the story weaves through the personal lives and motivations of Sacco and Vanzetti. In his continual search for social justice, this event gives Sinclair another opportunity to decry the social conservatism of the day. The novel presents the reader with a different perspective of this milestone in American jurisprudence."},{"Title":"Boston (Volume I and Volume II)","review":"This book provides an interesting perspective of the justice system. It compares the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, two poor, italian, anachists, to a trial of some of Boston's Blue Blooded elite (fictionalization of a true story). Sinclair never goes so far as to claim Sacco and Vanzetti are innocent (actually one of his biographers claimed that he had his own doubts), only to show that the trial was biased by their social and political views."},{"Title":"Boston (Volume I and Volume II)","review":"Wanted to read more Upton Sinclair and this book did the trick. It's really fantastic writing. I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Boston (Volume I and Volume II)","review":"This book about the Sacco-Vanzetti case is presented here as a novel. It is, however, a novel in which the historic analogies are carefully observed. In reading it one shudders at the similarities between that \\"red scare\\", the McCarthy affair and today the erosion under Bush of constitutional rights. It is obvious that the \\"upper class\\" is pitted against the \\"working class\\". In democratic socialism in which the owners of a concern are the workers (understood as being from the scrub-lady to the CEO. Decidedly stock-owners who do no work but have inherited their wealth are not considered as workers. There is no question that this was a crucial time for the labour movement and for the various parasitic wealthy people who have inherited their wealth and to whom the suffering of their labourers was indifferent. Undoubtedly it is a manifestation of the \\"class struggle\\" and of great importance to us in the U.S. today with its leaning more and more to the right. The indifference and even hostility with which in the US the poor are treated and exploited has apparently not changed at all.Dr. Erich H.

This book has a few great photos, but the text, illustrations and photo captions are worthless. The book's main value is in the French archival photos of the S-30 class boats with a few good S-38 class photos. Sorry, this book is NOT going to be a big help in detailing the Italeri or Revell S-100 class kits.Regarding the photos, besides the failure to deliver quality photos of armored bridge boats, I was further disappointed by the inclusion of useless fluff. Many of the photos and illustrations that bulk up the book are irrelevant padding.Blatant factual mistakes in the text make for an irritating read, not to mention the many spelling errors. I suspect the author pounded out some quick blah-blah, with little attention to accuracy, in a flippant attempt to give a scholarly appearance to a scrapbook. The book would have been better without the blundered attempt to \\"class it up\\" with text. Many mistakes are totally obvious, the fact that they weren't immediately apparent to the author demonstrates his feeble grasp of the subject matter and renders the entire text suspect. None of the captions or text should be taken at face value.Here are just a FEW EXAMPLES of MANY MISTAKES and FLUFF that spoil this book:*On page 158 the insignia identified as the 8th flotille actually belongs to the 9th. The insignia identified as the 9th belongs to the 6th. And the insignia identified as the 6th flotille is probably a personal marking. The insignias are crudely rendered with vague resemblance to the originals.*The top photo on page 28 features a photo of a 1943 or later armored bridge boat. Birnbacher and at least one other crewman are wearing 2nd pattern S-boot badges that weren't instituted until 1943. The other crewmen are wearing first pattern S-boot badges not instituted until 1941. But the caption states the date is \\"probably 1939.\\" Hello??*On page 126, the author displays his ignorance of technical details by showing a photo of a radio DF loop under the heading \\"radar\\".*On page 172 a portrait is labeled Klaus Feldt. Despite Feldt being one of the most famous, easily recognized and highly decorated officers of the KM and S-boot service, it is obviously not a photo of Klaus Feldt. Incredible! The real Klaus Feldt is shown on page 112 on the far left side of the top photo, and its no surprise that he is not identified in the caption.*On page 116 the caption states S-boot making preparations, but its an old fishing trawler! Had the author been paying attention he might have also noticed the crewmen are wearing the cap badges of the 8th Picket Ship Flotilla which deployed converted fishing trawlers as V-boote.*The crude color profile on p 144 sports an undocumented and probably bogus camo scheme that originated in a c.1999 Russian paperback.*The photo on page 99 is repeated on 105.*The photo on page 148 is labeled an \\"experimental design\\" when it is clearly an incomplete vessel still fitting out. The civilian flag should have been a clue.*Many illustrations are filler that have no reason to be in this book, such as the painting of a stuka attack on a Malta convoy on page 83; a full page portrait of a man in a rain slicker on p 47; the crewman taking up half of page 98 (the artillery headset he wears was intended for larger vessels with centralized fire control and is not S-boot hardwear) and so on.To summarize, this book is a jumble of photos with misleading captions and astonishingly erroneous text. The detail photos are limited to S-30 class boats, and a few of the S-38 class. Otherwise, this book is unreadable and a waste of money. I believe those expressing a favorable impression, gave it a superficial look, or were attracted by its size and flashy layout. Finally to add insult to injury, the oversized proportions won't fit in any of my bookshelves!"},{"Title":"German S-Boote at War: 1939-1945","review":"Jean-Philippe Dallies-Labourdette and Bruno Pautigny book S-Boote, does a very good job of telling the story of the German Navy's version of MTB's/PT-Boats (note: S-Boote were bigger, initially more heavily armed, and used more effectively than their allied equivalent). In this book, the authors tell us about the initial development of S-boote (their pre-war years) and follow it up with a very good year by year summary of how the S-boote did and what their equivalent were like at the same time period.Overall, this book is really a 4.5 star book, but since Amazon doesn't support half stars, I had to round down this time because there aren't that many descriptions of engagements, especially given the price of the material. However, the pictures are great, there's interesting material on the types of mines the German Navy used, and some good general material that can keep wargamers, modeler, or historians interested."},{"Title":"German S-Boote at War: 1939-1945","review":"Another great large format photo book from &quot;Histoire &amp; Collections&quot;.

A must for the hobbiest and those interested in the Kriegsmarine."},{"Title":"German S-Boote at War: 1939-1945","review":"This book is one of the few that deals with the German Schnell-Bootes - a small but ferocious and important corps.The Schnell-Bootes, or in English: E-Boats, were the fastest ships on the sea, using special scientific advances. They were the scourge of British coastal convoys. This book is also recent so the author has included the Lyme Bay attack, which nearly averted D-Day, and thus could have change the war.The text is short and to the point, all important aspects covered. The photos are just stunning!"},{"Title":"German S-Boote at War: 1939-1945","review":"S-Boote, German E-Boats in Action, is a very complete, stand alone history of the German \`fast boats' used in WW2. Author Jean-Phillippe Dallies Labourdette traces the creation of these torpedo boats back to WW1, the intra war development and operational use from 1939-45.This is a hard bound, high glossy page book with good quality photos, line drawings (several in color), mostly b&w;, but some color photos and maps. German propaganda magazine photos and posters are shown here to provide insight of the living quarters and layout of the boats. Each variant is described, as well as tactics, weapons of the German Navy as well as the opponents - there are descriptions of Italian, British, Soviet, US boats here as well. The author shares operational stories to show tactics, conditions used. There are organizational charts, descriptions of the various flotilla and WW2 photos of some of the Captains of the E Boats.Some surprises in the text - S Boats were made of plywood (but since larger, more seaworthy than PT boats) and had longer range than PT Boats. According to the author, there were problems early in the war with the magnetic warheads on the torpedoes which paralleled problems in the US Navy. 239 were made of all types. As with the PT boat, the weapons were beefed up throughout the years to add more and higher powered cannon on board. Color cutaways are used to show different torpedoes used, mines are also given attention here, as are photos of Naval Bases in French ports, the Allied use of Tallboy bombs to try to knock out the bases.One down side for modelers, the line drawings are not 3-D, so you only see one side. However, the WW2 photos make up for that showing various angles of the boat during use. This book is much more comprehensive than the New Vanguard book, at this price, it should be. I am very pleased with this book since it covers the boats, weapons, gives a flavor of the operations and tactics and as a bonus, compares the S Boote to the competition, something I always like to see."},{"Title":"German S-Boote at War: 1939-1945","review":"The content is wide and varied, with coverage of actual actions you don't usually see in this type book. There are many vignettes scattered about telling the story of certain people or operational aspects and events. One problem that may bother some is that there is very little organization to the book. Pictures and information on the the S-boats' typical enemies are also included, but it can be distracting because it is scattered around. You can't really sit down and read it straight through, but in my view it is mainly for reference anyway. In that role it is the best book available on the Schnellboote currently available."},{"Title":"German S-Boote at War: 1939-1945","review":"Good book for anyone interested in these great boats and the men who manned them.

This, naturally, means that at times it can be very dry. One wonders how the wonderfully colourful lives of his subjects can be so two-dimensional on paper. However dry this book is, it is a must-read for anyone who is interested in comtemporary Japan, just because it is full of such detail. One cannot hope to understand the mind of the Japanese youngster without having some idea of the images they have been bombarded with from birth. This book gives excellent analysis.

Before Amy boards the sub with Darius to make a needed repair, Lee Brody, petty officer second class, spies someone in the torpedo room. He inquires as to who they are and what they are doing but before he gets his answer he is knocked out.After boarding Hartford, Amy does some preliminary testing but the results don't show much, then Amy receives a call telling her there is a fire on the docks. She is on her way up when she gets side tracked and heads to the sub's office with McCann. They are in the office when someone slams the door shut and locks them in.On the docks, investigators realize the fire was set as a decoy and everyone is scrambling to find out why Hartford is leaving the dock unauthorized and why commander McCann and a civilian are on board. It becomes evident that Hartford has been hijacked. What's not clear is whether or not commander McCaan is a hostage or an accomplice.Finding a nuclear reactor, McCann has to disable it before the hijackers can use it. He and Amy go toe to toe with the hijackers. Since torpedoes have been fired, capturing them is no longer an option. They need to kill them to stop them.McCann and Amy have to work together to save themselves and a fellow crewmember. A turn of events has them rescued. But getting off Hartford is only part of the fight. They need to find out who the hijackers are, as they still pose a threat to the United States and until they are stopped no one is safe.Silent Waters is realistic, thrilling and suspenseful. The entire time I was reading, I was picturing the events unfolding on the big screen. This story is completely engrossing and extremely entertaining. McCann is a hero in every sense of the word. Amy is the perfect partner for him both romantically and intellectually. Silent Waters is fantastic. It has an action-packed and riveting storyline. I highly recommend this exciting and romantic story!NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Silent Waters","review":"Because of problems with its navigation system, Los Angeles class submarine USS Hartford docks at the Electric Boat shipyard for repairs. One night while ship superintendent Amy Russell is on duty, the sub is hijacked, with her aboard. She had been in the control room going over the ship's navigation systems with its skipper, Darius McCann, when the sub was taken. The two of them are locked in a room but manage to escape and wreak havoc on the hijackers' plans. On land, Lieuitenant Colonel Sarah Connelly and Commander Bruce Dunn are investigating the sub's disappearance and finding a lot of clues that don't add up.Meanwhile, it's the last day before a presidential election. The authors have taken the liberty of assuming that all Americans hate President Bush as much as they do, and created a caricature of their opinion of him in President Will Hawkins, a cold-hearted, war-mongering bumbler that the nation has tired of. His opponent, humanitarian and all-around good guy Senator John Penn, is everything Hawkins is not. In addition to Penn's all-around good-heartedness, he's the black half of a biracial couple, and out of his three children, one is gay and one is handicapped. How...quaint that one family can cover so many agendas, though they did neglect any mention of a beloved house staff of illegal aliens.The political propaganda in this book is nauseating. I suppose it never occurred to the authors that a person may pick up a work of fiction because one is tired of the political bipartisanship that saturates the media. Instead, we're subjected to their personal views with no attempt at restraint. I tried to be open-minded and even ignore it, but wound up insulted by the propaganda they're trying to shove down my throat.That aside, this is a second-rate thriller that concentrates more on the drama of events than on the action, and while one of the romances works, the other is just cumbersome. Its premise is implausible and its villain eye-rollingly obvious. It's safe to say my bookshelves are safe from any more Jan Coffey novels."},{"Title":"Silent Waters","review":"The USS Hartford nuclear submarine needs to make emergency repairs. However, Commander Darius McCann soon realizes that there is more to the stop then just a repair. Terrorists have gained control of the sub leaving him and his engineer Amy Russell in a precarious position of trying to stay alive while thwarting the enemy.Lieutenant Colonel Sarah Connelly and Commander Bruce Dunn conclude something is not right about the Hartford. They team up to figure what that is and soon reach the horrifying conclusion that cold-blooded killers, probably suicide bombers having access to nukes, have gained control of the vessel driving it on a path that is taking it to a panic stricken New York City.SILENT WATERS is an action packed thriller that never slows down from the moment that the Commander realizes his ship has been taken until the final climatic countdown to either the ultimate terrorist act or its prevention. The key players seem genuine especially the beleaguered Americans racing against time to stop a potential suicide bombing that will make 9/11 seem trivial in scope. Jan Coffey provides a strong thriller with a superb political twist that will stun the audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Silent Waters","review":"I'm only half-way through this, and I can't wait to get back to it each day.Ha!
