I answer the question then scroll over to the answer.)Good luck and happy cramming!"},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"Reading this book is a great way to learn recursion and the basics of working with list processing languages such as Scheme. I can think of no better material for quickly picking up on the patterns of processing data and the organization thereof. As with any treatment of LISP like languages the book concludes with implementing Scheme using Scheme. This makes the final chapters more harry than the initial 75%, but by this point you are already engaged enough to use the constructs of the language to tackle most tasks. Finally, it is certainly a treat to build in less than 200 pages the entire workings of a language used to tackle artificial intelligence. Perfect for mathematically inclined people."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This book provides a complete tutorial from the basics of Scheme and list processing to eventually having you build another copy of the scheme interpreter that you are running your program at. By the end of the book you understand how and why scheme runs your programs, including recursion, function definition, and evaluation of expressions.I cant wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"If you are looking for a language reference, you will be sorely disappointed with this book. It's not designed for quickly looking things up. However, if you are looking to an easy, painless introduction to functional programming, this is the book you want. The exercises are simple, build carefully on one another, and the theory behind them is explained at every step of the book. The presentation is charming, from the peanut butter and jelly theme throughout the examples, to the cavorting elephants on the cover. Pick this book up as a supplement to the mandatory, dry, exhaustive language reference, and work through the examples a few at a time. You'll find yourself understanding the language much better."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"The negative reviews almost uniformly make the claim that this book was written to learn a language (LISP, Scheme, etc). It is not. These are playful exercises to get you to think about recursion.It is goofy in its approach. It will make you think perhaps of Dr Seuss, Babar or other ludic approaches in the UNIX or Lisp world. I am thinking of things like the UNIX koans, the April's Fools Day RFCs, \\"Land of Lisp\\" (which actually teaches you CL).What is remarkable about this book?One thing is that you do not need a computer. There is a kind of Socratic discourse in which you incrementally build on simple ideas about lists and their manipulations. I believe this is a good exercise for students - thinking about fundamental CS ideas without turning one on.Another thing is that this was originally written in the '70s and is still good. Like \\"Kernighan and Ritchie\\"'s C Programming Book this has a continual relevance.The bad reviews of this misunderstand the book's point. Don't read this to learn a language. Get this book and read it (my copy is less than 100 pages long) and learn a bit from it. In time you will pull it down again and get something else from it. If some of the terminology is obscure - find defs on the intrenet (car and cdr are two examples).You do not need a computer nor do you need to already know a language. If you open your mind to it you will come away with something of value."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"I am using Java as my main programming language and I've been recently thinking of learning some new JVM language. I was thinking of Clojure (since it sounds more crazy than Groovy or Scala), but then colleague of mine recommended me to learn how to think recursively first. I was surprised when he recommended me a book that is older than me (well, the first edition was at least).Let me tell you that this was an excellent choice. The book was shocking from the very first pages. It is written in rare \\"Question-Answer\\" style that doesn't directly show you any definitions, but just examples. It is up to you to figure it out, what the formal definition is (if you care).For example, the first thing in the book is something like this:Q: \\"Is it true, that atom is an atom?\\"A: \\"Yes.\\"More important thing is, that this teaches you how to think recursively and illustrates it by using a lot of samples all over the book. You don't need no IDE, no compiler, no nothing. Just an text editor and this book.It is easy to spot how elegant some thing are in this functional recursive way and maybe it is sad that some things are too procedural in the todays world of programming. But don't expect anything easy! Roughly from the second part of this book it's getting quite hard and it'll fairly exercise your very brain capabilities.Even though Little Schemer is not going to change most of the code I write on daily basis, it had altered my thinking and it had overally expanded my knowledge as a programmer."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This is a terrific book for opening the mind of budding functional programmers. The book does requires some very basic syntax knowledge of really any Lisp variant. I only know a little Clojure and this has really helped me make the leap to the functional paradigm."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"Quite simply, this book is awesome! The authors of this book are masters of pacing. Every problem builds upon the previous one so that by the time your a quarter of the way in your solving fairly complicated problems effortlessly. After a few hours with this book I realized I would never approach a programming problem the same way again. This book is just great, it takes a complex subject and teaches it in a way that anybody could understand."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This book is excellent for explaining concepts of Scheme and Lisp. I highly recommend it for people that like logic puzzles and who are trying to uncover the Zen-like nature of programming in Scheme. This book emphasizes functional style by showing how many situations recursion applies to, and how you can use it to achieve various programming techniques (for example continuation-passing style).Although this book is not a technical introduction to Scheme or Lisp, it does get very technical. The last few chapters introduce continuation-passing style, the Y operator, and building an interpreter. Earlier chapters focus on list processing and uncovering some basic computer science techniques (e.g. that fact that numbers in a machine are representations of the concepts we have for numbers).This is a great book to read or skim any time, read with pencil and paper, or to actually code the examples. I've read it in various ways three times."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"One should not be fooled by the seemingly &quot;simpleness&quot; of its approach in teaching programming, particulary recursion. The reader MUST do the examples and extend them to get a good feel of recursion. I believe the authors want the reader to actually go through the material with a computer running a Scheme/Lisp programming environment; the reader, doing so, will benefit from this &quot;learning-by-doing&quot; approach."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This book is not a comprehensive description of the Scheme language -- the R5RS Scheme report is freely available for that purpose. It is rather a playful introduction to a programming style that has defined Scheme, or LISP in general. The authors use a dialogue approach to introduce each new concepts that makes programming complex software possible. But you will not find complex programs in that book -- which does not mean that you will not see some complicated ones. I believe the book can be a playful refresher for people who studied LISP a long time ago. And it could even stretch the mind of experienced programmers who never deeply studied LISP or Scheme. This is not a book for dummies."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This is one of my favorite programming books, but I had to revisit it a few times to realize it. See, the thing that took me a little while to figure out is this: The Little Schemer is not about Scheme. It's about how to think when you are approaching computer programming issues. It happens to use Scheme as the language of choice, because Scheme is (arguably) the best language available to learn about programming. This book is very well-organized, with each concept building on what has been established before. It is important that you follow through the question-and-answer style of instruction. Try to answer the questions, and think about the answers. The only reason I don't give this book five stars is because I can see it becoming less useful to you as you learn more about programming. Then again, that's the whole point of an introduction, isn't it?"},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This is a delightful little book that talks about recursive functionsand computation, and almost accidentally introduces the reader a fewimportant bits of the Scheme programming language. The format is aquestion and answer dialog in two columns, and the reader is expectedto try and answer questions for themselves before looking at them.Experienced programmers reading this book will find reminders aboutwhy programming is a joyful activity. Novices will be rewarded if theyactually try to work out the answers for themselves: the answers coversome of most beautiful and meaningful concepts in computer science.The book covers a lot of ground. It starts by drilling the reader onhow to understand recursive structures (lists and numbers) and developfunctions to operate on them. People familiar with recursion willprobably breeze through this, but for everyone else it is worthsweating through the details. The last 70 pages move fast: afunctional approach to programming, programming with continuations,unsolvable problems, recursion as function application (theY-Combinator!), and a simple Scheme interpreter, are all introducedwith a sequence of probing questions, perceptive answers, a few cutecartoons, and many references to foods. All the code examples can berun in nearly any recent Scheme implementation, and doing so would goa long way towards enjoying the material.If one had to criticise this book it would probably be for coveringtoo much too quickly! The concepts covered here often take months (oryears) to understand, leave alone master. It would be easy for anovice to miss the point here: the book is a taste of why computationis a subject of great elegance and beauty, and is meant to make thereader want to go out and study the subject in great detail. It isreally hinting at the great ideas out there awaiting the reader.

It definitely has the feel of a game - Sudoku moreso than Call of Duty.The key to enjoying this book is to not get hung up on the non-code questions. The book is written as a list of questions and answers, and it's frustrating to try to answer the non-code questions because they are often unguessable:Q: Is that bad?A: You must beware of shadowsQuickly read through the non-code questions and answers. But try to answer the code questions - that's the stuff that's fun and interesting.Q: Write fun? with set? and firstsA: (define fun? (lambda (rel) (set?

Friedman published a remarkable little book called The Little LISPer. It was only 68 pages, but it did a remarkable thing: It could teach you to think recursively. It used some pretend dialect of LISP (which was written in all caps in those days). The dialect didn't fully conform to any real LISP. But that was ok because it wasn't really about LISP, it was about recursive functions. You didn't need a computer in order to work through the exercises. After reading the book, I was changed. Or perhaps transformed. Or altered. In a good way. There are very few books that deeply change the way that you think. This is one of those books.The format is a programmed text with questions on the left side and answers on the right. The way you use it is to read a question, think about the question, come up with an answer, and then compare your answer to Friedman's answer.He used the names of foods as the symbols that are manipulated by your functions, and little jokes were scattered around to pull you back when things get so deep that your head is going to pop off. It even has a place reserved for JELLY STAINS!The book has been through several revisions. The latest, The Little Schemer (Fourth Edition), updated by Matthias Felleisen, now conforms more closely to a real programming language, Scheme, and has new chapters which delve much deeper into recursive function theory and language processors.Felleisen is not as comfortable with the programmed text format, so instead of questions and answers, he has a deranged dialog going on which reads a little like Sm&eacute;agol and Gollum discussing fishes.The Little Schemer is not a complete book on programming. It is weak in practical concerns like documentation, defensive programming, and computational efficiency. The development of a system of arithmetic from three primitives is delightful from a mathematical perspective and shockingly horrible from an engineering perspective.It also will not teach you very much about Scheme. It touches on only a very small part of the language: a very good part.Despite its flaws, the book has a very loyal following and that is because it works. It teaches one thing, a thing that is very difficult to teach, a thing that every profession programmer should know, and it does it really well. These are lessons that stick with you. You need to grab a sandwich and study this book."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This is a wonderful book for people who enjoy having their minds stretched. It starts from the most elementary concepts (this is a number, this is a symbol) and then proceeds to teach you how to program in scheme (a lisp dialect) using a question-and-answer approach, with the questions on the left hand side of the page and the answers on the right. Most of the teaching is by example; the authors show you something several times in several different guises in order to get you to understand the pattern underlying the programming examples. This form of teaching-by-pattern-recognition is especially useful for scheme, because lisp-based languages represent such a different paradigm from more conventional computer languages that it really helps to have the pattern in mind when you want to write a new function. The authors show how the basic elements of lisp (atoms, numbers and lists) can be used to solve an amazing variety of problems, many of which would be much harder (or impossible) in more conventional computer languages. Most of the book is so easy that a complete novice who had never programmed before could understand it, but the authors sneakily keep increasing the complexity until in the last three chapters they cover continuation-passing style, the applicative-order Y combinator (!) and writing a scheme interpreter in scheme (!!). Some of these topics would go over the head of most computer science Ph.D.'s (go ahead, ask one what the Y combinator is -- I dare you!). This is not the book to read if you're looking for a &quot;teach yourself visual basic in 20 minutes&quot; kind of book, but if you like programming and you enjoy having your mind stretched, you could not do better than this book (or its companion book, the Seasoned Schemer)."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"I am reading this book now, after wanting to get back into LISP programming after a ten year hiatus. My last memory of LISP was when I learned it in high school with an excellent teacher. I wish we had had this book back then! As it stands, I devoured the book in a few sittings -- its amusing, fast paced, rigorous and low-BS structure make it an excellent read.I'm of the last generation of students who were able to switch on a computer and get a BASIC prompt. The huge heft of &quot;introductory&quot; programming books today leaves me cold and uninspired -- I would hate to have seen these when I was first exploring the excitement of programming.The Little Schemer, by some of the old gurus of the (I believe) MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab (if not that particular lab, then at least those early, heady days in the '70s when AI wasn't a joke), reminded me of what it used to be like -- slowly building up a repertoire of commands and associated concepts that made programming seem a lot more like playing a Bach fugue and a lot less like debugging window objects. Things like recursion -- the essential part of this book -- are inherently wonderful.Were I teaching an advanced class for high school students, this book would be at the top of my list. Were I wanting to introduce a liberal arts student into the joys of mathematics, this book would be at the top. Were I wanting to deprogram a bad-habited CS student, this book. Indeed, with so many Universities wanting to stuff some kind of logical, syntatical reasoning requirements into their required courses, this book should be a best seller.It is a book that recaptures the joys and frustrations of programming and goes a long way to explaining why so many of the brightest people of the 20th century, at some point or another, sat down and cons'ed up a list."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"I think this is a marvelous book.The preface proclaims &quot;Things You Need to Know to Read This Book&quot; - The reader must be comfortable reading English, recognizing numbers, and counting. This perhaps understates the problem, but Friedman and Felleisen do an excellent job of introducing the reader to recursion and Scheme through the use of a formal methods. Concepts are built element-by-element and the reader learns by participating in the socratic &quot;question and answer&quot; style of learning. The examples train the reader to think recursively and present methods for developing recursive programs. Everything is built from first principles -- for example, a system of arithmetic and an equation interpreter is built only from number?, add1, and sub1.I highly recommend this entertaining book. The material is straightforward and interesting, yet it hints at much more weighty computer science problems. I think it would an excellent text from which to teach college underclassmen (or perhaps even advanced high-schoolers), especially as a first computer science course or as an adjunct to an algorithms class."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This book was distributed to us, in a CS class, at Rice University in manuscript form. If you are looking for a for a great introduction to Scheme, you've found it. To summarize my reasons for liking this book:1. It has an enormous amount of information packed into easily readable portions2. More complex concepts are tied to the simpler concepts they depend upon3. Material is organized in order of complexity4. Each concept is described from many angles5. When describing syntax, the sub-parts of complex syntax are explained well too, providing a fuller explaination. Thus, one develops a better intuitive sense of the language6. Last but not least, it is excellently written, the style is entertaining but does not compromise profundity. You won't be falling asleep. It's a rivetting read!"},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"The Little Schemer is most emphatically not a reference to the Scheme programming language. Nor will it tell you how to get your Scheme Interpreter to print \\"Hello World!\\" These are not flaws, though, any more than my TV's inability to cook a TV dinner is a flaw.The Little Schemer is written to teach you how to think about programming using recursion, which is the natural way to program in Scheme. And at this, it succeeds brilliantly. It starts with the simplest ideas and then proceeds inductively from those elements to develop programming patterns.Few people find it natural to think in terms of recursive functions. Scheme's programming style may seem even more foreign to those who have done all their coding in procedural languages, such as C, Java, and Visual Basic. The value of The Little Schemer is in the way it transforms the unnatural into the natural."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"I had exposure to Lisp in an excellent languages course I took, but forgot most of what I learned. I decided that I would like to learn Scheme to improve the way I think about certain things, and this book does just that.This book isn't a reference for the structure of the Scheme language. It's a guide to learning to think for Scheme; a guide for amazing recursion.I can't imagine that the reviewers who complain about a lack of structure in this book got very far. The format is a little odd for the first couple of pages, since they immediately start asking questions without having told you anything, but it's an excellent way to learn, and I became accustomed to it very quickly. There is certainly a logical structure to the book, and it has to be read sequentially. The arguments about the book's lack of logic must be from readers offended that the authors don't spell out an outline for you ahead of time."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"This is, without doubt, the best book I've ever read on computer science. It is also the strangest. It covers an astonishing range of ideas, from the practical matters of Scheme syntax, to some aspects of Goedel's incompleteness results.The pedagogical style is semi-programmed. That is, learning proceeds by question and answer, almost Socratic. I found it most useful to read the chapters away from the computer. This made it necessary to think through each question. Afterwards, I would go to the computer, work through each exercise and then experiment.Were I still teaching Computer Science, I would be inclined to use this book and approach for the first semester of an undergraduate course for Computer Science majors."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"The Little Schemer is a unique book that introduces the reader to recursion by way of the scheme programming language. This book is not a full introduction to scheme, only a small subset of the scheme programming language is introduced including the keywords car, cdr, cons, cond, lambda, quote and define along with a few built in functions like eq?, null?, add1, and sub1. Indeed, to define even local variables you will have to wait for the second book in the series titled appropriately The Seasoned Schemer. This book introduces basic notions of what to do in scheme such as using cons to build lists, but it focuses on the idea of recursion which is introduced in chapter 2 and then enlarged upon throughout the book. All through the book there are references to famous computer scientists and their contributions giving the reader a fascinating glimpse into the theory behind programming a computer. Functions as first class values are introduced in chapter 8 and in chapter 9 the Halting Problem is introduced as well as the Y-Combinator. Finally in chapter 10 you build a simple scheme interpretor for the keywords you have seen so far. I found chapter 9 to be difficult and still do not understand it fully but otherwise I found the book to be very illuminating especially in regard to it's presentation of recursion. I highly recommend this book anyone who programs a computer. Even if you don't work with scheme the introduction to recursion will be an invaluable aid to programming in any language."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"Not software engineering.

But if you want to learn what computer science is all about, this book will set you off in the right direction.Computer science is, of course, a useful tool in engineering and development, but the things you learn here will enable you to think thoughts that you might not have ever dreamed possible. It's a book about the very nature of computation, taking you from seemingly trivial beginnings to the outermost limits of what computational machines can and cannot do.Despite the title, I would recommend that you get some experience as a Scheme programmer before you embark on this book; if you already know some Scheme, then you will be able to better focus on the computational theory that this book is really about.

He shoots for things other than SI of course, but that's where you are sure to have seen his work. His style is unmistakeable. His photos rich, often dark, the subject reigns for our attention. You can tell this guy not only loves sports, but is a pretty keen observer of the things of life that surround him. Sporting Life is a weird mix, just like Iooss's work is. There are TONS of polaroids that he's shot of athletes, babes and babe athletes. Rough life. Mixed in with the shots are these bizarre, cool, modern pop collages of newspaper headlines, photos, stuff that he picked up while he was shooting his assignment. On the printed page it looks like a book of assemblage art. I love it. And if you love polaroids, edgy shooting, modern culture, you'll like this diary.

In the US, I have encountered their book exclusively as Sam's Clum and Half-Price Books, ranging between $10 and $15 for full-color, slick-paper hardbacks. Knowing this, you'd likely be very suspicious of the product...but it's suprisingly good!The format of the \\"Question and Answers\\" series is usually a blatant copy of the publication styles of Usborne and DK. White background, full-color illustration, and little miniblurbs of information dominate some titles, while others (like Mighty Machines) have more colorful pages. Mighty Machines is quite large--a generous 8.5x11\\", as is The USA. Others are smaller. (The Natural World is only 8x6\\". It is about animals only.)Mighty Machines contains eight chapters:Racing MachinesShips and SubsCarsTrainsMotorbikesTrucks and DuggersAircraftSpacecraftEach contain a lot of historical information (What were clippers?) and record-type information (Who were the first people to fly?) as well as plenty of fun trivia (Who wears a yellow shirt if he's winning?). Sometimes the Q-and-A format is annoyingly forced (Who used fast cars to get away?), but overall, this will be a book that any transportation-crazyed boy will love.I recommend all the titles in the series.

If you have already mastered some introductory courses such as &quot;Teach Yourself Spanish&quot;, or &quot;Just Listen n' Learn Spanish&quot;, or even &quot;Suenos-2&quot;, then you are ready for this one. The course is a story about an office worker (Merche) in an advertizing agency in Madrid, Spain. The plot is interesting and full of valuable colloquial Spanish. The course consists in 2 books and several hours of audiotapes. The story unfolds as we listen to Merche's conversations with her friends, her employers, with government officials, or even with a garage mechanic. The lively and captivating conversations are interspersed with a music that I am not particularly fond of but got used to after listening to the tapes for more than 10 times. At first, the audiotapes may seem to be a considerable hurdle. You may struggle to identify the foreign words and to decipher the meaning of the rapidly flowing conversations. However, if you persist, and keep listening, you will gradually get used to the voices and sounds and eventually, you will master the whole course. This course greatly helps in improving your listening comprehension of everyday Spanish. It is certainly worth the price."},{"Title":"Practice and Improve Your Spanish Plus with Book (Practice & Improve)","review":"The music on this tape set is so annoying and bizarre that I can't stand to listen to it again.

The tales that it tells of the masters of science fiction tell of a time I'm not sure that short, popular fiction will ever see again.While many of the authors still lived when this was originally published, and there was a bit more story to tell about their lives, this is a valuable reference for anyone interested in the lives of the writers, not just what their fiction contained.Thanks to Amazon and it's re-sellers, I now have a hardbound copy complete with dust jacket for a nifty price! Thanks re-sellers, thanks Amazon, and thanks Sam Moskowitz for writing a book that I'd still want to buy 40 years after I read it the first time!"},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce on Dreams","review":"There really is such thing and Amazon subscribers probably already know this. I had studied Fraud and Jung's dream interpretation and still found something missing in my own experience. This book was the link to the unconscious and the world of spirit. The author takes the real life experiences of a couple's dream experiences through 20 years +. Cayce's interpretation sees the levels of dreams with the clarity to understand their physical, intellectual and spiritual content. Read this book."},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce on Dreams","review":"Having completed my thesis on the function of sleep and dreaming, I have read extensively on the subject. While I tend to lean more toward physiological neuroscience perspectives on the functions of our dreams, I am very open-minded and believe that our dreams surely serve a psychological purpose as well. I picked up this book expecting something more than I got. I was presented with a poorly written and gender biased first chapter(for example, when talking of one of Cayce's clients &quot;She turned to the woman's world of family and relationships...&quot; Granted it was written several decades ago, but still...) Honestly, I'm avoiding finishing the book. I am sure Cayce himself was a very talented dream interpreter and helped many people but Harmon Bro does not do him justice here."},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce on Dreams","review":"I've had vivid dreams all my life, but was stumped when it came to interpretation. This book (a GREAT read if ever there was one) gave me the skills needed to accurately interpret not only my dreams but those of my family and friends, too. I can't say enough good things about this book, and the author's knack for economy in expression. Once you've read this book, you'll have the skills to immediately sort out dream images. An unexpected side benefit was a dream interpretation that enabled me to increase my personal net worth by 500% in less than three months!"},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce on Dreams","review":"I have enjoyed other Edgar Cayce books, however, this one left much to be desired. The information on dream interpretation was sketchy, when the author discussed Cayce's OWN dreams and the fact that they were &quot;submitted for interpretation&quot;, he didn't indicate who interpreted them! In addition, most of the example cases used in the book just seemed to be heavily stuck on the Stock Market.

Adults didn'tknow how to handle me and kids my chronological age thought I was an Adult spy.For the past 20 years in Georgia, we've averaged about 100 known murders or 'unexplained' deaths each year of children under the care of DFACS---Department of Family and Children Services. It seems the worse job DFACS, the more money they get---sort of like the situation in most Government K-12 schools.Anyway, at the time I bought this book I had been working at one of the largest county run juvenile detention centers in the US, the Fulton County Youth Detentionand Treatment Center. Some kids were sent to this JAIL because it was safer thanbeing in DFACS custody! Example: One Ohio 10 year old boy thought he was goingwith his parents to Disney World at Christmas time. When the parents got to Atlanta, they dropped their kid at our Juvy Jail---and left. The kid was safe at Juvy; but, within 24 hrs after transfer to an Emergency Child Shelter run by DFACS, he was beaten so badly that he spent a week at Grady Hospital ICU. Once the boy got well, he was accused of 'Assault and Battery' by the person who almostbeat him to death! And sent back to our Juvy Jail. This kid stayed in lock-up at Juvy Jail for 6 months! Crime? He wasn't wanted by his parents and DFACS was too dangerous.Happily, a child advocate lawyer found out about this situation and 'adopted'the boy outside the normal adoption channels only \\"If the lawyer would not mentionthis DFACS 'faux pas'to the media. Mention this to the media and thiskid gets returned to DFACS.\\" That was 15 years ago. Oh, BTW, this 10 yearold kid weighed about 50 lbs. and looked like he was just 5 or 6. The kidculprit who put this child in Grady ICU was 16, about 5'10\\" and 160 lbs.How do I explain the Lapp sisters' book?

First, it is easy to read and understand, but it delivers a knock-out punch to evolutionary theory. This is because Dr. McMurtry was an evolutionist for many years and this background has given him a unique approach to writing about the controversy between creation science and evolution. Second, this book covers a wide range of topics. It handles everything from the flood to dinosaurs to geochronometers (young earth theory) to carbon 14 dating in specific detail.Finally, it is very obvious that this author has a thorough command of his subject, therefore, giving his writing an authority that cannot be ignored."},{"Title":"Creation: Our World View","review":"I heard this gentleman do a presentation which was filled with a plethora of logical fallacies, sheer nonsense, and laughable logic. This book merely dumbs down dumb ideas to something a kindergartener would find ridiculous. Evolution does not preclude a belief in God, and \\"Dr.\\" McMurtry (if you research, he received his \\"Doctorate of Divinity\\"--usually an honorary degree--from an unaccredited Bible College) seems to want everyone to believe that you are either a Bible-fearing believer or an atheist. A typical either/or fallacy and pure rubbish. Don't waste your time with this pseudo-scientific hack."},{"Title":"Creation: Our World View","review":"This is such an easy-to-understand look at the different reasons why people either believe in evolution or Creation. They both involve faith. We cannot test either of them directly. None of us were there in the beginning. The huge difference?

Trust me, one does not have a leg to stand on."},{"Title":"Creation: Our World View","review":"Awesome book that brings the evidence to light in a simple way. Most people I beleive will come away with a better understanding that evolution has a lot of questions to answer.

He has a degree from the University of Tenn (GO Vols!!!), Masters is from State University Of NY, so besides what the other reveiwers may say, Mr. McMurtry has a quality education."},{"Title":"First-Aid Kit for Mothers: Loving Care to Wrap Your Heart and Soul!

It's perfect for day hikes along the rim or packed on raft trips, but if you're going on a long canyon trek on foot you may find it a bit heavy to pack. The great number of pages devoted to an overview of history, basic geology, trails, etc. are not really necessary on the trail and I have even considered cutting all that extraneous material out, as the field guide portions are excellent, but I shrink from slicing up a good book! Steve, how about a two-volume set next time, one for the armchair and one for the trail? Though there is information about Canyon hiking routes, this is not a trail guide; you'll want to get Scott Thybony's or Sharon Spangler's book for that, or one of several others that are available. But it is valuable reading for anyone planning to spend time in one of our most magnificent parks, and certainly worth tossing into your suitcase, if not into your backpack."},{"Title":"A field guide to the Grand Canyon","review":"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said, except that I really like the overviews of Canyon geology and so on, and don't feel that those make to book too heavy to be useful as a field guide.

H. Lawrence's &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; should have been titled &quot;Mother and Sons&quot;, since it is an unflinching, at times harsh, look at a mother's relationship with her two sons, especially with the younger son, Paul Morel, who suffers from an Oedipus complex with his mother. Mrs. Morel is portrayed by Lawrence as someone who tries to steer the lives of her sons, especially Paul, intervening in his choice of lovers and careers. Although her motives may be noble, her actions have unforseen consequences which affect adversely Paul's life. Lawrence's novel is said to be semiautobiographical, since the Morels are seen as fictitious counterparts of his own family. It surely is a literary classic, since it was the first to look at a dysfunctional family's affairs prior to the advent of Freud's psychological writings. It also remains memorable due to Lawrence's splendid, often lyrical, prose."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I hated most of the characters, but I still loved this novel. It kept me interested the whole three days it took to read. Definitely read this book!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons and Lovers tells the story of the Morels, which are the counterpart of the authors own family. It is in this book where D.H. Lawrence explores probably for the first time the circumstances and conditions of his youth in order to set himself free of the shadows of the past. The dominant, omnipresent influence of his mother a tie so strong he is hardly able to bear her death. So strong he almost chooses to follow her into the immense night which engulfed her. And if he walked and walked for ever, there was only that place to come to the place where his dead mother was awaiting him. Yet in the end, facing the seduction of death, he turns around and walks towards the light the faintly humming, glowing town thus deciding to continue the path of his life, alone but free. The story of a mother with an unfulfilled life and a marriage that was failure, too. A mother that substitutes her own life by the lives of her sons, making their success her victory. The victory that will make her triumph over the share of life she didnt get. Mrs Morel takes possession her sons of the lives, especially of Pauls (the counterpart of D.H. Lawrence). And by doing so she casts a shadow on all of Pauls actions, thoughts, and experiences. Everything he will do he will do it, in the end for his mother. This pressure, this shadow makes it impossible for him to see the light which would lead him along the path of his life and therefore his youth becomes a struggle, a fight against himself. He falls in love, but eventually he isnt able to love. The mother, sitting at home, jealous, is his conscience and she wouldnt allow anybody to come close to him. And so we see Paul grow up, a person bursting of life yet unable to live. With passion he falls in love, the passion though turns into pain. Pain, the keyword of the book, penetrates every chapter. A sensitive soul, deeply connected with nature, caught in torture. He felt as if his blood was melting into tears or his vision of a sunset: Gold flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness make us feel how the world of Paul utterly dissolves into torment and struggle. A book that is the vision of pain, not without any happiness, but always a happiness based on pain. This vision comes to us so real, so profound and sincere that the book seems to me an approach on life itself."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"THE BOOK WAS A SCHOOL BOOK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. BUT I MOST ENJOYED IT WHEN I READ AGAIN AFTER SEVEN YEARS. D.H.LAWRANCE IS A FOVORITE FOR ME ALLWAYS. I LEARNED MUCH OF ENGLISH FOR THE SAKE OF READING NOVELS WHICH WERE NEVER TRANSLATED TO TURKISH. D.H.LAWRENCE ALLWAYS EXPRESSES THE EVENTS BY THE EYE OF A MALE. YOU CAN NOTICE THE MANLY OPINIONS AT EVERY LINE AND BEHIND THE LINES. SOME WRITERS TRY TO TELL THE STORY BY THE EYE OF THE OTHER SEX AND THIS GIVES THE TASTE OF LIE TO THE STORY. SO REAL AND SWEET NOVEL. REALITY WAS NEVER SO SWEETLY EXPRESSED LIKE THIS BEFORE D.H.LAWRENCE.(SORRY FOR THE ERRORS IF THERE ARE, BECAUSE ENGLISH IS NOT MY MOTHER LANGUAGE.)"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This novel wins the unique distinction of being the smelliest novel i have ever read. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that throughout the story the reader's nose is besieged with myriad scents of flowers, flowers that are counterbalanced by the pungent scents of grimy coal miners. This is one of the beauties of this novel.However I am not a Lawrence fan and think this by far his best work. The reason it is his best is because he keeps his utterly irrelavant philosopies out of the story; he doesn't wine and lament about the &quot;plight&quot; of &quot;modern man&quot;. He does however do this in the following novel, the Rainbow, which is a complete disaster. Don't trust anyone who compares Lawrence to Henry Miller; unlike Miller Lawrence actually is capable of writing well."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"D.H Lawrence has obviously, with this book, created some kind of magical formula: rambling, wittering prose with no real direction can suddenly be accepted as an important novel. Why is this book taught in schools? It's style favours that of the long-winded, ill-thought-out mood-building, yet where Lawrence fails is in his descriptions of the characters within the book. They actually have very little depth. It has been said that this book is autobiographical. This suggests to me that Lawrence knows his characters so well, he expects the reader to simply know the characters, beyond the description of them as &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;sad&quot;.It occurs to me that Lawrence simply spewed his thoughts out on to the page when writing this book, and what dull thoughts they were."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I offered this book at my form 6.Now as a reader and a teacher of sons and lovers, I have discovered where its novelity lies.It is not an exciting book yet it is full of realism and the reality of its themes is what propelles one to read every single page of it.There is however a likely misconcept to develop in the reader, towards Walter Morel's character.He is painted as brutal but if we ask ourselves why a sensous,jolly man Getrude meets at a christmas party grows into a violet husband he is only after a year of marriage,We will honestly attribute his infamous character to his wife.The treatment he suffers at the hands of his own sons is not also encouraging."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I bought this book because my brother was reading it and kept saying how interesting it was. The story is about a woman who marries someone below her class and then invests everything in her children. The story focuses on her relationship with her son Paul. The story follows the life of Paul from birth through early adulthood. His tightly knit relationship with his mother seems to have a negative impact on his love life. How does it all end?! You'll have to read it to find out!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Despite what one reviewer said, this book cannot have been written from Paul's POV as he talks about people and circumstances that occurred before he was born, and about peoples' inner thoughts of which he could have no knowledge. As I read this 3rd person omniscient novel. I kept thinking \\"Oh, hell, get on with it!\\" Having read Lady Chatterly's Lover, I knew this tome was going to be a slog-fest, and I was right. On the other hand, in 1913, the reading public had lots of time and no TV soap operas, so I suppose they didn't mind tedious passages. For example, Lawrence labors over mom's and Paul's love of flowers (she's thrilled to find blue flowers in winter) and I wanted to scream, \\"Okay, I get it, flowers symbolize fecundity and beauty, and mom and son(s) have a relationship bordering on incestuous, only without the sex. Now what?\\" I started skipping whole passages and lost nothing of the chain of events. Dad is always a no-goodnik, and mom is always a prim saint. It's an okay story, but what was the point again? Oh, yeah, life is nasty, brutish and short. And quite a bore for poor, downtrodden Mom. I guess Lawrence's desire to be on the cutting edge with his self-proclaimed masterpieve didn't include an obvious alternate conclusion: the book could have been titled, Gay Sons and Lovers.That it was written in 1913, when people were still shocked by tasetlessness and for the most part unaware of Freudian psychology, I'm sure it was steamy for its day. But this story could have been written as a twenty page short story and should have been."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Wow...I don't remember the last time that I've read a novel that would bring out in me such immense sensitivity as this one. With incredible detail Lawrence describes his life and ihs biggest loves. Perhaps I should not be writing this review because I only read 200 pages so far, but it is just too breathtaking."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"A tour de force! Bravo. It is story of Paul Morel who loves his mother more than himself. Mrs. Morel who is married to a ignorant, illiterate coal miner tries to find comfort, solace and love in her sons, first with Walter and when Walter dies unexpectedly, with Paul, the second son. She lives for him, he for her. She is so possessive of him that she objects his involvement with his first love, Miriam. He then goes after, Clara, a married woman. The book revolves around Paul and these three desperate women, who comfort him, torture him andhe scornfully resiprocates. But he is always faithful to his mother , who he adores. I guess we are all like Paul, in someways. Miriam is a haunting character who reverberates in the entire book, so innocent, pure, religious, pious and madly in love with Paul. Clara, on the other hand, very rigid, calculating, demanding and yet very vulnerable. In Paul we see callousness, sacrifice, piety, haughtiness, repentance, a bit of Roskolnikov, a young man whose life is torn between a adoring mother and two lovers. In the end his high spirits and intellegence prevail and he conquers his demons."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This is a perfect book for anyone who enjoys reading twentieth century British literature. I like the fact that D. H. Lawrence is able to realistically portray the emotions of the many characters in the book. I did not only learn Paul's side of the story, but I also gained insight into Gertrude's, Miriam's, and Clara's thoughts and feelings towards Paul and towards each other. This omniscient narration makes the story a more interesting study into human emotions. Lawrence deals very heavily with psychological motivations for each character's actions, making the characters more human and believable. This is a great story that goes far beneath the surface. Sons and Lovers is a thought-provoking tale of love, death, possession, vulnerability, and heartache. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This is not the drum I march to. But it was one of my teacher Ms Worby's favorites. And I can see why. Lawrence does present us with graphic images, dramatic confrontations, an oedipal complex, and a love triangle. The disputes between Clara and Miriam are especially memorable. Clara's vain attitude contrasts sharply with Miriam's genuine love for the protagonist Paul. In all honesty this book is never boring. The reason I could not get overly attached to this is I feel Lawrence lacks the charm that Dickens always throws into his novels. I have respect for this book, and I understand its significance in the world of literature. But I don't feel D.H. Lawrence is another Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"The plot of the story is simple but the narration is very impressive. Life of the main character ,Paul Morel, will be revolving around his mother. Paul will fail to replace his mother by any other woman. When his mother dies, Paul will lose focus and his life becomes chaotic. But it is not a tragedy and story ends with positive note.Following is my favourite part in the novel. Morel is a drunkard and his wife and kids do not like him. I liked the portrayal of change in environment of Morel's house when Morel is in the house and out of the house. The Miriam's character is very consistent.Finally, if you are used to reading classics, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I never thought a book could be so enjoyable, but yet I found it confusing to muddle through the ideas that D. H. Lawrence presents and also the places that he talks about. The end of the book is really confusing because I found myself trying to figure out what had just happened at the end.

It's truly beautiful, and I'm sorry others aren't able to see this."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"To those who've criticized the novel, saying that Gertrude Morel was far to harsh on her husband, have obviously never lived in the type of family situation Lawrence depicted so well. Morel's obvious internal struggle with herself and her family were beautifully portrayed. Lawrence delved into the psyche of both individuals astonishingly well...causing me to see the truth in my own family. Great books are meant to inspire thought, and Sons and Lovers does just that."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"We have, before us, a delicate subject; the male desire to obsessively love his mother coupled with intense hatred of his father. D.H. Lawrence admitted to being troubled by such feelings and expressed them in his third novel, \\"Sons and Lovers.\\" Critics have named it to the top 100 best books of all time. First published in 1913 and originally carrying the title \\"Paul Morel,\\" Lawrence wrote about a dysfunction that Sigmund Freud explored about the same time that became known as the Oedipus complex, so named for the Greek legend of King Oedipus. There's much more to it, of course, but basically \\"Sons and Lovers\\" is a sanitized version of Freud's later lengthy discourse.There's no doubt that Lawrence suffered from such feelings, and his rambling autobiographical novel takes the reader into the deep feelings and troubled musings of Paul Morel, Morel's relationships with his mother and two lovers, hatred for his father, and the subsequent unhappy entry into a lonely life. The feelings are intense, the cogitation never ending, and the entire story is circuitous and based on decisions that sometimes seem poorly implemented.There is no question that Lawrence embodies the classical writer with exceptional language skills and a talent for the portrayal of realistic scenes. One should read this novel, if for nothing else, to revel in the descriptions of the beautiful countryside, the inclement weather, and the community found in rural England's coal country. The passages describing the flora and fauna are mesmerizing in their detail and his descriptions of family life conjure up the simplicity of cooking, eating, and socializing that characterized subsistence during this time in history.The plot is easy to follow but difficult to relate to. A young man is torn between the obsessive love of his mother, the platonic friendship with a neighboring farm girl, and a passionate physical affair with a married woman, all the while harboring extreme hatred for his father. Lawrence captures that simple idea through a multitude of mind-numbing explorations of unfulfilled love, so much so that I found myself becoming impatient with the indecision and shouting, \\"Get on with it.\\"I recommend this book for those with the patience to wade through intense personal relationships, the ability to interpret thick symbolism, and the patience to unravel convoluted streams of consciousness. I would not recommend it to those who want fast action, graphic sexual encounters, or captivating mystery.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Not having read any DH Lawrence I was not sure what to expect.

Excellent insight into life in an English mining village in the early part of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"There's something very satisfying about reading a book that requires some thought.

The writing is good and the picture of industrializing England is interesting to an understanding of the industrial revolution and its varied effects upon individuals and the world."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Besides some poetry, this is the first Lawrence book that I have read. Though this book is not considerably too long, I must admit that it took me a lot longer than usual to finish compared to works by other authors. The writing is not difficult to understand, and there are some excellent prose throughout, but the book just seemed to drag at certain points. Even if you haven't read this book, you probably know that this story is primarily about a mind-controlling mother, Mrs Morel, who ruins her 2nd son, Paul, by forcing him to devote all of his love and attention to her. What results with Paul are heartbreaking relationships with two women and a stifled career as an artist. The breadwinner of the Morel family, though not the head of the family by any means is Mr. Morel, simply referred to as Morel throughout the novel. Morel is an illiterate miner who spends whatever extra money he has on booze. Morel is also cruel and abusive, being despised by all the family members. As the novel progresses we see him age, become softer, but really never forgiven by the family. I found myself actually liking and pitying Morel the most by the end of the novel. Do a little research on D.H. Lawrence's life. He has left the world with an amazing amount of work in his 44 or 45 short years on earth. I will definitely read more of his work, the next likely being Lady Chatterley's Lover."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Lawrence drew a picture of his own life which is an image that many can relate to. His language is clear and even though his writing style is unique to him, it is well understood, making this book highly recommended to all who love and study Literatures in English. A must read."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"First published in 1913, when its author was 28 years old, D H Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers\\" is a semi-autobiographical novel set in central England's Nottinghamshire, Robin Hood country. The story opens with the courtship and marriage of Walter Morel, a miner, and the quiet Gertrude Coppard, four years his junior. Immediately Lawrence sets the mood: \\" ... for three months she was perfectly happy; for six months she was very happy.\\" Soon Walter's drinking takes over their relationship and he begins beating Gertrude, one cold night locking her out of their house. Babies come as a matter of course, and their third child Paul becomes the novel's protagonist, not a gifted writer, like the author himself, but a painter who can hope to support himself with his art. Paul is depicted as having a very strong sex urge, an attribute not frankly discussed in English literature of the previous generation. Even Thomas Hardy (and I detect a very strong influence here) could not depict sexual situations in narratives like \\"Jude the Obscure\\" as Lawrence does in his novels. (In fact, an unexpurgated version of Lawrence's 1928 \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" was not approved until a generation after its original publication, thirty years after the novelist's death.) Paul's intense relationship with his mother has provided critics with all sorts of theories, the most common being that it skirts incest. True, they are very close when Paul is a child and, like his mother, Paul learns to despise his father. He lavishes affection on Gertrude, invents little pet names for her and even admits in one chapter that he won't marry as long as she is alive. But I don't think it's so much attraction on his part as affinity. They both distrust the same people, such as animalistic Walter and tenacious Miriam, the girl Paul comes close to marrying, much to his mother's horror. (Paul also seems to have inherited his mother's basic selfishness along with her devotion, so that his motives in Chapter XIV are apt to raise ambivalent feelings in the reader.) Gertrude is more ready to accept the coolly elegant Clara, probably because Clara is already unhappily separated from her husband Baxter, a man his wife finds difficult but still desirable. Paul's tense relations with these three women form the plot of \\"Sons and Lovers\\" and keep the reader deeply involved in its development. Granted the prose sometimes shades off into purple (\\"The hot blood came up wave upon wave\\"), for the most part the tone is well-controlled. To read this direct book is to understand why Lawrence became one of the most controversial authors of his time."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons and Lovers was good read - format was not great but ok - love the charecter descriptions - very well written"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Great story line but almost too descriptive when it comes to countryside. Skipped over that a lot. Had difficult time with the father's language. Felt sorry for Paul's mother's hold over him. Predicted the outcome."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Though the title is obvious, the lesson is less so. I read and enjoyed this book, absent senses of change -- Lawrence for me is either the end of Edwardianism or the beginning of Modernism. I have to tell the truth when I say that I am not sure.What I am sure of is Lawrence's pathetic appeal. When I finished this book, the part of me that mattered was the son, and less so the lover. I called my mother, much to her surprise, and poured to her.I loved it, but you have to be careful; you'll cry."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This novel was required reading in one of my college classes. I think it's a good story, well-written, with conflict and drama. Lawrence creates a very real setting, a very real time period, and real characters who are in conflict over their wants and needs. The conflict between working class necessity (putting bread on the table) and middle class values (wanting the bread served on fine china set on lace tablecloths) reverberates throughout the story. I found it sad that the character (and, presumably, D.H. Lawrence himself) chose one parent and one set of values over another, though I do understand that he felt he had to do this in order to live a literary life. The characters in this story aren't exactly likable, though they aren't bad people. For me, this book succeeds because it paints a real portrait of different class values."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"My edition takes pains to make clear that Lawrence had not read Freud before he wrote this book, and was only slightly familiar with psychoanalytic theory when the novel was published. That makes it all the more interesting that Sons and Lovers is basically a case history of an Oedipal Complex. Also, Lawrence's alter-ego Paul comes across as a person who (as Lawrence would later say of himself)'tends to homosexuality' but there too it is unclear whether Lawrence realizes this or is revealing more than he means to. Generally the feeling is that of reading someone's most intimate diary, and wondering if he intended it for publication all along. And while the diarist is a pompous, annoying sort of a person, it's intriguing enough that you're inspired to keep going.As added fun while reading, play a game I'm calling Misogynist Bingo and see how many times in the book a female character 'bends', 'bows', or 'drops' her head, compared with how often a male character does. Emo-chick Miriam's neck, particularly, is liable to snap in two at any minute from sheer overuse."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This book was rather interesting, possibly because it is about mommas boys and I happen to currently be dating one...lol it is kind of an inside view from the mothers perspective. Great read, would and have recommended it. I think its only 400 pages or so, so its not exceedingly difficult. I am most likely going to read some of D.H. Lawrence's other books now."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Paul Morel, the protagonist of Sons and Lovers, can only give his heart to one woman. And as long as his mother is alive, she will sabotage any relationship that Paul tries to form. Paul wavers with Miriam and Clara, two love interests, because he is unconditionally bound to his mother. He has seen how she has been mistreated and vows not to make her life harder. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers is a rehashing of Oedipus Rex, with richer, more developed characters whose fate is equally heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This great and slowly moving novel remains one of the final great works in the English Romantic tradition. D.H. Lawrence's conservative style almost wants to remain in the pre-industrial world. This wonderful novel is both an oedipal portrait of a bourgois mother and her domestic conflicts with her mismatched and drunken husband and her future attempts to conserve her possession over her children. Paul Morel is the central figure, whose life revolves around his struggle with his love of two women and his devotion to his mother. Sons and Lovers is at its core about the dehumanizing effects of the modern world. It is no longer possible to live in peace and harmony with ones environment. Man has now been reduced to his functions. Although this novel does not really get going until the second half, the final passages remain some of the finest of English writing. A great though often dreary classic."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"It was a pleasure to read this book,written in such a simple, crisp style and yet conveys the gravity of emotions between mother and son flawlessly with beautiful prose, subtle expressions, quiet reflections and profound discoveries. This is a true classic."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Just so tragic novel! A woman who's helplessly married to a drunk, clinging on her children, sons especially, for love and comfort. I'm only at the moment 15, but this novel just truely hurts the human heart to read...you just start thinking,&quot; How ungratful can children be?&quot; Well, now I can relate to how mothers and fathers may feel about their &quot;wild&quot; teenagers...one like I."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This book is amazing. When I first started reading it I was afraid the book might drag at times but this was not the case. I never found myself becoming bored during the book, in fact, there were many times where I found it hard to put the book down. I have recomended this book to everybody, including to the person reading this review.Maybe the book is good for me because I can somewhat relate to Paul Morel's character at times. Now I am not saying that I am in love with my mother, but his akwardness in the earlier sections of the book really struck me. The scenes are so vivid in the book that a reader almost feels that they are there in England with Paul. I also loved how Lawrence would give the thoughts of the female characters as well as Paul. Again, I must say that the book was excellent and I look forward to reading it again soon."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons and Lovers is a story of how a complicated relationship between Mother and son affect relations with the son's lover. Sons and Lovers is written with more passion that other Lawrence works, probably because Lawrence's own life so closely mirrors that of the characters in this novel.The plot revolves around Paul Morel and his family. The Father is a coal miner whose bruttish behavior makes Paul detest him. Paul's Mother, full of contempt for her husband, pours all of her love toward her children, particularly the two eldest males. As Paul matures his attempts at a relationship with a lover are hindered by these complications. Paul, like his older brother William, finds that his choice of lover can never be accepted by his Mother."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"'Sons And Lovers' is perhaps the most touching classic by D H Lawrence. The story revolves around the Morel family, a lower-middle class family living on the Nottingham coalfield. Initially, Lawrence vividly describes the hardships faced by Mrs. Morel in raising a family of three sons and a daughter while living from hand to mouth, in face of the frequent beatings delivered by an oft-drunk miner husband. For the larger part, he examines in detail the passionate relationship between Mrs. Morel and her second son, Paul. Disillusioned from her drunkard and temperamental husband and devastated by the death of her elder son, Mrs. Morel has high expectations from her second son, Paul. At the same time, Paul is torn between his duty towards his beloved mother, and his passion for the two other women in his life, Clara and Miriam. It is widely believed that through this novel, Lawrence has addressed the dynamics of his own complicated relationship with his mother, and has depicted the dilemma that faced him. D H Lawrence has masterfully handled the fragile subject of intimate relationships between loved ones. In my view, it is a definite must-read. Also recommended: Waiting by Ha Jin, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons and Lovers is a book that has been set for years in school for children to read. Somehow doing this usually means that most people emerge with a hatred of it but Lawrence's book is of such quality that it is able to survive.It is about a woman who marries a coal miner someone who is below her class. While he is young there is some joy in her life but as she grows older the class differences create a wall between them. She lives for her two male children who she tried to keep out of the mines and to ensure that they can live middle class lives. As she grows older the children become more important to her. The death of the oldest means that she suffocates the younger son with a love that affects his normal development.The story is told through the eyes of the younger son. There is little question that the novel is autobiographical and based on the early life of Lawrence. His life is almost identical to the events portrayed in the novel.Lawrence was a prolific novelist and short story reader but this work is probably his most accessible. His later novels tended to be more about peoples relationships but without the social content.Nowadays the class issues have receded a bit into the background. At the time of its publication the book would have been seen as revealing the divisions that operated in Britain. Most critics tend to focus on the relationship of Lawrence and his mother as the primary focus of the novel. To some extent this is true but the book is much more. It is a portrait of a society thankfully now gone. It is the portrait of a young man being propelled by his mother to escape his fathers destiny. Unlike Lawrence's other books which have tended to date this book is easy to read and still a classic."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Emotional manipulation and possessiveness are at the core of this most intriguing novel. D.H. Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS greets the reader with the author's elegant prose while systematically immersing the story in a swirling cloud of tangled dysfunction.Married to a drunken, rowdy coal miner in early 20th Century England, Gertrude Morel has neither a life nor a true love. Her only chance for happiness--as she sees it--is to live vicariously through her sons: first William, then Paul. Her subsequent possessiveness, her relentless interference in their lives, is smothering and destructive. When William dies, Gertrude devotes all of her attention--her manipulation--to Paul. Her son becomes a symbolic soulmate. . .lover. . .and Gertrude is unable to let him go to pursue his own relationships.Torn between his love for his mother and his guilt whenever he harbors feelings of affection for another woman, Paul is anything but a suitable suitor. He falls in love with Miriam, but his emotional dysfunction all but dooms the relationship--a relationship constantly sabotaged by his mother. Needing a physical outlet, he has a brief affair with a married woman, Clara Dawes, but even then, his love for and devotion to his mother prevails. As his mother's health fails, Paul's existence becomes even more problematic, culminating in a transcendent death.SONS AND LOVERS is not a &quot;feel good&quot; read, and Paul's inability to break free from the psychological bondage with his mother is frustrating and sometimes exasperating. Yet the true victim of this Lawrence classic is not Paul, but Miriam, who only wishes to love, and be loved in return. The man she has fallen in love with is incapable of such devotion: the tragic complexity of the story lingers long after this book has been put down.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"The story is brilliant. It is about how a woman (the mother, Gertrude) takes her son (Paul) as her lover instead of choosing her husband. She did not have the will to love the husband, and instead turned that will on a child. The title is not &quot;Fathers and Lovers&quot; or &quot;Husbands and Lovers.&quot; The father is capable of being loved, but in Gertrude's mind, she is too good for the husband. Therefore, she turns her lover's heart towards a child (&quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;). In modern psychobabble, Gertrude doesn't recognize boundaries. The child is defenseless to the emotional power which penetrates him. He is absorbed and becomes one with the mother's heart and goals. It is similar to molestation but instead of a physical penetration, there is an emotional penetration. When the boy starts to grow up and should, rightly, begin to become whole with a woman, he is not free to take that step. His sexuality drives him towards an appropriate lover, and seemingly makes him appear available, but his emotional heart cannot take another woman into himself. There is already a lover who has penetrated his heart (i.e. his mother). For a man to be complete in love, he has to be able to enter a woman physically at the same time he takes her into himself emotionally. Paul can't allow another woman in emotionally because his mother is already there. Hence, even though he is able to enter a woman physically, the whole experience is deeply unsatisfying to both Paul and all the women in his life. The mother is not really satisfied because she can't have her lover completely (i.e. physically and as her life's mate), and the other women in Paul's life (with whom he could have a physical relationship) are left unsatisfied because he wills not to take them into himself emotionally, and thereby deprives these women of the experience of wholeness which accompanies surrender in love. Hence, the women he should be able to complete himself with (i.e. those with whom he can complete the physical act), he eventually wears out. They give up because he is not available. His heart belongs to another. E.g. Claire goes back to her husband even though Claire's husband is less refined, because Claire would rather have all of a working man, than only part of an artist. There are scads of women today who are throwing themselves at this inpenetrable wall of the mother's inappropriate molestation of her son's emotions, not really understanding why and how to work with it. Lawrence sheds insight into that process. The cure is to exchange the will to love the mother for the will to love the lover. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This work by D.H. Lawrence was rated number 9 on the top 100 list, and I think it's a fair rating. Sons and Lovers is a beautifully written and intricately drawn story of a young man. This actually serves as a pseudo autobiography as it mirrors DHL's life rather closely. There is a quality to this work that you do not find in contemporary novels. The characters are developed to an incredible depth and with great skill and precision. You find after reading this book that you feel you know some of the characters better than your neighbors. This is not a book about action or drama, it is about life. The focus here is not on the storyline, but on the people involved in it. As opposed to today's authors, Lawrence uses the storyline to define the character and personality of the participants. I think this book is so well written that it can make you look at your own friends and family and understand how little you really know of them. Many scholars talk about the idea of Lawrence introducing the Oedipal complex, but it's not really what this book is all about. While that psychiatrical phenomenon is a component of this work, the defining quality of this work is really about Lawrence's ability to capture the people in his story as eloquently and with such detail as he has. If you can appreciate good literature, this book is a must read for you."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This story of the Morel family begins with a dramatic portrayal of the effect industrialization has on human lives. Mr. Morel, a coal miner in turn-of-the-century Britain, lives a life of drudgery, anger and desperation. He takes his frustrations out on his wife Gertrude, while the real source of his unhappiness is his own low self-esteem. Gertrude is embittered by his hardness and so looks to her sons to fill all her emotional needs. This constitutes Part One of the novel, which to this reviewer's taste is the more satisfying section. The detailed descriptions of the arguments and even outright fights between the married couple are as powerful as anything in fiction, and bleakly dramatize how poverty can destroy the very hearts and souls of the working classes. Morel is oppressed by his employer, so he in turn oppresses his wife, who emotionally smothers her sons. Fight the power!All of which is what makes Part Two such a disappointment. The entire second half of the book revolves around the second son, Paul, and how his closeness to his mother makes it impossible for him to engage in satisfactory relationships with other women. Miriam, the milquetoast who yearns for a transcendent, spiritual love, cares for Paul so much that she lets him walk all over her. The much tougher and independent Clara introduces Paul to a more physically satisfying relationship, but neither of them has any real attachment to the other. The weakness of this second half is not just that it all seems to take far too long; it's that over time, the characters become very unsympathetic. None of them have the strength of will to break away from their failing relationships, despite the fact that these failures cast dark shadows across their lives. And there's certainly nothing tragic about these young people mooning about, complaining that their relationships aren't what they'd like them to be; most especially in the context of Part One, which reminds us that there are people in this world who are really suffering.Readers who are deeply interested in the internal subtleties of male-female relationships (and this probably includes a majority of young women) will love this book. If the two parts were published separately, this reviewer would unhesitatingly give Part One five stars, while grudgingly giving Part Two three and a half. For Mama's boys (and those who've seriously dated them) this book certainly rates five stars, but others will find these characters so annoying that even four stars may seem generous."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This is probably the most autobiographical of Lawrence's novels, dealing with the childhood, adolescence and early adulthood of the author. It is a brutally frank portrayal of the relationship betweem a domineering mother and the younger (and surviving) son, a relationship that colors every aspect of the protagonist's life, from his relationship with his father to his romantic relationships with two very different women. Lawrence paints this portrait with very fine brush strokes: an attention to descriptive detail and some of the best characterization in modern English literature. Although the reader might not like the characters in the novel, there is no doubt that these are real people - especially the mother, Mrs. Morel. The setting of the novel is the coal fields of Nottingham and Lawrence carries on the work begun by Thomas Hardy in writing of the English working class with realism and detachment, eschewing the English literary tendency to moralize and to judge.When Lawrence began the novel he had only passing knowledge of the theories of Freud regarding the mother-son relationship that became the backbone of the psychologist's Oedipus Complex. Essentially the author was writing from experience: the psychic bond between Mrs. Morel and her son, Paul, was very similar to the bond shared by Lawrence and his mother. This bond between son and mother amounts almost to a husband and wife sort of love - without the sex - and prevents the son from ever achieving a fully satisfactory relationship with another woman because of the hold the mother has on the son's soul. It is not until the mother is dead that the son is able to begin to free himself from her hold. The novel, then, is the story of that struggle.I have never been a great fan of Lawrence's literary style, finding it a bit too jerky and over edited - a criticism I find with this novel. True, there are passages of poetic beauty (especially some of the descriptions of the Nottinghamshire countryside) but I found the prose a bit too tedious and lacking spontaneity. This is probably Lawrence's best novel (far superior to the more popular Lady Chatterley's Lover) and the one on which his reputation is firmly based; also, a novel that should be read by every mother and every son."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I read this a long time ago and hated it with a passion. I was chuckling reading the one-star reviews here, because had the Internet been around when I first read this book, I would have given it a scathing, one-star review.The first time around, I was bored to tears, and it took me forever to finish. This time, I was so moved by certain sections my tears were falling on the page, and it took me only a week (or maybe it was six days) to finish. And though I will never call this my favorite classic, I liked it so much that currently I am reading Lawrence's \\"The Rainbow.\\"Make sure you get an edition that helps explain the dialect. After a while, I was able to figure it out myself, and that was kind of fun -- almost like learning a new language."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"D.H. Lawrence is a beautiful writer that goes deep into the human mind and soul to write. He is never satisfied with meer fiction, with mediocre descriptions or with plain verse. Lawrence loves to pick the mind and sexuality of both males and females. His books, though called dirty and shameful, interpret the minds of lustful and questioning young adults in a way that makes love and sex accepting and wonderful.Sons and Lovers can be considered Lawrences autobiography, because of the events and places that were used in the book resemble much of the writer's own life. It gives, therefore, an interpretation of how close Lawrence and his mother really were. D.H. Lawrence has written a woman's thoughts better than many female writers have and spectics have always guessed that he has been able to understand women so well because of his mother's raising. This book will give proof to this idea. Lawrence is very vulnerable here because he not only exposes himself as the son, but also inevitable as the lover.I loved this book not only for it's intuition, but also for it's ability to keep me entertained and excited throughout the events of the lives of the characters. Again, D.H. Lawrence is taking his place as one of my favorite authors of all time!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons and Lovers by D. H. Lawrence. Recommended.Sons and Lovers is said to be the most autobiographical of D. H. Lawrence's novels; according to the introduction by Benjamin DeMott, some critics have found it too flatly so. Like the protagonist Paul Morel, Lawrence was born to a coal miner and a woman who has married beneath her class, and his older brother died young, DeMott notes. Many other details coincide as well.Unlike some of Lawrence's other works, such as Women in Love, in which Lawrence explores lofty themes in a philosophical and often grim tone, Sons and Lovers is as down to earth as Paul's rough, violent, yet congenial father Walter. Despite his many apparent and iterated flaws, Walter Morel is shown as a whole person rather than a fictional creation, with a gentle, content, industrious side, at least when he's sober. Perhaps his \\"smallness\\" is a function of where he is and who he is expected to be rather than who he could be. He's so tied to his lot in life, the mining life, that it never occurs to him that his more gifted sons could aspire to more. That they achieve more is a source of both pride and derision for Walter Morel. Although Walter is a background character (to both reader and to the Morel family), it is he, \\"an outsider,\\" who forges the bond between Gertrude Morel and her sons, first William, then Paul.Gertrude Morel is not the first woman to try to live her life through her children, but her hold over her sons dooms their relationships with other women to failure and leaves them deeply unsatisfied and unhappy. Her motivations may be questionable, but she is sometimes right. William's fianc&eacute;e Lily would have cost him dearly, emotionally and financially, had he lived to marry her, and Mrs. Morel sees her own mistake of a marriage in his future. Although she makes her beliefs known, she seems willing to let William make his decision and suffer the consequences.Having learned from the experience with William, Mrs. Morel takes a different approach with Paul, who seems to be her last, best hope for justifying her own life. Her relationship with Paul becomes overtly sexual. When they go out together, they behave like lovers on a date. \\"He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.\\" When Paul tells his mother that he doesn't love Miriam (how can he?), she \\"kissed him in a long, fervent kiss. 'My boy!' she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love. Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.\\"It would be too easy to attribute all this to an Oedipal complex, but it is more complicated, as life is. Paul serves as Mrs. Morel's alter ego, pseudo-lover, and breadwinner. Everything she did not or cannot have must be Paul's. She is savvy enough to know who is a threat to her hold and who is not. She recognises in Miriam a woman much like herself-intelligent, thwarted, let down by men, hungry for a kindred spirit or soul mate. Paul, too, is aware of this and hates Miriam for it-and for the fact he does, indeed, love her, making him unfaithful to the woman to whom he owes his fidelity. There are spiritual overtones as well, as the religious Miriam tries to sacrifice herself for Paul, whom she sees as a \\"Walter Scott hero.\\" This sacrifice repels Paul ever further.Mrs. Morel rightly perceives that Clara Dawes is not a threat to her-she is fascinating, attractive, enigmatic, and sensual, but she lacks the ability to be more to Paul than a diversion from Miriam, Mom, and himself. Knowing that nothing of importance will come of this affair, Mrs. Morel even encourages it. It cannot divert Paul from her, and it fails as a result.In the end, the only intimacy Paul is capable of is with his mother. She has come between him and his own consciousness-and he has allowed her. Everything is filtered through her.

Lawrence's &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; the Morel family lives in a coal mining village in late 19th Century rural England; the father Walter is a coal miner who comes home drunk every night and fights, often physically, with his wife and children. Unable to control her husband's unruliness, Mrs. Morel directs her affection to her three sons, instigating them to turn against their father. Her love for her sons is not merely maternal, but so possessive that she gets jealous when the boys focus their attention on the neighborhood girls, whom she treats with haughty condescension.Paul, the middle son, is Lawrence's alter ego. He aspires to be an artist but works as a clerk in a surgical appliance factory to bring money home to the family. When his older brother William dies of pneumonia, Paul replaces him as the primary object of his mother's affections. At times their mutual endearment is so extreme and smothering that it's downright creepy, such as when she embraces Paul and tells him that she never &quot;really&quot; had a husband, implying that Paul somehow must act as a spousal surrogate.Paul starts a shy relationship with a girl named Miriam, but his mother's guilt trip prevents him from making a full commitment. Eventually he turns his interest to an older woman, Clara Dawes, who works in his factory and is separated from her husband. As opposed to the clingy, sensitive, virginal Miriam, Clara is liberated, proud, aloof, sexually passionate, and generally distrustful of men. Her husband, who also works in the factory, is a loose cannon and tries violently to intimidate Paul.Paul's relationships with Miriam and Clara are full of tension and antagonism. He unleashes on the women the hostilities that he had stored subconsciously against his mother, criticizing them for faults displayed by Mrs. Morel and not their own. It is ironic that his mother dies from cancer, since Paul realizes that his mother's cancerous influence on him lingers even after her death.Lawrence's motive in writing this book may have been to exorcise some childhood and adolescent demons, maybe in an attempt to explain his own personal relationships with women. At any rate, he is an excellent writer; like W. Somerset Maugham, his prose is direct and unpretentious, and he can write romantic scenes and dialogue without being melodramatic or tawdry. The theme of maternal influence is timeless, relevant in any age, and Lawrence captures it perfectly."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"D.H has the intention to destroy realism .He wants what is physic than human .D.H describes Mrs. Morel as she is the bearer of culture .But she is suffering from a certain void"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"The setting of the novel is in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire area of England. The novel is the story of the Morel family. Gertrude and Walter Morel married and went to Bestwood, a mining village in Nottinghamshire. She was a well educated and refined person; he was a warm, vigorous, uneducated man. They had four children- Annie, the daughter, and three sons- William, Paul, and Arthur. As Gertrude Morel's sons grew up, she no longer felt love for her husband, and instead turned all her love and passion towards her sons. The sons grew up hating their father and completely dependent upon their mother, who became the strongest factor in their lives; as a result, when they became men, they were unable to find a satisfactory relationship with any woman. William, the eldest, chose a flignty girl who gave him physical satisfaction, but nothing more, for his soul was his mother's. The struggle of this impasse killed him. Paul the second eldest, chose Miriam, who fought his mother for his soul; torn between the two women he ultimately returned to his mother. Later, he turned for a physical relationship to Clara, an older married woman, but again he found that the ties with his mother were too strong for a succesful relationship. Paul told his mother that as long as she lived he could not live a full life or love any woman. She became ill, and Paul dedicated his life completely to her. When his mother died, he was left alone with a wish only for death."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Hola, Mi Nombre es Juan. &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; es muy Bueno.

The ending left me unsatisfied. I don't know whether the reader is supposed to sympathize with Paul Morel, but I didn't. I found him to be - what did I find him to be? - he is arrogant and - what were his qualities? - I don't know, just arrogant. In fact, I did not find any characters that I liked. Although you don't have to like the characters to like the book, I didn't even like the plot. It was bland. You're probably wondering why I gave it three stars. There were some parts of the book that were excellent at showing human nature and how people relate to each other. For instance, Paul was attracted to Clara because at first she was indifferent to him. It just shows you that The Rules were at work even nearly a century ago!

Being mass-market paperbacks, they are easy to carry around. The only problem I would have with this is that there is not a lot of room in the margins for making notes about the text. There is some room, but you would need to write small. I would recommend this edition above others if you just wanted to read the story with really studying it.D.H. Lawrence wrote this in a time which also saw Sigmund Freud start with his writings of Oedipal conflict and motivation. A reader from today will start thinking about how much fun Freud would have with this within the first few chapters.I would have to say that I have not read a lot of D.H. Lawrence, but this book has convinced me to read more. The actions Paul, the main character, takes tell you what is happening, but if you look at the imagery of nature around them, you will have another idea of what is going on. Lawrence is a great writer. Look at the flowers when Paul and Clara have finished walking the slippery path by the river. Look closely at the flowers that are given to Clara when they stop for tea.I would recommend this book to anyone.

It's definitely a story worth reading, and one you're sure to like."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I hated this book. It's not the writing that's in question. Although what Lawrence describes is formidably bleak, nevertheless he describes it well - even the minor warmths that sustain the people. And it's not that he is not perceptive either - there were moments when he could have been writing my story, used exactly the same words I did to describe the same feelings.It was the characters I didn't like at all, especially Paul Morel (moral?). In the first half of the novel we learn a lot about his mother - in fact for a long time I thought the novel was about her. In the second half of the novel the story moves to her third child Paul (the second, Annie, is minor; the last, Arthur, almost trivial) and his 'loves' for Miriam and Clara. Miriam is pure and initially Paul leaves her that way, only activating the relationship later when Clara tells him he had never really tried with her. But once the relationship is sexual Paul retreats. Clara, the alternative woman, is separated from her husband and Paul experiences real passion in winning her over, but she too is unsatisfying to him. Is it his mother's love for him, and his love for her that is to blame? But who are these two women who we have little knowledge of to give us a foundation of understanding of their behaviour as we do of Paul and his mother?What really distressed me was the selfishness of Paul - one of his last acts in the novel - with his sister Annie - is truly appalling (it's not sexual). So what is Lawrence's reason for drafting the novel as he did. Many people experience disturbances to their sexual awakenings, but I would like to think that outcomes do not necessarily have to be as bleak as Lawrence portrays. This is a novel - it doesn't have to faithfully represent people's awful experiences. By doing so for his characters I can't help feel that Lawrence is fatalistic - if things go wrong for you, bad luck, you'll end up a derelict and there is no help for it. I cannot accept this.The most moving parts of the novel both involve Paul's mother - related to the death of her eldest child William and her own death.Other recommendations:Wedekind: Springtime AwakeningTurgenev: Spring Torrents"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I just loved this book, what a work of art.

I didn't really like it to much but I recognized the man had talent. He has some of the most elegant prose I have ever read. I heard this is a superior novel and much more profound so I decided to give it a whirl.Basically I couldn't stand it. I admit his writing is great, but I just can't get into this. Maybe it's the subject matter which is kind of strange, or maybe it's just personal taste, I don't know for sure. I am a great fan of literature of all kinds, but the period of writing from 1910-1925 I don't seem to enjoy. Sure Joyce wrote some ingenious things, Hemmingway was a great romantic writer but the stuff just doesn't click with me. Oh well, I gave the book 2 stars because I enjoyed the prose, but that is all I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This has been the most artless novel I've tried to read this year. It was excruciatingly long and I could barely get to page 200. I could not finish it. I actually ran out and bought the Great Gatsby just to remind myself what a great novel is supposed to be.It was like Lawrence just decided to slap everything together about these dull people, all without consideration for the reader's patience. I don't think in the history of literature have I ever seen so much description of people looking at each other and walking around. And the dialogue was exceedingly hollow. The father could have been extremely interesting but almost all the time, I had no idea what he was saying with Lawrence's annoying use of colloquial country English. Of course, Lawrence is quite literate; he knows a lot about scenery and nature but that's not what makes a book great. It is plotting, lyricism, and resonance that makes a book fun to read, and not to mention selection and editing and the craftmanship of scenes and situations. Worse yet, his prose style is sickeningly robotic. It made me want to puke. So far this year, all the supposedly great Brit writers have been thoroughly disappointing."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"knowing the reputation of this novel, i was curious to find out what the fuss was about. but i found that the best thing about the novel is the description of his family, especially in the first part. his writing is simple and direct, and part one paints a very vivid picture of working-class life in england circa 1900. the other thing that surprised me about the book is the euthanasia at the end. i wasn't prepared for this and quite honestly was shocked to read about paul and his sister annie 'gliggling' and they prepare the morphium od for their mum. paul's love for his mother is also disturbing. his last kiss of the beloved cadaver is completely morbid. frankly, i'm surprised this aspect of the novel didn't cause more controversy. in comparison, the sexual material is pretty tame, granted i am 100 years removed from the book's first appearance.the structure of the book is based naturally on the biography, but still, the story is a little shapeless. there are characters and incidents introduced that are never taken up and resolved. paul's brother arthur, for example, makes short appearances from time to time, but he doesn't figure in the story at all. you can argue this is like real life, and maybe this is what lawrence was trying to achieve, but by the standards of a traditional novel, it is sloppy.i also never really got into the book. usually, i race to the end to find out what happened, but with 'sons and lovers', i coasted. at first, i thought this was because of the book's shapelessness, but there's no reason a biographical work of fiction can't be well structured. i realized the reason is that paul morel is just not your typical 'hero' of a biographical book. in fact, he's no hero at all. he has too many worts and he doesn't try to cover them up - i think this unlikeableness or aloofness of the main character makes the book itself unlikeable and hard to get into.nevertheless, lawrence does write nicely and the novel has some very interesting moments. worth a read.3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Gertrude Morel thought at first that she was getting into a good marriage. Walter Morel seemed happy and successful and was not a drinker. She thought he would make a good husband and a good father to their children. It was only after they were married for awhile that she found that he spent much of his time drunk and didn't own any of the property he'd told her he owned. A seed of resentment was planted.Once their children, especially two sons, William and Paul, were born, Gertrude stopped caring much about her husband at all and concentrated on her offspring.Paul ends up with his mother's undiluted attention and affection. His decisions are largely based on keeping her happy, and when his thoughts wander to other females, such as those he dates, his mother grows petulant and her pouting convinces her son to come back to her. Although Paul has a good job and a bright future as an artist, he finds himself unwilling to commit to the girls he dates, because nobody can quite match up to his mother in his mind.This is a sad story of a mother ruining her son's life without meaning to. She really only wants to love him, but her love is so overbearing that she doesn't leave room for anyone else in his mind.The characters in this story didn't grab me. They were all incredibly weak, from Walter with his drinking problem drifting farther and farther away from his family; to Paul, unable to break away from his mother; to Gertrude, unable to make a life for herself and clinging to her son instead; to Miriam, allowing herself to be hurt over and over instead of walking away from Paul once and for all. They all needed to have some sense shaken into them."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I wish I'd lived around the turn of the century. Then I could have gotten any piece of tripe published, judging by this novel. Were standards just lower then? 'Sons and Lovers' is the long winded cause of an uninspired idea. DH Lawrence took the members of his family, attached an 'emotion' to them, then narrated his life (slowly) repeating this emotion (the 'I may be poor but you can't take away my dignity' mother, the 'I'm going to drink to hurt you' father, the sensitive son, whatever). The book's tension is portentous and its prose is artless save an occasional lapse into the countryside (how many ways can you describe green hills and wysteria? someone should have told Lawrence, not many).My theory is that 'Sons and Lovers' falls under the Gatsby effect - since it's taught so much in high school it is often one of the first novels people read. And the first novel you read to learn the way novels work will always feel the quintessential, even when the sad truth is there are probably more skilled manuscripts passing by publishers' desks everyday. Someone just hit that banal note first."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"D.H. Lawerence kinda scares you with this book. It's beginning chapters, while it introduces you to characters, are boring. Let's face it: Classic British Literature is boring, and Lawerence only adds to it worse. His character, Paul Morel, obviously loves his mother a BIT TOO much. I'm not saying you have to consider this bad, I'm just saying that it made the book pointless. A man, living his life with constant remorse because no other woman can satisfy due to his mother?? How sad and how pathetic. The guy lost his virginity to a girl, then LEAVES her. The book is no where near what I call entertaining or exciting or even worth reading. However, it does have one quality: If you need to go to sleep, pick up this book."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Well, I'm one of Amazon's cheaper customers: They'll never get rich off of me which is why I've been spending the last couple years reading Lawrence, Fitzgerald and Horatio Alger for free on my Kindle.I'm almost done with Sons and Lovers and have been enjoying every second of it. Unlike Fitzgerald, DH Lawrence writes about poor people masterfully: Every detail, from the texture and smell of the flowers to the wide spectrum of human emotions are masterfully spelled out. The characters are not obsessed with money, they are more concerned with getting on with life and immersing themselves in their social encounters. And they don't, for the most part, drink themselves into oblivion, although alcohol definitely can open the door to some interesting drama.I particularly enjoy how the characters will love each other in one moment and despise each other in the next, which is really the way it works in the real world. Lawrence, unlike many writers these days, gives the reader plenty of foreplay in his romantic encounters but, perhaps because of the mores of the day, barely lingers on the details of the actual sex act. He leaves much up to the imagination and if you happen to blink, you might miss out on something juicy, which is a refreshing change of pace from the soft porn that is littering the marketplace.I don't read romance novels so I'm not qualified to say whether this would fall into the category of romance, however. The writing reads so effortlessly and the details are sketched like a masterpiece in an art museum. I really don't know what to call this book except great and I can't wait to sink my teeth into more of Lawrence's writing."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This book follows the life of the Morel family, and takes a close look at the close mother-son relationship.

Lawrence, and what a powerful book to open with! Sons and Lovers tells the story of Paul Morley, the second son of a well-educated mother and crass collier of a father. Paul lives a fairly regular, if a little sickly, childhood and goes to work at the early age of 14. As he grows older, he finds the intense love he feels for his mother drawn away from her, first by the timid and Romantic (with a capital R) Miriam, and later by a suffragette named Clara Dawes. Throughout the entire novel, Paul and his mother share an intense, sometimes to the point of discomfort, relationship that plays heavily into the very dramatic conclusion of the novel. Beautifully crafted and wonderfully descriptive, Sons and Lovers is a wonderful novel and is sure to appeal to a broad audience."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This is one of Lawrence's more famous works and it is about a young man who grows up in a poor English family, just as Lawrence did himself.One can start by quoting another writer: \\"Sons and Lovers was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel.\\"The novel is semi-autobiographical and it is the story of how one son struggles to break free of his mother\`s emotional grasps. The mother is in an unhappy marriage to a coal miner in western England around 1900. She has three sons but she has the strongest attachment to her middle son, and she tries to transfer her hopes and expectations to him.Without giving away the plot, it is the story of the middle son trying to find his way in life. The story seems very realistic and believable and has many twists and turns as the middle son, Paul, moves away from home. In the novel he attempts to reconcile his various relationships with different women, one from his youth, and another with an attractive married woman.When the book came out, it was considered to be on the edge of the censors boundaries, especially in America. Bellow and other writers in the 20th century considered the work of Lawrence to be somewhat groundbreaking in the develoment of realism and in the descriptions of passionate love scenes and human desires.It is an excellent novel and well worth the read.As side note, I read this at about the same time that I read James's \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" and I thought they were both outstanding reads."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"The words beautiful, slightly twisted and tragic embody Paul's inability to love other women as he loves his mother in Sons and Lovers.

This book is also a study in the shifting narrative technique; he is a pioneer and the bridge between the conventional pre-20th century omniscient narrative and authors such as Joyce and Woolf, where the very storyline consists of jumps between the personal emotions and opinions of the various characters of a novel. DH Lawrence is proof that quality literature with a distinct sexual edge CAN be produced. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Few novels by any author have ever been examined under the microscope of autobiography more thoroughly than SONS AND LOVERS. Nearly every character represents someone from the life of its author D. H. Lawrence, who clearly has used himself as a model for the protagonist, Paul Morel. To complicate matters there is a well-documented undercurrent of the Oedipal Complex between Paul and his mother Gertrude (also the name of Hamlet's mother who was linked to Hamlet in the same potentially incestuous way). Lawrence was later to deny ever having read Freud but his much older wife Frieda (a dead ringer for Gertrude) has written in her memoirs that she had several discussions with Lawrence about just that theory.Gertrude, a pretty woman of twenty-three marries a handsome, virile, but loutish man named Walter. Their marriage is unhappy since he drinks, is abusive, and has nothing in common with his wife. They have four children of whom Paul is the focus of dramatic interest. He is artistic, sensitive, and hates how his father treats Gertrude. She in turn lavishes on him all the love that might otherwise have gone to Walter. As Paul matures, he meets two women of consequence: the virginal and puritanical Miriam and the earthy and sexually aggressive Clara. Gertrude approves of Clara but disapproves of Miriam. From an Oedipal perspective, Miriam is a threat to Gertrude's primacy over Paul while Miriam as a floozy is not. Paul has an extended affair with Clara that she breaks off when her husband re-enters the picture and beats the crap out of Paul. Paul has a single sexual contact with Miriam, knowing that she would find it most distasteful, so he breaks off this relationship. Gertrude dies of cancer with a push from Paul. Walter becomes a cripple and drifts out of Paul's life. Paul devotes his life to his art as the book ends. All of these characters relate to Paul in ways that are at best weird and at worst ugly to contemplate. As Gertrude smothers Paul with a misplaced affection, she makes sure, perhaps unknowingly--we are not sure, that he will have difficulty relating his own burgeoning sexuality with any other woman. Miriam, in her sexlessness, is a Gertrude surrogate that Paul can feel comfortable with so long as they do not achieve intimacy. Clara is the chippie that Paul can show physical affection toward only so long as he does not show emotional intimacy. It is no surprise that both relationships turn out badly. Walter, who starts out as the Bad Guy, slowly accrues the sympathy of the reader as he has a positive side that even the confused Paul can see.SONS AND LOVERS may be full of a constant undercurrent of sexual energies running at cross purposes, but it is not necessary to see the book only or even mostly in terms of seeing a twisted Oedipus to enjoy reading it. There are other non-sexual themes at work that engage the reader. Lawrence was upset over the slow disintegration of English society caused by an encroaching industrialism that he saw as crushing the human spirit. Whether one chooses to see SONS AND LOVERS under a sociological or a sexual lens is a matter of personal taste. Lawrence, who was an advocate of freedom of choice, would certainly agree."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Not even close to Lady Chatterley's Lover. I was expecting more from this novel. Paul Morel loves his mother. He is the ultimate oedipal mama's boy. So much so that he can't marry his true love Miriam. So instead he hates her for creating a conflict that takes him away from mom. Then he has a purely sexual relationship with Clara... At the end of the novel, Paul's coming of age comes to its climax. What will he do as a man??? (move forward or die-- I won't give it away) He makes up his mind in one sentence, and it's a little too Hollywood-ish to believe. But then this is not 1913.This novel is supremely dated. Read it if you want to check off classics, but don't expect transcendant brilliant ideas to come across from the early 20th C. If you haven't read Lady C, do so first."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons and Lovers is D.H. Lawrence's highly autobiographical novel of the early years of a young man's life in mid-nineteenth century England. As such, the book is very intense emotionally, as Lawrence seems to convey his own strong feelings about his family into his characters. One result of this exaggerated level of emotions is a constant state of tension and unreality. A simple scene becomes a moment of high drama and the constant repetition of such scenes eventually dulls the reader to those moments of genuine crisis.The book begins with the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Morel. Gertrude is an educated, sensitive woman who marries Walter because of his physical appearance and charming personality. She also believes, falsely as it turns out, that he does not drink and is the owner of this own house. Mr. Morel is a miner and the family lives in \\"The Bottoms,\\" a hardscrabble mining community. It soon becomes clear that he cannot cope with the responsibility of raising a family that grows to four children. In response he turns to drink and abusive language (although no real violence) toward his family, and especially toward his wife. Throughout the book Walter is portrayed, not as an evil man, but as one defeated by life. His family comes to despise him and at the same time love him, depending on his moods and behavior.William, the first child, is athletic and intelligent. He grows to manhood early in the book and leaves to go to London to seek his fortune, but comes to a tragic end. The second child, Annie, has only a modest role in the novel as benefits a book with this title. Paul, the third child, is the main character and Lawrence's alter ego. Unlike his siblings, Paul is sickly and unathletic, and he and Mrs. Morel develop a strong attachment for each other that carries throughout the book. The final child, Arthur, also plays a minor role in the plot.The book is divided into two parts; the first largely concerned with the early years of the Morel family and the second with Paul and his love affairs. As a teenager he meets Miriam, a young girl on a nearby farm. Paul develops a fondness for the whole family and he and Miriam become entangled romantically and the understanding is that they will marry some day. But neither Paul nor Miriam can make a sufficient commitment to this idea and even when Miriam finally does so Paul is incapable of a similar response. At this point an older woman, Clara Dawes, comes into Paul's life. She is married to Baxter Dawes, a brutish man from whom she is separated. Paul is attracted to her physically and they begin an adulterous relationship. But again Paul has difficulty sustaining a mature relationship and is constantly torn between his love for (and even dependence on) his mother and his wish for a mature and stable relationship with a woman.The novel is also infused with a heavy dose of religion. Miriam in particular, is described as highly religious and even derogatively referred to as a nun. The religion view that sex is something dirty is also evident.It would help, given the nature of the book, to read a biography of Lawrence before tackling this novel. Many of the characters in the novel act in dysfunctional ways and the reader wonders how much of their behavior is a reflection of Lawrence's own life experiences.It is difficult for me to rate this book much above three stars because of the depressing tone and unrealistic behaviors of the characters. One wants to say to Lawrence, \\"get some psychological help before writing about your life!\\" On the other hand it is a fascinating story written by one of the outstanding English writers of the nineteenth century. It is not his best work, but still quite good in many respects."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I attempted to read this book twice years ago. I failed to finish each time, finding the novel laborious. Now, married and with children, I have read through this book eagerly. It is perhaps a half-lifetime of experience that has allowed me to see this story in a different light. The examination of Paul Morel's emotionally incestuous relationship with his mother and the way it cripples his love for other women is insightful. My Barnes and Nobles version of this book (I put this review under this version since it is the most popular) has a contemporaneous review (Lascelles Abercrombie, Manchester Guardian, July 2, 1913) that assesses this book much better than I can:\\"Indeed, you do not realize how astonishingly interesting the whole book is until you find yourself protesting that this thing or that bores you, and eagerly reading on in spite of your protestations...You think you are reading through an unimportant scene; and then find that it has burnt itself on your mind.\\"This book has truly burnt itself on my mind, and I am glad that I came back to it."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"While \\"Sons and Lovers\\" would not be a best seller if it was written by a current day author, it was, for its times, quite controversial and forward-leaning and should always be considered one of fiction's classics. On its published date, 1914, the world was enamored with Freud's Oedipal fixation and found itself newly-awoken to the sexual side of humanity. Before this era, sexuality was either repressed or made a separate entity away from emotional caring. D.H. Lawrence relit the 'Oedipal candle' and the mother/son controversy went on. While neither Freud nor Lawrence ever fully understood their own sexuality, let alone that of others, this piece of autobiographical fiction allowed society to continue in its personal understanding of its physical self.While I fully agree with other critics that the main thrust of this novel is the interaction of mother and son, I also feel there is much more that can be psychosocially understood from its reading. The mother, in today's terminology was a narcissist. All of her actions throughout this tale are directed back towards herself and her own happiness. She married a very handsome and well-built man because she mistakenly thought that he owned the house in which he was living and that he could provide for her in the manner in which she felt she deserved. When this proved false and her plans became futile, she turned her selfish need for personal fulfillment towards her sons. She felt that it was their duty, and not their choice, to make her happy. Throughout the novel Paul, the younger of the two, is left with this onerous and suffacating burden. In very short order he, too, changes his need structure to rely on her for his recognition and fulfillment. But, his mother being a narcissist, she can never provide this in a mature and caring manner. Instead, she does so in a self-devised and incomplete manner making Paul to always wanting more and more and never feeling complete. He, in turn, was never able to fulfill her insatiable needs of attention and personal fulfillment. Neither person took any responsibility for their own actions or their own psyche and, because of that, eventually developed a love/hate relationship with each other. This is dramatically shown in the fact that Paul, while continuing to profess his love and caring for her, actually murders his mother while she lie on her death bed.In social situations the damage that Paul suffered at the hands of his mother, were generalized into the rest of his life. His work was never fulfilling, his love/hate relationship with his mother translated into an approach/avoidance behavior with women and his ultimate goals in life continued to focus on what would make his mother happy with little or no concern for himself. Because his mother had never equated her sexual life with any type of caring or emotion, Paul, too, made a divide between sex and love and often mistakenly confused one with the other. He never allowed himself to feel both together or, for that matter, had the capability to do so. The women in Paul's life had their own irrational agendas. One sacrificed her life while waiting for Paul to eventually admit his love for her and the other lived her life based solely on her own selfish and ego driven emotions while leaving rational thought unheeded. The author, if this truly is his autobiographical sketch, certainly lived and most probably died a very lonely and disturbed life. He never made the effort nor probably never had the emotional strength to understand himself as an independent being apart from the maternal demands that were continually laid at his feet.While the subject of this book does merit 5 stars, I only gave it 4 stars because of the rambling and diffuse writing that occurs in the first half of the book. Yes, I understand that the author himself viewed life as a rambling and purposeless process but we, as readers. do not need to re-experience his self-confusion in order to fully understand it. We, too, have our own life experiences from which we can draw and do not need our hands held while we come to understand the author's internal insecurities. Nor do we need to have the various derivatives of the work 'hate' be used in nearly every paragraph in order to understand the love/hate relationship that the author had with everything around him. We, too, have a degree of intelligence that can comprehend intense negative feelings directed towards the world."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"In what is considered to be D. H. Lawrence's most autobiographical novel, Lawrence's main character, Paul Morel, is a frail, artistic boy, having more in common with his mother than with his coal miner father. His mother had had some education before she married the once-attractive Walter Morel, but he eventually succumbed to alcohol and his bleak life in the pits. When Paul's older brother, who became the mainstay of the family, left for London and later died, his mother transferred her dependence from him to Paul.Written in 1913, the novel was shocking at the time, dealing as it does with an unhealthy relationship between mother and son, leading to the son's subsequent inability to love women his own age. Having only scorn for her wayward and irresponsible husband, his mother needs Paul for emotional support. When Paul begins to develop a love for Miriam Lievers, a neighbor with whom he has been close friends since childhood, his mother becomes even more possessive. A \\"spiritual\\" girl, Paul comes to believe that even though Miriam has \\"given\\" herself to him, she does not love from an inner need, that at heart she is \\"a nun,\\" and that her passion is more dutiful than real. Since he himself is still tied to his mother, emotionally, his own ability to love fully is also compromised.His next relationship, with Clara Dawes, a married woman separated from her husband, is far more passionate, but Clara is also far more liberated than Miriam, and she demands an emotional commitment from him in return. It is not until his mother's death, however, that Paul realizes the extent to which his mother has truly controlled his heart and soul, leaving him far more bereft than is normal for loving sons.A novel which probes the inner psyche of Paul Morel, Sons and Lovers is a novel which speaks directly to the modern reader, eliciting both sympathy and empathy as Paul tries to become his own man. Lawrence's ability to tap into universal feelings and needs elevates this novel into a sensitive study of love in all its forms, not just in the case of Paul Morel, but on a deeper, grander scale. Though the novel is almost a hundred years old, it is as fresh and rewarding to read today as a contemporary novel, even when one considers the mores and prohibitions of that time period. Lawrence, ahead of his time, has created one of the enduring classics of English literature, one which supersedes time and place. n Mary WhippleWomen in Love: Cambridge Lawrence EditionLady Chatterley's Lover (Bantam Classics)The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd (Broadway Theatre Archive)"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"i approached this book reluctantly as i felt that it was far to detached from my current surroundings to have a note of relevance. I was pleasantly shocked and rewarded for my efforts at broadening my range of classics, this novel is an amazing tale of love and the complexities of family in relation to it. If you haven't read it do so!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This novel created considerable controversy, along with Freudian accusations of an Oedipal relationship between Paul the son and his mother Gertrude.D. H. Lawrence depicted the physical attraction between Paul and Clara in a very frank direct manner that was quite radical for the time. The tormenting uncertainty betweenPaul and Miriam, along with his strong attraction to Clara as compared to the mutual emotional dependency between him and his mother were understandably overwhelming to the public.It was very instructive to see how the absence of love in the mother's life led her to have an emotional dependency on one of her kids, only to switch to another son when she loses the first one. Portraying human narcissism through motherly love is a very shocking way of examining human nature. It was very interesting, as well, to see how the son was always torn between loving a woman and loving his mom, which are very different and incompatible emotions.Lawrence's honesty is very admirable considering the period in which the novel was written, and the unique way he described the son's decision while the mom is in pain on her death bed might raise some deep insight regarding this Author's vision. I, though, reject the possibility of a deep emotional thinker, and go with a merely honest portrayal of a pleasure worshipping male, who did not understand typical male desires as compared to typical human feelings.Lawrence had many admirers, including some smart/confused feminists, who thought of him as a great writer who portrayed quite accurately women's feelings. I, on the other hand, agree with the good writer part but sense in him shallowness and pure blind desire with a great dearth of complex analysis."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This is really a book of psychological analysis. It's not exactly an autobiography but Lawrence makes a good deal self-eveluation of his childhood.When you read the novel you feel in an instant that someone who can describe human conditions that successfully,must have lived it all himself.Paul's excessive attachment to his mother and how his life became unbearable after her death shows the human helplessness.He tries over and over to LOVE someone other than his mother but each time he finds some missing part which is fullfilled by his mother. He really loves Miriam but somehow love also falls short to live happily-ever-after. When I first started the book I felt that the main character was Mrs.Morel. I was mistaken. Lawrence used all of the characters with nearly equal emphasis.Of course the leading one is Paul. On the other hand you take lots of things from other characters by his clear depiction. Paul,thus Lawrence, is a good psychologist.If you like to find your own thougts and feelings told by an author you should read Sons And Lovers.I finished it in a week."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I suggested Sons and Lovers for our book club because it was on three respected \\"Top 100\\" book lists. We often read classics, so the club eagerly voted to include Sons and Lovers on our reading list.We all finished the book; but much to our surprise, we were unanimously disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, one person gave it a negative four. Ouch!The first 150 pages of the book are about Paul Morrell's youth and family life in a small coalmining town. This section is lively, interesting, vivid, and enjoyable. The second section of the book (the remaining 400 pages) is a study of Paul's obsession, frustration, and indecision about the women in his life. Reading it is like watching someone at a restaurant become very angry and emotional because he cannot make up his mind what to order; it is both boring and frustrating. Paul's constant vacillation between loving Miriam and then hating her (often both in the same sentence) eventually becomes laughable to the point of inviting parody.My book club agreed the book had potential, but the second section really lacked momentum. Paul's obsessions and indecision simply became boring.To his credit, Lawrence's prose is smooth, direct, and immediate. He is very much of the Modern tradition. The first section of the book was superb. I am certain I would have enjoyed the book much more if the second section were perhaps 100 pages shorter. I liked parts of Sons and Lovers enough that I'll try Lawrence again someday. But I can't really say I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"\\"Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not.\\" James Joyce\\"Mama's gonna check out all your girl friends for you... Mama won't let anyone dirty get through... Mama's gonna wait up till you get in... Mama will always find out where you've been... Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean...\\" Lyrics from the song \\"Mother\\" by Roger Waters of \\"Pink Floyd\\"This rather abstract, deeply affecting autobiographical novel by D.H. Lawrence is sure to unearth a myriad of emotions and conceptions for most readers as it did for me. In fact, one could easily scribe a terse, ten page thesis on this one. Talk about a complex story filled with a group of complicated, and yet captivating characters, especially the two main characters - Paul Morel (based on D.H. Lawrence himself) and his possessive, yet extremely endearing mother Mrs. Gertrude Morel. Yes, as you have probably read in the other reviews, Freud would have loved this one, for it's a prime example of his Oedipus complex theory. However, to focus solely on that aspect of this story would be doing this masterpiece a grave injustice, for it is so much more than that. The abnormal and imperfect relationships of Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers\\" are among the most widely discussed and analyzed in English Literature. This is one of those novels that will keep you completely absorbed from the first chapter on to the very last page.The story takes place right around the turn-of-the-century in the small, rather poor, mining village of Bestwood, England (Bestwood actually based on Eastwood where Lawrence was born). All of the main characters (with the exception of Clara Dawes, who was a composite) are based on real people in Lawrence's early life. Essentially, Paul Morel's early life story is the story of D.H. Lawrence. Paul is one of four children of Mr. and Mrs. Morel, two people who are complete opposites of one another, with the former being an uneducated, uncouth, and extremely unsophisticated mineworker. Estranged from her husband early on in their marriage, Mrs. Morel decides to take comfort in her four children, particularly (after a family catastrophe that I will refrain from disclosing) her middle son Paul: \\"Wherever he went she felt her soul went with him. Whatever he did she felt her soul stood by him...\\" And to young Paul, completely alienated from his ogre father, his mother is his whole existence, by far and away \\"the strongest tie in his life\\". However, trouble soon awaits the pair as Paul begins his slow ascent into manhood.As Paul enters into his teens, and those hormones start kicking in, he soon falls deeply in love with the austere, esoteric, loner Miriam who lives on a farm not too far from Paul's home. For many years the two of them carry on an extremely intimate, but yet purely platonic relationship. An intimacy that leaves Paul confused and totally unfulfilled. His feelings for this all-consuming girl seesaw back and forth from love to hate. And of course, his mother far from approves, \\"she's not like an ordinary woman... she wants to absorb him... til there is nothing left of him, even for himself... she will suck him up\\" (the very definition of transference!) Of course, his mother's adverse opinion of Miriam proves to be one of the main reasons he chooses not to marry the girl.Paul's second love affair is with Mrs. Clara Dawes, a suffragette, who is currently separated from her troubled husband. She is introduced to Paul through Miriam, and at first the two become close friends (it is her sage advice which soon helps him end his frustrating, platonic relationship with Miriam). However, despite her being married and Paul's heart belonging to someone else, the two of them begin a passionate love affair. Of course this affair also leaves his mother very despondent and discouraged to say the least. And in the end, of course... well... I'll refrain from disclosing anything more.I know this is a rather long review, however I still think I could write for days about this one and even then not quite do it justice. D.H. writes with such detailed, flowery, and poignant prose. This novel is a unique, in-depth look inside of the artist himself. He very bravely sketches for us his true character, warts and all, and about all the events that made him what he was.Lastly, I've read several reviews bashing Mrs. Morel, but all in all, with what she had to work with, she seemed to do a relatively good job in raising her children. The majority of 'mama boys' I have known in my life usually are self-centered, egotistical, under-achieving, pompous jackasses. They are the type of guys who think that it's their planet, and the rest of us here are just visiting. Thankfully so, D.H. Lawrence did not turn out that way! Ergo, his mother had to do something right.In closing, all I have to say is - WHAT A MASTERPIECE!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This Kindle version is not the unexpurgated test first published by Cambridge University Press in 1992, It is the version extensively edited by Edward Garnett and first published in 1913, and omits approximately 100 pages of Lawrence's original manuscript. Garnett also made several editorial changes to make the text less controversial for the times. This was the only version available to readers for almost 80 years after it was written.&#34;Sons and Lovers&#34; is a semi-autobiographical novel in which the story's main protagonist, Paul Morel, struggles to maintain relationships with two female characters (Miriam and Clara) despite an almost Oedipian relationship with his mother, whose own disastrous marriage drives her to focus an abnormal amount of affection on her sons. Paradoxically he ends up killing his mother (out of kindness) rather than his father. Paul is a frustratingly complex individual and, for me, less than authentic. If this were not so evidently autobiographical I would be more skeptical. Lawrence himself, while the son of an essentially illiterate coal miner and a school teacher, attended Nottingham Grammar School and the University of Nottingham before becoming a teacher himself. His alter ego in the novel, Paul Morel, leaves school at the age of thirteen and becomes employed one year later, taking night school lessons and studying art. Despite his father and presumably his boyhood friends speaking in a thick East Midlands accent (although his mother does not) he seems to develop an almost unbelievably artiiculate manner of speech. Where does something like &#8220;Oh. You make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate&#8221; come from? It doesn&#8217;t ring true to me, although Lawrence himself was obviously very intelligent. Paul Morel lacks his education however.The seeming oversuse of the word &#34;hate&#34; throughout the text also puzzles me. As an example: &#34;And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering then he hated her - and he easily hated her.&#34; And this is the girl he is supposedly falling in love with. Perhaps &#34;hate&#34; implied something different almost 100 years ago. Is this an example of semantic drift? I found it disturbing.Despite these minor irritations I did enjoy reading &#34;Sons and Lovers&#34; and immediately went on to read the unexpurgated version of &#34;Lady Chatterley's Lover&#34; which Lawrence wrote towards the end of his relatively short life while living in Italy. I found that to be a much more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Reading this book makes me want to have sex with my mother. The son is in love with his lonely mother. He wants her but he can't have her due to morality issue. What a torture! Avoid it if the idea of mother-son incest turns you off. If incest turns you on, watch the porn movies, Taboo and its sequels, is more satisfying."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"The man is an absolute master at relationships. I have not read any other writer that has his patience and skill at building complex, realistic relationships through the accumulation of minute detail. While the characters and plot are only adequate, the relationships between the characters, and the poetic prose, drove the novel and managed to keep me engaged the whole way through. I was surprised that this novel, at least, showed no indication of the smuttiness of which Lawrence has often been accused. Overall, a good introduction to a literary author who will get another look later."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I read this book for my English class and I found it to be ultimately unsatifying. I think Lawrence's prose is incredible but I just could not empathize with Paul Morel - he''s so childish and weak. Paul is only charming during his love scenes with Clara when he affects the Welsh accent of Walter Morel. I thought Gertrude Morel was a despicable woman who treated her husband with undeserved contempt and emotionally suffocated her sons. In the book, Gertrude's death leaves Paul in a world of darkness, he's a broken man. However, it's interesting to note that as much as D.H.Lawrence (the book is semi-autobiographical) came to view his mother as a negative influence in his mature years. As an adult, it is D.H. Lawrence's father who is personified as Walter Morel, for whom he exhibited admiration."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I enjoy reading the works of D.H. Lawrence. I believe no other author of his time explored the complexities of human sexuality, behavior, intimacy, and depth as poignantly as him. By far I loved Lady Chatterley's Lover, his most famous and controversial novel. SONS AND LOVERS is the second Lawrence book I've read. I can't really say if I truly liked the book or not. I believe that what this book explores is deeply interesting and even haunting, seeing how controlling and possessive a mother could be on her sons, and how deeply attached sons could be towards their mother. It was also interesting seeing the complexities of the characters grow and develop with each chapter. I can definitely see why SONS AND LOVERS is considered a classic. The only flaw i found with this novel was how annoying Paul Morel is. I just found his behavior to be pathetic and ridiculous. But other than that, this is a great read, but not necessarily Lawrence's BEST work."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This book renewed my belief in the power of love. D.H. Lawrence seems very romantic, yet tragic at the same time. This was very pleasurable reading. &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; and &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy are my two biggest recommendations for anyone who enjoys classic fiction. I purchased the &quot;Modern Library 100 Best Novels&quot; version of this book, which conveniently lists the rest of Modern Library's 100 Best Novels on the front cover."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This book is so obviously brilliant, soulful, real, intense and true. If you had to read it for some assignment in school and didn't like it, maybe you should keep your thoughts to yourself instead of disputing it. As Bob Dylan said, &quot;don't criticize what you can't understand&quot;. Sure, everybody has a right to their opinion. But being assigned a book means you have no choice, and therefore are maybe predisposed to not like it. Paul's agonies over Clara and Miriam could be happening to any guy, today. Lawrence cuts right to the bone of relationships, and anyone wanting to understand that immeasurable gulf between men and women would do well to read this book, not because I or anyone else tells you to, but because it's true and real."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"There are several subplots, but the main one the story ends up gravitating around is that when Mrs. Morel becomes pregnant with her son Paul, her marriage has pretty much dissolved thanks to her husband's alcoholic and abusive nature. She seems to have antenatal and postpartum depression; as a result, her infant becomes sensitized to her moods.He grows up and is too attached to her, and her to him. He cannot make heads or tails of his own emotions in relationships, partly because he over intellectualizes everything, and partly because he cannot see how his mother's hold on him is suffocating his ability to grow as an independent person. Worse, he emulates his father's disdainful attitude towards women, rendering him often a less-than-likeable character.His mom, in a matyristic fashion, begins to die of an ailment she never revealed to her main physician. He thus becomes mired in the process of helping and watching her die. He and his mother have a few moments that are more than just enmeshed (incestual in tone); his father seems to pick up on the inappropriateness of the relationship, but given his own alienation from the family can do very little in the way of anything, other than get out of the way.There are moments of poetry, but the constant exposition of internal struggles in philosophical and psychological terms tends to get a bit tiring, and thus diminishes the dramatic tension. It would be a good book for students just getting the hang of applying psychological theory to literature (the Oedipus complex particularly), but it is overdramatic in characterization, overlong, and rather depressing in its misogyny and hopelessness. Three stars from this reviewer."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This was the first book that I have read of D.H. Lawrence.

H. Lawrence's that I have ever read and now, after I've finished it, many things begin to make more sense than before.The book is divided in two parts: part one includes six chapters and part two includes nine chapters.In the first part we meet the Morels and the narration revolves around Gertrude Morel. She lives a harsh and unsatisfayingy life because of her husband Walter, who gets drunk and abuses her and their children.In the second part, the main character is Paul, the third child of the family and probably the one who would have had potential to become a remarkable protagonist, due to his capacity to work hard and due to his creativity.However, Lawrence shows us an extreme case of Oedipus complex. Since Paul was a baby, Mrs. Morel treated him in a special way that had led in time to a pretty tight bondage between them. The mother-son love pushes the normal limit of familial affection, becoming almost erotic. The interesting fact is that both of them are jealous of each other's relationships: Paul hates his father - almost wanting to murder him - and Mrs. Morel hates Miriam and Clara, inoculating the idea that her son hadn't found the right woman, whom he ought to marry.As well as Gertrude's marriage with Walter, Paul fails in both his relationships, after swinging for several times (annoyingly for the reader) between Miriam and Clara. In truth, he doesn't want to marry neither of them, because he secretly loves his mother more than the two.The narration is a bit slow because of the descriptions and the characters' thoughts towards the others.Paul Morel is not a protagonist that I might like, because he is very confused, his thoughts are often contradictory and he doesn't know what he really wants from life. His love for his mother has devastating consequences for both of them in the end.I think that Lawrence exaggerates when he pictures Paul as a spiritually and mentally mutilated man. If the protagonist had had a strong personality, he would have avoided the deplorable situation in which the reader finds him in the last pages of the novel."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"This is my favorite d h lawrence novel a little rambling at parts but I still love this book and have read it many times"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"--Oh! Pardon me for that rather undignified opening. Although (yawn) when I get to reflecting back on this book it seems somehow an appropriate response. It is a book about selfish and spoiled people, about elitists imagining their ideas as somehow relevent to the larger world around them and about how a little bit of education can lead to a great deal of contempt for the society in which someone is raised.Now, of course, these are valid and even potentially interesting points, but the method Lawrence chose to tell this, what I gather is a deeply personal story, is basically condescention and self-absorbsion. After about 100 pages I started dreading what was to come, which was basically more of the same alongside some predictable, tacked on melodramatic tragedy.The complication comes from Lawrence's genuine ability as a writer. There are lines--sometimes, albiet rarely, pages of pure beauty. These words came from a powerful and passionate writer who was too personally involved with the story he was telling to make it universial. I can appreciate the venting, the often conflicted outrage of the elitist scholar and budding psychoanalyist that Lawrence was later to become, but if this is a modelled story of the man's life it will ultimately take away some of the respect my reading of The Rainbow, Women in Love and a handful of his short stories had previously inspired. I can forgive the late, great author for this childish and selfish book, a mama's boy trying as hard as he can to show off how clever people have always told him he was, but I have trouble comprehending the innumerable critics and casual readers alike who boast and gloat over this story as if the triumph of personal arrogance related within somehow validated their own wavering sense of intellectual accomplishment.Two and a half stars rounded up because of some pretty writing and the apparent lasting relevence of this mostly frivilous work--"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"DH Lawrence was born in Nottingham, England in 1885. He died at age 44 in Vence, France in 1930. In between those birth and death dates he created great fiction. His first big book and, probably, still his greatest is \\"Sons and Lovers.\\"The novel is highly autobiographical. Walter Morel is a crude, hard drinking miner who has no intellectual interests. He weds the etheral and lovely Gertrude. The couple have four children: William, Annie, Paul and Arthur. William, the eldest, is a good boy engaged to a flighty woman. He dies at an early age. The other children, with the noted exception of Paul, live mundane lives.Paul is the Lawrence figure in the book. He is a momma's boy tied to her tight apron strings. Paul loves books, learning and the beauties of flowering nature. He has long affairs with the beautiful but shy Miriam who lives on a nearby farm and Clara Dawes (resembling Lawrence's wife Frieda Weekly). He marries neither woman leaving his boyhood home for adventures elsewhere. As the novel ends, Paul will continue his artistic work and his spiritual questing.There is little action in this novel. It is, instead, a pyschological probing of such human affairs as familial and erotic love, death, suffering and the process of saying goodbye to childhood. It is a deeply moving book. One cannot refrain from crying at the death of Paul's saintly mother.\\"Sons and Lovers\\" was written before Lawrence was scorned by critics and damaged by life. It is an excellent book which everyone should read if they are interested in life within a family. This book is rich with descriptions of nature and is a joy to read. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I know this review is going to sound markedly unintelligent, but I really can't help it in this case. I'm going to say what I need to say about this book, whether it makes a helpful review or not.Let me get one thing straight first: Sons and Lovers does not flow in the way Lawrence's other works flow. Each scene does not seem to bind itself to the next to make a perfect, seamless whole. The book does lag at times, in fact. It is beautifully written but not 'perfectly' written like Lawrence's other works. I am not rating this book on its composition, though. I'm rating it for something else.I'm wondering if anyone else felt the same way I felt when I read this novel. I have never before had to lay down a book in mid-paragraph and put my head in my hands for sheer emotional inability to read any further that day. I've read authors whose works hold up a mirror to an entire society, to a clique, to a cult, or a nation, but NEVER have I seen an author hold up a mirror to common individuals like myself. Quite honestly, I have never felt so horrible and so sickened with MYSELF simply because I read a book.What IS it about this story that makes me feel this way? I can only say that Lawrence must have been an expert at inner self-examination and observance of society. When I say society, I don't mean of 'the English,' or 'the Americans' or 'the-anything.' I mean of 'people.' There must be aspects of all human beings that will never change through time, age, gender, and economic status, because Lawrence captures each and every little thought, feeling, and nuance of human emotion and throws it as us in this book. The effect is a screaming recognition of yourself (at least, of myself.) 'Oh my God, that IS me!' I sympathize with Miriam, I sympathize with Paul, with Lily, with William, with Gertrude, and, God help me, with Walter Morel. I see myself in them.Lawrence may want us to feel negatively toward Miriam at times, but those are the times when I most identify with her. She may be a 'soul sucker,' but I know that I am, too. Mrs. Morel hates Miriam for this overbearing quality, but there's the clincher:I, too, hate the people who try to suck the souls of the people whose 'souls' I want.In less ridiculous language, Lawrence uses the relationship between Miriam and Paul to lay the inevitable facts about human jealousy and possessiveness in front of our eyes. We all have thoughts, desires, and jealousies so 'embarrassing' or so shameful that we won't even voice them in our mind's ear. These are the thoughts that will make us weak or despicable if we acknowledge or accept them. Lawrence makes these hidden thoughts and feelings a part of his writing style. When he describes his characters, you'd better BELIEVE he describes them. He leaves nothing out. They are weak, stupid, good, beautiful, and hopeless. I hate to seeing myself in his characters just as much as I hate being like them.Nearly all of Lawrence's works are like this, it is true, but this was the first of them that really slapped me in the face and made me see myself (and most likely everyone else) for what I really am.It's a good book. Very powerful, sad, embarrassing, and dangerous. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Because this book deals with the timeless feelings of love, obsession, and vulnerablity, it doesn't feel outdated, even though it's set in a time period much different from the current one. Especially interesting is Paul's relationship with Miriam, and how he becomes angry that she is trying to consume his soul--but at the same time, he says that he is looking for a woman who can belong to him. It seems like a double standard, but Paul is so obviously dysfuctional that as a reader, I could easily excuse it. DH Lawrence did a great job of making the content of the book flow well. When I got to the end, I could just feel that he was going to have to work Miriam back into the story somehow--and sure enough he did. And I think that as a reader, when I am able to anticipate what the writer has left to say, that is really a great statement about the ability of the writer to bring his readers to the same line of thought about the characters and the plot that he has. And something that I especially enjoyed about this book is that it is almost entirely dialogue, and it doesn't spend pages describing the scenery and such. So if that's something you like too, then you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Sons &amp; Lovers is by far one of the most insightful books I have read, following the story of a working-class family in early 19th century Nottinghamshire. It focuses on the second son of the aptly named Morel family, and his life and relationships within it. It is largely written from a psychological point of view, but it's lengthy description can drag on. An excellent book following the relationship between mother and son, the over-shadowing power of maternal influence, and although the chapters are hard work, the effect is strong and this book is definately a good read.It may be stuck in its time of writing, but a brilliant reflection of pre-World War One lower class life. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"D.H. Lawrence was a guy that came out of the womb knowing how to write. You read his prose and his innate genius quickly becomes self-evident--this is an artist for whom the creative act of literature is akin to a Mozart symphony--airtight, beautiful, logical, NATURAL. Floooooowing.Compare Lawrence with someone like Wallace Stegner--the latter being a writer with a fair amount of talent and a heckuva lot of dedication...but whose works seem...synthetic. Over-written, almost. As if he would look at a sentence and say, \\"This needs another adjective here--and a polysyllabic synonym for this word here.\\"With Lawrence, there is no sense of writerly straaaaaaining for profundity...no sense of sweaty self-consciousness. The sentences seemingly emanate from the ether, with a fundamental soundness and beauty which only a tiny, tiny few lucky people are capable of creating.Stegner could study the craft of writing for thirty years and still produce an inferior book to the twenty-seven-year-old Lawrence's Sons and Lovers. Lawrence had IT. He was the real deal. The genuine article. He WAS Mozart (Stegner was you-know-who).Sons and Lovers is a masterpiece. Not without its flaws, surely, but a masterpiece all the same. Some parts drag; some parts are choppy; some parts are frankly uninteresting. Notwithstanding that, it is just a single rung below Lolita and Under the Volcano in terms of quality.The MLA concluded that Sons and Lovers is the ninth best novel of the 20th century--and it's hard to quibble with that assessment. (Even though it is ranked AHEAD of the supernally brilliant--and better--Under the Volcano.)If you are a serious connoisseur of literature, this is one you have to get under the belt."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"SONS AND LOVERS was first published in 1913. It's the story of Paul Morel, a gifted artist. Paul is one of four children born to Walter and Gertrude Morel. The others are Edward, the oldest, Annie, and Arthur the baby.Walter Morel, a miner by trade was most attracted to Gertrude Coppard because she was a lady. Gertrude in turn thought that Walter was quite handsome and would be a good provider; however, over the years the couple become estranged from each other over Walter's drinking and brutish behavior. In their many arguments, Gertrude insisted on telling her husband off and usually won the verbal disputes, but was often physically abused. The four children all seemed to adore their mother and saw that her life was hard. They rallied around her as much as possible. They feared their father and keep their distance from him.The boys, Edward and Paul were the most protective of their mother. Edward, the elder son, was very bright and acquired an excellent position in London. He initially sent money home, but when he became involved with a woman, he spent every cent on her in trying to win her love. The woman was really undeserving of Edward's love and things went from bad to worse.Paul also tried to look out for his mother as much as possible. He found Miriam, a girl to love, but put off a proposal and marriage for years. He knew his mother did not care for the young woman and at first tried to overlook his mother's dislike of his girlfriend, but was not able to cope with the situation. His second relationship was with Clara, a married woman, but again, Paul could not completely give of himself.I really liked the way that Lawrence drew his literary portrait of what life was like for the family of a miner. It was interesting to observe the dynamics of the children and how they related to each parent. The home life was detailed as were their amusements and community life.Initially, I was not sure that I would like this book, but with each page that I read, I became more and more involved in the story. It was an excellent read and shows how manipulative a mother can be in controlling her children. The psychological hold that she had on her sons was something that they were not able to break. It also shows how influenced we can be by the interaction between our own parents."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"The main character in his many bouts with love, combatted by his intense lust for individualism and desire to be a world unto himself, could not overcome himself and therefore, with a conquistador's view of love, failed miserably at love's aquisition. He could not however create himself as an all emcompassing world, he search for satisfaction, and his realization that he could only love himself consequently chained him to himself.This book made me think more than most, but neglected to make me feel. Dostoevski is a poor writer, but suceeds in making one 'feel' rather intensely, like Hemmingway said. However, Lawrence, though a bit tedious and repetitive at times, makes you almost one with the character in their intellectual battle with themself, but not in their battle with emotions. I felt detached from Paul's emotions. I felt detached from his mother's, even though she was her emotions. Lawrence writes a great deal better than most of his contemporaries, and its a wretched pity that he still could not synthesize thought and emotion like only a few have done."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"Has any literary reputation (maybe Hemingway's) fallen like Lawrence's has? In my parents old set of encyclopedias, c. 1950, his entry was a paragraph long. In the 1970 Ency. Brtit. it was pages long. He was suddenly on par with Joyce... When I went through school I caught the very tail end of this mass admiration for Lawrence. It was a strange admiration too, mostly male critics gone overboard, calling such juvenile drivel as Lady Chatterly great literature and whatnot. I read practically all of Lawrences works, no mean feat, because the man wrote like a banshee. I also read the bios and the Letters... And I've come to the conclusion that Lawrence wrote one beautiful novel and that's it: Sons and Lovers. That Lawrence later disliked the novel is interesting because it evidently ran afoul of his ludicrous philosphy of life (and that so many intelligent British men at that time were taken with such nonsense is a bit disturbing and quite funny; I can't think of any woman infatuated with with his loopy ideas). This novel is written in beautiful prose and it evokes an England that no longer exists; nothing else that Lawrence attempted comes close to the beauty in this novel... Some of his earlier, short stories and novellas do, but they are few and far between.T.S. Eliot once said that Henry James had a mind so fine that no idea could violate it. Lawrence is an example of the absolute opposite: of a writer getting so carried away with his ideas that the art starts to suffer. He's like Tolstoy (but on a vastly smaller scale) in that he had to propagandize his ideas at every little turn... But Sons and Lovers is definitely worth the reputation that it has had all along."},{"Title":"Keynotes-Sons & Lvrs","review":"I have long been interested in the work of D. H. Lawrence. His reputation as one of the greatest novelists of the past one hundred years, as well as the censorship battles at the turn of the last century which led to some of his works being banned in England until the 1960's were all reasons which led me, finally, to read him. I started with Sons and Lovers, which was originally published in 1913.Sons and Lovers takes place in Nottingham near the coalfields. Paul Morel is one of three \\"sons\\" in the story and Miriam, Mrs. Clara Dawes as well as Paul's mother, Mrs. Gertrude Morel are all the \\"lovers\\". Mrs. Morel is married to a husband who pays her no attention, and who would rather go out all night drinking. She is thus devoted to her two oldest boys, William and Paul, and from an early age they are coddled to excess. They develop into mama's boys who cannot make any decision without thinking of the effect it would have on their mother. When William dies after a brief illness, Mrs. Morel becomes almost frightfully attached to Paul, and their exchanges seem incestuous with the terms of endearment they use. Paul's feelings towards his mother seem nothing less than Oedipean. The tender words exchanged between mother and son are far more passionate than the dialogue between either of Paul's lovers, Miriam or Clara. Since I had not read about the plot of Sons and Lovers before I started the novel, I did not know if mother and son would develop a sexual relationship. It certainly seemed plausible by their dialogue. Since Paul confesses to his mother, as well as to his two lovers, that he can never marry them (and they soon figure out why) it is not far-fetched to imagine that possibility.There is much passion in the story and the sex that takes place is subdued and not even written about in euphemism. Quite abruptly the younger characters turn on their lovers and Sons and Lovers suffers, in my opinion, from an overabundance of phrases such as \\"She hated him for it\\" or other such phrases using \\"detest\\" in its place. One minuscule fly in the ointment of sweet caresses might turn Miriam instantly against Paul with a phrase such as that. It grew tiresome to read that once again Paul \\"hates\\" Clara or that Miriam suddenly \\"detested\\" Paul.Clara Dawes is separated from her husband Baxter yet both see other people on the side. One hundred years ago it might have seemed scandalous for a British woman who was still legally married to be seen in public courting other gentlemen. Clara's mother, Mrs. Radford, was my favourite minor character in that she spoke like someone who has seen everything and wasn't afraid to call a spade a spade. She spoke her mind and provided comic relief. She was also likely a target for the censors of one hundred years ago for her degree of openness.I enjoyed Sons and Lovers for its descriptions of working-class England at the start of the 1900's. Lawrence writes some characters' dialogue in Nottingham dialect which fortunately was not difficult to decipher, despite the abundance of apostrophes and briticisms. Lawrence finds new ways to describe the countryside and flowers, coaly skies and hazy mornings. It was a delight to read his inventive descriptions for such dismal and dreary images. I plan to read more of Lawrence this year and thoroughly enjoyed Sons and Lovers."},{"Title":"Oracle DBA Interactive Workbook","review":"Not every book is meant for every reader.

As the book opens, Montero is pursuing the story of a trio of teenage car-jackers terrorizing the city by shooting drivers of late-model luxury cars gratuitously in the knee and dropping them by the side of the road. The cars then vanish.That night it becomes more personal when Montero herself witnesses a car-jacking that goes wrong - resulting in the killing of a baby and the maiming of its mother. Persistent as a hound on the scent, Montero tracks down one of the carjackers and discovers he's a salvageable homeless kid with a crack-addicted mother. But under Florida law, all those present at a crime resulting in murder are guilty of murder.Meanwhile Montero finds time to pause and help a rookie colleague - a would-be reporter stuck in the paper's library, go-getter Trish Tierney. With Montero's help Trish soon lands a general assignment job in the newsroom and quickly shows herself to be smart, grateful and a good cook to boot.And crime doesn't stop just because Montero's hot on a trail. Body parts are found in a downtown demolition site, a child disappears, a sinkhole swallows traffic. And Montero misses a major story - the biggest political scandal in years - scooped by Trish.Soon Trish is hogging more and more of Montero's limelight and the veteran reporter's suspicions sound like petty jealousy. As the story lines converge on a startling climax, Montero finds herself in danger of losing more than her job.Buchanan keeps up a breakneck pace, as Montero exploits police sources, goes along on chases, tracks leads into Miami's seamiest neighborhoods and delivers plenty of steamy Miami atmosphere. A top-notch thriller."},{"Title":"Suitable for Framing","review":"I found this book to be better written than most of the similiar books on the market.

I doubt that the Miami Chamber of Commerce would approve of this book, as it would certainly scare me from the thought of heading to that city which seems to have a large criminal element.

The story centers around a rash of car-jackings and a soon to be rival up and coming reporter after Britt's job. The two stories balance together well and fouund myself staying up late to finish it on a work night. You can easily find yourself rooting hard for Britt and the other good guys. One nice touch Buchannan adds is a tender side, in the story with the gang character and the Margaret Mayberry charatcer.The reason this novel falls to four stars is the typical &quot;let's make the main character perfect&quot; syndrome.

What an inane story with the most unbelievable characters. The dialogue was trite and repetitive. How many times do we have to hear the characters telling each other how much they love each other?(all that gooey sentiment -yuck) I have teenage sons and a daughter and we do not talk to each other like that! Rather than have the reader learn about the characters through action and decisions, she keeps giving us laundry lists of all of their qualities, ad nauseum. She didn't flesh out the characters, she just kept telling us about them. The reader never learns anything new about the main characters from page one until the last page (except for Stephanie). If this book is like any of the authors other books, than count me out as a future reader of Vale Allen."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"What I liked most about Grace Notes was the way Ms. Allen managed to fully render Grace's emotionally complicated personal relationships while still maintaining the thriller aspects of the story. From the liner notes, I knew that the emails from Stephanie Baine to Grace Loring weren't at all what they appeared. But once I started reading, I became caught up in Grace's personal relationships, particularly her relationship to her brother Gus which I found touching and tender. It's rare to find a good brother/sister dynamic in a novel.Ms. Allen managed to bring alive Grace's frustration and guilt over caring for her brother. Yet she never lost the tension of the narrative.

But the only part of the story I found interesting was Grace's e-mail relationship with Stephanie. That is, in the very beginning. Toward the middle, it was starting to get repetitve, and I will admit that it was very unrealistic. In the midst of all of this, I did skip over entirely the scenes which dealt with Grace's life taking care of her ill brother. I read it in the beginning, just to get to know the characters, but after a while I found her life taking care of Gus rather boring. I suppose because it paled in comparison to Stephanie's story. And I didn't like Grace's daughter Nicky at all for some reason. I don't know what it was about her, but she just got on my nerves. Nicky was supposed to be twenty-two, and seemed more like the typical young teenager (her room always a mess, etc.) By twenty-two, I would have thought the character should have been a little more matured than that. As for Stephanie, if I had been Grace, I wouldn't have trusted her. When Stephanie first introduced herself to Grace, her story seemed truthful enough. But as Stephanie began writing more and more to Grace, her story just took on an unrealistic tone. I couldn't believe any parent could be that hateful of their child as Stephanie's parents were supposedly hateful of her, and her sick husband should have been hung. Can anyone in real life be that abusive toward their own wife? Laughing, making fun of her, taunting her the way he did...I found it terribly unrealistic. Grace was rather unrealistic also, for not being the slightest suspicious of the whole thing. I found the story interesting enough to finish, however. I found myself drawn into it enough to wonder how it would end."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"Over two decades have passed since Grace Loring walked out on her abusive husband, taking her infant daughter and moving into her brother's home in Vermont.

She has long been an advocate and has supported many causes for the plight of abused women. But her writing has slowed down considerably since she has become the primary care giver for her older brother who is suffering from acute rheumatoid arthritis. Grace is increasingly bitter and depressed and feeling trapped in their home in Vermont and is somewhat of a martyr because she won't accept much help from others.She starts an e-mail correspondence with a woman who claims to be suffering emotional and physical abuse from a controlling husband and gives the woman advice on defending herself and escaping from the abusive relationship. Grace becomes obsessed with the plight of the woman, and when the correspondence abruptly stops, she fears the worst. She gradually realizes that something about the woman's story didn't ring true, but she is unable to make contact with her.In the meantime, Grace's long-time romance with the inimitable Vinnie is heating up. Vinnie splits his time between remodeling his old barn in Vermont and his New York City apartment. Grace is madly in love with him but won't allow herself to become dependent on him. Grace has a 22-year old daughter Nicky who is quirky, smart and totally loveable.Grace refuses to accept her brother's advice about ending the e-mail relationship, and the violent events that follow are rather contrived and unbelievable.

Medicare is not based on one's assets. You receive Medicare once you are 65 or after you have been disabled for at least two years.

Grace Notes is a cautionary tale about the ways in which the internet (email in particular) can be used--sometimes to great disadvantage. It's also a very truthful exploration of the tremendous demands of caregiving and of the long-term effects of domestic abuse. Several clever twists at the end were definitely not foreshadowed.

A successful author, she has fled an abusive marriage to live with her sympathetic brother Gus, but she now finds herself nearly overwhelmed as a caretaker as Gus surrenders himself completely to a crippling and financially ruinous rheumatoid arthritis. Grace has little time for her bright 22-year-old daughter Nicky--a convincingly perky depiction--or for the achingly decent man Vinnie who has finally entered her life, or even for her own writing, but the costs and burdens of the disease drive her back to the computer. And into this already stressful mix falls yet another plea for help that Grace, of the tormented heart, simply cannot resist. E-mail arrives from a woman who claims she is the victim of brutal and unremitting abuse. Grace's heart goes out--even as the reader begins to worry more and more that this new correspondent may not be quite what she claims. Grace is almost willfully nave and trusting and self-denying--which would, of course, be virtues in a better world (a world built by women, perhaps, as opposed to the one built by men where \\"realistic\\" souls try to hammer each other into submission.)The tension becomes almost unbearable as all these crises come together at once for Grace--and the e-mail correspondent abruptly shows up in person. Like reporting on any powerful mystery, I cannot reveal any more about the story without spoiling it. But I can say the characters moved me, unnerved me with their flaws (human flaws, not writing flaws), and I desperately wanted to step in and help them out of their predicaments. I will remember them for a long time.And finally, I detect more than a whiff of autobiography making its way into this story, both as abuse survivor and caretaker, and if I were an abused woman, I think I would immediately fly to Ms Allen's door and fall at her feet to worship her for writing so powerfully on a dark subject that deserves much more light thrown on it."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"I didn't expect the book to be so serious and thought provoking. From the back cover it sounded like a mystery but in reality it was about the life of an abused woman who escaped and ended up taking care of her beloved crippled brother. I actually enjoyed the book very much and it taught me a lot and made me think. The ending was odd and a little abrupt but I'm glad it had a conclusion. I recommend this book to anyone who has had it rough."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"The arrival of a new Charlotte Vale Allen book is always a treat! One following so close on the heels of Parting Gifts makes it a double treat. One cannot get too many of her books and this is another one that is a joy to read. Grace Notes takes us into the 21st Century with computers,the internet and emails playing the major role in this book.I will not reiterate the story line as doing so would only replicate what has preceded this.I will only add that she deals with both rheumatoid arthritis and spousal abuse with great knowledge. Ms. Allen's talent with character development is unsurpassed and she more than excells in this book. Grace Loring,her protagonist,is so real she almost leaves the book and joins you. Her brother,Gus;her daughter,Nicky;her dear friend,Vinnie; even Dolly and Lucia,her salaried help,are so totally dimensional it is difficult to see them as fictional characters. The only shadowy character is Stephanie Baine,but since she is manifested on email - a cyber person - she remains one dimensional. Only close to the end is she developed fully. Ms. Allen has written another fast-paced book that is highly readable. It builds in suspense to an exciting and unexpected conclusion. It is a great book,a great read, and she has done it again! After reading this book you may never fully trust your emails."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"This book, while a cautionary tale about abuse (spousal and otherwise) is also a testament to family, unconditional love and what is really important in life.While I have never been abused, I have been a mother to teenage girls and a caregiver to an ailing relative. All the action and feelings pertaining to these characters was totally realistic and the dialogue was right on.Going in you know the e-mails are a bit fraudulent so you are just waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak. It does and bad things happen. When all is said and done, all the loose ends are tidied up and we go on. Is that not what life is? Things happen and we go on?I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to everyone and anyone who wants to spend a few hours with some pretty nice people."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"Author Grace Loring - drawing upon her own background with an abusive husband - is accustomed to readers emailing her for advice regarding their own situations. However, she's taken off guard when she receives an email from Stephanie Baine, a young woman whose stories about physical, emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband and parents are as horrific as anything Grace has ever heard.Quickly becoming drawn into Stephanie's life, Grace is determined to help her save herself. As Stephanie begins to email her with increasing frequency - and increasing levels of horror in the tales she recounts - Grace finds herself becoming more and more consumed with Stephanie's life.Then, Grace begins to have doubts regarding the things Stephanie's told her...and even about Stephanie herself. Does someone named Stephanie Baine really exist? And if she does, is she truly being abused...or is there something else going on here?Throughout her days of communicating with Stephanie and taking care of her invalid brother Gus, Grace finds herself involuntarily pulled back into her own memories of the past. Essentially, she's so colored by her own experiences that she never stops to consider someone might be toying with her...something that might often happen in various real-life situations.Readers might suspect what might happen next, but the ending is a true surprise. This is one of Allen's finest works!"},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"Grace Loring was once married to someone who abused her. She quickly got herself and her baby girl out of the house and went to her brother's house in Vermont. Her brother Gus looked after them just as Grace would look after him years later when he was sick. Grace and Gus were both adopted. Their adoptive parents are not remembered fondly by either of them. Grace is a successful author but has not written anything in a while, overburdened with the issues of care giving. There are many loving relationships in this book, Grace and her daughter Nicola, Grace and Vinnie, Gus and Jerry, but they're pushed aside to deal with the emotional ramifications of his illness. Grace gets involved with a young abused wife from Virginia who contacted her by e-mail. Her story sounds tragic and Grace is worried. Towards the end, it is somewhat expected that Stephanie is not who she says she is. Grace and Gus finally realize how important their relationships are but by then you are at the last page. The message of this novel is strong but it was over too soon."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"Grace Notes is vintage Charlotte Vale Allen. It makes you smile, cringe, and think, all at the same time. Grace Notes spotlights the best and the worst of the &quot;world wide web.&quot; The opportunity to reach out and help others is spotlighted, as is the potential to be taken extreme advantage of. As a mother of young children, I would use this book first and foremost to warn people to be careful of revealing too much and being too trusting. At the same time, Ms. Vale Allen's portrait of a family pulling together to help and support each other in the face of a debilitating illness offers lessons of it's own.Bottom line, an entertaining read, sure to spark much discussion."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"Charlotte Vale Allen has written another powerful book titled Grace Notes. The characters are believable. Grace is a writer, but it's not a book about writing. The book shows how things can go wrong, awfully wrong, and the ending will shock you. I love suspense and this book has lots of tension. I found myself reading until the wee hours of the morning. It's a modern day story and there's something for everyone, even a gay character shown in proper light.I don't review the plot as that's really cheating. I guarantee you that you'll want to curl up and enjoy Grace Notes from cover to cover. I did. Once, a chill crawled up my spine. I won't tell you what page. That doesn't matter. There's as much love in the book as everything else as well. I found Grace Notes both rewarding and gripping.Once again, Ms. Allen's characters are true to life. If you want the fantasy world, rent a Walt Disney movie. Ms. Allen tells it how it is in real life with all the elements of day-to-day living.It's interesting to note that in the book Grace is a well known writer that welcomes readers to contact her. On her website (www.charlottevaleallen.com), Ms. Allen declares the same thing.Grace Notes involves the internet and emails and love and pain and much more. The emails become another character and it's interesting to see something not really concrete become a major character. It shows how the internet plays a major role in a lot of people's day to day lives.There's as much seriousness to this book as there is tension (gripping tension!). But there's parts that made me laugh and some parts were very, very sad. Charlotte Vale Allen understands life and in Grace Notes has written a book about real people and a dark situation that could easily happen.My only advice is NOT to take this book to bed with you if you have to get up early. You'll find yourself reading \\"just more chapter\\" and then another and then another.Grace Notes is a major treat for Charlotte Vale Allen fans. New readers will enjoy how she spins a web and gets the reader caught up from the opening page. Each book she writes is different. I've read many of her books and enjoy them greatly.I highly recommend Grace Notes in all regards."},{"Title":"Grace Notes","review":"I always enjoy Charlotte Vale Allen's books. This was one of the best.Grace Loring was a lucky woman when she and her daughter escaped from her abusive husband and went to live with her brother Gus in Vermont.Grace becomes a successful author later, and has many loyal fans of her writing. She is always one to be sympathetic when she hears others stories like those of her own. However, when one girl, Stephanie Baine e-mails Grace about her abusive husband, and that she must get away, Grace gives her very clear advice. Get away from him as soon as possible.As weeks pass with many exchanges between the two, the e-mails stop suddenly for no reason. Grace wonders what is going on, and in fact, if this woman is really telling the truth. Grace has the feeling that something far more sinister is going on, and in fact she better watch her back, as this woman could be very dangerous as it turns out."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"There were too many writers who tried to make something new aboyt the literary form.Some never do the noticeable inovation,some are succesful once in their life.Milorad Pavic does that every time he takes the pen.But,the reader is always brought to a position to wonder about the &quot;simplicity &quot; of the idea.Who couldn\`t remember of a dictionary,or the tarot cards,or inversing the story!Everything looks so familiar and easy like a fairytail or a SF novel,and then it begins to look like a little more seriously stuff.Metaphorical,maybe.Than you continue reading and become confused:who is who,and what all those people do in a completely different centuries?But there occurs one more time transfer and the book shows itself as an highly symbolic text. All those layers are invisible,their meanings cannot shine out while you are reading,but when you say:&quot;I don\`t see any conection here&quot; and go to bed or start washing the dishes.And then it becomes suddenly clearer and clearer.You run back to read it on.It doesn\`t let you rest. But the most unexpectable for me was that the author puts the Key of the book in Appendix(I and II),on the place where is less expected,like something that could and didn\`t have to interest You. The time is floating trough the people making people\`s efforts last forever.But there\`s very,very much texts where much better things are wrote than I ever could."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"A pleasant effort to read: a masterpiece of magickal literatureMilorad Pavic, born 1929 in Belgrade, is a noted Serbian poet, prose writer, translator, and historian of literature. \\"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel\\" is his first novel, published in 1988. Originally written in Serbian, the novel has been translated into many languages, including English.The novel is in the form of three small encyclopedic dictionaries, each compiled from either Christian, Jewish or Moslem sources. The three sections (Christian, Moslem and Jewish) are separated, yet intermingled due to cross references (many of them contradictory). They are color-coded, yet this only provides one aspect of categorization. Each section is set up like an encyclopedia in its own right, with the unifying figure of Princess Ateh \\"presiding\\" throughout the book.Owing to its lexicon format, the novel may be read in any number of ways, rather than simply front to back. Pavic intentionally challenges his readers to shun passivity in reading and become active participants in the novel as they themselves compose the story from often conflicting fragments.As the author writes (in his introduction to the English translation):\\"No chronology will be observed here, nor is one necessary. Hence each reader will put together the book for himself, as in a game of dominoes or cards, and, as with a mirror, he will get out of this dictionary as much as he puts into it, for you...cannot get more out of the truth than what you put into it.\\"Dictionary of the Khazars (\\"DOTK\\") offers a prime example of what is known as ergodic literature (the term is derived from the Greek 'ergon,' meaning \\"work\\", and 'hodos,' \\"path\\") a literature that requires a \\"non-trivial effort\\" to traverse the text. This effort must consist of more than simply reading by moving one's eyes along lines of text, turning pages and mentally interpreting what one reads.The book comes in two different editions, one \\"Male\\" and one \\"Female\\", which differ only in seventeen lines of one critical paragraph.As might be expected, there is no obvious plot in the usual sense, but the book's central theme (the \\"Khazar Polemic,\\" i.e., the mass religious conversion of the Khazar people) is based on an actual historical event generally dated to the turn of the 8th and 9th centuries. Although DOTK asserts that both the indigenous faith of the Khazars and which of the three Abrahamic faiths they converted to remain unknown, it is certain that the Khazar royalty and nobility converted to Judaism along with a portion of the general population. Pavic, however, is not concerned about the historicity of his depiction of the Khazars, but in the events and processes that led to a melding of cultures of the Balkans, the states of Man and God and their relationships to each other, and in formulating the prospect of peculiar, surreal connections that an informed reader can potentially make between multiple books.Pavic often veers into his own style of playful fantasy: most (but not all) of the characters and events described in the novel are entirely fictional, as is much of the culture ascribed to the Khazars in the book, which bears little resemblance to any literary or archeological evidence. One critic has called DOTK \\"a sort of metafictional false document,\\" as the people and events in the novel are presented as factual. Some observers have suggested the novel symbolically addresses the dissolution of Yugoslavia, which at the time DOTK was written had yet to happen, but is nonetheless a distinct possibility.This book, lacking a plot, is without any single or simple way to read it. I have re-read it several times, and on each reading the experience is a different one. Like skimming through a dictionary or encyclopedia, this book beckons you to read its parts in no particular order or in any order you choose.\\"DOTK\\" is sure to intrigue any sagacious reader; and while the whimsical nature of the book may seem superficial at first, the reader is inexorably drawn deeper into the mystery of \\"What is this all about?\\"Reading \\"DOTK\\" opens the door to a magickal world, one well worth visiting and re-visiting.

A place that you can never realy leave because just as you think you can you find another wonder to explore which you may have explored already.

I won't say much more, other than that Pavic is the best fiction writer in the world, and this book is the best introduction to his work."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"Milorad Pavic is a dreamer... plain and simple... If you have noticed there are few dreamers left in this world. The realism of life has obscured the world of creativity and imagination. This books based upon Kabalistic and Babylonian influences which were at the time of Khazars probably quite a marvel. History obscures this because of the mysterious nature of the religions. Not all are able to withstand the Kabalistic concepts of life. Thus they are frightened away by the dark imagery and when they confront their own shadows they flee. In these dreams they are thrown into a fit of their own inexplicable darkness, later to emerge as a star of light.Pavic has been there and back and is a true dream catcher. As a Christian I have lived a life, spouting scriptures and a rigidity of reality that has usurped all other thought. But I wonder where are the Daniels, Isaiahs, Ezekiels and the revelations of John are? They are there lying in the subconscious awaiting the (kabalistic) \\"key\\" to unlock the door to them. This book is a catalyst to all who seek freedom from the static and is an introduction to the figurative emphatic... It opened my eyes... I rate this book among the top ten books I have ever had the good fortune of reading."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"When can a dictionary become a beautiful, strange, lyrical postmodern novel? When it's written by a beautiful, strange, lyrical postmodern Slavic poet. The Dictionary of the Khazars is ostensibly the combined record of the Khazar people of the 8th century: a Christian dictionary, a Muslim dictionary, and a Jewish dictionary. Each has alphabetical entries detailing the legendary \\"Khazar polemic\\" where the chieftain of the Khazars converted to one of the three religions - and each dictionary records the chieftain convering to its own faith. The dictionary also records the mysterious dream hunters of the Khazars, and the three authors of the dictionaries' bizarre and mysterious intersecting lives. And, of course, Satan.There is a plot - but the plot is not the point. Pavi''s writing, as a poet, is evocative and sensuous, baffling and suggestive all at the same time. And part of the fun is cross-referencing the different entries in the three lexicons and seeing how they are the same and how they differ, how the different strands of lives and histories and metaphors blend into each other. In other words, you choose how to read the book and how to construct the plot.

At this point, I haven't found much that differentiate one book from the another. That is, I can put a Christian entry into the Islam book and no one will find any discordance. It is another way of saying: there appear to be no lines demarcating the religions, and the Khazar polemic seems another hoax the author wrote to tease the reader.If forced to glean some \\"meaning\\", I would say the book, by establishing no difference between religions, and in fact making contradicting statements about the Khazar Polemic based on undifferentiated religions, seems to suggest that the only good the religious quarrels do to us is to make us insane, manifested in a book with a total breakdown of logic and reality."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"One of the truly great books.

By navigating in seemingly random fashion, a world begins to emerge, one as mystical and strange as it is real and solid.Pavic has an unusual command of the absurdity of meaning; his juxtaposition of the normal with the bizarre as if there was nothing to it makes reading him exciting, new. The book will probably appeal to the historian inside us, as well as to the meddler, the gossiper and the prude in us. That juxtaposition creates a desire to know 'what next then?'We meet princesses with deadly eyelids, slow mirrors and fast mirrors, poisonous books and killer winks...Read it, but you will never be done with it!"},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"This book was written by a serbian professor of literature, but might have been written by a former argentinian librarian: Jorge Luis Borges. Both the authors share a love for combinatorics, puzzling coincindences, catalogues, and bizzarre stories. Their stile is rational and dramatic at the same time, like the facade of a baroque church. Also, this book was published in 1986, the year of Borges' death, and is maybe the epitaph that Borges would have liked.This is a book about the truth. The king of a mysterious people (the Khazars) summons three sages (a christian, a muslim and a jew), because he wants to convert to the true god. Centuries later, three literati write their own accounts of that conversion (each one is different). And this century, three researcher investigate again on what happened.Finally, there is not a single truth. The book is organized as a dictionary, or better, three dictionaries (one for each religion). Every word inspires a different story and explanation, but all are filled with magic events and mysterious characters. The reader is the ultimate investigator -- and creator -- of the Khazar empire. It's up to him to discover the truth.A final (and personal) note. This &quot;dictionary&quot; may seem an extremely sophisticated literary game, similar to those of Calvino and Perec. This is is true, but there is more. When the book was out, the civil war (apparently motivated by secular religious intolerance) had not begun yet. To me, this book seems also a passionate attempt to show how difficult is to attain the truth, and an invitation to tolerance."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"This book is a rare gem. Milorad Pavic is known for his unqiue formats and incredible imagery, and \\"DotK\\" is certainly no exception. The 3 sub-books (each an individual dictionary) provide alternate perspectives about entries that serve to flesh out the story, which centers around what is referred to as the \\"Khazar Polemic\\"; a debate set forth by the Khazar Khaghan to determine which of the three major religions to adopt: Christianity, Judaism, or Islam.This little tome is filled with beautiful, bizarre word pictures that shouldn't be passed up. As someone has already remarked, he very much is the Salvadore Dale of literature. Buy this book and read it at least twice; once to get the story and again to appreciate the phenomenal minutia. All of his characters are so fantastical and colorful that it will take more than a cursory glance to absorb the feast Pavic has set before us. Belly up and dive in, it's great.This is also a perfect spring board to launch into future Pavic novels."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars is a very odd book. It's written more like an encyclopaedia than a dictionary, and more like a book of mythology/folklore than an encyclopaedia.Perhaps the book can be best described as the ultimate bathroom reading for post-modernists. The book is divided into three parts: Christian, Jewish, and Muslim. The entries are generally short, and can be read in any order. As you read, you'll find crossovers, similarities, and outright contradictions to perplex and tease your mind. The time periods covered jump from the distant past to the present, with murders, accidental deaths, personification of devils, and dream-hunting.Some parts I found rather dry, but on the whole, the book is filled with moments where I would put the book down to contemplate a sentence. The Dictionary of the Khazars is full of nice, chewy ideas and insights, and reads a bit like a more user-friendly Umberto Eco."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"Are you ready for this ? Do you want a novel with a plot, tangible characters, and the usual narrative style ? OK, forget this book. You are flying over an unknown land, maybe New Guinea, below all is steep mountain and impenetrable jungle. It's a land sparsely inhabited by utterly different people. You fly through some clouds, get lost. Now how will you navigate ? It's all so beautiful, but where are you going? You look down and in the immortal words of Bob Dylan, \\"you know something's happenin', but you don't know what it is..\\" Yes, you are definitely reading DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS, a beautiful, strange book, redolant with poetry, myth, fantasy, legend, a murder case, dreams, scraps of history, and a political allegory about former Yugoslavia. Pavic has a 17th century fresco painter who is also the Devil say, \\"Why shouldn't someone create a dictionary of words that make up one book and let the reader himself assemble the words into a whole ?\\" Pavic has come close to that. The words dazzle. In what other book can you find an egg that holds one day of life, a Thursday or Friday ? Where else do you read about a man with ears so pointed that he could slice a piece of bread with them, about parrot poems, eleven-fingered lute players, or inheritance according to the color of one's beard ? When I read that \\"it was so quiet in the inn that the hair of the dreamer could be heard splitting somewhere in the dark\\" I knew that I could not give this novel less than four stars.The Khazars were a Turkic people living on the Ukrainian steppes and between the Black and Caspian Seas. They disappeared close to a thousand years ago, but not before their khan converted to Judaism, leading Arthur Koestler to write \\"The Thirteenth Tribe\\", in which he claimed Russian and East European Jews were all descendants of the Khazars. The conversion was effected by means of a debate between three scholars invited by the khan, a Christian, a Muslim, and a Jew. With this nugget of history, Pavic creates a fantasy, divided into three books, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish, in which characters, institutions, books, and events are treated as in some fabulous encyclopedia. Slowly, with some concentration, being constantly diverted by dreams, weird tales, and witty asides, you see the connections appearing. The number three (as in the 3 religions) is repeated three times---three characters who were the original debaters, three characters who converged around a battle and manuscript in 1689, and again in Istanbul in 1982. You don't have to read this all in order---you can start anywhere---but my advice definitely is to finish.Surrealistic in the extreme, DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS is like a Dali painting or maybe a Fellini movie. If you like those, you will find the novel attractive. It would help to know something about Yugoslavia between 1945 and 1991. Though this political factor is there, mainly alluding, in ironic observations, to the situation of the Serbs, it is far from omnipresent. This is a first novel about life by a highly original poet. It may be confusing sometimes, but it is never dull. A moth may see a white wall as the whole sky. Or maybe not. But you can certainly find the whole human condition in this novel. Try it, you may be glad you did."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"Honestly, I am not certain what to write about Pavic's \\"Dictionary of the Khazars.\\" This is not because I did not enjoy it-- I enjoyed it hugely-- but because I am not certain there is anything else it can be compared to. Unlike his other works, which are certainly amiable enough fiction, this book is inspired, and totally unique.Taking the form of a dictionary, it is completely nonlinear and untraditional, essentially a hypertext novel printed on paper. To make things a bit more interesting, the dictionary is actually three separate dictionaries, each 'composed' by a different character, and 'redacted' by a fourth. One reading cannot suffice to comprehend and appreciate the book, one really must read it at least twice: once to try and figure out who the players are and what the hell is happening; and again to go back and forth, following the tangled threads of characters and ideas to appreciate the quality of the story's craft.The book, unsurprisingly, deals with various people's obsession with the story of the Khazars. I found this delightful, as I have always been fascinated with the story myself, and especially considering it seems few have even heard the tale today. There really were Khazars: they were a Russo-Slavic people, living (as Pavic duly assures us) near to the Black Sea, just north of the Byzantine Empire. At an indeterminate time, but likely around 700 CE, their king decided to change his religion, and requested a disputation (a religious debate) be held for him by representatives of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, so he could pick the proper path. He chose Judaism, and the entire nation converted, becoming, for the rest of their existence, the only sovreign Jewish nation in the world from the Roman expulsion of Jews from Judea in 200 to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948. The Khazars were conquered and dispersed sometime around the 10th century or so, and perhaps might have passed out of history (save for the most curious of esoteric legend collectors) had the Khazari disputation not been used as the literary framing of Rabbi Judah HaLevi's medieval philosophy of Judaism, entitled \\"Kuzari\\" (the Hebraicization of 'Khazars').Pavic starts at this juicy tidbit of historia obscura-- already more than a bit surreal to begin with-- takes it, and runs. The Khazars in his book are an enchanting fusion of excellently-researched fact (or however close to fact the actual legends of the Khazars may be) and Pavic's own strange creations, such as their being 'dream hunters' and treasuring numerous different varieties of salt.The three sections of the dictionary are purportedly compiled in late medieval or early Renaissance times by a Christian, a Jew, and a Muslim, respectively, with the redaction being modern and secular. The helpful device of the book is that dictionary entries which are found in multiple sections (yes, some are only found in one section or another-- read carefully) are marked by a cross, and/or a Star of David, and/or a crescent.What amazes me most about Pavic's work here is how meticulously detailed and well-researched it is. The factual details he uses are scrupulously correct, and the invented details stunningly crafted, to the point where unless one happens to be quite well-acquainted with the Khazars and the history of the spread of religion in the relevant times and places, one will be hard put to know what springs from history and what from the mind of Pavic. The characters also are wonderfully bizarre, with that strikingly surreal colorfulness so frequently encountered in historical figures from the Russo-Slavic areas.Obviously, if you are looking for a serious work about the historical Khazars and their Jewish kingdom of Khazaria, this is not that book. But if you're looking for a truly engrossing read, unlike anything else you've ever read, with which to delightfully while away hours on a trip or a dull evening or even a nice morning, this is a must. A tremendous amount of fun, a joy to own (you will come back to it, and it will not disappoint), and-- I guarantee-- not something you will see anywhere else."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"This is a bizarre and beautiful book, and perhaps due to my limited attention span I found its value more in the poetry of its language than its attempts at being a novel. Some of the passages, such as the one describing Man's relationship to God as similar to that of the man and the moth, are breathtakingly wonderful. As a writer myself, I have been endlessly inspired by his new ideas in both language and structure. If you're looking for straightforward magical realism I would suggest reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Milan Kundera first, but if you wish to delve deeper into the odd tunnels of human thought (I often wonder how Pavic thought of some of his stories-within-stories)then this &quot;lexical novel&quot; is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"This book simultaneously tells several totally distinct estories, but which are all the same. It is incredibly charming, I read it twice, some years ago, and the excerpts that I wrote may be slightly different on the book due to this!The first way to read this book is as a tale of three excludent versions of the conversion of a people to the true Religion: Judaism, Christianity and Islamism. Three wise men were convoked by the Khazars King to explain a dream. Afterwards each claims to have won the debate, although even ignoring the names of their opponents. It seems to me a very proper symbol of the European or even the World History: each one describing events totally blind to other peoples versions.The Khazars, before converting, had a Religion based on Dreams. Afterwards they were destroyed by the Kievan Russians, &quot;so suddenly that the shadows of their palaces had no time to disappear together with the buildings, and still remain there&quot;. &quot;Only some parrots of the Black Sea still remember their language.&quot;It is also a fantastically poetic book, with many moving passages. It relates the fight of Man to recreate a New Man, against the concerted alliance of the devils of the three religions. It tells an incredible maze of personal estories: the powerful princess Ateh, an european noble fighting on the turkish side, a devil who painted religious icons, and so forth.In conclusion, it tells the estory of Man alone trying to create its own Future, but fighting against poerful devils and the omnipresent God, whoever He is. In this way it remembers me a fantastic brazilian romance &quot;The Devil pay on the Backlands (Grande Sertao: Veredas)&quot; of Joao Guimaraes Rosa: Is there a Devil or is everything of our own responsability? That may be a good question to ask ourselves."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"Although this novel comes in two versions -- male and female -- this is just a Pavician joke and it's not necessary to hunt the single altered paragraph which is the &quot;key&quot; to the story. At the end of the book, Pavic playfully suggests that male and female readers should meet up to exchange the missing paragraph -- he is perhaps the first meta-fictional matchmaker in literary history! Anyway, this is an absolutely brilliant novel, and Pavic deserves to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. It's a genuine literary event when he publishes a new novel, and he is the only author to bestride the 20th century like a genuine colossus -- one foot in the 19th century, standing with Tolstoy, Gogol, Multatuli, Alas, Balzac, and the other foot in the 21st century, among writers still unborn."},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words (English and Serbo-Croatian Edition)","review":"Per the author's challenge to the average reader to discover his or her reading style within the confines of \\"the book,\\" I would suggest that the \\"Dictionary of the Khazars\\" be marketed to people who either 1) are effected by ADD [...] On the one hand, the book provides no reference point; much like hyperspace, the person who likes quick clicks and the illusion of complete control will take to the \\"Dictionary\\" like (insert your own bad metaphor).

Well, the first question doesn't require an answer. He did it. And the second is answered by the book. It's fine.But what is its value? What does fiction do, at its best? It allows us to inhabit a person that we could hardly understand otherwise. Here we have white America's worst nightmare depicted: a young tough smart black man who doesn't give a damn.Now black writers may feel that Goldblatt is poaching on their reservation. But foreignness can give a writer an advantage. And there's another advantage here to not being black. A black writer has a complex reaction to this character too. He or she is as likely to be afraid of such guys as a white; plus there's some group solidarity - don't expose this side of our people in front of the outsiders. Or there's irritation at someone who is squandering his opportunities ; or there's a desire to use this character to beat up on white readers, scare them or make them feel guilty. The white author is free of those possible hang-ups.An author may love his characters or hate them, or he may take sides. Love some, hate others. Dickens and Tolstoy I consider to be obvious examples of writers who love their characters; they love even their villains. For hatred it's hard to match Evelyn Waugh. (A Handful of Dust would be the absolute indicator.)Here's the amazing thing about Africa Speaks. Goldblatt loves his character. He gives so much detail of the life so quickly. Violent crime, wasted educational opportunities, intolerable attitudes toward women and sex, nonsensical racist rant, these are unfortunate details in a man who may not be lovable, but is loved anyway. But how do I know Goldblatt loves Africa Ali? Chuang Tzu and the fishes. The Chinese philosopher walking along the stream comments on the joy of the fishes. His companion complains that he couldn't possibly know that. He responds that he knows by the joy he feels watching them.So here's what this book does. It lets urban middle class white readers enter into a relationship of love with a character that they see every day, but will never be close to. This is not the relationship they will have with the pathetic Bigger Thomas, for sure. Easy Rawlins, Mosley's detective hero, may be enjoyable, and likable but no more real than a TV cop. And not BAD. Black male figures in literature are either not the man we fear, or not a man we can love. Africa Ali is both. Isn't that something.The unobtrusive frame of the story is that Africa has volunteered to state his view of life to a sociology prof with a tape recorder who buys him Chinese lunch. Africa isn't the only character. On days when he can't make it he sends friends. A promiscuous black woman who loves him, an ambitious young man working a menial job to start a normal life, and a pompous young Afrocentric university student. They are all presented lovingly. In the background is another friend, a real violent gangster. He never appears. Goldblatt's benevolence, perhaps, could not stretch so far.The street attitude toward sex, and the nonsensical prating of Afrocentrist rant should be funny, but the urban pathology is simply too painful for these vivid raps to be really hilarious. Guys like Africa, however, are eloquent performers in a style that is constructed to be amusing, and the author puts it down wonderfully well. So it's amusing even if not funny(?) Still, for a piece of sociology combined with linguistics and rolled into a fictional package, it's great.The fact that this significant book is not widely reviewed in periodicals is a scandal."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"I wouldn't be writing this review except for the last couple of reviews which imply that Goldblatt should not have written this because he's white, or that he doesn't get the language of hip hop exactly right. I read this book right after it came out, and I am a big time fan of hip hop, and I can tell you he got the language just right. Not to say he got it exactly the way it's spoken on the street. If he tried to do that, the book would have been dated before it ever got published--since hip hop slang changes every week. (That's one of hip hop's strengths.) What Goldblatt does is he invents a kind of essential hip hop language--close enough to sound real but still understandable to non-hip hop fans. Then he uses that language to tell the story of Africa Ali, who is the main narrator. The things Africa says may not be pretty, but they're true in the way that only fiction can be true; they're true to the character of Africa. It's easy to say, but I'll say it anyway: I personally guarantee you'll laugh out loud and cry out loud in the course of reading this book. You'll love every character in the book, and you'll root for them, and you'll read the book over and over just to hear their voices again. This is everything ia classic should be. And if you don't read it because other readers, with axes to grind, put you off it, it will be your loss."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"I found this book compelling and convincing. Its stark portrayal of the logical consequences of the rap ethos, its bleak humor, and its engaging characters take this beyond the question of idiom or stereotype. Whether posturing for the interviewer or puzzling out the mystery of racism, Africa Ali and his cohorts seem desperate to tell their stories, and it seems to me that those stories -- authentic or not -- deserve to be told. If the stories frighten the whites and frustrate the blacks, so much the better.Novels may be the ideal space in which to consider and encounter otherness. Africa's life and language are alien to me, and so is urban black culture in general. Reading this novel, knowing it was written by a white man, forced me to decide where my own sympathies (and pathologies) might be located. If rap were turned into narrative, would it be like this? If I find these characters sympathetic, does that make me a racist because, as some reviewers have said, they are stereotypes? Or does it mean that I have broken through the stereotypes to their humanity? Maybe the important thing is to be asking the question. This novel startled and challenged me, and that's a good thing.Unfortunately, the controversy over whether a white man can legitimately write a novel about black culture speaks volumes about the strangle-hold identity politics has taken on America: perhaps our desire for authenticity, and our wish that the oppressed might speak for themselves, has closed doors to creativity that ought to be left open. In any case, I plan to teach this book in my class on Contemporary American Literature, and let the students debate the question."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This may not be the Great American Novel, but it's as close as anyone's gotten in the last 25 years, and it's damn sure closer than any of the bloated 800 page monstrosities critics like to put up on that pedestal. Face it--race is THE subject, for better or worse, of American writing, and this book tackles it with no holds barred. It's an ugly, brutal, heartbreaking, absolutely truthful book. If other readers (and critics) have a problem with that, it's their loss."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This book caught me off-guard. The well-written satire is fascinating fast-paced, sad, and thought provoking. I picked it up and was intrigued by the first paragraph and opening page. I didnt put it down until I finished the book, a few hours later. I found myself wanting to further understand the main character, Africa, and hoped I could find some empathy for him and his gang. The author of this book is a superb writer. I wanted to read more of his writing, and found many witty &quot;to the point&quot; articles in different journals and other publications. I would recommend this book highly, and hope the author continues to write fiction."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This book is superb. Although it is ostensibly a satire on black culture, it achieves a warmth and humanity that is usually alien to that genre. The characters are deeply engaging, so much so, that their failings are not to be sneered at, but rather lamented. It is as if the author has taken us behind the often grim exterior of \\"blackness\\" and revealed the humor, the humanity, and most importantly, the squandered potential that lies behind. And we owe that insight to the fact that this writer has great compassion for his characters. The novel is satire at its most educative, and most humane.The book also moves at an incredible pace. Part of that is derived from the gripping storyline as it is advanced by the protagonist in his monologues. It is also due to Goldblatt's adept handling of black speech. The editorial blurb on the book jacket asserting that Goldblatt \\"has an ear for idiom\\" is an understatement, indeed. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This book is a hilarious and sobering look at a walking collection of social pathologies instantiated in the person of \\"Africa Ali\\". The character, not unlike many real life black males, has opted out of the responsible, productive society. In place of a fact based education, a Leonard Jeffries inspired racist mythology is enshrined as the intellectual ideal. The idealization of crimminal, irresponsible, and destructive behaviour has been made the badge of \\"authenticity\\" for \\"blackness\\". The sobering and depressing fact is that the black community itself is perpetuating this 'oppression'upon itself, cultural suicide in an increasingly complex and technological world. New immigrants see the downward spiral of black culture and form their own stereotypes from these observations. Asians and Hispanics are moving up the socio-economic ladder in this country when and because of their rejection of the underlying attitudes of black culture. In the not too distant future Hispanics will be more numerous than blacks and Asians will soon follow. This demographic trends will either sober blacks up OR cause them to add Asians and Hispanics to their racist litany of boogeymen along with whites and their all purpose demon of demons, Jews. There is truly little, if anything, admirable in hip hop culture. The best preventative medicine may be to laugh at it, long and hard. Teach your children to laugh at it as well. It does not deserve to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"The highest compliment I can pay this book is to reveal that I stopped reading it for a few weeks. Why? Because Mark Goldblatt's uncanny ear for the speech patterns of the fictional (yet vividly and insufferably real) Africa Ali sent me searching -- so to speak -- for a quieter subway car. That's not to say that Africa and the sad segment of society he represents is irredeemable. It's merely to state that people like me -- successful white males with the ability to understand and perhaps even change society -- don't want to do the redeeming: Africa and his friends can either shut up and do their thing somewhere else or I can just move to the next subway car. In that sense, Mark Goldblatt gets us to see that we are all part of both a problem and a great societal failure: Africa and I may be drinking from the same water fountain nowadays, but that's where it ends."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"It is hard to review a book so unique without giving away some of its originality. The book is written in the first person, the narrator being an African-American who calls himself Africa. He talks about his life, his friends, his thoughts, his beliefs, his likes & dislikes, etc. We, the readers, become witnesses to sadder and darker realities and truths unfolding, as the main character nonchalantly walks us through his life and his conclusions. Several chapters are used to introduce us to his friends, and Mr. Goldblatt achieves that with great economy of style and observations that are both keen and powerful.[SPOILERS FOLLOW] The genius of the book is multi-layered: first off, the book is written by a white person, Mr. Mark Goldblatt. Second, Mr. Goldblatt has an excellent ear for language and rhythm, and a profound understanding of mindset and its roots; it is as if he has distilled his character out of the many he has met, has listened to or has read. Third and most important, the book exposes some tragic truths about today's America, where people force themselves to fit into a manufactured reality. When we see the world through the eyes of the protagonist Africa, we are saddened to realize that many do indeed deceive and short-change themselves as thoroughly as he does, for the same reasons he does. Despite his bravado, the protagonist is a willing victim of the false myths that surround him, and doom him to his existence.\\"Africa Speaks\\" is a must read: it is a brilliant tour-de-force that combines a tragedy and a heartfelt, brilliantly written wake-up call, to hopefully pull us out of our politically-correct stupor."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"Judging from comments I have heard and read, it seems many readers miss the point of this novel entirely.This is a work of satire. Goldblatt is lampooning and poking holes in the ridiculous movements that attempt to claim black culture as their own and use blacks as pawns for their own personal gain. He illustrates the lies both groups and individuals tell to continue the oppression and subjugation of the black population in the United States.Rather than working for true equality based on mutual respect, people offer ideologies that create further conflict and guarantee blacks will remain a permanent underclass. Africa Ali-a clearly intelligent and ingenious young man-is doomed to a life of promiscuity, senseless violence, and the eventual deaths of his friends and families. All because he abandoned true opportunities in favor of the lies promoted by those who wish to keep him \\"in his place.\\"For example, the \\"angry black\\" archetype so commonly promoted in urban centers eliminates the possibility that such young people will be successful in public school, colleges, and in the work force. The ridiculous notion of \\"street cred\\" as the driving force to manhood leads to death or disabling injury. Alternatively, those who adopt viewpoints like those proffered by the black academic-i.e., whites stole all cultural achievement from the Nubians, etc.-are placed into a direct and permanent conflict with the (mostly white) gatekeepers of academia and our society's economy, greatly limiting their future chances for success.The terrible consequence of all this is a glimpse into the potential fate of the entire black culture: when the people in power feel threatened, they tend to eliminate the threat. Hopefully, people will wake up and realize that mutual respect, honesty, and love are the only hope we have as a human race."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This debut novel, a \\"gangsta\\" narrative of a street-smart, young black man written by a white biblical scholar, is a disturbing indictment of the insidious influence of an American subculture. Through a series of monologues, Africa and his friends reflect on the American black experience. His \\"rap-sodies\\" are in turn funny, exasperating, ignorant and poignant. Through these multi-layered distorted mirrors, the reader must deduce the reality of their existence, which is mired in the stereotypes, illusions and delusions of racism. And though Africa sees himself as a rebel of society, he is, in fact, a prisoner of his misguided philosophy.Africa speaks to \\"get the truth out\\", but in doing so, he denies it. Yet despite his words and his threats, we are able to see his doubts and his suffering. And though he never transcends his own \\"nigga\\" world, Africa, for us, becomes tragically human."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This novel scared the daylights out of me. I don't know if Goldblatt knows what he's talking about--if this really is what young black people think about living in America. But if he's right, it's a grim picture he paints for the future of the country. As for the book itself, it zooms by. I read it in three sittings. The language is pretty shocking, but you get used to it and settle into the story. I wound up sympathizing with the main characters. You feel that they're doomed, but you root for them anyway. This is a sad, sad book."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"This novella about New York City Blacks is not like most novels. It has no rising action, no climax and no denoument. It is, however, interesting and informative. The story is told in the first person as the characters speak to an anonymous interviewer-researcher who is invisible to the reader.Several points of view are revealed that exist within the Black culture. The radicals believe that the ancient Nubians invented everything worthwhile and the Greeks stole it all, and that some day Blacks will be on top again and everything will be cool because &quot;brothers know how to work things out.&quot; Others don't buy any of this and don't see the world as black or white. They just want to get along and prosper as best they can.There are some shockers here for readers not familiar with radical Black politics. Africa Ali, the main character, tells us that the Jews invented AIDS for the CIA to kill Castro. When that didn't work the CIA used it in Africa to kill Africans. Whites are the root of all evil but &quot;there's nothing lower than Jews,&quot; Africa tells us. We can see inside the Black world through the personal narratives of the characters. Young Blacks have to face the need to succeed in a white-majority world while at the same time submit to peer pressure not to act white.The book gives us an idea of how young Blacks feel about each other and about other ethnic groups. Only Blacks themselves can say whether or not the author got it right. It is not a put-down, but rather an attempt to help us understand the cultural differences. Whites should stop trying to act Black and should stop expecting Blacks to act white. Blacks should realize that the vast majority of whites have no wish to return to the days of racial prejudice nor do they want to repeal any of the advancements in racial equality enacted over the past forty years. If the divisive and sensitive racial issues of today are ever to be worked out, the solutions will only come after we reach this kind of mutual understanding."},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","review":"Goldblatt's book is certainly ambitious, but in the end, its satirical nature fails to fully materialize.

Christ is the tie between the Testaments, the content of the canon, and the unifying theme within each book of the Bible.This book is basic to both Bible study and preaching and serves as an excellent guide to the Bible's central theme. It encompasses far more than a study of types and the Old Testament prophecies. Each chapter takes seriously the affirmation of Jesus: \\"Everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled\\" (Luke 24:44).Related to Geisler's central thrust -- that Christ is the clue to the whole Bible -- is the clear assertion concerning the inspiration of Scripture and the deity of Christ. Chapter topics include: (1) Christ Is the Key to the Bible; (2) Christ in the Old Testament; (3) Christ in Both Testaments; (4) Christ in Every Section of the Bible; (5) Christ in Each Book of the Bible; (6) The Word of God; Personal and Propositional.

But over all, it's a good book for Bible students looking for an introduction to the over all theme and unity of the Bible."},{"Title":"Traces of Dreams: Landscape, Cultural Memory, and the Poetry of Basho","review":"Matsuo Basho (1644-1694) is certainly the best-known haiku poet of all time, even though he never heard the word &quot;haiku&quot;. What he did do, in his own time, was (a) write and teach the writing of &quot;haikai no renga&quot;, the popular style of linked, collaborative poetry of his time, (b) collect the largest number of followers (or &quot;disciples&quot;) of any poet of his day, (c) write a number of short prose pieces with short verses he called hokku (haibun), (d) write a number of independent hokku (which we now call &quot;haiku&quot;), and (e) write several travel diaries, the last of which, &quot;Narrow Road of the Interior&quot; goes by a number of titles in English and is one of the great masterpieces of world literature.You can find out about all this from other books. However, in Professor Shirane's book, you will find out more: Basho was not the only person doing these things during his lifetime. And although nobody is likely to say that Basho was not the most important poet of his day, he was definitely influenced in all his work by the trends of the time. When funny verses were the vogue, early in his career, he wrote funny verses. When Chinese poetry became a major influence on the poetry scene, his writings reflected his own rich knowledge of that Chinese heritage. When other poets started advocating a &quot;lighter&quot; style, more directly concerned with the things of daily life, Basho took up &quot;lightness&quot; as an important element of his art.Basho's uniqueness does not lie in his unique type of poetry, but in his great ability to ride the wave of fashion in a common type of poetry and make something rich and lasting from it. By placing Basho and his work--with many fine translations--in the context of his own day and his own culture, Prof. Shirane gives us a deeper, richer Basho than we knew before. And, he helps us grasp some basics of Japanese culture, and of haiku, that we probably missed in other books on the subject."},{"Title":"Traces of Dreams: Landscape, Cultural Memory, and the Poetry of Basho","review":"William Higginson's review of this important book is spot-on. However, he missed a few features of the book I regard as significant.One rather major omission is Shirane's wonderful, in-depth translation/analysis of a Basho-group kasen, \\"Withering Gusts\\", which is really the centerpiece of the book since it brings together all the critical themes of the book. In fact, the subtext of the book seems to lionize Basho as a renku (linked-verse) master par excellence, emphasizing his catalytic role in the development of renku (or haikai no renga as Basho would have called it).\\"Withering Gusts\\" is an early example of a kasen (36-link renga or \\"renku\\") by Basho et al. It is outstanding in that the participants were all young, full of vigor, and overbrimming with newness and skill. Of course, Basho was the \\"master\\" of this renku session, but his presence seems to have stimulated the other renkujin to great poetic heights.One plus is the reproduction of a few of Basho's own haiga, sumi-e drawings he made with his hokku poems and calligraphy included.Haruo Shirane is a thoughtful critic who brings much to bear on his subject. He skillfully shows how Basho brought newness and vitality into renga by introducing haikai subjects that would have been prohibited in the more formal and sober rule-bound renga of earlier masters such as Sogi (d. 1502). Shirane shows how Basho not simply introduced demotic subjects but raised them to the level of great poetry.This book, as the flap claims, is truly for both the general reader and the specialist. As a \\"general reader\\" myself, I must confess some of the analysis went over my head, but there is enough that I can understand that kept my interest throughout. Even so, after a while, I could really grasp some of the deeper analytical concepts he discusses, because his writing is so lucid and not overburdened with specialist terms.The modern-day renku enthusiast will undoubtedly find much of value in this study. It is superbly well-written, with relatively few typos (I caught a couple, H. G. Henderson's 1934 book on haiku titled \\"Bamboo Broom\\" was mistakenly referenced as \\"Bamboo Room\\"). But these trivial peccadilloes do not detract from the achievement of this book, a major contribution to Western understanding of the haikai poetry of Basho and his time."},{"Title":"Secrets of Big League Play","review":"great clean read 4 anyone. inside tips on pitching, catching, batting, fielding base running and winning ballgames with: luis aparicio, earl battey, hank bauer, yogi berra, ken boyer, jesse burkett, roy campanella, orlando cepeda, ty cobb, mickey cochrane, choo-choo coleman, wes covington, roger craig, willie davis, dizzy dean, bill dickey, dominic dimaggio, leo durocher, johnny evers, bob feller, chico fernandes, frankie frisch, hank greenberg, clark griffith, jim hegan, solly hemus, elston howard, frank howard, al jackson, joey jay, walter johnson, john kennedy, harmon killebrew, tony kubek, brooks lawrence, johnny logan, connie mack, art mahaffey jr, mickey mantle, roger maris, willie mays, willie mccovey, john mcgraw, stan musial, rocky nelson, satchel page, camilo pascuel, herb pennock, vic power, bobby richardson, phil rizzuto, jackie robinson, wilbert robinson, john romano, john roseboro, edd roush, babe ruth, red schoendienst, warren spahn, tris speaker, casey stengel, hank thompson, bob turley, vic wertz, ted williams, maury wills, rudy york, cy young and don zimmer are all refered to in this book."},{"Title":"The Spider (#45): Voyage of the Coffin Ship","review":"THE SPIDER is noted for slam-bang action.

That is what I thought. However, while the writing is clearly entertaining and relaxing, the message is a serious one and the author communicates it effectively. In ten brief chapters the book describes essential blocks for creativity.Creative thinking allows for the possibility that the right answer can be illogical, and one get that answer only by following some rules of thumb while breaking others, as long as in this frivolous play people do not lose more than they gain. This is the gist of Chapters 1 - 5.Subsequent chapters recognize that specialization aids productivity and hence gains from exchange. However, there is the obvious caution that too narrow an area of specialization stifles imagination. Thus, it does not hurt to \\"occasionally, let your \`stupid monitor' down, play the fool, and see what crazy ideas you can come up with\\" (p.128). The reason is that in creative efforts ambiguity pays; to err is not to do wrong. Temporary failure is sometimes better than temporary success, for \`if you hit every time, the target is too near or too big' (p. 154).

THE DIVINE FEMININE offers a refreshing and inspiring approach to all three."},{"Title":"The Divine Feminine in Biblical Wisdom Literature: Selections Annotated & Explained (Skylight Illuminations)","review":"When I got this book in the mail I thought I would just read a couple pages to get a feel for it but I ended up reading the whole thing that night. It is more of a devotional with about 180 pages of selected passages with author notes on the facing page.The Wisdom Literature the author sites comes from these seven books:* Psalms* Proverbs* Job* The Song of Songs* Ecclesiastes* Wisdom of Solomon* The Wisdom of Jesus Ben SirachThe book itself is divided into five topical sections* Foreward & Introduction (I found his personal story interesting and the historical information on the books a good frame of reference on how to approach the various verses)* Who Is She?* Where Is She Found?* What Does She Teach?* The Way of the WiseYou would think that with having to read it all the first night I would have given it 5 stars, however I found some of the passages a bit ambiguous in terms of relating to the divine feminine and in some areas he relied heavily on one book or chapter of scripture.

Readers may be surprised to learn there is a feminine aspect to the Old Testament, and may not know about Wisdom Literature: Wisdom Literature combines four Hebrew books of the Old Testament with two Greek texts and provides passages which are excellent commentaries on feminine aspects of spiritual traditions."},{"Title":"The Divine Feminine in Biblical Wisdom Literature: Selections Annotated & Explained (Skylight Illuminations)","review":"Rabbi Shapiro is a frequent author of Skylight Path Publishing books. He is a very clear writer and informative, and many people benefit from reading his books. He has his own theology, but whether one agrees with him or not, readers gain a wealth of information and insights from his volumes. While readers might suppose that this book offers one of what they might call Rabbi Shapiro's unorthodox views, this is not true. The rabbi shows readers selections from several biblical books that extol wisdom, which the Bible describes as a woman, as being so important that it is metaphorically divine. The selections are placed on right-hand pages and Rabbi Shapiro's explanations are on the left.For example: Proverbs 8:22-26 has Wisdom say in Rabbi Shapiro's translation:God is my Source,and I am His creation.Before time - I am.Before beginnings - I am.There were as yet no oceans when I was born,no springs deep and overflowing.I am older than mountains.Elder to the hills, the valleys, and the fields.Before even the first lumps of clay emerged - I am.This book captures the teaching that the most important possession that people should acquire is wisdom. The selections dramatize that the world itself is designed to work with wisdom, God's first creation. The New Testament book John begins with a version of this quote. It uses the Greek logos that means \\"wisdom.\\" Since logos also means \\"word,\\" most translations render it \\"word,\\" most likely incorrectly since the author of John was clearly paraphrasing Proverbs. Readers who are unfamiliar with the biblical teaching about wisdom will gain much by reading this book and even those who know this already should read the book to be reminded again."},{"Title":"The Divine Feminine in Biblical Wisdom Literature: Selections Annotated & Explained (Skylight Illuminations)","review":"Rabbi Rami Shapiro does the reader of biblical Wisdom literature a great service by focusing on key passages and providing profound commentary that allows for slow reading and \\"digesting\\" of proverbs emanating from the subtle voice of Wisdom.As Gerhard von Rad wrote in his Introduction to his book Wisdom in Israel: \\"Once an experience has found expression in a proverb, a sentence, a maxim or even in an aphorism, a multi-layered process has come to an end. In the interval, the validity of the experience in question must have been proved. ... It can ... like a precious stone among trinkets, outshine a poem of the highest quality. The demand which it must always satisfy is that of brevity, of compactness and yet of intelligibility, with, if possible, a clear graphic quality; in short, that of being easily remembered. ... Many of these, by their often remarkably profound content but also by their literary form, invite the reader to pause at length over them. ... They are, in fact, concerned with the achieving of a certain distance from that which is near and everyday, from that which everyone knows and yet no one knows or understands\\" (Abingdon Press, 1972, pp. 4-5).Wisdom in IsraelBecause the form and the content speak with one voice in these pages, this presentation of Rabbi Shapiro's work underlines his assertion in his Introduction \\"About the Wisdom Literature\\" that \\"The truth of a proverb is self-evident. You only have to hear a proverb once and you will know it is true. It is as if the proverb reflected truths already embedded in the human psyche as well as in the doings of the nonhuman world of nature\\" (p. xxvii). He also concludes quite profoundly that: \\"In a sense, the Divine Feminine is married not only to God but to all who are wise. The implication is that those created in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26) can do as God does, and find union with and delight in the love of Wisdom\\" (p. xxxvii). This book beautifully encourages that ideal.Isabel Anders is the author of Becoming Flame: Uncommon Mother-Daughter Wisdom and Blessings and Prayers for Married Couples.Becoming Flame: Uncommon Mother-Daughter WisdomBlessings and Prayers for Married Couples: A Faith Full Love"},{"Title":"The Divine Feminine in Biblical Wisdom Literature: Selections Annotated & Explained (Skylight Illuminations)","review":"Rabbi Shapiro provides a decent overview of wisdom literature both in the Hebrew canon and outside of it. Drawing on books like Proverbs, The Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, The Wisdom of Jesus Ben Sirach, Shapiro guides the reader through his own interpretation of wisdom as the female part of God (or our version of that part) and its way: living in the moment; realizing that nothing is stable or fixed; and not relying on our own 'stories' of realty as a meta-text of what reality is. For certain people, Shapiro's version of wisdom will be appealing, especially for those who see wisdom as living with uncertainty, change and flux. This Tao of Hebrew Wisdom is certainly a non-traditional interpretation."},{"Title":"The Divine Feminine in Biblical Wisdom Literature: Selections Annotated & Explained (Skylight Illuminations)","review":"Rabi Remi Shapiro usually writes books that one can be encouraged by because the writing is so consise and flowing.

I am doing some work on Scripture and femininity and bought this book expecting some intellectual thoughts and study on the subject. What I received is an inspirational book that is not only weak, but is lacking in grounded interpretation. The book has passages of scripture and then explanations/annotations of each passage. The explanations are nonsensical and obviously carry Rami M. Shapiro's mystic beliefs. There is no research to back up the claims made, and the interpretation of the passages is laughable. I was very disappointed.

The state has been my home for ten years. I am not sure I would have appreciated the book, had I read it much earlier. One has to live in Idaho and become minimally aware of some history and have visited some places in the state. Then reading the book brings a sense of rewarding surprise as the reader realizes there is more to what he has known and seen. Many of the descriptions of events in the book begin in a very ordinary way and then build to connect to something important. The author uses this device to tell about the Frank Church wilderness area. It all begins with the Forest Service rangers trying to solve the problem of washing their clothing without using electricity or gasoline to power a washing machine. If there is one thing I would have wanted in the book, it would be small maps with the outline of the state and a black dot placed to indicate where exactly each event happened. It is said Idaho is a state separated by geography and distance. It is easy to live in one part of the state without becoming familiar with other parts of the state. This book would make a good gift for a number of occasions. Even people living outside of Idaho could enjoy it."},{"Title":"Meet General Grant (A Star book)","review":"This biography of Grant extends into a history of his times. The writing is informed, elegant, readable, and interesting. And very quotable: \\"Certainly no man can be a Christian and a soldier at the same time, for the two ideas are wholly incompatible.\\"Unfortunately, it is marred by racism. The author claims that slavery harmed the Southern white man more than the slave! That it \\"civilized\\" the slave \\"in a shorter time than any savage race was ever civilized before.\\" He says that slavery would not have worked in Kansas because slaves \\"lacked the intelligence to grow wheat successfully.\\" He claims that blacks \\"became free without any effort of their own.\\" His pro-Southern bias is evident when he says, \\"The South confronted the North with the insolence of poetry defying prose.\\"In his assessment of General Grant, the author tries to be fair but falls short. He praises him for his honesty and his tenacity in battle, while insulting his intelligence. \\"There were extensive portions of his mentality which appear to have been dormant all his life.\\" He states that Grant was a pacifist who lacked the initiative to abandon his military career. \\"My opinion is that his mind was that of a mechanic or engineer, rather than that of a soldier.\\" Woodward has little regard for other Union brass. General Halleck, for example, was \\"a large emptiness surrounded by an education.\\"This book does not rise far enough above nineteenth century racism, but it does otherwise give a good account of Grant's life and times."},{"Title":"Meet General Grant (A Star book)","review":"While looking through the stacks of a bookstore at a local flea market, I found a hardback copy of Woodward's &quot;Meet General Grant&quot;. Figured any old book was worth $4, so I added it to my collection. I found this book extremely educating and quite interesting. Even though I am a &quot;distant relative by marriage&quot; of Grant, I didn't really know much about him. Visited his birthplace, childhood home, etc. which is right across the Ohio River from where I live in Northern Kentucky - but, well - he's just not a man that I had read a lot about.Woodward gave me not only an excellent sketch of Grant, but of the social events and mores of the time. In short, I learned a LOT about the man and his times. Some of the language (e.g. his somewhat antiquated viewpoint of African Americans) seems dated, but hey, the book was first published in 1946.I liked it. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn the true &quot;genius&quot; of the lesser revered general of the &quot;War of Northern Aggression&quot;."},{"Title":"Meet General Grant (A Star book)","review":"In a lesser-known Upton Sinclair non-fiction book about alcoholism titled, \\"The Cup of Fury,\\" the author describes an encounter with the writer William E. Woodward thus: \\"William E. Woodward is best remembered as the author of two splendid biographies, one of George Washington and the other of General Grant.\\"On that recommendation, I found copies of both and read them. I was not disappointed. In fact, these two biographies, along with his subversive, Zinn-like \\"New American History\\" and biography of Lafayette (the best of the bunch) are treasures in my library.In \\"Meet General Grant,\\" Woodward seems to paint a very fair picture. He praises the general for his force of will, and tells the story of his unlikely rise from soldier to general to president with great skill. Along the way, Woodward knocks over quite a few sacred cows. And his financial background (Woodward was a banker before turning to writing late in life) makes him an authoritative source describing President Grant's official scandals.Oh yes, the racism thing. Once one is called a racist, well, how does one defend oneself, particularly if one is dead? Certainly, a longing for the Old South is sprinkled here and there in his writing, but nothing unusual for a Southerner.I highly recommend \\"Meet General Grant.\\" The author didn't seem to admire Grant as he admired Lafayette -- but the story and the style and subversive tone of \\"Meet General Grant\\" make it a classic on my shelf."},{"Title":"Meet General Grant (A Star book)","review":"Many very interesting but what I believe to be little known facts about not only this famous man but facts about other men and incidents of the times.

Chapters 1 through 9 contain 98 pages, 10 of which are BLANK, with just the word \\"Notes\\" at the top of each page. The book contains NO ILLUSTRATIONS or PHOTOS. The 88 pages that are not blank mainly contain just \\"lists\\" of tired, old, and obvious ideas for decorating \\"on the cheap,\\" e.g., use old blankets for pillow covers; make stencils from cardboard; use sheets to make curtains; hang LOTS of baskets; etc. The book is redundant, e.g., in at least 3 places, readers are told to \\"buy plants\\" or \\"get cuttings and grow plants\\" with which to decorate. Instructions, when given, are unclear or somewhat \\"iffy\\": Readers are told they can make a clock, by buying a pre-cut round of wood and marking the center just by \\"drawing two lines.\\" That method works great with squares, but not with circles.

I was drawn to the book by its high recommendation by the clerk in the bookstore and also by its setting. I was quick to learn that this book was far from a formula romance. The strong character of Maggie May Keough was so unlike any other female protagonist I could remember! It was only through her relationship with the book's other principal character, Brian Kelly, and with her daughter, that I could see the framework of a decent human being. Driven by her career and social standing, she represented everything I've come to detest in a personality; it was in the character of Brian that I found a decent human being to root for in this unpredicatable romance between a CPA and Maine motel operator.The author has a gift for writing dialogue as evidenced in the many spirited exchanges between Maggie May and Brian - intelligent compared to the conventional romances. Coughlin also goes a few notches above the norm in a steamy, sexual interlude. I get the impression that he puts more effort into this book than the standard romance writer following some cookbook formula. Many of the plot twists and ideas were fresh and unexpected.I would theorize that the author gives us Maggie May and Brian to represent symbollically materialism and humanism at odds. The quandry, you want Brian to be happy but he's only going to be happy if he gets his Maggie May. The novel's ending is unpredictable and most satisfying. I feel like I stumbled onto something a little special in this book.I look forward to a sequel perhaps, but certainly many more pleasurable hours of reading in future books by this author!"},{"Title":"Maggie May's Diary","review":"I read this book because it was based in Manchester NH and Wells ME, two areas I know quite well. It was wonderful to read discriptions of places and be able to picture in my mind exactly the setting. The story line was not extraordinary, however. It seems a great deal of books I've read lately are about women who move on with life after their husbands walk out on them. This one also has a woman going in search of a lost love and how they rekindle old relationships. The best thing going for it was that it was short, so it was very quick. I wouldn't have wanted this book to go on much more than it did."},{"Title":"Maggie May's Diary","review":"(...)I found the book to be superb! I was drawn back to my own high school days and recalled some of the students from that era. I then remembered my first 15 year reunion and the way some of the people had changed. A few were just as obnoxious as they had been in earlier years and some had become more sensitive to people's feelings. Coughlin was right on target. I enjoyed his dialogue, related to his characters, understood his scenes of intimacy, and felt for the individuals in the story as they faced the issues that challenged them. Once started, I could not put the book down, contrary to what the other reviewer stated. I also enjoyed reading the locations mentioned in the book. As a Mainer, I could visualize each place and put the characters in perspective. Having visited those areas years ago, it brought a feeling of nostalgia to me that I had not thought about in years.

Living in NH and knowing Perkin's Cove and Wells ME as well as I do, I find the plot real and Coughlin sensitive. He loves Maggie or he wouldn't put up with her...This book is for anyone who has ever looked back and searched for an old love....It is a great summer read and I have the feeling that Maggie May will appear again in a sequel...I am told that the book has taken the Maine coast by storm.

The female character was so irritating, mean and nasty. I pictured her to be the typical bleach blond, always at the gym, thinks she's the best-thing-since-sliced-bread type that cares only about herself and no one else. I was frustrated that Brian would put up with her nastiness since he was such a nice, down to earth guy.

I feel like Coughlin was in a rush to finish the book and rushed the ending with a forced epilogue. I hope that Obscene Bliss carries on in the same fashion as Brian Kelly and Maggie May's Diary. A great love story to follow through to the end."},{"Title":"Maggie May's Diary","review":"My family has vacationed in Wells for years. I picked this book up last summer and loved it.

Thanks Thomas and please write some more."},{"Title":"Maggie May's Diary","review":"Maggie May's Diary is a different romance than any other I've ever read in that the heroine is not very likeable until the end of the story, but Brian Kelly is the kind of guy female readers fall in love with! As a girl who kept a diary in high school, I identified with the diary entries -- surprising since written by a male author! The story unfolds really nicely though and these 2 main characters play off each other very well; there are parts of the book that made me laugh out loud. I especially liked the setting of the story since I vacation in Maine a lot. And the ending of the book left me with a smile on my face!!! All in all, a refreshing change from the usual romance formula."},{"Title":"Maggie May's Diary","review":"I read this book one day while I was vacationing in Wells, Maine (one of the locals in the book). It was very enjoyable to read his discriptions of places and beaches that have been my second home for 18 years. I was intrigued to read on and see what other landmark he would choose to include. The book itself is just a tadd above a romance novel. My major complaint with the book is that Mr. Coughlin never made me like the main character, Maggie. She simply did not seem like a very nice person. I found myself almost wishing against her at times. All in all, a good first novel."},{"Title":"Maggie May's Diary","review":"I began this book because a friend suggested it. I must say that I would not describe Maggie May as &quot;strong&quot; but, instead: egotistical, selfish, and immature. I trudged through the story until she became involved with the rich lawyer and then I could stand her no longer. I skipped to the end . I think the smartest character in the book is her ex-husband - he gets out in the first few chapters! The location has absolutly nothing to do with the story - just a gimmick to sell, sell, sell! I wonder if the same story will appear in Florida or California with the resturant and town names simply changed? Don't waste your money$!"},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"This thing is hard to write a short review on since it is actually three books in one. It is about a family, beginning with Jonny Moreau, who for three generations were implanted with high tech weaponry to make them super soldiers. But as has been typical of Timothy Zahn throughout his career these stories are about far more than that. It deals quite a lot with how a society deals having such high tech warriors in their midst. A factor that leads Jonny Moureau into politics, and his oldest son Corwin, who is not a Cobra, follows in his footsteps. Being a Cobra and a politician can put a strain on family life. But it's hard to tell at times which is the bigger problem. The original story Cobra is written as a group of short stories because two of the \\"chapters\\" were originally published as short stories. I'm not sure which ones. This is well worth the read for any Timothy Zahn fan."},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"The Cobra trilogy was enjoyable but not worth raving about. I'd recommend it to voracious Sci-fi readers, but not many others. For someone who hasn't read much science fiction, this would be a great one to start with. There is enough science to make it seem plausible and yet not stifle or drown the stories for a new reader.The ideas and science applications are not totally new, but the stories, characters and settings make up for the lack of originality in the science.Also, Timothy Zahn has created a continuity with the characters and their family that really made the entire volume seems real and personal.There are many things that could be picked apart, but wouldn't do much good at this point. I liked it a lot, and for most Sci-fi fans, especially military Sci-fi fans, they will love it as well."},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"I always liked to mix up my reading. If I have been reading a few mysteries, I will try to grab some science fiction. If I have been reading something serious, I will look for something funny. And if I have been reading heavier, intense literature, I try and look for something light and fun. With that mindset, I grabbed up and began to listen to Cobra by Timothy Zahn. Reading the summaries Cobra was about enhanced super soldiers, so I expected something light, with a bunch of action and explosions. I had never read Zahn before, but I knew he wrote some Star Wars novels, so that is basically what I expected, a shoot em' up Western in Space.That is not what I got. Instead, I got a detailed and intimate tale of the life of a soldier. Instead of raging armies of super soldiers taking on tanks and Mecha, there was a well told story about the effects of war on a single man. There was action, but most of it was one man, escaping bad guys, or taking on subversive plots with not just lasers and bombs but his mind. Even more so, the book was a look at what happens to soldiers when they are taken from war, and placed back into society, those people they were duty bound to protect, now looking at them with fear and scorn. The beauty of Cobra is that is followed our protagonist past his battle days, and shows you his life from multiple perspectives. It allows you to see how the active duty life of a soldier is only his first battle.Cobra exceeded my expectations and again taught me that you can't always judge a book by its publisher generated blurb. As with many science fiction series, the seep sonorous voice of Stefan Rudnicki handled the narration. This tale was right in Rudnicki's wheelhouse, a character driven science fiction tale."},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"This edition brings together the first three books, written in the eighties, in a military SF series about the cybernetically and biomechanically-enhanced \\"Cobra\\" soldiers. It is the first of two trilogies about the Cobras written a quarter of a century apart.The first trilogy consists of:1)Cobra, published 1985, story begins in 24032)Cobra Strike\\" published 1986, set a generation later3)Cobra Bargainpublished 1988, set another generation on in 2474.Much more recently Zahn has revisited these stories to produce a second set of three books known as the \\"Cobra War\\" trilogy, which is set another generation later (the heroine of \\"Cobra Bargain\\" is the mother of one of the main characters in the Cobra War books). This second trilogy consists of4)Cobra War Book 1: Cobra Alliance5)Cobra War Book 2: Cobra Guardian6)Cobra War Book 3: Cobra Gamble(Due for publication in 2012).\\"Cobra\\" and \\"Cobra Strike\\" were also published together in one volume as \\"Cobras Two.\\"As this series begins at the start of \\"Cobra,\\" some four hundred years in the future and many light years away on the frontier of human space, a group of human colony worlds are under attack from an aggressive alien race known as the Troft. The first planet they attacked was over-run in only three weeks. In a desperate attempt to stop the invaders, the Dominion of Man creates the enhanced \\"Cobra\\" guerillas: the name stands for COmputerised Body Reflex Armament.The Cobras are indistinguishable from a normal human from the outside, but with a whole host of computer-controlled weaponry and enhancements built into their bodies and their very bones. These soldiers are deadly in combat but the process of turning a normal human into a Cobra is irreversible - which means that those who survive the war will have all manner of problems returning to civilian life afterwards. The novels examine some of the personal and social consequences of turning people into supermen - have they given up their own humanity to save humankind?Each of the three novels which make up this first trilogy tells the story of a generation of the Moreau family who serve Aventine both as Cobra soldiers and as political leaders.The first book tells the story of Jonny Moreau who was one of the first generation of Cobra solders from the time he joins the Cobras as a young recruit just after the war with the Troft to an agonising political choice which confronts his thirty years later as a senior politician.\\"Cobra Strike\\" begins a few years after the conclusion of \\"Cobra\\" and continues the story both of the world of Aventine and of the next generation of the Moreau family. The main character of this one is Jonny Moreau's son Justin, who follows him into the Cobras, and one of the supporting characters is his older son Corwin, who follows him into Aventine politics. During that book an astonishing request comes from the alien Troft, who the Cobras were originally brought into existence to fight. They ask the Cobras to assist them in dealing with a world called Quasama which they claim poses a threat to Troft and humans alike - and they offer Aventine a hugely valuable payment - no less than five new worlds - if the Cobras could deal with that threat.The offer seems too good to be true: is that because that's precisely what it is?Cobra Bargain is set another generation later - the back cover of my copy of the original separately published edition says that it is set in 2474. I can't find this date in the actual text, but it is consistent with the chronology of the series. Corwin Moreau is now a governor of Aventine: the heroine of the book is his niece Jasmine or Jin, who is the daughter of Justin Moreau and determined to follow her father and grandfather into the Cobras.At first there is enormous opposition to making a woman into a Cobra, but then the need arises for a dangerous mission to the world of Quasama (the world which her father visited in the previous book.) Because Jin is one of the very few people on Aventine who has mastered the difficult Quasaman language, the Aventine authorities reluctantly allow her to become the first female Cobra.But when she arrives on Quasama, the mission begins to go wrong almost immediately ...This three novels in the original \\"Cobra\\" trilogy are reasonably well-written, entertaining, and exciting. However, having been published in the eighties during the early days of Timothy Zahn's writing career, I don't personally feel that they are in the same league as the best of the brilliant novels which he has produced over the following decades.If you read the first three Cobra novels expecting anything like \\"Warhorse,\\" \\"Deadman Switch, \\"The Icarus Hunt\\" or any of the \\"Grand Admiral Thrawn\\" books set in the \\"Star Wars\\" universe, you may be disappointed.Nevertheless if you are into Military SF it is extremely likely that you will enjoy this trilogy, and you will also find that some of the ideas in these books appear to have inspired a number of more recent books by other popular SF writers."},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"good keeps your interest all seem to come together would buy another one by the author ok ok ok ok"},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"I was very happy to receive my order.

I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Zahn at Comicpalooza 2012 here in Houston in May, and I picked up the final copy of this work (and got an autograph, too). The author was a very nice guy who went out of his way to visit my own booth (I run a publishing company) and we chatted for a little while.\\"The Cobra Trilogy\\" is an omnibus edition of three other works,COBRA,Cobra Strike, andCOBRA BARGAIN. I'm glad I was able to get all three in one volume, as this series kept me turning pages long into the night. Packed with action from beginning to end, I was drawn into a world where the very essence of what it means to be human was challenged.The psychology of war is a main part of this series, and how people who are so vastly different - and, in many ways, superior - to 'normal' humans deal with not only the war but each other and their normal friends and relatives. To me, the best stories aren't the ones that are all about the action and fast pacing, but rather the ones that use those story elements as a backdrop for more intricate and detailed character development. Zahn has succeeded on all fronts with this series.As a bonus, I just learned that there's three additional \\"Cobra\\" books, a new trilogy called the \\"Cobra War\\".Cobra Alliance: Cobra War: Book I,Cobra Guardian: Cobra War: Book Two, andCobra Gamble: Cobra War, Book III."},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"Book Info: Genre: Military Sci-fi Reading Level: AdultDisclosure: I received an ARC of the final book in the Cobra War trilogy from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review; in order to fully appreciate it, I have gathered this first trilogy (in omnibus format) and the first two books in the Cobra War trilogy, for all of which I will happily also provide an honest review.Synopsis: The colony worlds Adirondack and Silvern fell to the Troft forces almost without a struggle. Outnumbered and on the defensive, Earth made a desperate decision. It would attack the aliens not from space, but on the ground-with forces the Trofts did not even suspect. Thus were created the Cobras, a guerilla force whose weapons were surgically implanted, invisible to the unsuspecting eye, yet undeniably deadly. But power brings temptation . . . and not all the Cobras could be trusted to fight for Earth alone. Jonny Moreau would learn the uses-and abuses-of his special abilities, and what it truly meant to be a Cobra.My Thoughts: This is am omnibus edition that contains the books Cobra (originally published in 1985), Cobra Strike (1986) and Cobra Bargain (1988). I have read a number of books by Timothy Zahn in the past, which have varied from brilliant to so-so. Military science-fiction is a relatively new addition to my list of books I will read - my husband introduced me to the genre with the fun The Rats, The Bats, and the Vats something like eight years ago and then I graduated on to the Honor Harrington books and never really looked back. There are some I haven't cared much for, but overall, military science-fiction is an underrated genre and one that I quite enjoy. It probably seems a bit excessive to buy the equivalent of five books in order to be able to review a single book, but since I've generally enjoyed both the genre and the author, I figured they would fit well together. Then when I learned this were originally published while I was still in high school, I was even more interested to see what I thought, since at the time I was mostly reading fantasy - a very different mindset!The set-up for this is a very interesting one - the Cobra soldiers are basically turned into a sort of cyborg and used for guerrilla warfare. Like many books of military science-fiction, this book goes beyond the war and into the reactions of the people to war, victory, defeat, and the military itself. The sort of men who win wars are not the sort of men who are usually welcomed back into society with open arms - they are usually viewed with at the best suspicion and at the worst overt hostility, as people tend to fear that these same men, that saved their homes and their freedom, might possibly decide that maybe these people don't deserve their freedom. They then turn on the soldiers, forcing them into untenable positions - well, if you've ever read any military science-fiction, you'll recognize the plot device.This series is a multi-generational thing. We follow down from Jonny Moreau and through his family lines to his granddaughter, Jin, as the Cobras first are created and then later form a place for themselves within society.I found this to be an enjoyable piece of military science-fiction - perhaps a bit belated with its late acknowledgment of women in the military, but a solid piece of the genre fiction. You can find individual reviews for each of the books in the usual places. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cobra Trilogy","review":"I have read more than 2000 Sci-fi novels (spread-sheet listed) and the Cobra Trilogy ranks as one of the great stories I have enjoyed in quite a few years.

So when John Hospers presents the ideas of Libertarianism from his viewpoint, in a book written about 1 year before running against Jimmy Carter for president as a Libertarian, it is easy to see where a government like this would have changed America. Sewn seemlessly with dozens of quotes and historical references this book leaves little room to argue that the premise couldn't work. How well it might work is still left to the reader. This book goes bounds beyond politics and enters realms of insightful philosophic depth. Most importantly it is an idea of governing people, as if their lives and happiness do matter more than anything else, more than economy, more than delutions of patriotism. I give it all 5 stars because this book is highly accessable to anyone, unless they typicly enjoy hard to understand political books where government acts in itself and not for it's people."},{"Title":"Libertarianism: A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow","review":"With a new preface by the author, the phenomenal classic on the American libertarian philosophy is now back in print and available to a new generation of readers interested in the constitutional alternative to socialism and 'liberalism' in the United States. In the tradition of Bastiat, Hazlitt, von Mises, and Ayn Rand, Prof. Hospers dispatches one Big-Government clich&eacute; and fallacy after another in clear and understandable English. An important resource in the arsenal of liberty, this 2007 edition includes a new preface by Dr. Hospers which discusses some of the most critical issues facing Americans today. The book that launched a movement can inspire us all again in the struggle to recapture the spirit of American freedom under constitutional law.Libertarianism: A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow"},{"Title":"Libertarianism: A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow","review":"Many people, especially professional academic philosophers, tend to think that Robert Nozick'sAnarchy, State, and Utopiawas, if not the very first book ever written on libertarianism, then certainly the first one written on the subject by a distinguished professor of philosophy. Well, they are manifestly wrong on both accounts. It is hard to understand why as John Hospers is widely known among these people, and his other booksAn Introduction to Philosophical AnalysisandHuman Conduct: Problems of Ethicsare widely used in philosophy courses around the world, and the present book was originally published in 1971, some three years before that of Nozick. One reason why Libertarianism - A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow is not as recognized could be that it is not a very philosophical work despite its author's professional credentials. Hospers ran for president in 1972 for the Libertarian Party in the USA and this book can be seen as his political program. As such it is an apt description of the libertarian position rather than a philosophic treatise. If you want to know what libertarianism is, then the present book is indeed recommended. But if you wish to read something written with a more philosophic approach, I would recommend Jan Narveson'sThe Libertarian Ideaor the above mentionedAnarchy, State, and Utopia.Reading the present book reinforced my hope that libertarianism really is the political philosophy for tomorrow. Too bad that Hosper did not live to see it as he recently passed away at the impressive age of 93.Fritz- Anton FritzsonLund University,Sweden"},{"Title":"Libertarianism: A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow","review":"Excellent book.

My immediate reaction was: Lee Fahnestock must certainly be &quot;Ponge's voice in English&quot;. Several rereadings, and a comparison with the French originals, confirmed this opinion.Ponge was the first modern poet to be moved to imagine the inner nature of objects - &quot;things&quot;. Things animal - vegetable - mineral. Snails - moss - pebbles. Ponge's imagination delves into the very being of the objects, he sees how even the most apparently insignificant of them is an integral part of the world we know, he shows us how the nature of inanimate things is intricately linked to all things animate, to all of us human beings. He made it his lifelong task to use his fastidious felling for words and language to make strange and beautiful poetry out of his vision.To represent this unusual view in another language, it is evident that the translator must have a deep empathy with the original visionary, and it is clear that this empathy was what urged Lee Fahnestock to make these poems wider known. Ponge's poetic intentions may seem very serious - and they are - but he expresses seriousness in a joyous, often insouciant style, full of humor, lighthearted word play, puns, alliteration, allusions, imaginative contrasts. And I feel that this unique combination has be reproduced with love and understanding by Lee Fahnestock. She gives us Ponge's tones, rhythms, humor. She has maneuvered his word play with respect and unostentatious discretion; she knows how to read between the lines. Here, to my mind, is indeed Ponge in English."},{"Title":"The Nature of Things (French Series)","review":"This translation of Francis Ponge is melodic and gentle. The tenderness and beauty in these poems seem, through Lee Fahnestock's translation, to come straight from Ponge himself. The simple, inviting book design and the lucid translation of the prose poems bring Ponge directly from another time and another place to the modern English-speaking reader. The book as a whole is a treasure."},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"I read this story when it was in an anthology called Out of This World. After reading it, I was inspired to go back and read Destiny, Eternity, and Infinity.

I highly reccommend it, especially if you have read any of the others I mentioned."},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"***Review containers spoilers***This is a novella, which centres on Puabi - a dark Immortal High Witch. She throws herself into the sea after her husband leaves her to burn in their house, as he runs off with his mistress. Matthew rescues her from the sea. Puabi could be the twin of his dead wife, Gabrielle.The story is about redemption and love and has an unbelievable happy ending.It was a compelling read but not a satisfying one - even though I knew I was going to get a predictable romance before I started reading. I don't usually mind that - so I guess I must have found other elements of the story unsatisfying and that is probably down to the length - not enough time for characters to be drawn properly and events to unfold at a natural pace."},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"IMMORTALITY originally released as a short story in the OUT OF THIS WORLD anthology in 2001.When her beloved husband betrays Puabi to be with his mistress, it was all she could do to pull herself from her burning home and crawl to the cliffs near her house where she falls into the ocean. Badly burned and suffering from smoke inhalation, she still hopes to survive, but if she doesn't at least she has the satisfaction of knowing her husband won't find her body.An unknown amount of time later, Matthew Fairchild is out boating and sees the body of a woman drifting in the ocean. Pulling her into his boat, he quickly discovers that she is still alive and much to his surprise she the vision of his deceased wife!Maggie Shayne is an author who never fails to impress me with her writing ability and this is actually the first of her witch stories I've read. IMMORTALITY has inspired me to go and read more of her witch novels.Puabi is an Immortal High Witch and has given up her soul by killing numerous \\"light ones\\" to maintain her life and youth. By tossing herself into the ocean, she dies a thousand deaths, each time restoring herself with a life she had previously stolen. She is a bitter woman, a Queen in her own right and while weak in body strong in will. She desperately needs to be loved, and loved in return. While she comes across as very hard, I actually thought she also came across as very noble, so I liked her as a character.Matthew lost his wife and unborn child because he was too devoted to his work and very neglectful of his needy wife. Even though he had married her out of duty, Matthew blaims himself for her death and cannot come to terms with her loss. Finding Puabi, he realizes that while she is and was not his wife, she is the type of woman he could very easily love.This story is very touching and the end was a little bit of a surprise for me.

If you have not read the series, it is Eternity, Infinity, Destiny, and Immortality. The books do follow each other, so I would recommend reading them in order. However, if you have already read the other books - this is the story of one of the \\"bad guys\\" from the previous book (Destiny) coming to terms with the choices she has made throughout the years. It is interesting to see how her basic issue is that she is selfish, and that has driven her to do some terrible things. However, it does not cover the same details as Destiny (this is a Novella - a compainon book to the series), so I would recommend reading that book first or you will be confused by some things."},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"This is the fourth story in the Immortal High Witch series which includes \\"Infinity\\", \\"Eternity\\" and \\"Destiny\\", all much longer than this short story.

When Puabi escapes from the burning house of her husband Nathan she casts herself into the sea and expects, eventually, to use up all her lives and to drown. However she is fished out of the sea by a man who takes her to his island to care for her. Matthew Fairchild is taking some time out from his work to deal with the consequences of the death of his fiance and unborn child; when he meets Puabi he is shocked by her physical similarity to his dead fiance Gabriella, although their natures could not be more different. The two talk, spar and eventually uncover their secrets, although Matthew doesn't of course believe Puabi is really a Sumerian Queen who's over four thousand years old. When Matthew's Personal Assistant tries to kill them they both discover a shocking secret and Puabi is given another chance to atone for her sins.This story started off reasonably enough and I was interested to see how the author would deal with the fact that her heroine is incredibly anti-heroic, having killed lots of people, including two in the previous story. However I was rather disappointed that this aspect of Puabi's nature wasn't really discussed, just that Puabi was having a fresh start. The events towards the end of this story were too far fetched to enable this reader to really go along with it and I felt it was all rather a cop-out."},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"As I didn't pay attention to the number of pages, I was shocked at how small the book was. It says 96 pages, but is actually only 84 in reading. But, short story or not, it was a great read! I thought it might be too far fetched, too sci-fi to be a romance as well, but Shayne made the characters very believable. Can't wait to read more of her books!"},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"This is the first book I've read from Shayne's witch series. I wasn't expecting it to be a short story. It's actually 84 pages long. Needless to say I finished it in one evening. It was sweet and sappy like most romances are. What I didn't like about it was the fact that they fell in love with each other almost immediately. Reguardless of the fact that she was a total B***H to him. It was just sooooooo over the top. And then when she admitted to killing (and I don't mean just one-I'm talking lots) he seemed okay with that because he felt he murdered his wife because he didn't pay enough attention to her. Oh, boohoo!Sorry, but I think weakness is lame."},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"This is the second book I've read by this author so far, and I plan to order several more of her books soon - they are that good!Maggie Shayne's books tend to be a mixture of romance, mystery & the paranormal - she is able to seamlessly bring these concepts together into a storyline that sucks the reader in effortlessly.Immortality is about a young man grieving the loss of his pregnant wife, and a woman who could be his late-wife's twin that he finds barely alive in the ocean near his island estate. Could they really be long-lost twins?His wife had killed herself, and he believes she did this because he didn't give her the attention she needed - all he cared about was his business... So he is still guilt-ridden when he finds this woman in the sea.Matthew (the young man) rescues the woman, and attempts to care for her - noticing with each hour that she isn't a \\"normal\\" human... But what could she be? She speaks of being a queen from a far-off land that no longer exists, and she acts as if she expects to be waited on, as if she is royalty - but these ramblings/actions must just be delusions, brought on by her lengthy exposure in the sea - right?After fighting the feelings for a while, of course these two fall in love, but now it looks as if she's dying as well. She talks of being an immortal witch - a dark one - but if that is so (and he isn't ready to believe that it could be), then how could she be dying - and why is she dying?There is much more to the story, but I don't want to say too much - as I don't want to ruin it for you. Suffice it to say that this is a definite page-turner - one you won't be able to put down!"},{"Title":"Immortality","review":"If you've ready any of Maggie Shayne's Immortal witch stories - this is a must ready. It tells the story of Puabi the dark witch mentioned in earlier books."},{"Title":"Irene Dunne: First Lady of Hollywood (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series)","review":"For the exhorbitant price of $45.00 and higher, I expected a nice coffee-table style book chronicling Dunne's career and her life as well, loaded with pictures. This is not what I received.What I received was a 178 page synopsis style of Dunne's non-scandalous life (rare for a Hollywood star...she was married to the same man for 45 years!! Amen to that...refreshing...) devoted to her family, a jewel to work with, and never gave a bad performance. Along with Barbara Stanwyck she was the best actress never to have received an academy award (she was nominated five times).However, the author skims over Dunne's life, briefly analyzes the periods of her career and says almost nothing of Dunne's later years!! There Are a few pictures in the middle insert...but none of Dunne as a child or as a mature woman.Irene Dunne was a classy lady who deserves better than what she gets here...a tepid, rushed biography (which doesn't even include a dust jacket) finely printed on glossy paper with the high price that is just not worth it. I'm sorry I bought it as I really learned nothing new about Dunne that I didn't already know. This book is acceptable at perhaps $7.95. $45.00??? Ridiculous! Trust me!"},{"Title":"Irene Dunne: First Lady of Hollywood (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series)","review":"If you want a university style thesis on Irene Dunne, then you will be happy with this highly priced book. It is analytical as one might expect from an academic but the author has failed to make a story out of it. This makes for a very tedious read. Dunne was a model citizen and there are so many aspects of her public life beyond her prolific film careeer which are of interest. The content simply is not here. It is indicative of the academic approach that each chapter contains a lengthy index which is of almost no interest to the reader. Such Indices are better left at the end. The author also has the annoying habit of itemising things which give the feeling that the book was compiled from a series of dot points instead of a smooth flow of text. Finally, illustrations are scarce and this always contributes to a \\"dry\\" read. One plus, however, is that the book has been published in a nice hardback edition (minus dustcover) and an easy size to handle.Overall, Margie Shultz, in her bio-bibliography of Dunne, does a much better and simpler job. In fact, I would say the biography of Irene Dunne is yet to be written."},{"Title":"Irene Dunne: First Lady of Hollywood (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series)","review":"I think this book is excellent for students and people who are discovering the world of classic Hollywood. It goes into detail without getting \\"too personal\\". Please realize that this book is intended for educational purposes (although it is entertaining at points about her life).If anyone wants to know more about Irene Dunne personally, then you should start collecting old movie magazines from the 1930s to the present. Otherwise, I would recommend this piece of well-written art, to anyone who is willing to learn about a great actress and a great human-being! Thanks for your tribute to Irene, Prof. Gehring. Since she didn't write a book herself, there are lots of us fans who really appreciate your hard work (not to mention how envious we are that you got to talk to her). We commend you!"},{"Title":"Irene Dunne: First Lady of Hollywood (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series)","review":"This is a lovely book about a woman who certainly did her best in her field and private life. She was indeed unique as one can easily tell when watching her wonderful films....old and well as the later ones.I think the author did a wonderful job researching his subject. I wanted more and didn't want the story to end. Thank you."},{"Title":"Irene Dunne: First Lady of Hollywood (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series)","review":"The author did a good job including as much as possible about her life before, during and after movies. But Irene Dunne was a lady. There is truly nothing to write about. She is one of the very few that had a nearly perfect career and life. And she is everything you'd expect her to be based on her roles in pictures. I don't see what everyone is complaining about, do they want the author to make up scandals to keep it interesting? The book is only boring if you don't like Irene. And that is not possible."},{"Title":"Boat Building","review":"For anyone interested in wooden boat construction, this book is a must. Even if you have built small boats in the past and think you know what you're doing, you can learn from this book. His methods are timeless and lack the \\"quick and easy\\" that has seemed to creep into the boat building world. If you want to build a boat WELL, read Chapelle."},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"My girlfriend bought me this book for my birthday and I couldn't wait to get started on it because I'm a huge Pumpkins and Corgan fan. After about the fifth page I was already disappointed. I could hardly stand reading the author's long, drawn out, overly dramatic way of informing the reader. Every sentence felt like work to read because the author goes out of her way to try and impress with her large vocabulary and endless, dragging, dry descriptions on every single event.I couldn't agree more with all the bad reviews written before me. If you strip all the dry filler from this book you wouldn't have much left, and of that most SP fans probably know 75% of it already. Don't be fooled by the good reviews that attack the intelligence of the people criticizing this book. I understand the words the author uses, but it makes for difficult reading that doesn't flow well at all. Like I said, reading this was like work. I'm very disappointed. I've never liked/disliked a book so much that I would actually write up a review, but I don't want others out there to go through what I did and waste their (or their girlfriend's) money. You can get better information about the band by studying their lyrics and finding interviews with them online."},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"The first, and only biography I have ever read of smashing pumpkins, and the worst biography I've ever read by anyone. Hanson over-utilises long words and skirts around even the slightest hint of any member of the band's private life in a bid to appear intellectual and inoffensive. In actual fact this only serves to irritate the reader. The photo section is the only real piece of green in this boring concrete patchwork, but even that is thin and devoted to the gish days. Although hanson clearly has a respect and perhaps a love of the pumpkins, her over-egging of songs like I am One and Siva is annoying. The real fault of the book though is its effort to appeal to indie kids who think they're clever, but even they would probably hate this clinical trash. I don't normally write amazon reviews, in fact this is only my second, but any prospective fan thinking of buying this book should look towards the mellon collie or adore CDs. Don't buy this, if you see a good review of this book, the person who wrote it was bribed. This is long, boring, irritating and over-intellectual with no real let up."},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"This is quite possibly the most horrendously God-awful biography I have ever read. Granted, I appreciate the author's brave efforts to encapsulate the Smashing Pumpkins career, but I believe she is not a fan - and maybe even despises them. Regardless, I gave this book the great benefit of the doubt, hoping all through it that it would improve. I thought redundant, senseless ramblings couldn't fill up an ENTIRE book - WRONG! Once I reached page 164 I decided it was time to start jumping through paragraph through dry paragraphs seeking even the smallest tad-bit of information that would stimulate my interest.Amy Hanson takes you through the Smashing Pumpkins career, but she also takes you down and through rocky, dirt-road detours where her words become the hot dust in the air making you cough. If it was her goal to make the Smashing Pumpkins the dullest topic one could read about, she is the most successful author ever. Hopefully a true fan with the superior thinking and writing skills required to write a biography on the best band of the 90's will create a real bio - one the fans can celebrate and one that the band deserves.I would recommend this beast only to the die-hardest of pumpkin smashers. Anyone else would be turned off from the band and should check out the SP's online community/FAQ's/Bios before spending money on this brick of pretentious, arrogant prose.Highlight: the killer black and white pictures in the center of the book & the discography at the end"},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"Given the lack of Smashing Pumpkins biographies that exist in print, I approached this book with enthusiasm. However, this feeling evaporated within the first couple of chapters. Although I agree that it's important to understand the context in which the Pumpkins' music was created, I quickly found myself skipping over the author's self-indulgent and frankly boring examinations of topics that should have remained marginal at best. More disappointing was the fact that these tangents were at the expense of any in-depth study of the personal influences behind the music - surely a band biography cannot completely detach the musicians from their music? Not wishing to pry into an individual's private business is admirable, but the emotive aspects of the Smashing Pumpkins' story are part of their appeal. However, this has largely been ignored in this book, and instead it is comprised of dry chronological information that displays little passion or enthusiasm for the band. I don't feel that I know any more about how the music was written or what the inspiration for it was. The author doesn't offer an opinion or even a description of most of the songs. There is surely an interesting biography of Smashing Pumpkins waiting to be written; sadly, this is not it."},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"This book is disappointing, very disappointing indeed. Firstly, there are not many pictures of the band, the pic on the front cover could have been better too. Worse still though, the writer seems to get sidetracked too often, her sentences are quite long at times and she has a habit of using fancy words that some fans (no offence anyone) would not understand. Recommended only for true Pumpkins, otherwise I personally wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"I bought this book with the highest expectations, as there are no real biographies of The Smashing Pumpkins out there. What I found was a book that tries to compensate for subject matter by going into overblown, wordy digressions that are completely subjective. More research on the Pumpkins would have revealed some key elements far more interesting than Hanson's interpretations of events. For example, why not mention Corgan's battle with Chicago Sun-Times critic Jim Derogatis during the Siamese Dream days and into the Mellon Collie era? How can you miss that the band played three sold out nights at the Metro to start off the Siamese Dream tour? How can one not mention that the songs for Adore were written between periods of writer's block (the book suggests that the songs flowed out freely)? Our author even misses a song title, printing \\"The Impending Voice\\" instead of \\"The Imploding Voice\\" (from Machina), and stuff like that bugs the crap out of me. It appears to me that the book is poorly researched and even more poorly edited (irritating comma splices everywhere). The author is clearly not a music buff, possibly not a real fan, and not much of a journalist. The only saving grace to this book is the coverage of the Adore and Machina periods."},{"Title":"Smashing Pumpkins: Tales of a Scorched Earth","review":"This is the first, and only (that I know of) biography on the band. The book itself is good and covers much of the formation, keys gigs, singles and other elements. Like past reviewers have said it does make you wanna play the singles as you read, and provides alot of details. However at times the author does become to descriptive on some events and occurances, and it would have been better to cover more, perhaps with a bit less descriptive elements. I was a bit dissapointed, because alot of the end of the book is simply drawn from specials and shows that any serious fan would have already seen or heard. The earlier sections are good though and give a lot of insight into the bands quick rise, and all that came with it. Overall the book was good, but not perfect. I would recommend it more so to those who no little about the Pumpkins, but also to avid fans."},{"Title":"Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics","review":"Yearning is comprised of a series of essays, which identify, dissect, and communicate cultural politics with a focus on the world's lack of focus towards black women. Various overlooked and underrepresented groups in the media and world literature are given a voice too. Stereotypes and cultural ignorance is dealt with thoroughly. Not only does the author shoot down the upper-class white heterosexual male icon, she analyzes mentally, statistically and historically oppressed peoples own misgivings. All the while, the book is entertaining. bell hooks has a straight forward approach that forces one to look past his-story's rhetoric and recognize truths. hooks writes for those with a vocabulary, so if that's what you lack, grab Webster and learn a few words as you gain insight and recognition on cultural politics."},{"Title":"Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics","review":"~ there are books that one reads and remembers,there are others that become family members; books that stay with one throughout longines of suffering;words from the author stoicly holding up the soul when one doesn't have the strength~ this book lives by my nightstand; the words from bell hooks essay, \\"Choosing the margin,\\"found me when i was an undergraduate and struggling; struggling with figuring out how to writethe truth;moreso; how exactly to write the truth in front of everybody; how to look people in the eye; and still,write the truth; it is a painful undertaking; this writing of the truth in front of everybody; this essaywill teach a writer more than any lecture on learning to live withinthe safe language space; it will speak to the intellectual who is figuring out still,how to say it;the truth;how to make it look good and feel good and taste good; there is no way to do this; and in a radicalchess move, ms. hooks writes as if to say there is a better way to keep the flame of your soul alivelearn to reside within the margin space ; learn to live within the group, by living on the outside, refuse tostepinside the circle ; refuseto become one who agrees to everything ; stay here in this radical space ; thismargin ; will sustain you ; by living within the margin ; this is where you will begin to thrive ;call bell hooks radical call her racist call her what you will but she too, has mastered living in the marginsand this is where she will thrive and survive this is the great open radical space where no one can touch her ;she is ultimatelyone of the worlds purest formsof greatness ;i admire her ; and i cherishnearly every single thing she ever writes ;"},{"Title":"Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics","review":"Being substantially outside of Bell Hooks' target audience, I confess a certain amount of difficulty in hearing what she has to say. Frankly, I had to read this book twice in order to get past her offensive terminology. \\"Whiteness\\" is the foundational problem for Hooks, and it leads to racism, colonization, and \\"oppressive structures of domination.\\"It is possible that Hooks uses inflammatory language with intention. Her overarching purpose seems to be to rekindle black solidarity in order to complete movement toward racial freedom and equality. This goal is laudable, but I find it easier to support Hooks when she rephrases this goal outside of racial class conflict. She advocates for control of one's destiny, self-actualization, community, and integrity of being, but she does not seem to realize that these are the yearnings of all humanity, not simply American blacks.American culture, perhaps every human culture, is hierarchical. Even whites must deal with the \\"oppression\\" of those higher in the structure. Continued fracturing of middle and lower levels of the social structure along racial lines merely diffuses the power innate to each social class. Coalitions across racial, religious, and ethnic barriers are needed to compete with the hegemonic power of the social elites. Hooks passionate voice may actually work to maintain the secondary status of black Americans by making such coalitions more difficult.I find two additional inconsistencies in Hooks message. First, she advocates solidarity and self-actualization, but I cannot help but wonder if these two goals can be harmonized. Secondly, I believe she is guilty of baseline distortion in her assumption of hopelessness as the black cultural norm. This implied victimization is self-defeating, and seems to deny the tremendous advances black Americans have made educationally and economically in the last twenty years.It is possible that America needs to be continually confronted lest we become complacent in the progress we have made toward an egalitarian ideal. If so, Hooks' voice should be heard. But make no mistake about it, Hooks is not a voice of calm reason and balanced reflection. She writes from the fringes where ideals shine so brightly that the merest hint of a blemish is magnified."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Reading","review":"The book itself is terrific.

Cris Mazza grew up in southern California outside of San Diego as one of five children, but, as she makes clear from the first page, she is not a stereotypical Californian. She is not blonde, does not surf, has no interest in acting. Her California is a gritty terrain - scrubby land populated by ant lions, bird dogs, and sand crabs. The daughter of educators by vocation and scavengers by avocation, she grew up hunting, clamming at the beach, searching through the landfill for soda bottles to redeem for spending money, and playing with and studying the indigenous creatures she encountered. Her views on ecology come from knowing both the before and the after, and by attempting to understand the forces that come into play. But Mazza is not an environmentalist; she is a fiction writer who has set out to share the complexity of her experiences. In these personal essays, Mazza uses her life as a touchstone to pose questions we should all be asking. In the chapter on her failed marriage to a San Diego symphony musician, she explores the reasons behind - as well as the repercussions of - America's view on the arts. As she discusses both her mother's stroke and her own volunteer work in the children's wing of a nursing home, she poignantly evokes the difficult role of being a caregiver while exploring what it means when the body cannot perform the most basic of human activities - walking and talking. She conjures up her preteen days of wanting to be a boy in the 1970's when the male gender seemed to have all the fun and advantages. She writes of raising her Shetland sheepdogs to be champion show dogs, thus examining the intricate relationship between humans and animals. All the essays are punctuated by black-and-white photographs of Mazza and her family. These images serve as anchors to Mazza's writing; they add to the atmosphere and wonder of what is written within these pages.Mazza writes with clear-eyed passion for her subject matter. Under her touch, ordinary subject matter becomes extraordinary. Her story contains none of the sensationalist topics of many high-profile memoirs; instead, it revels in the quiet details of an unconventional life. This book is exactly what a memoir should be: intimate, intelligent, and thought-provoking. Certainly fans of Mazza's fiction should read INDIGENOUS to understand the background from which her stories and novels spring. However, even those without a familiarity of her work will enjoy Mazza's stories about growing up in rural California and then taking that experience into a much larger world."},{"Title":"Thirteen Tangos for Stravinsky","review":"Catholic Library World reviews in March 2001:This moving collection of memoirs, told in thirteen stories, each a dance in time and space, recounts the author's turbulent journey from Costa Rica to Los Angeles and the painful challenges facing an immigrant youngster in the 30s and 40s, a period that still retained some innocence. Cardona-Hine's coming-of-age story reveals a boy's first experiences with English, his infatuations with American girls, and the pain of high school bullying and otherness. After Pearl Harbor, the family flees to Mexico, seeking a home, wanting to belong somewhere. Feeling more alone there than in California, they return to the United States where they rent an apartment in their home to a series of pathetic individuals: Jews escaping from Europe, a young couple in love who fall out of love, a Frenchman who dies upon learning of the taking of Paris. Surrounded by people experiencing human tragedies, but living in the warmth and fruitfulness of California,they manage to survive.Beautifully written poetry in prose form, Cardona-Hine's delightful reminiscences make the reader pause to admire unexpected combinations of words and images. This is a book to read slowly and to savor. Belonging to the genre of memoir and bildungsroman, this series of stream-of-consciousness meanderings through a time gone by, creates a mood that only approximates reality."},{"Title":"Conflict of Laws: Cases-Comments-Questions (American Casebook Series)","review":"This is a great book (in my admittedly biased opinion) but please be aware there's a new 7th edition available as of August 21, 2006."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"Raymond Benson creats another exciting adventure.

I have read other R. Benson books that were good but this is plain garbage.It is such a rip off to \\"You Only Live Twice\\" for the romance. If you recall in the movie perhaps the book too but it's been sooooooo long since I read it:-), James falls for a girl, she gets killed and beds the next girl he works with in Japan (again). Plus she is only 20 years old. Give me a break! Bond is old enough to be her father. The storyline is hard to follow and you never have an understanding for the villian and why he acts the way he does. It is violent and bloody to read. Best advice, reread one of Ian Fleming's books like I plan to reread \\"You Only Live Twice\\"."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"It's a sad commentary on how corporations can annoint someone a best-selling author, complete with promotion accounts, regardless of whether the writer is any good at all.This book shows how consistently cliche, weak, and predictable Benson's Bond series remains. Ian Fleming could describe masterfully yet stay brief. Benson imitates this by describing every detail of a hotel lobby, thinking this makes it descriptive writing. It doesn't.The plot itself is predictable and formulated with all the usual characters to drag it along.Don't waste your money on this pap, even if you're looking for a light beach read. There are countless others to choose from, starting with Fleming's original work, soon to be reissued."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"It's best not to think about the Bond literary franchise any longer. I truly believe that Ian Fleming would have died again had he heard that a fanboy took his famed character and cheapened him so.The sad part is, I really believe that Raymond Benson tries hard with these books. And they're appalling, every one of them. That's the scary part.I did not read this book. I stopped reading Benson with the previous outing, which I couldn't even finish. I really enjoyed the Fleming Bonds, and even liked a few of the Gardners. But the decision to hire Raymond Benson remains a mystery and has killed my interest. I won't read this one, because I have no reason to believe it will be any better than the previous ones.The few things Benson does well--basically make up halfway decent stories for a Bond story--are wasted with amateur writing. Benson even went so far as to include graphic sex scenes in the books, for no particular reasons. It came off as seriously embarassing.Do not waste your time or money on any of the Benson Bond novels.Benson has apparently taken time off after this novel (which appeared in 2002.) He's dedicating his time to putting out his own, original garbage. We can only hope the management of Glidrose gets medicated and hires an actual writer again..."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"I have read every one of the Bond novels from Fleming to Benson from cover to cover. As much as I want to like Benson's, it's just an impossible task. While he has brought back the superficial connections to the Fleming character, each of his novels just reads like a mini-script, waiting for a movie to be filmed. They are the novels of Pierce Brosnan's movie-Bond, not Fleming's. I appreciate his wanting to re-inject the Fleming character's history to his novels, but it's just not enough. When will someone bring the character back to it's chronological roots in the 1950's? Really--back to where it belongs, with plots that are subtle and interesting and tie together well. With a book by book building of substance--well, as much as a fantasy spy figure can provide.Firstly, the plots. I agree with an earlier review about Ray's inability to blend fact with the story line. It does read like a \\"wait, let me unfold the tourist brochure and tell you this...\\", then a refolding of the brochure to commence with the tale. The plot in general, as with the previous novels, are written as if they're movie scenes lashed together. Each one has a slap-stick chase scene which I find abhorent to the Bond character. In another novel, Bond's inexplicably shooting a villain in the face in an elevator and then running from the police through TV sets is painful. This one has a chase through a Kubuki playhouse simply to add some description of Kubuki. Bond finally finds a key character (the prosititute) in the latter third of the story, in Sapporo, and takes her with him on a dangerous investigation of the villain's HQ. Why didn't Tanaka pick her up and allow Bond to operate on his own? If she was so important to the case, she should have been in Tanaka's custody within an hour. When Bond's female partner and love interest doesn't make it past the latter third of the story, Bond forgets his anguish later on and beds the prostitute (as the earlier reviewer mentioned, he had already seen her as a chld-figure--so how did this change take place?) The dwarf is captured so easily after previous vicious battles, it seemed as if Benson just wanted to get rid of him quickly. Most obviously, is that with all this knowledge uncovered about mosquito-carrying virus being targeted for the G8 conference...do you really think the security services of those countries would have permitted the President, the Prime Minister, and other leaders to even step foot in Japan? The plot's major weakness was in having the conference continue to take place in a location identified as having an obvious breech in security. He should have figured out how to be more realistic, yet still involving the story line.The characterization of Bond is again dissapointing. Bond is consistantly portrayed as a bit of a shallow, comic character--he seems to have learned nothing from his past exploits, he's easily deceived, his physical prowess is usually less than it should be. Benson had a terrific idea with this novel--bring him back to a significant time in his past and retrace some steps. This would have been great had he also extended the revisit from \\"You Only Live Twice\\" to \\"Moonraker\\" as well. What I mean by that is I found Fleming's Bond in Moonraker to be an extremely lonely, melancholic figure. The solitary \\"knight\\" who has no friends and sacrifices all for the good of his country. The last scene in Fleming's Moonraker was perhaps the most powerful in all the Bond novels. Benson had a wonderful opportunity to end this novel in the same way. He lost his love interest to violence, it dredged up all the old ghosts (I must point out here, though, that Bond reacts to the death of his love interest by selfishly lamenting about how it could be happening to HIM again, when the woman was the one who died--no thought to the poor victim, just to himself, not a very noble reaction for Benson's Bond). Ray had the great opportunity to end the story not with another cinematic bedding of a prostitute (that he had earlier seen as a child figure), but as the figure of solitude stepping out on the teeming streets of Tokyo, sad, alone, walking back into the faceless crowds of people, continuing his lonely, faceless existance. While not the bang-up action ending that accompanies the Brosnan movies, it would have been a true nod toward the Fleming Bond.You see, bringing back characters and names is not the way to honor Fleming's Bond. That is much too superficial. Bringing back the characterization of the true James Bond would have been the ultimate salute. It's time for someone to put Bond back where he belongs in a novelization (I've given up hope for it in the movies)--in his correct time period, with the REAL Bond character, not Pierce Brosnan. As a hint, I'd advise Ray to view the old \\"Danger Man\\" episodes with Patrick McGoohan. That was the closest to the Fleming atmosphere and characterization. Just place Sean Connery or McGoohan's face where Ray has Brosnan's. I continue to lament for Fleming's lost James Bond. I hope some day he will return."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"It's obvious that Mr. Benson is a huge fan of James Bond, but somewhere along the lines someone should have realized that simply being a fan doesn't qualify him to continue the James Bond legacy in print. While his non-fiction works on James Bond are fairly good, his novels, unfortunately, are not. They are simply dozens of cliches combined with references to older Bond books, all tied together with what I must simply label very poor writing. Mr. Benson's dialogue is flat, unrealistic, and occasionally ridiuclous. His characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic. His prose is stilted and uninteresting. I really wanted to like his Bond books, but after several attempts, I realized that I had assigned myself an impossible mission.I have read all of Fleming and Gardener's books multiple times, but nearly put Benson's books down in the middle simply from lack of interest. His stab at revitalizing the James Bond series was a worthy attempt, but unfortunately a failed one. I would recommend simply re-reading Fleming or Gardener if you have a taste for more Bond in print."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"As I close the back cover of yet another Raymond Benson book, I weep knowing that the quality of descriptive prose embodied in the books of Fleming, Amis, and (to some extent) Gardner, is now lost. I admire Mr. Benson because his great love of Bond keeps the literary franchise going but perhaps, as a director of the Ian Fleming Foundation, he should ask other writers to submit a few chapters of their own Bond novel ideas, and see if there is a writer out there that can bring back the literary Bond I love.The Man With The Red Tattoo's climax features the Mosquitoe Magnet, a simple device that is now sold in Home Depot stores, and should have been turned on during the conference, not AFTER people were bitten. Anyone with any knowledge of that device would have had it running before, during, and after the conference; though designed for outdoor use, a way could've been found to integrate that into the story.Mr. Benson is a screenwriter at heart. Unfortunately, screenplays are written in third-person limited and novels are entirely different. Read any Fleming novel, study his descriptive narrative, the thoughts that run through Bond's head, the dialogue, the building of the plot; that is how a good novel is written. I've read all of Mr. Benson books. In interviews he sounds like a very nice, decent person. But picking up where Fleming, Amis, and Gardner left off is not Mr. Benson's strong suit. One man's humble opinion."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"This is not one of Benson's best, neither is it among his worst. I find all of his Bond's far superior to John Gardner's and so inferior to Ian Fleming's that no comparison is just. Mistakes like having someone major in business at Oxford bother me alot. I do not enjoy reading tour guide excerpts much either. It moved quickly enough not to be boring, but the ending was truncated and very disappointing. Some of the scenes were interesting. I do not blame Benson per se, Bond is not a plausible figure out of his necessary historical period.I confess to being a purist. I suggest reading, or rereading, the Fleming books if one wants the authentic Bond. The first four films are good too."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"In this latest literary incarnation of Bond, Benson has 007 traveling to Japan where he does battle with elements of the Japanese underground. These criminals prefer the old ways of Japan's past and will do anything to force a return to a fundamental way of life. Along the way Bond meets the usual pretty woman or two. The plot includes the sinister plan to use a biological weapon on unsuspecting civilians.I found this novel to be an easy read, just perfect for a warm day or two on a beach (I read it in cold Missouri). Characters were fully developed, and as in all Benson novels everything was well done. The settings in Japan were obviously well researched, much detail here. The only reason I took one star off of my review was due to the fact that, in my opinion, we need a Bond novel that is less predictable, where Bond does'nt prevail, where Bond does'nt get the girl, sort of like real life. Imagine the possibilities here, almost endless. Regardless of this criticism, this novel is still excellent."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"The idea of taking bond back to Japan was excellent as was the bits of info on Japanese culture. However, the novel was less than thrilling. Bond is written as a physically weak character which is not consistent with his reputation. The sex scenes are boring and the action slow. The 2nd battle with the dwarf was insulting to the reader after their fight in the Casseopia tunnel. Also, where were the gadgets, car chases, etc.? The novel does, in fact, read like a Japanese tourist brochure. Way too much detail! This is not Bond at his best. Mr. Benson, please bring back the Bond we love!"},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"Raymond Benson usually writes fast-paced novels that are easy to read. This novel is good, but is slow moving and tedious at points. If the reader can get past that, they ensure themselves a good read. If you are Bond fan, you enjoy rich detail, or if you enjoy a good read THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO is a must have.James Bond has been given an assignment to babysit the prime minister at a G8 conference in Japan. Meanwhile, he is to investigate the death of an English businessman. This investigation will take Bond on a slow journey all over Japan, and ultimately a good one. Bond fans know that 007 has deep emotional roots in Japan, and can appreciate Benson's choice of Japan as a locale for the novel. The addition of Bond's old friend Tiger Tanaka is also quite welcomed.Benson's writing has a few flaws this go around. It is slow moving and tedious at times. This is a direct contradiction from Benson's usual style. Also, it is obvious that Benson tries to write as an English author would. Sometimes, he fails in that quest with words like \\"stuff\\" and \\"whatever\\". However, it must be said that you are immersed in Japanese culture as you read and the vilain's motivations are chillingly genuine. That being said, if you enjoy good reads, buy Benson's THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO today."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"Since the days of Ian Fleming, James Bond has been spying on England's enemies, and shooting those who prove dangerous and elusive. He also, of course, seduces beautiful women (the only ones he seems to encounter) and uses cute gadgets with which he can defeat the villains. All of these elements are included in this entry in the James Bond saga, written by Raymond Benson this time.This time around, Bond is sent to Japan to look over the situation there in preparation for the G8 conference, which the British Prime Minister is scheduled to attend. When Bond arrives in Japan, he finds that an old enemy, Goro Yoshida, is apparently planning a nefarious attack on the G8, and has some diabolical weapons to deploy.The James Bond series has been going along for many years now, and it seems to have lost most of its uniqueness and interest, at least with me. These days, it's silly that he smokes, and stupid that he carries a Walther PPK (everyone else carries a 9mm.). The beautiful women seem like an endless parade, and the villains seem almost by the numbers. In this case, the villain is fun, but Bond himself is sort of silly, two-dimensional, and uninteresting. Frankly, I think this will be the last James Bond novel I read, unless I go back and reread some of the earlier stuff."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":". See storyline above.Raymond Benson's version of 007 is adequate. This time 007, in order to save the world, must find a deadly virus. This virus is a highly altered version of the West Nile virus.Benson takes you through the beautiful country of Japan and its nearby provinces. You'll learn about the Japanese mafia. You'll be intrigued by some unusual customs practiced their. This was a bare bones thriller. Fast-paced and quick to read.Recommended for the hardcore Bond fan"},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"In an era of contrived attempts to \\"personalize\\" Bond's missions or \\"peal back the layers\\" of Bond's psyche, it's refreshing to have a straightforward Bond-on-a-dangerous-assignment-in-an-exotic-locale adventure, and that's what Raymond Benson delivers in THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO, his best stand alone Bond thriller to date. This time, Mr. Bond, it ISN'T personal. Halleluiah! Even the return of the Walther PPK seems to be Benson's way of saying, \\"Let's just use what has always worked and enough with the self-conscious 'updating' of the character.\\" In this way I think RED TATTOO is well ahead of the curve (and just reinforces the fact that Benson is the best of all the post-Fleming Bond authors).But a straightforward plot doesn't mean RED TATTOO is lacking complexity of character. Just the opposite is true. Japan holds dark memories for Bond, and that aspect is not ignored. Whereas John Gardner might have given a passing reference to Bond's legendary ordeal in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, Benson uses the \\"ghosts\\" of Bond's past as a full-fledged complication. Fans will not be disappointed in how Benson weaves elements of the Fleming masterpiece into this current book, nor will they be disappointed in the action. Gunfights and fistfights abound in RED TATTOO. It's probably Benson's most violent book to date -- the body count is quite high -- but this seems to be in keeping with the Asian action movie milieu the book frequently evokes. The methodology of the villain's master plan is ingenious and is the best conceived caper we've had, book or film, in quite some time. And speaking of films, have I mentioned that RED TATTOO would make an amazing Bond movie? Well, it would.For the seasoned Bond fan THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO is the perfect book at the perfect time. For those who have yet to read a Benson book and are looking for a classic cocktail of Bondian action, suspense, and exotic locales, you would be well advised to start right here."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"I've recently been reading the original Ian Fleming 007 books, and since I have to wait till February for the last two I thought I'd see what the other authors had to offer to the series. So I went to my local book store and found Raymond Benson's \\"The Man With The Red Tattoo.\\" I thought this would be a good read because A. I like the character of Tiger Tanaka (from You Only Live Twice), and B. The dragon on the cover was badass. Anyway I've read to Chapter 7, and it's like torture. Benson writes this book the way I would write a high school term paper(i.e. trying to fill space). He tries to make ties with previous bond books but this is a pithy display of the authors knowledge of Bond trivia. The dialogue is horrible and the descriptions go on and on. The characters act nothing like they should, and James Bond's IQ seems to have been dropped to about Jinx level. In my opinion if you want to read a James Bond novel opt for the Ian Fleming books. If you want to torture yourself, or are a fan of the past two 007 movies feel free to read this book about Bond fighting West Nile virus."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"This book is more Nihon merchanise description and expensive vacation video than a story.

All of Benson's Bond novels are fast-paced and exciting, but this one may break the mold. Benson is at his most descriptive here with Bond's first visit to Japan since &quot;You Only Live Twice,&quot; and, like in that Fleming book, the reader learns a great deal about Japanese culture. But travelogue aside, it's a cracking good story with a terrific plot. This one is definitely worthy of filming. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"Unfortunately Raymond Benson continues to prove it was a mistake for him to be appointed the official \\"James Bond\\" author as he delivers yet another novel that starts well but turns out to be a lacklustre adventure. The old problems come home to roost - too many weak characters, too many plot flaws, and not nearly enough exciting action to keep the story moving. Also this time Benson, who is usually as faithful to the cinematic version of Bond as he is to the literary one, makes some odd errors. Bond is once more armed with his Walther PPK, which from professional experience I personally think is a good thing, but of course 007 was rearmed with a Walther P99 in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" and has carried one ever since - so why the sudden change back now ?!! And the character of \\"Q\\" (aka \\"Major Boothroyd\\") was clearly written out in the last movie, \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" 1999, yet he is still in charge of his department here. Surely it makes sense for Benson to get in step and retire this character as well ?!! Another curious flaw is that Benson, who prides himself on knowing Fleming's Bond inside out, has 007 ending up in bed with a prostitute. Now according to the back story of Bond he had an affair with a prostitute in his teenage years which ended badly. Ever since he has had a loathing for those in the profession, so the idea of him romancing one seems highly unlikely. As with his previous novel Benson also brings back another character from Fleming's day - \\"Tiger Tanaka\\" from \\"You Only Live Twice\\" - but typically ages the man while Bond of course remains ageless. Again I have to say that for me this weakens the credibility of the plot, but at least he didn't ruin or arbitrarily kill off the character as he did with \\"Draco\\" in \\"Never Dream Of Dying\\". As for the overall story it is surprisingly lightweight and unoriginal. Genetically engineered viruses have almost become the 21st century equivalent of the nuclear bomb threats of the 20th century - oh how times have changed !!! - but even in the old days Fleming dealt with this topic in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", and Alistair Maclean also did a great job with this theme in his novel \\"Satan Bug\\". Somehow pitting James Bond, the world's greatest secret agent, against a killer dwarf (*shades of the film \\"The Man With The Golden Gun\\" 1974) and deadly mosquitoes, seems to be pushing things just a bit. So another somewhat disappointing effort from Mr. Benson, reasonably well written but clearly full of bugs !!!"},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"For those of us who got to know James Bond through the pages of Ian Fleming's novels, we know that character isn't in the films, and was never, ever, on even one page of John Gardner's books. Thank goodness Raymond Benson has brought him back to life again, and in this new novel his character is emphasized as he travels to Japan, a country fraught with many vivid memories for him to face up to (see; the novel, \\"You Only Live Twice\\"). In the James Bond literary tradition, in addition to being an exciting action story the novel also serves as window into this fascinating foreign culture. The book is filled with memorable, multi-dimensional characters, the best yet. It's well paced, building to a satisfying climax with excellent set pieces and battles along the way. The 007 novels have always been more grounded than the movies, and James Bond's humanity comes through on every page of this intriguing, macabre adventure."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"Raymond Benson's James Bond series is excellent, despite what the nay-sayers tell you. He has a handle on the character and I truly feel as if it's Fleming's Bond that he's writing about. &quot;The Man With the Red Tattoo&quot; is a thrilling read with a timely plot (involving West Nile Virus) and some very suspenseful sequences. The &quot;travelogue&quot; aspects of the Bond novels have always been an important part and Benson applies his with aplomb. You'll learn some things about Japan while you read it but it does not detract from the exciting story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"This is Benson's worst effort and I don't recommend it to anyone but the most ardent James Bond fans (which I am one.) It took me three weeks to plow through this slow, meandering thrillless thriller.Gore Yoshida, the man with the red tattoo, is planning to unleash a biological attack of the West Nile virus against the western world and leaders at the G8 summitt. Bond is sent to Japan where he investigates the death of a British citizen and his Japanese family.I'll now run through the problems I've had with this book. Benson is not a good enough author to include details of fact with the story. Instead he separates the two. Benson will devote several paragraphs describing scenery or Japanese culture or the biology of mosquitoes. Then he will get back to the action. Good authors incorporate the description with the story so the reader isn't bored by mundane details.Second, the Japanese culture is a big problem. Benson is obviously proud of all the things he learned about Japan, and he lets us know everything he knows. Probably one hundred times, Benson describes something using the Japanase term, then uses a sentence to say what it means in English. This gets to be boring. Other authors can write about foreign cultures without making them as exciting as a textbook.The plot itself wasn't that exciting. Bond made many stupid comments instead of the usual wit. Also, Benson makes a big point of telling us about Mauimi (sp) Mcmahon, a twenty year old prostitute. Bond comments on how young she is and refers to her as a little girl many times. Then by the end, Bond is sleeping with her. Fifty year old Bond sleeping with a twenty year old. Not that big a deal except Benson made the point that Bond looked at her as a little girl, not a potential lover.Another thing that bugged me is the British spelling (I guess its British) of all these words. Can't their be two versions of one novel?I don't know why this book grated on me so much. I've enjoyed most of all of Benson's novels. This one just lacked in so many areas."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"If you haven't read Benson, you haven't read Bond!

Read and enjoy. I did."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"The mini review prehaps says it best &quot;a plot of such monstrous proportions that it could only have been hatched in the mind of a madman.&quot;Not that I'm calling Raymond a madman, mind you! But the villians plot is one of the best ever in a Bond book. The location descriptions I felt at first were a bit padded, but I realized how much they make Japan part of the plot. It IS a different culture that Bond is experiencing and Benson explores that part of it really well. There is a reference to the events(very, very briefly) of 9/11, and I can't help feeling that was a last minute addition.There is also reference and people from the Fleming book &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, Bonds' last foray into Japan. As usual, Raymond has to carefully dance around the time issue - Time has past and characters are older, but Bond is still around 42.While it's not the best that Benson has written (I still think his last book is better than this one), it's damn close. Buy it, read it.Now, if only Putnum would do something about the boring US covers!"},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. This book had me gripping the covers from the moment I began until the second I finished it. It's fast-paced, interesting, and exciting.

At about the same time near Tokyo, Kyoto's parents and her older sister also die. In England, the coroner believes that Kyoko died from a strand of West Nile disease, but only ten times deadlier than the normal strain.James Bond attends the G8 summit in Japan to provide added protection to his country's leadership. He also investigates the deaths of the McMahon family, as the patriarch was a Scottish citizen and the CEO of a powerful pharmaceutical firm. Bond prefers not to return to Japan as he has bad memories though he appreciates the grace and beauty of the women. He soon works with his old friend Tiger Tanaka and agent Reiko Tamura in a race against a doomsday clock. Japanese Mafia Yami Shogun Goro Yoshida plots an end to western domination especially kicking America off his beloved nation's soil through a strand of virus that makes the deaths of the McMahon seem slow and gentle.THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO is the best of the neo-Bond light tales. Raymond Benson returns Bond to what makes the character interesting to readers, yet humanizes 007 with his bad memories of Japan. The story line is quite exciting with global implications yet simplistic. The support cast is fun especially the return of Tiger and the villain who seems a lot like Bin Laden, as he wants the American presence off his beloved island nation. Mr. Benson makes a case that he is the heir to Mr. Fleming.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"Many reviewers have already covered the short-comings of this novel, so I'll try to bring out some aspects I observed that haven't been mentioned:This had an interesting premise of Bond going to Japan to find out what killed a mixed-race Asian girl on a flight. However, the writing becomes muddled as the author attempts to stop the action to explain a landmark, piece of hardware, or aircraft.There are no characters to latch onto, and the story seems like a forumulaic James Bond rip-off. The henchman, who resembles the Japanese folk creature, Kappa, is \\"defeated\\" very quickly when earlier we saw him as a very dangerous and quick adversary. And, the main villain - Goro Yoshida - seems to be of the type who is bad, just because we are told he is; there is no depth to the character.Too, Japan is painted as a very exotic place where everyone says \\"Hai!\\" and bows, and the women (because they are Asian, specifically Japanese) are automatically deemed beautiful...and are sexually available and willing.This is the first Raymond Benson Bond novel I've read, and I am curious of how he handles the Bond character in his other novels, which I understand are a bit better.A missed opportunity with this book, however."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"I have to admit that I'm one of those slow readers,but this book was very suprising.

However, this is not the James Bond of the many novels most recently written by Raymond Benson. He is more of a reserved gentleman albeit a ladies man, however, nowhere near the extent he is on the big screen. He also takes a heck of a pounding by the bad guys who are not quite so over the top. He is a bit less of a superman.In this installment Bond is ordered to travel to Japan to help provide security for the many world leaders at the G8 summit conference. However, he is also asked to look into the deaths of a prominent family all of whom died quite suddenly of a mysterious ailment. As Bond investigates with his friend, Tiger Tanaka, they discover a plot with a unique but potent weapon that could place many lives at risk at the G8 summit.One-dimensional characters and a plot that for much of the book plods along, make this a less than stellar entry into the Bond series. Any sense of originality that the books possessed has worn thin for many years. Yet, Bond remains a very popular hero and, with the continued success of the motion pictures, we can expect the books to keep on coming no matter who writes them."},{"Title":"Man With the Red Tattoo","review":"I enjoyed reading &quot;Tattoo&quot; because it not only provides an exciting adventure in the 007 tradition, but it includes location details that actually put the reader into the fantasy.

Nahai is the story of the Jews in Iran, and one character in particular named Peacock. Ms. Nahai did a lot of research and it rings with both historical accuracy and as well as a bit of magic realism. The story begins more than two hundred years ago when Iran was called Persia. There are harems and ghettos and child marriage. There is vast wealth and grinding poverty. People are locked into rigid social patterns that they cannot escape. Jews are treated as outcasts but yet sometimes intermarry. Cruelty is everywhere.Ms. Nahai creates her characters well; each is an individual and yet is representative of a culture and a way of life that has existed for centuries and has remained largely unexplored in western literature. We meet Esther the soothsayer and her descendents, visit marriage beds and feel the experience of a culture where a man is allowed four legal wives and hundreds of temporary wives. We see love and passion and feel great sadness.I found it difficult to read this book at times because of the constant cruelties. There was something to make me wince on almost every page. Even the wealthy were not spared. It made me wonder if perhaps the author went too far in her fervor to shock the reader. And yet, I couldn't put it down. After a while I got hardened and focused on the rich and interesting characters. And slowly but surely I began to understand the forces shaping the Iran that has emerged today.Yes.

Special in many ways - from the atmosphere, full of magic and the supernatural, through the layout, describing the fate and details of the family life, intertwining with the history of Persia (later Iran), to the choice of the Jewish minority in a Muslim country as the side from which the story is told.The book opens with the family tree, spanning six generations from 1796 to 1982, beginning with Esther the Soothsayer and Thick Pissing Isaac, in the Jewish ghetto in Esfahan, where Esther appears from nowhere and goes away like a ghost, only to haunt the generations to come.The beginning of the story is at its end, when Peacock, the old woman of 116, is imprisoned. She recalls her life and the legends of her family, starting with Esther. And from the beginning we know that all the characters will be powerful, magical and captivating. We follow the descendants of Esther through the ages. They are ordinary people, Jews without right in a Muslim country, who are regarded as dirty and unworthy, whose touch would harm the believers, relegated to rat-infested ghettos and life in poverty. Because of their position in society, however, they become an important card in the political games in Persian internal and international policy.The plot spans nearly two hundred years, but the prophecies, dreams and memories go much farther in the past, so that the reader gets a glimpse of ancient Persian myths and history from the first rulers, Cyrus and Darius, and Ismail Shah, who made Shiite Islam the national religion, and from whose times date the pogroms and repressions towards Jews in Persia. The members of Esther the Soothsayer's family tree are ordinary people, but somehow they are as important for the country, as the royal family and have an impact on the directions in Persian politics and history. On the other hand, the rulers have the strengths and weaknesses of ordinary people...The story culminates in the twentieth century, when the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi decided to modernize Persia, renamed it Iran and rapidly tried to introduce the reforms, such as banning the veil, make-up and cinema, and, importantly for the plot, stopped the discrimination of Jews, declared them equal to Muslims and opened the ghettos. The society was not ready for such brutally fast change, and so Khomeini could emerge with his counter-revolution and introduce the Shiite rule again...\\"The Cry of a Peacock\\", however, is not a political or historical novel (for those who seek great historical info on Reza Pahlavi and Khomeini, I would recommend \\"The Shah of Shahs\\" by Ryszard Kapuscinski). It is an infused with magic story of human feelings, of borders inside us, of intolerance and hatred, but also of love and mercy, that know no race or religion. This story, written in beautiful, simple yet rich prose, is colorful and changing in the light like a peacock's feather!"},{"Title":"Cry of the Peacock","review":"This is one of the most incredible books I've ever read. In fact, I've read it twice just to savor the language and re-enter the lives of Ester and Solomon the Man and all of the rest. It matters not if you are Iranian or Jewish, this book is a story for everyone. The characters don't just get under your skin, they burrow deep and fester, causing you to scratch and scrape until they burst forth in all of their beautiful splendor. PLEASE READ!"},{"Title":"Cry of the Peacock","review":"I loved the writer's style. The story was very well-paced, and there was never any part where I was yawning and resisting the urge to flick on the TV. The story of Peacock and her family are well interspersed with stories of separate (though related, plotwise) people, and actual historical facts. The only thing was (and this is also, most likely, a historical fact) that this book heaped so much misery upon its characters that after a while, it just became 'things that happened.' The impact of the book lay in the sheer weight of misfortune, rather than any single heartbreaking mishap. 9.5/10"},{"Title":"Cry of the Peacock","review":"I couldn't put the book from the time I started reading it. Following the family through several generations was fascinating, especially in the context of the different historical events in Iran. Since I do not know much about Iranian/Persian history, I cannot speak to that portion of the book. I just enjoyed the book for the story it told and the glimpse it gave into the culture for Jews during this time period."},{"Title":"Cry of the Peacock","review":"I loved Moonlight On The Avenue of Faith, so was excited to order this book.

Freeman has completed extensive research for this project. A Room at a Time is an easy to read book, with wonderful information on the Womens' Suffrage Movement, and women in the powerful place of politics. I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics","review":"As a young boy I was always fascinated with the tales of intrepid archaeologists, Schliemann at Troy or Carter in Egypt. I imagined myself accompanying them as they dramatically uncovered humanity's hidden history.Many years later as an adult I volunteered for an archaeological survey. I followed a trail of Anasazi flint chips to the top of a hill and discovered an 13th century American tool factory with a great view of the Utah high desert. Not exactly the walls of Troy or the treasures of Tutankhamen, but a source of joy and wonder neverthelessAccompanying Jo Freeman as she uncovers the hidden history of how women entered into the political parties gave me a similar sense of wonder and discovery. Her book begins with a section called \\"Myth As History\\". Freeman meticulously demolishes the convenient myth that the Suffrage Movement \\"failed\\" because women did not storm the barricades of American politics and vote as a revolutionary bloc.As a political activist as well as a scholar, Freeman understands that political change is a complex process with many fits and starts. She explains that women political activists were a diverse group ranging from radical feminists to stalwart big city machine bosses. Sometimes these divergent groups worked in tandem when their interests coincided. More often they worked separately or even at cross-purposes.Yet, as more women slowly entered politics \\"a room at a time\\", politics became more democratic. Voting moved from the saloon to the local grade school polling place. Issues like child labor and public health came to the forefront. Is it a coincidence that most of the significant social legslation in America came about after women entered politics as activists and voters?Freeman dug deep into the sources to bring this hidden history to the surface. While doing so she uncovered a political tragedy worthy of a Sophocles or a Shakespeare-- the moral decline of the Republican Party.It may surprise today's readers to learn that for most of its history, the Republican Party was the party of feminism and women's rights. The GOP began its life as party of radical reform, attracting feminists, abolitionists, free soilers and even socialists to its ranks. Susan B. Anthony, Ida B. Wells or Jane Addams would not recognize today's Republican Party with its deep disdain for gender equality and its opposition to all progressive social legislation.Jo Freeman's book is a wonderful tool for uncovering the complex relationship that American women have had with our major political parties.

The idea was that inhabitants would live on unleavened bread and apples, abstain from sex, and expound on the universe. The experiment lasted only from July to December, when it predictably fell apart. In adulthood, Louisa trained a comic eye on the whole experience, and wrote this brief, funny parody of it, with only names changed to protect the innocent. Also included here are girlhood diaries kept by Louisa during this experience, which offer insight into what life was like at such a place in those days. These diaries are made doubly amusing by a few marginal notes Louisa added to them later in life. For anyone interested in Alcott family history, or in the crazy days of the transcendentalists (the 19th century's version of the sixties), this short work is a must read."},{"Title":"Transcendental Wild Oats and excerpts from the Fruitlands diary","review":"The Fruitlands commune was a fascinating experiment that took place in beautiful Harvard, Mass. when Louisa was a child. &quot;Transcendental Wild Oats&quot; is her brief and affectionate send-up of the ridiculous ideals and characters she remembers from Fruitlands, among them her father. &quot;Fruitlands Diary,&quot; her actual diary from her childhood, offers great insight into daily life from this time period, with affectionate comments here and there added when she was an older woman."},{"Title":"The Parent Plot (Sweet Valley High #67)","review":"Jessica and Elizabeth's parents are broken up.Elizabeth is very sad and is plotting to get them back together,Jessica -on another hand- accepts that the relationship is doomed and vows to find a new ,exciting man to get her mother back together with.It is a fun book and I almost wish I had not sold my copy."},{"Title":"Charlotte Smith: A Critical Biography","review":"Charlotte Smith was a Romantic poet who influenced William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. She had 12 children, 3 died, and she raised the other 9 by herself. Her husband was a womanizer of the worst kind who landed the whole family in debtors' prison. None of that matters in the end because she wrote poetry and novels in order to support herself and her children. The poetry she left behind is beautiful, especially her elegaic sonnets, and her novels can still be found and read today.Fletcher does a wonderful job bringing Smith's personality to life in this biography. Although I had read much of Smith's works before reading this biography, I felt I understood Charlotte Smith so much better after reading this biography.Although this biography is written by a scholar, it is very readable and engaging. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand more about Charlotte Smith, her life, the time in which she lived, and how and why she is considered the first of the great Romantic poets. There are many explications in this book of her poetry which sheds even more light on Smith."},{"Title":"Enemy Of The State/an","review":"So many sci-fi novels delve into the tiniest details concerning weapons, transportation, intelligent computers, etc. while ignoring the most fundamental aspects of one of the most powerful forces in society, namely economics. Wilson manages to tell the story of a revolution centered on economics, and he doesn't \\"dumb down\\" the theory behind it. He cleverly illustrates the human effects of economic forces by sympathetically telling the stories of both the initiators of these forces and their victims.This is not a shoot-em-up type of story. All of the characters are motivated by ideology, and Wilson does a good job of humanizing even the most villainous among them while at the same time presenting a hero who is vulnerable himself to the same vices of his opponents."},{"Title":"Enemy Of The State/an","review":"Unlike some other sci-fi future revolutions, the revolution in this book is bloodless and based solely on economics. Borrowing ideas from modern political science and economics, Wilson visits issues like the Gold Standard, libertarianism/anarchism, inflation, totalitarianism, market controls, and even gender attitudes in old civilizations vs. frontier developments (i.e., a frontier's success is dependent on getting new people, one of the easiest ways being women giving birth -- thus, women become baby factories and are devalued with regards to any other activity or idea.)However, Wilson goes a little light on all the ideology; there are some strong personalities at play in this story of an empire's accelerated downfall. Just like in Asimov's Foundation Series, a small cabal is working to soften the impact of the inevitable crash of an overloaded empire; however, in Wilson's version, the impact is lessened by forcing a collapse in 5 years, as opposed to the expected 20. The leader of this movement, Peter LaNague, is from an odd frontier planet Tolive (for &quot;to live&quot;), founded by a group of people following the tenets of Kyfho (in the book, Kyfho is found to be very much in the vein of Heinlein's TANSTAAFL - There Ain't No Such Thing As a Free Lunch). But LaNague is up against the violent Droohin, leader of a rebel group whose plans were ruined by LaNague. A mysterious ultra-violent couple under LaNague's orders keeps Droohin in check, but one wonders if the tension can hold.I found the book fascinating in its development. Wilson keeps you as well as the other conspirators in the dark as to the overarching plan - LaNague plays it close to the chest so that the movement is not betrayed. This becomes a focal point in the interaction between LaNague and his fellow subversives, his wife, and even the government which he brings down.Wilson draws from the tradition (and has some sly nods to in the naming of some characters and spacecraft) of Frank Herbert's Dune, Robert Heinlein's Future History, Isaac Asimov's Foundation, and the detailed technical aspects of Larry Niven's work."},{"Title":"Enemy Of The State/an","review":"Never judge a book by its cover, right? Well I did when I pulled this one off the shelf at my neighborhood paperback re-seller. I had never heard of F. Paul Wilson before but was stretching my wings in anti-state philosophy. Collapse the STATE by exposing the sand of it's foundation; faulty economic policy. LaNague is a cross between Guy Fawkes and Robin Hood! Now I am a F. Paul Wilson addict, especially his Repairman Jack series. An Enemy of the State is a friend of mine...:)"},{"Title":"Enemy Of The State/an","review":"Originally written in the 1970s, in the context of stagflation, F. Paul Wilson's ENEMY OF THE STATE has renewed relevance today, with the likelihood of high price inflation hanging like a sword of Damocles over the United States thanks to the Fed's recent money-creation spree.This book is set an the future on a group of planets ruled by the Outworld Imperium, an oppressive, declining, semi-democratic empire. Wilson chronicles a small cabal's efforts to achieve a genuinely libertarian revolution. It is led by a charismatic-if-somewhat-aloof man named Peter LaNague, an adherent to a libertarian philosophy known as \\"Kyfho\\" (an acronym for \\"Keep Your F@#*%&*g Hands Off\\" -- gotta love it!) Because of his strong belief in libertarian principles, LaNague's challenge is to effect a revolution with as little violence or loss of life as possible, and to ensure that the \\"old boss\\" is not replaced with a \\"new boss.\\" Instead, LaNague wants there to be \\"no boss.\\"How LaNague pulls this all off is quite clever -- I won't reveal everything, but let's just say a crucial part of his strategy is turning the government's tendency towards inflation against it. To me it was quite inspiring and extremely relevant.Any libertarian-leaning scifi fan will love this book. It's clearly in the tradition of such classics as Heinlein's THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS (there's even a brief reference to that book in ENEMY, a tip of the hat by Wilson to Heinlein.) My only (minor) complaint about ENEMY OF THE STATE is its brevity -- normally I'm a big proponent of concision in books, but in this case I found myself wanting more!"},{"Title":"Enemy Of The State/an","review":"I love F. Paul Wilson's LaNague Federation series of stories, and I was overjoyed to find that they had finally been made available for the Kindle. However, I was extremely upset to find that the last three chapters of the book were left out of the electronic version of the book. Chapters 19, 20, and 21 are absent from the book, which is odd, as the Epilogue managed to be included. So we have this odd jump to the end and I can't believe people who read this version weren't scratching their head and asking questions.The only acceptable solution for this is for the company that did the translation to ebook format go back and fix it.UPDATE: Amazon has worked with the publisher to get the missing material added.

This one hits meets all of my modified interpretation of the Baen criteria.This book - while written a few decades ago - seems to have a lot of today's details involved with its plot: a government growing larger and larger, increasing unemployment, an ever-increasing public debt, and inflation growing unchecked. All combined with a growing discontent with the public and radical change being initiated.I thought it was pretty good, and have the next one in the series but will wait a while to start it. While I picked it up for free, I think it is well worth the $2.99 Kindle price (pricing as of April 20, 2011)."},{"Title":"Enemy Of The State/an","review":"This is the most incredible book I've ever read (barring the Tolkien Trilogy), and I'm a huge Repairman Jack fan and this isn't a Repairman Jack book. It's not even a horror story, unless you consider our current economic crisis a horror. Years ago Wilson figured out that the way to topple a government, and, indeed, an entire planet, was through economic manipulation. This is the story of a very patient people who hatched a plan that took years to implement. Every time I read a page I would look up at the news on TV then back down to the page and say, that's us! This is the book that started the KYFHO craze. The only clue I'll give is that KYFHO represents a phrase that starts with the word \\"Keep.\\" You figure it out. Better still, buy the book. I've already bought several to send to friends. Political warning: F. Paul Wilson is a dedicated Libertarian. You will know this is you have read any of the Repairman Jack books. Progressives and Liberals may find Wilson's political premise distasteful. Libertarians, Republicans, and Conservatives will love it. If you are a Glenn Beck fan you will love this book, For those of the more liberal persuasion, the story is still intriguing and even you might find it hard to put the book down. Although the book deals with Earth outer space planetary colonies, it is not a science fiction book, so fans of horror and sci fi might be disappointed. If you like this book and haven't read any of the Repairman Jack series, I suggest them wholeheartedly.

To his credit, the illustrations Peter used were good enough to overcome the shortfalls in describing how to tie the knots.

This clan is tight-knit, with the brothers and cousins coming to the aid of their kinfolk when needed, and in Wade's case, help is needed big-time.Wade Benedict sets out on a mission to fulfill a dying wish of his friend, a mission that will ultimately alter his life forever. Traveling to the Middle East to rescue the daughter of his friend, Wade is surprised to find that the intended rescuee, Chloe Madison, is reluctant to be rescued at all.Chloe Madison has lived in the country of Hazaristan for many years and lives in fear of her stepbrother's tyrantical rule over the family. After her mother's death, Chloe always dreamed of returning to America, to live with her father, but that dream seemed just that, only a fantasy. That is, until she literally runs into a tall, dark American who seems intent on taking her away from the primitive culture she has come to know. As much as Chloe longs to take the Wade Benedict's offer to help her leave, she knows that these actions will bring on the rage of her stepbrother, and the possible torture of her family. But after learning that she was to be sold in marriage, Chloe discovers that she must leave now, or face dire consequences.Taking Wade up on his offer, the two soon find themselves running for their lives as they flee to America. But even on home shores, they soon find that the evil has followed them to the heart of Wade's family. Would their closeness and blossoming love survive the events to follow?Taking a page from current events, Jennifer Blake concludes her Benedict family series on a dazzling note. Bringing the entire family together to finish out the story is brilliant and gives a great sense of closure for her fans.Blake describes the agony she went through trying to decide how to finish this series, which she was in the process of writing during the time of the attacks on America. She has done a very admirable job of capturing the desperate feelings and dire circumstances of women caught in the primitive culture of the Middle East. This is wonderful conclusion to her series, and a fascinating look at current events combined with a heartbreaking love story."},{"Title":"Wade","review":"I never thought Jennifer Blake could create a character that I felt more deeply about than LUKE, another in the Louisiana Gentlemen seires,but she's done it with WADE.

A must read! Then get your hands on KANE, ROAN, LUKE AND CLAY to see what else you've missed. No one can make you long to meet a Southern Gentlemen better than Blake!"},{"Title":"Wade","review":"This was a very different and interesting plot than the usual fare. This is about the Taliban and how one woman becomes trapped in a country exactly like Afghanistan and how one man tries to get her out.So different from what we normally see in romance, this was brilliant. Written right before the terrorist attacks, the book almost never was released. I am glad it was. Ms Blake takes us into a frightening world where everything is black and white and there is no room for error. Where women are second class citizens and treated worse than rodents.This is a tale about an American woman trapped inside with no hope of escape and about her father's last dying wish to get her out.Wade is that man. Former military with the Special forces, he sneaks into the war torn country and tries to convince the woman to leave with him. Afraid and without hope, she shrinks away from the bold American risking his neck to fulfill a last wish.With the Taliban onto him, Wade must make a decision, leave the frightened woman behind and save himself, or drag her out against her will and risk being caught.Heart-pounding and action-packed, this is a must-read.

Without revealing anything, it wasn't up to par with the rest of the amazing book.A well worth read!Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Wade","review":"I was very impressed with Jennifer Blake's story of Chloe and Wade. Although this book does stray from Blake's usual tale of rural Louisiana life, it is well written and reflects the political climate of our time. The references made to the RAWA movement and the harships women suffer under the Taliban rule had a huge impact on me. I truly enjoyed this book and it will be saved on my &quot;Books to keep shelf&quot;. Additionally if you enjoy Suzanne Brockmann, I think you will like this book."},{"Title":"Wade","review":"Wade Benedict, fulfilling his friend's final wish that his daughter be rescued from the Arabian land where she moved with her mother. Unfortunately, despite the harsh conditions, or rather, because of them, the lady in question, does not want to be rescued, preferring to stay, fighting for freedom. Wade, however, will go to any length to get her out, though when Chloe realizes she can continue her work back home in Louisiana, and that her cruel stepbrother's plans for her marriage to gain her money will place her life into a literal hell, she agrees.The battle to get out of the country is bloody, but they manage to survive, only to find that it has followed them home, and is not a Jihad, a holy war, that pulls in the entire clan into even more fights, barely escaping with their lives. Perhaps of equal importance are the battles of the heart Chloe and Wade face as they must decide what to do with the relationship they have found themselves suddenly to be in, each with their own issues to face before they can claim the love that awaits them, if they survive.***** In the most exciting novel of the series, WADE concludes Ms Blake's Bayou Brothers line, making me sorry I have missed all but one of the others, if they are all this fine.Readers get to catch up with characters who have surely become their friends in past books, and to meet a dynamic new couple. Heart pounding excitement never lets up, though romantic interludes amidst it all light up the pages with passion instead of gunfire. Every character is vibrantly drawn, and the storyline is one that could be ripped from current life as the Taliban and their world seem to haunt our everyday lives. Brava, Ms. Blake. Perhaps she can find another Benedict cousin hiding in the swamplands, if we are lucky."},{"Title":"Wade","review":"Wade Benedict reluctantly agreed to carry out the dying man's last wish that he rescues his daughter from the oppressive Taliban imitated reign in Hazaristan. Leaving the comfort of his Turn-Coupe, Louisiana home, Wade travels to Asia to bring Chloe Madison back to the United States. Chloe was born in America, but moved as a child with her family here when her stepfather relocated to his homeland following the Soviet pullout.Wade is shocked when he fails to persuade Chloe Madison to leave with him. Chloe believes her work to help women obtain basic rights is important. However, soon she has no choice, but to flee with the American, as Taliban-like justice calls on her. As Wade and Chloe trek through the mountains, they fall in love. The terror follows them to the serenity of Louisiana.Wade is a typical Benedict hero and Chloe is a strong woman trying to do the right thing, but the key to this novel is the descriptive plight of females in this part of the world. The story line starts at an incredible pace as readers learn swiftly how justice works. Though the book switches locale to the Bayou too quickly, as Jennifer Blake is a victim of her own Middle East portrait, the audience will appreciate this powerful romantic intrigue.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wade","review":"This was probably my least favorite of this series, but I still loved it and will read it again, and again."},{"Title":"Wade","review":"This isn't the first Jennifer Blake novel I've read, and my recollection is that her other books were much better than this one. I know it's the last in a long series of novels about the Benedicts and their cousins; perhaps she ran out of steam. This book's concept was promising, and I found the first half of the book very interesting. I was fascinated by Chloe's transformation from precoscious American teen into an outwardly submissive yet internally rebellious Muslim woman. I felt I really understood how women in those countries must feel. Chloe's and Wade's escape from Hazaristan was thrilling. But when they arrived in America, the story started to drag, drag, drag. And the dialogue became stilted and inane. I know that Ms. Blake hails from Louisiana, but I thought all the \\"aw, shucks,\\" good ole boy dialogue among the Benedict clan was just too much. I also thought Ahmad's character became so overblown as to be a caricature. Because he was the author's sole plot device, his conduct became more and more bizarre and incredible, in order to keep the plot going. I mean, come on, he slits his own sister's throat because she tried to help Chloe escape? Then, in spite of the fact that he is apparently very occupied helping al Qaida with their terrorist efforts (and really, was the al Qaida tie-in really necessary?), he takes time out to follow Chloe to America so he can kill not only her, but the entire Benedict clan? Because of all this distraction, the first love scene between Wade and Chloe was anticlimactic and flat. I don't know about any other love scenes, because I put the book down after that and never picked it up again. In my humble opinion, don't bother with this one. Jennifer Blake can write and has written much better books."},{"Title":"Scripture and tradition in Judaism;: Haggadic studies (Studia post-biblica)","review":"I'm not sure if everyone would agree with some of Geza Vermes' interpretations but this book is eye opening. I first got turned on to this book while studying Islam where I learned that the son who was to be sacrificed by Abraham was a willing and active participant. This was not the way I understood it. So I did some digging and, in time, ended up at this book.While the book tackles more than just the Akedah it does discuss in detail the fact that many of the oral traditions of Judaism made their way in written form into the New Testament and that this oral tradition had a tremendous impact on Christianity. This 'tradition' falls outside of the Hebrew Bible as we know it yet it had a significant impact on both Christianity and Rabbinical Judaism, one obviously, the other less obvious.For example, we find that Jesus, of whom Isaac was considered by Christians as a 'type' of sacrificial lamb for his people and by Jews as a 'type' of martyr willing to die for the Nation, was a willing participant in his own sacrifice. Vermes draws out the possibility (perhaps probability) that the understanding of Isaac's role in the Akedah by Jesus' day had, through tradition, become that of a willing and active participant.As in Islam the Quran reflects what might be seen as a developed tradition of what is only touched upon in the Hebrew Bible, so too does Christianity, several hundred years earlier, reflect a developed tradition. It is 'tradition', outside of the Bible, outside of the mainstream, lying at what is considered by some to be the fringe, where things get interesting because it is here where we are truly able to begin putting ourselves 'back' there.There is much in the New Testament that would be quite baffling if it were not for books/literature from the Second Temple Period that unfold what would otherwise remain enigmatic. Vermes unfolds the implications of some of these traditions in this book. It is quite scholarly but it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Queenie Peavy (A yearling book)","review":"Robert Burch has succeeded in providing a lively, vital, energetic juvenile character with the intelligence and guts to stand up to her stressful life which includes a not so respectible father. Through her lively, but sometimes disruptive activities at school and in her community, Queeny gains a reputation as a fighter and a loner. Youthful readers can vicariously identify with her rebellious nature and learn from Queeny's mistakes.In today's world, many children live with this same type of stress (parent in jail) and more. As a former sixth grade teacher and current school counselor, I have used Queeny Peavy for many years.

The other is a place of pure imagination-- populated by the myths, legends and creatures of lore that humans have thought about since the beginning of time. In the beginning, this parallel world is a dark and wild place and the creatures in it are gods and demons-- awesome and mighty. Imagine the consternation that mass media brings: Suddenly, the Devil is face-to-face with Mickey Mouse. When that happens, there is Hell to pay...Out of Their Minds is a charming conceit, but truthfully not one of the best of the Simak collection. I have kind of the feeling that he had a terrific idea, but never worked it out very far past the point of being a terrific idea. The introduction is great, but the follow-through is a pale shadow of some of his greater novels like Way Station or Destiny Doll.Simak fans should find this a nice digression (I love the moment with Snuffy Smith!) but people new to his work should begin elsewhere."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"The concept behind this book is that everything the human race has imagined, from the Devil to Disneyland, exists in another world governed by all the bizarre rules we've thought of too. Not a bad idea and the characterisation works quite well. The storyline moved along nicely towards the punchline but when it arrives, the delivery isn't great. A good read but a disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"Clifford Simak, 1904-88, noted science fiction author, wrote several novels that could best be described as fantasy, although I will be the first to admit that parsing the dividing line between science-fiction and fantasy can result in contentious discussions and disagreements. Nonetheless this novel, \\"Out of Their Minds\\" (1970) is in my oppinion more fantasy than science fiction. Does it matter? Well, it does to some, for sure. To the casual reader I strongly suspect not. And it is to those readers I direct my admittedly opinionated comments.Horton Smith, protagonist of this novel, is experiencing what was years ago referred to as a mid-life crises. A successful and well-known newsman Horton decides to chuck his life in Washington D.C. and drive cross-country to his boyhood Midwestern hometown of Pilot Knob in order to fish and write a novel. Strange things start happening, very strange things. A close friend is killed in a mysterious auto accident. Taking an apparent wrong turn on his journey he has a bizarre encounter with comic book-like folks and a decidedly unfriendly snake. Upon arrived in his home town most folk greet him like the prodigal son except for one group of punks who decide to give him a real country homecoming. One of the young Turks shows up dead after the encounter and Joe goes on the lam to dodge the vigilantes. The local schoolteacher who he had befriended rescues him from a pack of wolfs who just disappear when her headlights shine on them and then the devil makes an appearance.Fortunately for us readers Simak inserted a \\"document\\" into the novel - chapter 5 - that make us privy to cause of the weirdness. In the form of a letter from his friend killed in the auto accident this 11 page \\"theory\\" proposes the idea that mankind's mental evolution has created an alternative universe of sorts inhabited by all manner of our imaginary creations - cartoon characters, monsters and the Devil. Now these creations want to merge with our \\"reality\\".Simak had sufficient name recognition in the science-fiction community so he could of very easily spent his writing career cranking out mindless outer-space potboilers. His foray into fantasy shows an author who was not content with the path of least resistance but a writer who could experiment and take creative risks.In point of fact this is an entertaining novel with just enough loopy logic to keep disbelief suspended and the pages turning. May you enjoy it also."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"Like many of Simak's books, the ending may leave you wishing for a different resolution, but it is still an engrossing read.

If you have antiques (or just old or quirky things you really love) this book explains how to arrange them with other furnishings in a way that is both beautiful to look at and also very livable. I'm decorating my tiny house, and have been reading a lot of decorating books. This is the ONLY book I've come across that explains HOW to decorate. It breaks down this daunting task (it seems daunting to me since I don't know where to begin) into smaller components that make sense. Each chapter explains how to work with the different elements of your home, such as Furniture, Fabrics, Lighting, but also explains the elements of each room, such as choosing Flooring and Wall Color. It also tells you how to pull together items that don't necessarily match through use of Color, Texture, Pattern, and through Proportion &amp; Scale (yes, even I was able to understand these concepts because of the direct, yet eloquent wording of the text and great pictures that reinforced the concepts being explained). Some of the pictures had the typical 14-foot ceilings and grand spaces that I will probably never live with, but many others were of small-sized rooms that were beautifully done. Even the 14-foot-ceiling pictures had many, many ideas that I could use because these rooms were decorated by function--most contained small groupings of furniture (i.e., sitting areas, dining areas, etc.) that broke up the large spaces and made them look comfortable and inviting. I just finished reading the book, and I'm looking forward to going back and really study it again. I do feel more confident that I'll be able to create a home that is lovely and comfortable."},{"Title":"Decorating With Antiques: Confidently Combining Old and New","review":"In many ways, the pictures in this volume reminds me of interiors shown in books on French style.

ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"Decorating With Antiques: Confidently Combining Old and New","review":"If you are the type of decorator who likes to mix antique or just plain old furniture and possessions with new furnishings, this book is loaded with ideas on how to make it work. The first half of the book is dedicated to the elements of design--chairs, mirrors, lighting, pillows, etc. I did not find the text in these sections to be as educational as the text in the 2nd half of the book. The photos in this first section are wonderful (very high end) and the writer talks a lot about balance, scale, etc., but doesn't say what you actually need to do to accomplish the balance, scale, etc. The second half, dedicated to the indivudual rooms in the home, is much better. Not only are the photos beautiful, but solid suggestions are given as to what works and what does not. Most of the photos are of the homes of world-class designers or the very-rich. That was as problem for me because there is no way that I can afford the kinds of furniture and decorative accents used in the photos. For that reason, I'm giving the book a ****. I bought mine from an individual seller at a discounted price, so it was worth it for me."},{"Title":"Decorating With Antiques: Confidently Combining Old and New","review":"I love Caroline Clifton Moggs books.

McPherson's focus is the white abolitionists though there is some information about black abolitionists. This book traces the experience of the abolitionists during Reconstruction, its destruction in the late 1870s, and events leading up to the founding of the NAACP. McPherson provides both narrative and an effort at quantification by measuring attitudes to a variety of issues in a group of militant pre-war abolitionists and their descendents.McPherson is particularly concerned with rebutting the idea that abolitionists lost interest in black rights after the Civil War. Not surprisingly, this is a complex story. Indeed, some abolitionist figures did fall away. The experience of Reconstruction, which like much of Gilded Age America, was characterized by quite a bit of political corruption in Southern states, alienated some former abolitionists. Others became more committed to genteel political reform (mugwumpism), which others were attracted by the idea of pursuing alliances with \\"moderate\\" paternalistic southern whites. MacPherson shows, however, that a core majority of pre-war abolitionists remained committed strongly to ideals of black political and social equality, providing considerable support for Reconstruction policies. As they were before the Civil War, this core remained an important and militant fringe movement in American life.After the withdrawal of Federal troops from the South, many of these individuals remained outspoken advocates for black rights. The end of Federal intervention in the South, however, caused a number to focus on gradualist, meliorist strategies, pursuit of alliances with relatively liberal Southern whites, and strong emphasis on education for blacks. Quite a bit of this book is devoted to educational efforts in the South, describing the very impressive efforts of white abolitionists to support black colleges and educational institutions, some initially integrated. These efforts were often complicated by Southern white resistance and violence, and as time went on, by black efforts to escape what was partially a paternalistic system.The 1890s saw the extinction of hopes of progress through alliance with Southern \\"moderates\\" and gradualism. The wholesale disenfranchisement of black voters, imposition of Jim Crow laws, and frequent lynchings eventually led to a new relative militancy, neo-abolitionism, led in several cases by descendents of pre-Civil War activists. Oswald Garrison Villard, a principal founder of the NAACP, was the grandson of the great William Lloyd Garrison. McPherson has interesting chapters on Booker T. Washington, the relationship between abolitionism and women's rights, and the interesting role of opposition to American imperialism as a factor in the re-emergence of neo-abolitionism.Despite the wavering of some members of the movement, the paternalism of many, and their sometimes sanctimonious and rigid piety, these individuals, particularly those associated with Garrison and his family, were the only consistent white supporters of equality of African-Americans across many decades."},{"Title":"Combustion","review":"After severely injuring her knee while on the job, smoke jumper Autumn MacAllister returns to her Montana hometown to heal though the place has one monstrous nightmare memory for her that she can't shake of her parents dying in an inferno.

The book moves fast with a lot of chasing action as the main character is on the run through Scotland and England. It's interesting and despite having fewer descriptive words to work with, you still get a sense of the character's personality.I recommend this book for English learners, but with a few precautions. There are a lot of characters that come in and out of the story, so that may be distracting and make it harder to follow. Also, it is written in British English, so a few words may need to be looked up in the dictionary. Another issue is that the action takes place in Scotland and England with some place names. It would have been nice to have a map in the front of the book to get a sense of the main character's movements throughout the book.Overall, I recommend this book to English language learners, and I hope the book would affect them as it has me in now wanting to see the Alfred Hitchcock movie and see how they compare."},{"Title":"Domestic Relations","review":"Well, I wish I was Norman.

A delightful distraction from the tediums of everyday life while at the same time giving one an opportunity to ponder morality, fairness, etc.... Looking forward to the next phase in Norm's journey."},{"Title":"Domestic Relations","review":"When this book arrived in my mailbox and I read the back cover, I added it to my \\"to read pile\\" without a whole lot of enthusiasm. According to the back cover, this one was about a divorce lawyer in Dallas who is faced with someone from his past who makes things in his present day life get a little disconcerting. Nothing I read on that back cover excited me or made me think, \\"wow, this one sounds good..\\"Domestic Relations begins in a suburb of Dallas, as we follow the main character, Norman, through much of his childhood. He lives within a community of like minded families in a housing development, complete with its own cul-de-sac. Throughout the first part of the novel, we come to know not only Norman, but also his family, his friends and their families. Included in these folks is Norman's closest childhood friend, Lisa.Soon Norman is all grown up and a law school graduate. He gets married, has a daughter and leads a content and happy life. Next, Lisa re-enters his life after a many year absence and things in Norman's world quickly start to change. Boundaries become foggy, relationships become strained, and morals become questionable.The story itself is nothing earth shatteringly new, but at the same time, i really did enjoy it. The author writes with an almost sarcastic, borderline cynical wit that really appealed to my sense of humor. I've heard it said that sarcasm is the lowest form of humor. My theory on that is that whomever said that, wasn't intelligent enough to understand, or \\"get\\" the point of the sarcasm. The use of humor in this book, albeit sarcasm, is often used to drive home Norman's thoughts and feelings -- and it works well. The humor in the story was what made it for me. While the plot wasn't mind blowing, the style was rather engaging, and as a result, I enjoyed the story I read.Before picking up this book, I can honestly say I knew a grand total of nothing about the lives of divorce lawyers; especially divorce lawyers of the upscale, wealthy members of society. In reading Domestic Relations, I was transported into their lives for a while, right into the middle of the scandals and deceit. While I wouldn't call it a soap opera, it did present me with that same feeling of guilty pleasure as I read through. Beyond that though, there is more to the book-- the questions of values, ethics and morals that are posed to the reader being one of the primary aspects here.Overall, its a good read. Will it become a classic piece of literature? Probably not. Would I recommend you read it? Absolutely...its a good way to escape from reality for a while, and you'll probably laugh out loud a few dozen times while you're doing it."},{"Title":"Domestic Relations","review":"I am really enjoying this book.

I hope to meet up with Mr. Spiczek again...You would never know that this is Mr. Geilich's first novel!"},{"Title":"Domestic Relations","review":"It is hard to believe that Domestic Relations is Charles Geilich's first novel. His skillful blend of humor and pathos is not often found in a new author. The protagonist, Norman, is the quintessential young man from the suburbs who has risen to power in the sometimes sordid, sometimes outrageous world of Dallas divorce. He is equally comfortable in an exchange of wits with sharp attorneys and hurling gutter talk at a lawsuit- hungry prostitute. Norman is Everyman whose Good Deeds for his clients often conflict with his hesitant relationship with Lisa. We are rooting for him to chuck Lisa to the sidewalk with her buxom brashness, but he has to discover for himself that the girl next door is not what he thought she was or even what he wants now. Like Odysseus, Norman weathers his trials and tribulations with wit, charm and a bit of touching nostalgia as he finally realizes what is importnat to him. Not what was or what could have been, but what he has now. And Norman has it all. I didn't want the story to end, and look forward to another novel by Geilich soon."},{"Title":"Domestic Relations","review":"DOMESTIC RELATIONS is both entertaining and revealing.

Mr. Geilich does a great job of sharing with everyone some of the certain best kept secrets and dirty laundry that go on \\"behind the senes\\" so to speak in the Dallas family law world. You are brought into a whirlwind of halarious, sexy, backstabbing, adventurous and just about any emotion you can hit on the rollacoaster that Norman and some ofthe other characters in this book take you on. I think that this book is like a window into lives of people you will probably have known for years, but think you will never meet, or at least not get to see what they are really like. There are plenty of times in reading this book that I said to myself \\"Man, I have wanted to say that or felt that way a time or two\\", or \\"Why can't that happen to me\\" and there were a few parts where I thought. \\"Eww, I hope that never happends to me\\". There is an unstoppable interest you will have as you begin to read this book. The broad spectrum of \\"Domestic Relations\\" that is covered and actually exposed in this book is amazing. I am sure that you will have a great time reading it! I sure did!!"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I carried the 7th Cav into various battles and never questioned Col Moore's analysis of the situation. We always knew that if Col Moore would go there, we would go. We all did our job as best we could and often under fire. He darn sure fully and accurately assessed McNamara. If you ever have the honor of saluting Hal Moore, do it with pride. He's as good as they get. Don Estes (KIA), who is mentioned in the book, was a personal friend of mine. I saw him die . . . but that's another story."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Moore and can verify much of what occurred with &quot;B&quot; Company.The story told by the authors is true, even more happened, which was not included. Gen. Harold Moore and Joe Galloway did a remarkable job of reciting the facts as they actually happened.If you want to get a good close-up look into what actual combat in a foreign land was, this book gives you facts.It depicts many heroic acts and some character flaws in humans. One black M-60 machine-gunner I saw whom, without hesitation, gun blazing, pressed forward in the heat of battle.Omitted from the book was the actual odor of hundreds, dead and dying, in the extreme heat of Ia Drang Valley; a smell unlike I had ever experienced and the picture of bodies wrapped in ponchos stacked like cord wood at Pleiku.By the Grace of God and many prayers I survived... and yet, this does not mean those who died did not have God's Grace. This book cannot answer the \\"why\\" question but it will help you better understand the real consequences of war. Is war worth the supreme sacrifice and ultimate casualties?The book could provoke you to think that if we must engage in combat how can we accomplish our goals and minimize the casualties and are those goals worth the cost?Many Americans who saw only quiet tense young soldiers (yet somehow mysteriously different) return home can now understand the great trauma that some went through in Viet Nam (as with other wars).How do you tell a man that had taken several rounds in the chest, pleading &quot;Please Doc don't let me die&quot;, that it's okay.&quot;If war could make a man than life should be better... but war can mold the soul that makes the man...

In fact, it reminds me slightly of Catch-22 in that is seems to jump around, even though it doesn't, even though Catch-22 did, and now I've gone cross-eyed. The point is, it reads like a report to a general. And that's probably more what it is. Hal Moore is not an author, he's a retired Lt. General. Galloway was a reporter, not a novelist. They aren't going to write a nice neat book like Tom Clancy. The reality of the battle is to me reflected in the reality of how the book was written, namely in a manner I expect from a soldier, not a writer. The book is compelling because it's real, and it's never been told this way before. A must read in my opinion for anyone curious about Vietnam."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"My Father's helicopter picked up the last men to leave ALBANY.He was enlisted into the 11th Airmobile Division as a CH47 helicopter mechanic when the division was formed. He deployed to Vietnam with the renamed 1st Cav as assistant crew chief on a CH47. During the Battle of LZXRAY his helicopter flew non-stop resupply missions for three days to the firebases supporting the 1/7 and 2/7. Neither him nor any of the crew ever shut down the CH47 nor did they get much sleep.His aircraft later policed the ALBANY battlefield which means they flew out equipment and US Dead. He said his aircraft flew out four loads of dead wrapped in ponchos laid out 30-40 per load on the deck of the aircraft. And then they picked up the security element on their last flight.He has read the book many times and watched the movie several times with myself and my brothers, two of us are former Sergeants in the Army. The movie still gives him goose bumps, especially during the loading and LZ landing scenes.He served three tours in Vietnam with the 1st Cav. Because of his position as a helicopter crewman, crewchief, 1st Sergeant, and then BN Maint Supervisor, he saw action in just about every battle in the Highlands as well as outside Vietnam. He can recall verbatim many of the operations he was involved in. He has read many books on Vietnam, and has annotated the errors in them.His copy of this book has virtually no annotations which is a tribute to Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's devotion to the men of the 1/7 and 2/7. This book and the movie will stand the test of time as it has stood the test of one of the best men to serve on a CH47.The book and movie should be required for all young men ( and women) who are considering joining the military. It is a sobering look at the hard realities of infantry battle during a meeting engagement. And it is a tribute to the leadership qualities and superior fighting spirit of the US Soldier.Hal Moore is a superior role model for young leaders. His leadership lessons are timeless and apply to all ranks and to all spheres of human endeavor. He shows that brains, courage, and brawn have to work together to win."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book is a stunning accomplishment written by the on scene American commander of the first major combat engagement in VietNam in late 1965 at the Ia Drang Valley. It threads the line masterfully between human interest story and gripping actual war story. It is quick to read, but also remarkably detailed. It is not a \\"literary\\" masterpiece, but it is in no way a \\"dumbed down\\" book.This 560 page paperback tells the story of the formation and first time use of what would become a standard image of the war in VietNam, Air Assault by helicopter. The book opens with a number of pages telling how portions of the 1st Cavalry Division were being converted by technology and need from old style mobile ground infantry into highly mobile, helicopter-bourne shock troops for use in the hostile territory and hostile terrain of the growing conflict in South East Asia. We follow many of the participants from their training in the United States over to deployment \\"on the cheap\\" in South VietNam. Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore was the battalion commander and Joe Galloway was the UPI reporter who found themselves dropped right into a massive hornet's nest of eager for battle North Vietnamese Army regulars massively outnumbering the Americans at Landing Zone X-Ray. The details of the battle from BOTH SIDES are described in vivid detail giving the reader a harrowing image of the horror that combat actually is. The main battle rages on day and night for a couple days as every bit of the new training and tactics taught to the battalion are put to desperate use. New tactics are developed on the spot as American soldiers frantically fight to save themselves and their buddies. The history of the embattled unit (the 7th Cavalry of General Custer's last stand at Little Big Horn) weighs heavily on the Americans as they fight to prevent being overrun again nearly 90 years later half-way around the world. The value of Hal Moore's excellent leadership during the X-Ray battle is vividly illustrated later when poor leadership gets the unit's sister battalion decimated nearby at Landing Zone Albany.This book is well worth reading even to the casual reader. It is not a \\"flag-waver\\" or an anti-war book. It simply tells the true story of relatively ordinary humans who find themselves mixed up in \\"a new kind of war\\" that seems destined to get all of them killed brutally. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is expertly presented and researched. Many of the American survivors of the battle meet each year in remembrance and the authors have used these gatherings to make sure they got the details and full stories right. The authors also met the North Vietnamese commander of the battle at length when writing this book who gave them fine insight into the perspective from the \\"other side\\". You can smell the sweat, and the fear, everywhere.This book is not to be missed by any human being who wants to understand (and hopefully avoid) what war is like. It is sobering and very much worth your effort."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Easily the best Vietnam War book written. Probably the most personal account of battle from the perspective of the individual soldier. Hal Moore and Joe Galloway avoid the temptation to add to the politics of this war and simply write a stunning, frightening, inspiring story of common men fighting for each other and their own survival. Beyond the striking descriptions of close battle, this book provides an interesting perspective of how the Army adopted the use of helicopters as air cavalry and air mobile operations. I'm a career military officer and avid military history reader and haven't found another book like it - I routinely recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel battle in all its elements. In my top 5 all time best military history books. If you like this book, read \\"With the Old Breed\\" about the Marines in WWII Pacific."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Without doubt, this is one of the best accounts of military history that I have ever read.'We Were Soldiers' describes two separate engagements between the NVA and American forces in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam. This battle, fought in 1965, was one of the first 'real' encounters between US and NVA forces, and it changed the Vietnam War from a political exercise to full fledged conflict.Essentially, the book is divided into two stories, that of the soldiers that fought at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray, and that of the soldiers that fought at LZ Albany, two locations in the Ia Drang valley.The book is frighteningly honest about the harsh realities of war, and does an excellent job at showing the human cost of war. Lt. General Harold 'Hal' Moore writes in a very forthright and honest manner, and it is obvious he is someone that does not mince words, and I believe that every word in this book is truth.The book isn't easy to read, and it certainly isn't a light, entertaining story. If anything, the book is closer to a history text, rich in detail and thoroughly referenced, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fascinating read.But overall, what I admired so much about this book was the honesty of it. Nothing is withheld, all is told, typical of 'Hal' Moore. After reading this book, it is obvious to me that Hal is a man of the highest integrity and earned every star on his shoulder.I am an Australian, and although the men at Ia Drang weren't from my country, I was still deeply moved after reading this book. Every man that served in that valley was a hero, and I admire them greatly. I recommend all Americans read this book, young and old."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"If you're looking for a book on Vietnam that tells the story of the troops on the ground and what it was like to fight in Southeast Asia this is definitely it. General Moore and Joseph Galloway have done a superb job telling the story of the first large battle involving American troops in Vietnam in the 1960s. It is full of heroism, leadership, mistakes, and hard fighting. It reads like a novel, is definitely a page turner, and it hits you part way through the book that you really are reading about young men fighting for their lives of far away battlefields at distances where you could throw rocks. Moore and Galloway are to be congratulated here for they have told a tale of bravery, endurance, and fortitude that few authors have been able to accomplish. Unblooded American troops met and defeated a skilled and determined enemy on his ground, though not without loss and mistakes. The bravery of the common soldier is unbelievable, as are the conditions under which he was asked to fight. This book is highly recommended and is one of the best this reviewer has ever read. It is accurate, well-written, and one of the best battle studies produced in a very long time."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I read this book in 1993, right after it first came out. It was the marine commandant's choice for Marines who wished to read in their field of concentration. Joe Galloway, a war correspondent and Col. Hal Moore, the commanding officer in this horrific battle in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam, co-wrote this superb depiction of one of the first set piece battles of the Vietnamese war. That these men survived this battle at all is mute testimony to their irrepressible fierceness, to their dogged determination, and to the fearless efforts of their air and artillery support. They fought a courageous enemy who was bent on one purpose, the annihilation of their American foe. It's a brilliantly told tale of military heroism and perseverance. The recent death in the WTC bombing of one of the primary participants in the battle, Rick Rescorla, and the articles dedicated to his selfless display of bravery as he made certain that his charges were evacuated from the WTC, caused me to review this book once again.Most Americans are sadly deficient when it comes to any knowledge of military history and its impact on the course of civilization. It seems too often that we are a nation of full stomachs and empty heads. However, the emotional trauma of the recent Taliban attacks on our soil has shaken us loose from our stupor and an interest in affairs military has been thusly ignited. As one who remembers WWII, and whose family is filled with men who went to every war this country has ever fought, my fervent wish is that our citizens will one day wake up to what actually happened in SE Asia in the mid to latter part of the 20th century. My second wish is that people will grow to understand that terrorists are not patriots, and that they are not leaders of their people. Cromwell, Bolivar, George Washington, all of whom refused the crown, they were leaders of their people. Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Ho Chi Minh, Castro, they were and are killers of their people. America fought a cold war, rebuilt Western Europe and Japan, and liberated South Korea from the Communists like the aforementioned. Vietnam was a battle in that Cold War.The Taliban, who have taken many lives to further a fanatical agenda, are merely the latest iteration of terrorists who seek to do what our constitution was written to prevent. This book is a great story about men who fought and died for principles that too many know too little about to understand. Perhaps now that the country is on high alert we'll gain back some ground form the empty heads that have presided over the media and academia in America. Buy this book and read it, you'll be very glad you did."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"\\"It was early March of 1970, and the weather was damp with a trace of snow on the ground. Since I had no means of transportation, I walked around the bend of Wurzburger Strasse in the early morning mist of a drab Monday morning. I walked onto Graves Kaserne, which housed the entire First Battalion, Seventh Infantry unit; I was heading to meet Lieutenant Colonel Dillon, the battalion commander. All incoming officers must report formally to the commander, and they have to endure the traditional \\"Welcome-to-the-greatest-unit-in-the-army\\" soliloquy.\\" These words come directly from my book I co-authored with my army buddy Bob Toto titled \\"In Our Duffel Bags, Surviving the Vietnam Era.\\"The significance of the above paragraph is that Colonel Dillon was the S-3 officer for LTC Moore's 1st of the 7th Cav. At the time of the Battle of the Ia Drang it was November, 1965. Fast forward four and a half years later; Lieutenant Colonel Gregory P. (Matt) Dillon had command of the 1st of the 7th Infantry which was part of the 3rd Infantry Division located in the Zone of West Germany. Since writing our war memoirs I've since been reading a lot of material on the Vietnam War, after forgetting most of it for over forty years. I never knew that my commanding battalion officer was a very instrumental and heroic officer at LZ Xray.First of all, the very concept prior to the battle of the Ia Drang Valley of air mobile assault was an untested theory. After the battle it became doctrine written in stone as how to conduct operations in Vietnam. The troopers of the 7th Cav were trained in the techniques of airmobile assault at Fort Benning Georgia. Their uniforms which signified the typical fatigues that were worn in CONUS (Continental US) Europe and Korea shows to all that this unit was one of the first units to go to Southeast Asia. The basecamps erected by the 1st Cav Division looked to be temporary tent cities very reminiscent of WWII temporary camps. Later on in the war the base camps would be made heavily sandbagged structures complete with outhouse latrines and rainwater showers. The uniforms would also change drastically and the troopers would be wearing the lighter weighted jungle fatigues and the newly designed canvas upper jungle boots.The troopers of the 1st of the 7th Cav would be led by the highly competent LTC Harold G. Moore. These troopers were well trained and Moore's officers were of a very high level. Their mission was what was to be a familiar phrase to all infantry officers who served in South Vietnam and it was to \\"search and destroy the enemy.\\" The enemy was found soon after landing at LZ Xray. This LZ had the capabilities of holding 8 slicks when landing and extracting troops and equipment. Moore and Galloway tell the brutal story of how they held the LZ for three days and were able to direct in field artillery and air support on the surrounding NVA. The 7th Cav with a force of about 450 men were able to hold off an NVA force of 2500 men. Using the choppers for support and medevac operations the 7th Cav proved to all that they could indeed contain and beat the forces of the well trained NVA.The stories told herein, show the professionalism and heroics of not only the lst Cav but also gets into the mindset of the North Vietnamese. It shows the true dedication of the revolution techniques of the North Vietnamese. As well as the Americans fought in Vietnam the North Vietnamese knew that we would tire of it. In fact General Moore faced these facts way back in the early days of 1965. He knew that the North Vietnamese were a tough and savvy opponent and that the US severely constrained themselves by not going and pursuing the enemy when they escaped to Cambodia. The war as fought with these so-called rules could never be won. Moore understood this early on.This book represents many things. It shows to us that the US brought air mobility to the battlefield. It showed to all that it could maneuver from above the tough jungle terrain of Vietnam. Something the French lacked was the ability to maneuver, so they lost on the battlefield. The US did not lose on the battlefield, however as Ho Chi Minh knew we would tire of the war no matter how many of the North Vietnamese and VC we Americans killed. So therefore we left the battlefield in 1973 and the weak ARVN were left to their own devices, which I may add we supplied them. They quickly lost these devices and they indeed lost the war in 1975.Moore's book is a classic which shows the brutality and yes some of the senseless management of men at war. Moore and Galloway show respect to the troopers who fought in that war and they convey what the effects of that major battle were and how the Vietnam War was to be fought in the future. It also shows our hubris and tragic decisions which led to the ultimate tragedy that was the Vietnam War. This book should be read by all who want to know about the battle, the Vietnam War and perhaps how to prevent such tragedies in the future."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I never understood why he didn't want to talk about it. After reading this book, now I know. This book had a most profound effect on me. I have read and re-read sections it. As a teenager growing up in the mid sixties to early seventies I didn't realize what my father was going through. I remember the day he came home after one tour of Viet Nam. People threw things and spit at him and called him a \\"baby killer\\" as he came off the plane. I was angry then and I'm still angry. For those that felt it was their \\"duty\\" to do so, I ask you to read this book. My father did his duty for our country. He watched his own men get slaughtered in battle. I have watched him sit alone for hours and never understood why. It took this book to make me understand somewhat what he went through. I can't fully understand as I believe those that were actually in the battles can fully understand. At least now, I know why my Dad never talked about it. Thank you Hal Moore, Joe Galloway and all the others that fought at LZ X-Ray and Albany. I owe you a debt that I know now I can never repay. Most of all, thank you for letting me read such an account of Viet Nam. Now I know what my father went through and why he would never talk about it except with those that served with him during his 2 tours in Viet Nam. For those that didn't understand what went on in Viet Nam, read this book. It is heartbeaking."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's account of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley is truly one of the most riveting accounts of men in battle that's ever been published. It is, at times, gut-wrenching. When the men who were there come forward to say, \\"Yeah, that's exactly how it was,\\" then the reader should take notice. It's best for the reader not to dally on the decades-after-the-fact second-guessing by armchair tacticians ... they simply have a theoretical, perfect-world view that's less affected by bullets whizzing over their heads -- and through their buddies' faces -- than by textbook strategy and tactics.Better, if you want some idea of the fear and confusion our boys in Iraq might be facing right now, read Moore and Galloway's account. It's a different war, a different enemy, a different place, a different time ... but boy's hearts don't change."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"First, let's look at what this book is not: It is not beautifully written, it is not the story of one person's experience and it is not dedicated to character building. If you are looking for those things, then look elsewhere.Now if you are looking for the smell, the horror, the courage and the sacrifice of the battlefield, then you will find it in this work. Moore and Galloway have written a book that will serve as a textbook for generations of people who want to know what war is really like in a very objective manner - the heroism, the great leadership, poor leadership, mistakes, and occasional cowardice. It pulls no punches and takes people and organizations to task where appropriate. It is truly an amazing work and one that should be read by anyone when a debate on going to war is raging.The book is in three distinctive parts: The fight on Landing Zone X-Ray; The Fight on Landing Zone Albany; and the aftermath of the battles, for both the US involvement in Viet Nam and some of the families affected by it. Moore was the Battalion Commander at X-Ray and gives a very good view of the decisions he made and why he made them. He is able to walk us through the battle and describe the critical actions by both the North Vietnamese and the US forces that turned the tide of this battle and allowed Moore's force to win a victory. There are many first person accounts of different aspects of the battle given by the US soldiers that fought there and also by some of the key North Vietnam leaders.The second part of the book was about the relief battalion's retrograde back from LZ X-Ray to LZ Albany. Moore was not here so all of the reporting was done thru interviews after the fact. He is pretty scathing in some of his assesments of the decisions being made - although if you do not have military experience you might not find the writing scathing enough for what happened. He describes the complecency by some of the leadership on the movement back, the failure to set out decent security and the indecisiveness in the early moments of the battle. He also points out the slow flow of information from Albany to the higher levels of the US Forces. Albany was fought to a draw with horrendous losses on both sides after a North Vietnamese battalion and the 2/7 Cav had a meeting engagement (which means they ran into eachother in the woods). One lead company was almost completely slaughtered, save a few people that had to do an E&E; (Escape and Evasion) in order to get to safety. The book contains three accounts of men that did that.The final part of the book looked at the political decisions made in the aftermath of the war using declassified top secret memos written by Sec McNamara to illustrate that he knew very early in the war that it could prove to be unwinnable, putting the odds at a US victory at no better than 1 in 2. Also, there are personal accounts from the widows and the children of some of the men that died in the battles. Since I am in Iraq right now with the Army, and I have a two year old daughter, I found these passages particularily moving.My only gripe with this book, is that your understaning of it is assisted greatly if you have been in the military. Since I am, it is no problem, but for someone walking in with no experience, a lot of the terminology used and the prose itself will make following the story a little more difficult. It reads almost exactly like an After Action Review, which probably is the proper voice for this piece, but some readers will have problems with it - as evidenced by some of the earlier reviews.The bottom line - very honest, interesting, work. It will help the reader understand battle, and perhaps understand it a little more than they would like to. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book is a first-hand account of the first major battalion-scale operations in the Vietnam War. Written by Lt. General Harold Moore (retired) and a war correspondent, Joseph Galloway, who was the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, it tells a savage and bloody story. The two authors of this spent many years interviewing soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang Valley, and also the relatives of those who died in the battle and had journals and letters which were sent home.In November of 1965, a Cavalry Battalion was dropped behind enemy lines using experimental helicopter tactics and was immediately surrounded by over two-thousand enemy soldiers. Three days later, and barely three miles away, a battalion in close relation to the ones first dropped in the initial landing zone was slaughtered.An interesting credit to this book is that it is not only from the perspectives of the American battalions. The authors not only interviewed the American officers and troops, but also interviewed the North Vietnamese commanders, who offer their opinions and perspectives, making the battle seem all the more real to the reader. Without these perspectives, it would have seemed like someone was trying to paint a picture but was missing many of his materials.Although sometimes it seems dryly written, there is no exciting way to describe such a terrible and seemingly one-sided battle. Although the Lieutenant Colonel writes itto be more of a black and white documentary than the dramatic and colorful movie interpretation, it is not difficult to see the leadership in the officers on the ground and the bravery of every soldier on the ground. Many of the people in this book were not able to read it, because they sacrificed their lives to make it.The authors go into extensive detail in many areas of the book. This can obviously be credited to the fact that these two men were on the ground with the troops while the battle was going on. Many authors of books that are similar to this or are included in its genre are limited to what the authors could research. This is not the case in We Were Soldiers Once... And Young, because the authors can also include their own experiences throughout the three day battle for Landing Zone X-Ray. Although sometimes the details can become wearisome, they provide the information necessary to completely understand the situation. This book is more to understand the happenings of the Vietnam War and its first major conflict than to be entertained. The movie was meant to be entertaining; the book is clearly more informative.However, its blandness at points does not mean it is always dull. There are many chapters full of stories of the brave men who fought and died in the Ia Drang Valley. It basically alternates between the two men's hind-sight of the events and then what the men who were fighting in different areas were going through. This makes it interesting because the authors offer their opinions on what happened, as well as what they had thought at the time.This book is a magnificent retelling of the events happening during the battle for the Ia Drang Valley, and it belongs on every person's shelf who has ever pondered what it must have been like fighting in that bloody war. It is full of tales of sacrifice, determination and heroism, on the parts of both forces. This compelling account of bravery was an astonishing read and a true eye-opener to the events occurring during these battles and what the soldiers had to go through. This book is a credit to every American soldier and is an absolute must-read."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book is a rarity. It sticks stricly to facts, but it is overwhelmingly moving. It is both an account of a battle and a sweeping microcosm of the the whole war at the same time. Gen. Moore and journalist Galloway were participants in the first large scale battle of the Vietnam war. They tell the story, primary through the voice of then Lt. Col. Moore, in a strictly factual style, in keeping with the best military writing. But this is no dry \\"after action\\" report. Moore loved his men, and they loved him back. The reader mourns every death, just as the commander did. Moore was, as he promised his men, to first man in and the last man out, and he left behind no one, dead or alive. The result is a gripping drama of real Americans caught up in the confusion of Vietnam's steaming jungles and nationalistic fervor. This is page turning history. But this book is so much more than just a great war story. By highlighting specific command decisions at the brigade, division and political levels, Moore elevates this single battle into a compelling depiction of both the military and political strategies of the US in Vietnam. While the battalion and company level focus of the book cannot begin to represent a comprehensive treatment of the American experience in Vietnam, the reader is permitted to see the consequences of the tactical frustration caused by the political decisions of the higher brass and the Johnson Administration, such as respecting the Cambodian border when the beaten NVA retreated accross it with the Americans in hot pursuit. Even the home front impact of the war is dramatized by a chapter devoted to Moore's wife personally delivering death notices to the wives of men killed in the battle--this history is truly heartbreaking. Perhaps the best service done by this book is the portray the truth about the American fighting man in Vietnam. Despite the bad image the media perpetuates, the truth is that Americans fought and died in Vietnam with the best of intentions and with great military results. We killed 10 NVA for every American that died. The American failure in Vietnam was political, not military. We underestimated the depth and resiliency of Vietnamese nationalism and we possibly overestimated the threat of Vietnamese Communism. But don't blame Hal Moore or the men of the 7th Air Cavalry. They fought with guts, beat the odds and answered the call of their country. We need to choose our friends and our battles more wisely, but we cannot hope to do better than to count on men like Hal Moore and the troopers of the 7th Cavalry."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Reading retired Lt. General Harold Moore's account of the early days of American intervention in Vietnam, one cannot help but feel a bit of frustration. Though the misguided &quot;search and destroy&quot; that characterized America's initial efforts in Vietnam led to the near disaster that was the battle of Ia Drang, it was Moore's remarkably effective leadership that prevented the battle from being an American disaster. The irony is that the battle taught some very important lessons that the top American leadership failed to learn until after the Tet offensive. By then, they had exhausted the goodwill that had previously existed on the home front. Moore's account of the battle is riveting and is one of the most compelling accounts to come out of the war. Anyone with an interest in military history should read it."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Moore of the Ia Drang valley to me. When I read his retelling the story of his men's two day eternity in hell in the Ia Drang I couldn't help seeing the love and respect for his men in every word - every sentence. Col. Moore does not dwell on the decisions that put his men in danger. His books tells of the individual heroism and terror that the men in that battle felt. I began to know each man and feel what they felt. Col. Moore respectfully leaves the ending chapter for the aftermath- for those who survived and the families of those who did not. It brought tears to my eyes. In the end he dedicated the book ( and I think the rest of his career) to the men who fought and that hallowed ground."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

General Moore and Joe Galloway told their story well.This is a MUST read book and then SEE the movie. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I was 8 years old when the battle of Ia Drang took place. Vietnam was a faraway place I had never heard of. This book brings it home. There are scenes of great heroism and tragedy. Ia Drang was one of the bloodiest battles fought by American soldiers in the post-WW II era. While the new movie starring Mel Gibson tells some of the story, there is a great deal more to be learned in the book.However, the most moving part of the book comes towards the end as the lives of the wives and parents and children are impacted. They are informed by telegram that their husband, son or father is missing or killed in action. The commentaries are heart rendering.Vietnam scarred my generation, and we have been treated to too many hopeless accounts. This book is different. This book tells the story of heroes. There is no shame, no bug stomping crazy people, no vulgar accounts. This is the story of men who bled, died and fought because they believed in the dream that is America. They went because they were ordered to go. They fought because that was their job.It is not pretty, but it is the truth unvarnished by political correctness.

It is especially relevant and poignant for leaders that are down doing &quot;muddy boots&quot; jobs, and is very contemporary in that it chronicles the perilous combat of the first air assault operation.LTG (ret) Harold Mooreimpresses both in his recollection, his frankness, and his connection with his soldiers. He remembers everyone's name, their character, what made them tick, and truly painted an exquisite picture of the uniquely bonded community that is formed in a combat arms unit. He did not shuck the responsibility of telling it like it was when it came to human failure, which is all too often a problem in today's military.Anyone who is dedicated to being the best they can be (and not the Army of One) will benefit from taking on the experience that is this story."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This title does an excellent job of that.There are plenty of maps that make the situation very clear to the reader. I find it very ironic &amp; tragic that at the end of this first &quot;test&quot; of air mobility the renforcements are ordered to walk into LZ Albany &amp; ambush. It is even more ironic that the brass saw the battle is an american victory, and set the precident for the &quot;way to fight&quot; in Vietnam eventhough the concepts of using airmobility were never used in this battle.(airmobility- using the mobility &amp; speed of helicopters to envelope &amp; crush an enemys positions, routes of withdrawl, etc.) Instead the troopers fought off waves of PAVN or NVA attacking their perimeter.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"With the movie coming out this week, it's time to get serious about SOLDIERS and discuss the book (although from all accounts the movie is faithful to a remarkable and, for Hollywood, surprising degree).The silly old saw is that there are two kinds of people, and it goes downhill from there. In this case, there ARE two kinds of people: those who have fought to the death in battle, and the rest of the world. The soldiers in SOLDIERS fought one of the bloodiest, nastiest, ugliest and most brutal actions in the history of war, and this book describes their experiences with dreadful clarity.The remarkable thing about this book, beyond the vigor and quality of the writing, is its directness and lack of histrionics or unnecessary drama. This was a very bad place to be and there was, literally, no way out for most of those involved. If anyone has any illusions about the supposed dignity of war, SOLDIERS will dispel those illusions for ever.I intend to see the movie and try to watch without turning away or pretending that such shocking violence and death does not occur and need not touch anyone not directly involved. The awful truth that comes across in the book is that the men who fought and died did so as surrogates of other humans on both sides and that there is no way for those others to avoid responsibility for these events.Why not indulge in an exhaustive analysis of the book itself? There is no need, because 90+ other reviewers have done it well. I just wanted to get past the paper-and-ink facets to explain what this book does to the mind and heart and why every thinking person should read it and consider his or her attitude to war.War is indeed hell. Are there any other alternatives? Will we ever learn? How low can humans get if they can condone what has been happening to our species for millennia and what otherwise thoughtful, sensible individuals can do to each other?I have suggested, not entirely in jest, that Planet Earth is actually a penal colony to which we have been sent for past bad behavior in some part of the galaxy or other. This comes to an apotheosis in SOLDIERS.Read it and weep for all of us, for all time."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"&quot;We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young&quot; is a story of two of the first battles fought by US soldiers in Viet Nam. Although the soldiers fought well, the military failed to appreciate that the Viet Cong also fought well, and that this was not going to be a walkover. By concentrating on two actions, the authors examine details that would be lost in a larger survey. One of the most chilling is the lieutenant who tells his friends that he is going to win the Medal of Honor. Of course, what he achieves is to get himself and much of his platoon killed in short order. This book is an accurate guide to the tactics used in the early parts of the Viet Nam war. Finally, it shows how the Army expected the war to be won, and thus is a precursor for what would happen for years to come. An essential book to understanding how the war was fought."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

The authors take care to mention as many of those who participated in Ia Drang as possible. This slows down the read, but as i said makes it historically significant. The book takes you through the two main parts of the battle, and describes in detail the harsh realities of war. In my opinion this book should be read by history and military buffs, although it would make a great source if you were writing a paper on the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

The first time I read it as straight military history, the second more critically. There is no doubt about the bravery on both sides. My questions are these: Without the huge American fire power, air, and resources, this battle would have been an unmitigated disaster. How could this have been avoided ? And the other question is, General Moore left Vietnam after only 6 months. What had the military learned, and why was he pulled. This truly was a formative battle and a precursor of the future. And a disasterous tribute to the futility on both sides. What a waste."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book, while very popular and included on the US Army Chief of Staff's \\"Professional Reading List, is a mixed bag. There's lots of action, shooting, firefights, etc., and Col. Moore did get some of the NVA perspective as well. The maps are pretty good, and are useful to consult while reading this. After reading this book, I came away with a feeling of awe and near disbelief about what these very young soldiers had to go through, what they endured, and how many were killed. The problem, however, is that after awhile, the book reads like one non-stop chronicle of firefights and NVA assaults. There is not enough structural framework to the narrative once the battle starts. If the fighting was confusing to the GI's in the jungle where the battle was fought, how much more so to the reader 40 years later, not having seen the ground. The book suffers from what many do, especially by 1st time authors--it keeps EVERYTHING in, and leaves nothing out. The book could have used some editing of the repletion, and needs to have a much better organization of events. I kept asking myself, \\"why are the soldiers there?\\" \\"Why did they send in such a small force, and not reinforce in greater #'s?\\" Moore never really provides this."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"There has been an explosion of books recently about the Vietnam War and its history. THese books range from those focusing on personal experiences in and out of combat, and books that have brought forth reinterpretations of the war's causes, effects, and our failures there, and even of the Vietnamese's impressions of the war and its effects on their country. As the United States has opened its archives, so have China, Vietnam, the Soviet Union and other players in the war. Many assumptions about the war's legacy and impact on world history and politics are changing. But despite all the new information, the grim realities of combat rarely change, and this book is among the best at graphically portraying life in a combat zone. THe Battle of Ia Drang, one of the first significant engagements of the War between US and North Vietnamese troops, was one of the first indications that the enemy was determined, well-prepared and every bit as brave as our own troops, despite their significant disadvantage in firepower. Though we won the battle in terms of the body count, the Vietnamese learned they could stand face to face with American troops and inflict grave harm. It was a lesson for both sides. American military strategists and General WEstmoreland based their attrition strategy on this early encounter and the heavy kill ratio in our favor. The authors of the book give an almost minute by minute account of the details of the battle, naming the wounded, the dead and following many individual acts of bravery and courage. At the end of the book the authors also account for what happens to the soldiers after the war, and in the beginning of the book they list those who died. Its a heart wrenching, emotional account of warfare at its most basic level, and few can read the book and maintain any emotional distance. Those of you who are looking for something more than a gory and bloody reenactment of the battle and its longlasting effects on the men and their families are reading the wrong book though. Its not a history book on Vietnam. THough the authors (a former Colonel and a career war reporter) clearly have some thoughts about went went wrong there, they focus mainly on the battle itself and the men who fought in it. Among their criticisms of the conduct of the war are: the miltary policy of letting soldiers leave after one year of service, thus denying the military the ability to retain men of experience, the sending in of combat units with shortages of men and supplies, and the failure of the government to allow the troops to pursue retreating enemy soldiers as would normally be dictated by miltary strategy. THese things did happen, and no one who reads this book can question the bravery of American soldiers, or the Vietnamese for that matter, who's side is often told in this book. HOwever, history has shown that remedying these matters would likely have done little to change the outcome of the war. It was the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time. Many military men (including the authors of this book) still seem unable to conceive of that. THe war was a civil war and cultural revolution we should have stayed out of. Its clear that the military was unable to think beyond military terms. So while this book is among the best at describing the harsh realities of combat, its certainly not one of the most significant books to come out of the Vietnam War, despite the words of Colonel David Hackworth (the most decorated living American soldier) on the cover. Its one of the best books on what war is really like, and its also a living testament to those who fought there, but if you want to understand the Vietnam war and the folly of our involvement, read something else. One other note worth mentioning, as one might expect of a book written by military types, the book, in many ways glorifies the sacrifices of those who died there, and at times, even glorifies the realities of combat. Its done in a subtle way, but its quite a contrast from other books such as A Rumor of War by Philip Caputo or Dispatches by MIchael Herr. There is no questioning of why they were there or what they were doing. Clearly they were good soldiers, but the book would have been even better if it had taken a critical look at what happend. BUt again, that is not its purpose and one must respect the authors for what it is the book does do. A must for war historians and those who want to know what war is like."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This book reads like a gigantic action report intended for the higher brass. You're told things like \\"Seargent xxx from Middletown, Nebraska took an AK-47 shot in the shoulder that exited from the middle back. 2nd Platoon of Bravo Company was pinned down by heavy automatic weapons fire on the left.\\" After going though half the book I just gave up. I could not generate enough enthusiasm to pick it up again. This is a rare thing for me. I hate leaving a book unfinished, and I particularly like war stories. This textbook approach is only interesting as a tool for analyzing the battle. The battle this book describes is one of the fiercest in the entire war and requires an author who can recreate that energy and horror in a way that puts you in the action. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for me with these authors. For a much better read on Vietnam try \\"If I die in a combat zone\\" by Tim Obrien. The events are far more trivial in that book then those described here, but it is much more compelling somehow.

Nonetheless, it is painful to imagine the staggering losses on both sides with the Americans having a 5 to 1 kill advantage. But 200 troopers killed in this battle from Custer's old 7th Cav made me reflect that history repeated itself somewhat because Custer lost about 200 troopers too. Hal Moore had high technology to back him up in the way of air support and artillery. Custer had neither. And yet the losses are the same.

As a kid who was born in the 1960's, my appreciation of the soldiers who fought and gave their lives has been limited to the various movies and stories of the era.The authors of this book have done an incredible job gathering information from their fellow soldiers (and in some cases those soldiers families) in order to convey and portray what can only be described as an incredibly poignant account of their experiences.I know that this will be a story I will one day recommend that my own children read in an effort to improve their understanding of the sacrafices such brave people have made for the sake of our continued freedom."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Moore and Galloway have written a great account of infantry combat in Vietnam. The courage of the men in the battles is outstanding, and should never be forgotten. Unfortunately, Moore is not explicitly critical of the leadership which sent US soldiers badly outnumbered to LZ X-ray, and then on a murderous trek (90% casualties (KIA/WIA) in Charlie Company!) to LZ Albany. I felt this to be a major problem with this book. Hackworth's &quot;About Face&quot; gives better criticism of the Army leadership during the Vietnam war, and is much more satisfactory from this perspective."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is an amazing book, fascinating and disturbing at the same time. There is probably nothing I can add to the hundreds of reviews of this book. However, I'd just like to say what lessons I took from it. First of all, at the risk of hyperbole, I must say that I wish every American would read this book. In it you will learn about the bravery of the American service person, and the real cost of war. It is a story that transcends the conflict in Vietnam and is very applicable to our modern military adventures, where the burden of war is carried by only a small percentage of our citizens.The first half of the book describes the formation what would become the 1/7 Cavalry, part of the first air mobile division (1st Cavalry Division) and its deployment to Vietnam. The 1/7th is commanded by the co-author, Hal Moore. Moore's battalion is sent into LZ X-ray and survives a battle against what would have been overwhelming odds if it were not for massive American artillery and close air support despite the expert leadership of the officers and NCOs in the battalion from Moore down and the undisputed bravery of each individual soldier. This is significant as the first major engagement between American air mobile forces and the North Vietnamese Army.The second half of the book, however, did not get portrayed artistically in the Mel Gibson movie. It tells the story of Moore's sister battalion, the 2/7th Cavalry, that was marching toward LZ Albany to be extracted after reinforcing the 1/7th at X-ray. While approaching the LZ, unprepared for meeting the enemy again, the battalion was attacked by three battalions of NVA soldiers. The chain of command was not able to bring artillery and air support their rescue in this engagement for several hours. The results were devastating. Both fights constitute the Battle of the Ia Drang, not just the part stylized in the movie.The most moving part of the book is revealed in the closing chapters. The story of two widows and two daughters bring to light how the sacrifices of soldiers not only take the lives of amazingly talented soldiers, but also dramatically affects the lives of their loved ones at home, who continue to pay the price. Reading about the aftermath and the effect on the veterans and their family members is a very emotional experience. However, even more amazing and anger inducing is the way the battle was treated by the leadership of the country. The upper management of the Army and the government refuses any lessons to be learned from this battle, and the country continued on a path that was already decided upon before the 1st Cavalry Division even arrived in Vietnam.I wish I could give this book more than five stars. If you enjoyed the movie, then please read this book and get the whole story."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

The book deals with the first major conflict with American and North Vietnam regulars. The battle itself set the strategy for the entire war. On one side (American) the idea was that we would seek out and kill as many North Vietnamese (and Viet Cong) so they would cease fighting due to loss of life. The North Vietnamese, on the other hand, thought that as long as they could cause a high casualty rate, the American people would protest and cause an end to the war.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I saw that Lt. Gen. (ret.) Hal Moore just turned 90 two days ago, so this is a good time to review this incredible book.At the time of the battle of Ia Drang, which is the focus of \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young\\", the airborne cavalry was an unproven experiment in a new kind of warfare. Where helicopters would take the place of horses to quickly deploy the soldiers of the 7th Calvary. Hal Moore (then Lt. Col.), a devout Christian, a father and a loving husband found himself at the tip of the spear, as his battalion (450 men) was surrounded by upwards of 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers. So he was both greatly outnumbered and without his biggest advantage, which was the ability to move faster then the enemy.All of which makes this book less about the fighting and tactics of the battle, although that's here too in heart-wrenching detail, and more about the leadership, courage, and humility of Moore. Ultimately, the is a story about strength found through faith, sacrifice and love for one's brothers in arms. A real life example of a universal theme (to be sure).Joseph Galloway, like the old-school journalist he is, loves to avoid the limelight. It's a shame, because his accomplishments and experiences are no less impressive then Moore's. This book would not be anywhere near as powerful if Galloway had not been there with the men of the 1st Battalion during this battle.This book will leave you crying and thankful for your blessings. If not, see a doctor (or perhaps a priest) as quickly as possible."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Harold Moore and Joe Galloway were participants in the fierce battle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley of South Vietnam in November, 1965. Galloway was a United Press journalist, but he was no less a participant for that: he carried a rifle (against the rules) and he was in the midst of the X-Ray fighting. Moore commanded the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry(Airmobile), and he too was on the scene (not, as some readers might expect, in some distant headquarters).Moore and Galloway spent ten years on this book, corresponding with and interviewing not only American survivors of X-Ray and its bloody continuation at LZ Albany, but three North Vietnamese commanders as well, one of whom stated without exaggeration that the Americans had \\"fought valiantly.\\"Both sides were terribly mauled, particularly the North Vietnamese (whose losses by their own admission were triple those of the Americans), and it says something about the nature of combat in Vietnam that both sides claimed victory in a tactically inconclusive operation. Moore and Galloway understandably focus on the American side, in the eyewitness style pioneered by S. L. A. Marshall and carried on by writers like Cornelius Ryan and Keith Nolan.Moore and Galloway seem to want to tell every story about every GI. For the general reader, this makes for a long and somewhat repetitive account. That's unfortunate, because the piling on of detail tends after a while to desensitize the reader to what's happening. Nevertheless, the concrete descriptions of close combat in the fog of war are shocking and heartbreaking enough. Few readers will wish they'd been in the Ia Drang Valley.Unusually for a combat narrative, a later chapter describes how the wives and families of some of the men killed learned about and dealt with their loss.There's no flag-waving here, no rhetoric, fake melodrama, self-glorification, politics, or sugar-coating. Certainly \\"We were Soldiers Once\\" is essential reading for anyone interested in the military aspects of the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Initially, I listened to a book on tape that just included the battle at X-ray. That was very good at building a mental picture of the horror of the battle and its casualties. Then I watched the movie which also was based on Hal Moore's fight. I saw an interview of Hal Moore where he spoke of the later ambush and the errors of judgement that caused so many casulties. He also related his later meeting with the NVA officer who directed the opposing army tactics. Both seemed to have come to peace with the past while still mourning the losses of their men. This book encompases all 3 segments. The battle seemed easier to follow when listening to the tape and of course when watching the movie. The book seemed to have places where I lost tract of which group and at what location they were fighting. That is why I give the book 4 stars. But it sure provided an emotional kick by letting you feel the fear and uncertainty of combat."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This engrossing account of the harrowing battles that took place in the Ia Drang Valley is a gripping eyewitness account told from numerous points of view. Lt. Col. Harold Moore was in command of the operation and his co-author, reporter Joseph Galloway, was also present. They interviewed the survivors and pieced together a compelling oral history that reveals the operation and the experience of the men who lived it from every angle--even, occasionally, from the enemy's point of view. The result is an exhaustive and exhausting read that commands respect for soldiers who, whether they were drafted or had chosen a military career, struggled to do their best under horrendous conditions and often paid the ultimate price. It is also an interesting look at strategy and tactics under constantly changing battlefield conditions. Moore and Galloway take care to mention the name, hometown, and a telling detail about every man who fell, and the book concludes with a moving testament to their memory."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Hal tells what really happened at Ia Drang in full detail and one is also able to learn exactly what the vietnamese PAVN and VC troops did in the future to prevent full scale battles like the battle of Ia Drang (not to mention learning about how General Westmorland didn't take heed to Hal's after action report and therefor we suffered more casulties in the future after Ia Drang)...

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Compelling precisely because it is not like a novel. It's an after battle report, and it's a good one. The authors were there. It shows.This book takes you step by step through the preparations for, and the details of, one of the first and deadliest battles in Vietnam. It does so through the eyes of the commander in the field, one who had great respect for the men in his command, and the men (especially some helicopter pilots) who supported them.It bogs down occasionally, but even that is welcome since it is usually the relating of individual soldiers age's, hometown's, and family details that makes sure everyone is remembered for the effort and sacrifice they made.The book also carries a battlefield commander's appraisal of larger political questions of government support of the effort and the troops, restrictions on movement or pursuit, and the decision to maintain the regular enlistment period (and let go of the best trained men) and rigid 'tour' of men, and the 'ticket stamping' rotation of officer's combat assignments.These are valid questions, and should be debated much more than they ever will be. They also detract from the relation of the battle (actually battles) that were fought, and the 'fog of war' that existed.The book shows the pride of a professional soldier and the respect he has for his enemy. Both viewpoints frequently missing in a typical novel.Well worth the effort. Read it."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I devoured it over the next week. I didn't want to finish it too quickly. Instead, I wanted to savor it. Even after all this time, the book still resonates with me.General Moore's book will remain a classic of not only Vietnam, but of infantry warfare. That the book has drawn comparisons to some of the greatest books ever written about warfare and warriors should surprise no one who has read it and it is certainly deserving of them. It's tone is mournful, sad, and the General still is in awe of those heroes who went with him into the Ia Drang. Anyone whoever doubts the fighting ability and dedication of the American soldier (even if it's in a place as morally ambiguous as Vietnam) should read this book and thank God that this country is so blessed to have such young men who make such sacrifices.General Moore, I salute you and the heroes you have lead. God Bless."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"A story of war is a canvas for the depiction of human qualities and capabilities. The stakes are not just victory or defeat but life or death. Also, most of the persons involved don't want to be there -- at least that was true as to the average American serviceman in Vietnam. A war-story about Vietnam, then, is a story with very high stakes told about people who usually didn't want to be there and about what they did in a deadly confrontation. This is a subject of inherent drama and worth.We Were Soldiers Once is written by the American field commander in the battle of Ia Drang. The author extensively quotes servicemen who fought in that battle, and their remembrances are vital to this book. At times the book is quite moving, as when the author visits the grave of one of his officers who died in the battle of Ia Drang. At other times, it depicts awesome courage and resourcefulness.Vietnam was a tragedy. Because of the ultimate futility of it and its exorbitant human cost to both America and Vietnam, it's a shame it happened at all. However, it happened, and Americans who fought and sometimes died in that war deserve to have their stories told. This book tells a piece of the overall story and tells it well."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Recomended to all military science students."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"You'll probably not post this on the book's website, but I feel compelled to comment on it. I myself am the author of a book on war and veterans, &quot;Hell, Healing and Resistance: Veterans Speak,&quot; to be published this fall. I was not in Vietnam, but spent two years in Navy/Marines ROTC, with active duty '78-'80. However, I know many veterans of Vietnam and other wars of this century, who inspired me to write the book. In addition, I personally interviewed more than 40 veterans and collected over one hundred previously unpublished accounts. &quot;We Were Soldiers Once and Young&quot; was perhaps the most difficult book on Vietnam I have ever read. It is not the profanity or blood and gore which is hard to take (neither are overwhelming), but rather the loss of life on such a personal level. The tragedy of young boys thrust by circumstance into the &quot;kill zone&quot; is heartbreaking. And so needless! The two savage battles at X-Ray and Albany took place in November of 1965, before Vietnam was a household word. For those who believe Vietnam was the first televised war from beginning to end, this book proves otherwise. The carnage of Ia Drang was well-concealed from the American public. And mothers were informed of the death of their sons by anonymous yellow taxi cab drivers, who simply delivered &quot;The Secretary of the Army regrets to inform you&quot; telegrams into their quaking hands. What makes this book so devastating is the schizophrenia permeating every page. The depiction of personal tragedy and loss clashes violently with the acceptance of massive deaths on both sides. Only the military would attempt to intertwine love of comrades and tender remembrance of individual character with such blatant irreverence for human life. By the end of the book, the words &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;killed&quot; have been stripped of horror; men pass from life to death (and into eternity) like the ticking of a clock. If I didn't grasp before how &quot;unhitched&quot; the military mind is, I certain! ly do now. None of us has the right to judge the hearts of men (boys, really) who were shoved into horrifying meat grinders like the battles at Ia Drang. Their families and their surviving comrades deserve an outpouring of compassion and love and listening like never before. But never again must we capitulate to the inevitability of war! The &quot;Vietnam Syndrome&quot; is not &quot;over and done with;&quot; it is time for we Americans to face our legacy of self-deception. As architect of U.S. foreign policy and head of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff in 1948, George Keenan wrote: &quot;We have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population... In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity... We should cease to talk about vague and unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.&quot;... That is why we went to war in Europe, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. Instead of remembering battles and thinking about the next war, let us, for once, begin to seek a way of life that makes war impossible. That, indeed, would be the finest tribute to the fallen at Ia Drang!"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Having seen the movie with Mel Gibson when I saw this book I had to read the &#34;real&#34; story of that first battle betweeen American and the North Vietnamese Army. The movie only covers the &#34;heroic&#34; conflict at LZ X-Ray and in in true Hollywood style omits the &#34;real&#34;, little known, ambush of the column going to LZ Albany and the unnecessary slaughter of hundreds of US troops.This book is simply but brilliantly written and goes into extensive details which are quite profound and a sad reflection of the political arrogance of the powers that be at the time ( viz President Johnson and his staff ) and the folly of the military system.* The reports from the troops who survived the engagement are profound and are testimony not only of the brutality of the combat in November 1965 but to that which was to follow over the next ten years.The later interviews with the North Vietnamese offices involved makes fascinating reading of what their strategy was at the time. Hal Moore (and McNamara ?) from these first engagements realised that despite the NVA body count ( 12 NVA for each American ) there was no way that the American voting public was going to stand the stream of body bags and mutilated troops who would flood America in the years to come.In summary, an essential read for anyone who has more than a passing interest in the Vietnamese conflict in the 60's and 70's as it covers so many aspects of the battle; the battle itself, the men who lived and died, Lt Col Hal Moore himself, and the aftermath of the two encounters ( the battle ) with the NVA.* A companion to this is &#34;Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, Mc Namara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff&#34; by H R Mc Master which delves in detail into the political background of the entrance of Amercia into the war. Not an easy read and so full of facts and details that one has to grind through it.

The best account I have ever read of a battle from the point of view of the men who fought it, backed up with some of the larger details that give context. Moore didn't say as much as he could have, but if you know a bit about the history of the Vietnam War you can fill in the gaps with what he does say. Many of the things the military does today are based on lessons learned from this battle, and others like it.One of the blurbers described this book as eye-stinging. I can't think of a better word for my emotional reaction. The citizen soldiers who fought at LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany displayed incredible courage and grit. I was struck by the difference between this book and books of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The military that fights in the sandbox today is very different than that of the Vietnam War. Many of today's shooters are professionals, career military men who provide structure to an all-volunteer force that is increasingly disengaged with wider society.Moore's men were a combination of conscripts and volunteers, but they were the best of citizen soldiers, non-professionals who shouldered a tough job for a short time in solidarity with their countrymen. One of the best parts of the book is Moore and Galloway's homage \\"Where have all the young men gone?\\". They tracked down as many of the men who fought at Ia Drang as possible, and told their stories after the battle. These were men from every walk of life, so the impact of their lives and deaths was diffused throughout society. This was the last great hurrah of the citizen soldier, and he fought damn well."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I spent two years in the Army in the early 70's and I thank God almost every day that this war was near ended when I was in.The one thing that you can take away from books like this and those about Korea and WWII in the Pacific is that we can't seem to get our hands around the mentality of the enemy. Unlike European \\"gentlemanly\\" war with a code of honor, these enemies were more like our \\"make war a living hell\\" Sherman and Grant. Vietnam should never have been lost but we were on the road to fighting politically correct wars much like we are doing now in Afghanistan and Iraq. During WWII we learned that the only way to defeat the Japanese was to make war so bad that they wanted to quit. Fire bombings, nuclear bombs, whatever it took. We lost those lessons in Vietnam and left our boys stranded stragglers for years, calling them every name in the book instead of respecting the work they tried to do. We've now become more \\"patriotic\\" in our thinking but our gutless leaders are still concerned about making war what it is, a living hell to the vanquished.Sorry, just mad.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"In WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG, the team of Harold Moore and Joey Galloway, have given us a devastating and detailed account of battleIn November 1965, 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, were helicoptered into the Ia Drang valley to destroy whatever elements of the NVA they found.From the time they landed until two days later, they came under constant attack. Colonel Moore formed a perimeter and fought a classic defensive battle, but it was a close run thing. They were probably saved by air and artillery coverage; even so, there are grim scenes of Americans being killed by misplaced napalm and artillery rounds.The authors have no qualms about recounting the explicit gore of battle. One soldier tried to move another and \\"it seemed like his entire brain fell out...\\" And a few lines further, \\"Rodriguez is hit...His guts are on the ground.\\" Everywhere, the screams and curses of dying men, and once, \\"Oh my God, forgive me.\\"One of the righteous complaints of the American soldier was that he was sent into combat with a toy for a main battle rifle, and Moore/Galloway present us with innumerable examples: \\"I got my hands on one that didn't work. The second one didn't either, nor the third.\\" And \\"I fired a burst from my M-16 which promptly fell apart.\\" One man...\\"got another man's M-16 and tried to fire it but it was inoperable. I took his .45 pistol...\\" and Old Ugly came through for him. The propensity of the M-16 to jam was notorious and \\"every third man was down in the bottom of the hole with a cleaning rod, cleaning the rifles.\\" One sergeant sighted on an NVA: \\"He fired at me and I fired back. I got off one round and my M-16 jammed.\\"If the M-16 was a dirty joke, so was its puny 5.56mm cartridge. \\"I got him with my first round, saw him drop...and start to crawl forward...I sighted very carefully and saw him jolted by my second round, but he kept coming...\\" Another soldier: I fired twice. I hit him but he refused to go down, he kept coming and shooting.\\" Many soldiers bought civilian ammunition at their own expense.Moore's battalion was successful in its defense, and was relieved by Robert McDade's 2nd Battalion. They in turn were marched out to another area (Albany) because the B-52s wanted to bomb around Moore's old area.On arrival at Albany 2nd Battalion found a gourmet Army meal waiting for them: hamburgers, mashed potatoes, and string beans. Under combat conditions, a meal for the gods.Unfortunately, on the fifteen mile march, 2nd Battalion had become strung out along the trail, and had entered an area occupied by some two and a half fresh NVA battalions. They knew McDade was coming and set their ambush.While the lead elements were still eating their hamburgers, the NVA followed the old Sun-Tzu/Mao dictum \\"When possible, attack the enemy while he is in motion.\\" They attacked the column, fractured it, surround the invidual companies and started to decimate the encircled elements.Here again, we are treated to page after page of desperate valor and butchery. If there is any major flaw in the book it is probably this kind of repetition. Also, there is such a large cast of characters that, unlike fiction, we can seldom identify with them. After a time the butchery becomes commonplace, and because the participants are unknown, they become only names, and numbers.Men scattered and tried to make it to other units, while NVA death squads searched for the wounded, and executed them in the tall elephant grass. One soldier, wounded and not expecting to survive, booby-trapped his own body with a grenade, and waited. Artillery save him, but others were not as lucky.By sunrise next day, one company of 112 men had forty-five dead and more than fifty wounded. Only a dozen could walk. At the end of Albany, only four trucks were needed to carry out the non-wounded, this from some four hundred men who marched in.2nd Battalion claimed a body count of 403 NVA with an estimated 150 NVA wounded. If these figures are valid then the casualties were about equal, and Albany was a grim standoff.After the fight, in camp, the survivors were given a victory dance. They had showered but due to some glitch, had not been given fresh clothing. When the local laides got a whiff of the blood, sweat, and feces smell of the uniforms, most of them opted for the powder room.Ia Drang; who won? Both sides claimed victory. Moore's battalion inflicted losses of about 5-1 on the NVA. When the Americans talk about Ia Drang, they talk about Moore's battle; when the Vietnamese talk about Ia Drang, they talk about the ambush of McDade's battlaion. Perhaps the American army had some reservations about Albany too. McDade retired as a colonel in 1975, while Moore retired as a lieutenant-general.This is a book that \\"tells it like it is.\\""},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This book satisfies on so many levels. First, it provides an accurate historical account of the most important battle of the Vietnam War -- the first one. From this examination, the reader can understand why the U.S. reached strategic failure in Vietnam. Until its publication, there has never been an accurate accounting of this savage, enigmatic battle, only partial analysis and limited oral histories. This book presents the battle from the battalion commander view and integrates it into the goals of the war. Second, the book presents, in unsparingly frank terms, the sacrifices and courage exuded by average American boys in combat with an ardent foe in a foreign land. After reading this book, I dare anyone, ANYONE, to question the scope and magnitude of the sacrifices made by those who served in Vietnam. The depictions of combat and its accompanying loss will stay with the reader for a very long time. Lastly, for all military buffs, it's a great read and allows you to engage in some healthy hero-worship. In honor of those who served and died on this tragic battlefield and all those of Vietnam, a paraphrase of the inscription at Thermopylae is in order: &quot;Go tell the Americans, stranger passing by, Here, obedient to their laws we lie.&quot;"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This is the book that makes those bad things come alive for all to see, to understand, and even to experience in some remote way. This book is moving beyond comprehension.Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway are owed a debt of gratitude by every veteran for recording these events. Certainly the men who walked in, flew in, and supported LZs X-Ray and Albany are owed an even larger debt for what they endured. But their due would have no measure without this book--this tribute of love--having given form to their days in hell. Not since Bernard B. Fall's &quot;Hell in a Very Small Place&quot; has any book captured the courage, fear and grime of battle so completely as &quot;We Were Soldiers Once, and Young.&quot;Many things stand out in my mind about this book's account, but three head the list.First and foremost, one simply must stand in awe of the courage and brotherhood of the common soldier under fire. He did uncommon things with uncommon valor, and Hal Moore and Joe Galloway captured that essence with vivid clarity--on page after page after page.Secondly, like the men on the ground, the Huey pilots loom larger than the lives they touched. They did what had to be done under the most horrifying of circumstances, and they did it because brothers out there needed it done. In the Ia Drang, they did the impossible routinely and set the standard for those who followed them.Thirdly, I was deeply moved by the tribute the authors paid in the book's Prologue to the enemy they faced in the Ia Drang. I faced the 66th PAVN Regiment for two years. They were highly motivated and as courageous as any soldiers who ever took the field of battle. The Ia Drang was their introduction to South Vietnam, and yes, they were a worthy enemy.To all of these men, friend and foe, I salute you and thank you for your sacrifices. You are owed more than you can ever be paid. To Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, I owe you my sincerest thanks for your service and for this book--and a tall cool one on demand.If none of this makes sense to you, read the book. Then it will."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Lieutenant General Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway have written what is probably the definitive book on the soldier's experience in Vietnam. Covering the American campaign in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, the book focuses in on two battles: the Battle of LZ X-Ray, where an American battalion held off attacks by a People's Army of Vietnam division, and the Battle of LZ Albany, where another American battalion was decimated by other elements of the same PAVN division.The Ia Drang campaign set the tone for Vietnam, demonstrating both American solders' fighting abilities and the strategic failure of American planners who could never take the initiative away from the enemy. When the battle was joined, the Americans would fight well and inflict devastating losses on PAVN forces, but the battles were almost always fought on their terms, at times and places of their choosing. American willingness to fight the war on their terms ensured the North Vietnamese would win in the end, as long as their will to fight persisted.But while Moore and Galloway touch on these factors, their focus is firmly on the young men who fought and died in the Ia Drang. Moore, the battalion commander at LZ X-Ray, and Galloway, a UPI reporter who rode into LZ X-Ray to cover the battle, have done meticulous research to produce a well-written, easy to read account of the two battles that drags the reader headlong into the terror and tension of the fighting. We are introduced to each soldier in turn, and the book is careful to note the circumstances of each American death as best it can. The result is a gripping read, impossible to put down.Moore and Galloway are to be commended for their hard work and dedication in writing this book. There's no way to understand how it truly feels to be trapped in a desperate firefight when people you love are dying all around you, but this comes as close as humanly possible. After decades of propaganda calling Vietnam veterans either emotional wrecks or horrible baby killers, \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" finally puts out the truth about the Americans who fought and died for their country in a war few cared about. It is a fitting tribute to all those men."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I first saw the movie, was moved, then read the book. This book is FANTASTIC -- best book on small-unit combat tactics I have ever read.It deals with two battles: one at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray and another a day later at LZ Albany, a few miles from LZ X-Ray. The battle at LZ X-Ray lasted several days under the direction of Lt. Col. Hal Moore. Moore, the American battalion commander, and Joe Galloway (a UPI photographer present throughout the battle) wrote the book. This battle was a testament to the military leadership and skill of Moore and his company commanders, as well as the spirit of his men, along with the chopper pilots and artillery units that supported them.The second part of the book deals with the battle at LZ Albany a few days later and illustrates what harm a poor commander can do to his men. The Americans were slaughtered.This is a book on tactics and on leadership. But it reads like a novel and will have you riveted to your seat!!! (Moore has quotes from many of his men and the tales they recount make you want to cheer and then cry.) After reading this book (in one night -- I couldn't put it down! -- I recalled the line by Frederick March after William Holden's death in the movie, \\"Bridges at Toko-Ri\\". March asked himself, \\"Where do we get such men? Where do we get such men?\\"This is a GREAT book. Get it!!"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I've been reading a lot of books featuring stories of combat forces lately: Black Hawk Down, Ghost Soldiers, Flags of Our Fathers, and now this book by Lt. General Moore. I guess what I'm looking for is some sense of what this abstract quality is that causes men (and now women) to place themselves in harm's way and potentially give up their lives and their futures for their country. I'm not sure I've found it yet in these books, but I've seen hints of it. The only thing I know for sure about this quality is that I don't have it and the men in this book do.Lt. Gen. Moore, the author of this book, was the commander of the 450 men of the 1st battalion, 7th cavalry when they engaged in combat in the Ia Drang valley in November, 1965. This was very early in the war and these men were not sure what to expect. This book tells the story of the horrific battle that followed from a very human standpoint. While there was significant carnage, General Moore treats not a single casualty as a statistic. He describes every soldier in the most human of terms, who they were, where they were from, and their actions in this battle. The tactics and flow of the battle are described flawlessly, but mostly this is a human story.One of the closing chapters of the book is given to the families of the men who died, to tell their side of the story of losing their husband, son, or father. I'm not a man often moved to tears...but I was moved to tears. Battle can never be considered casually. The cost is just too high.I don't think I've found the answer to my question yet and probably never will, but this book moved me a step closer. At the very least, I've concluded I'm a selfish idiot with a comfortable life whose biggest concern is whether to order the chicken or the fish. The people who wear the uniform...are heroes."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is the best rendition of tactics in Vietnam and a must read for small unit leaders. We Were Soldiers Once...And Young takes us on a journey with then Lieutenant Colonel &quot;Hal&quot; Moore and Joe Galloway, the reporter who climbed on a helicopter heading for a &quot;hot&quot; landing zone, into the Ia Drang Valley. The North Vietnamese baited the 7th Cav into a firefight in order to determine how the U.S. would fight, and they learned quickly in the first major engagement of the war. As the battalion commander of the 1/7 Cav, LTC Moore engages in a battle for the lives of everyone in his unit. The lessons which Mr. Galloway and LTG (Retired) Moore illustrate in the first section of the book will drive home the need for discipline and leadership during combat. The first section makes the book worth the read, all by itself.Fortunately, there are two other sections, equally as dramatic. The second section lets us walk with the 2nd battalion, 7th Cavalry Division into an ambush quickly established by the NVA. This time almost the entire unit is wiped out. Due to poor discipline (not putting out security, letting soldiers smoke and talk on break, etc..) the 2/7 is completely surprised. This book uniquely juxtaposes the difference in success between two similar units, with very different leadership, morale, and discipline. The lessons are stark and vivid.The third section, titled Aftermath, describes life on the homefront - not the protests and demonstrations, but the military families waiting to hear how their soldiers are doing. The description of Western Union hiring taxi drivers to deliver death notices is emotional. Some wives were awakened at 4:00am in the morning and handed a yellow slip with the words, &quot;The Secretary of the Army regrets to inform you that your husband .... was killed in action, etc..&quot; If you don't want to go to bed crying, don't read this powerful account of how coldly the institution cared for families during the Vietnam era. My wife and I have both spent over ten years of service in the Army and found this section to be a powerful motivation for helping to care for military families.As the title of this review indicates, the movie is coming soon. Mel Gibson will play Joe Galloway, and other famous actors will take part. I highly recommend this account of courage, leadership, discipline, success and failure. This book spent several weeks on the New York Times best seller list, and almost every senior leader in the Army recommends it as mandatory reading for leaders at the tactical level.

I'd watch the honor roll nightly on t.v., taps playing in the background, feeling vaguely numb as the names of dead soldiers scrolled across the screen. Read this book if you want to feel and smell the battlefield and get to know the men who served. This is a poignant, well-written account that provides a lot of historical information without being dry and difficult to follow. It is an incredibly personal account without being sentimental. The author occasionally and very subtley gives insight into his own view on the war and the politics that kept it going, but focuses on his soldiers and their struggle to survive the deprivation and slaughter of a meandering war without end. You will get to know the soldiers by name. You'll learn about the lives they left and, if they were lucky, the lives they went home to. You will not be spared the carnage of the battlefield, but this is no Rambo-esque mythology of the glories of war. It is a sad paen to the slaughter of so many young men.I had preconceptions about the kind of book a Lt. General might write. Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway shattered them. This book will haunt you."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I was interested in this book because of the movie previews (I read the book first, then decided to watch the movie because of the book), but what made me buy the book was a quote from now-retired General Norman Schwarzkopf: \\"Anyone who wants to know what the Vietnam war (or any war) was really like should read this book.\\"I respect his opinion even more since I read the book. I was in the Army (also, one of my brothers was in the Vietnam war, and another was in the Persian Gulf war), so I may be a little biased and I can see how this book could be a little boring or dry to some people. But, if you can get past that and really read the entire book to understand what is being described, it tells an incredible story.Much of what was written in this book, I've never heard before (possibly because I was born in 1970 and really grew up after the war) and it changed my perspective of the war. Don't get me wrong, my wife is Vietnamese and I've been to Vietnam twice in the past 3 years, so I've instinctively done a lot of research on the war and Vietnamese people. But, since everything I know about it is not from personal experience, I've always depended on what others have written, and there were many things I read in this book that I've never read before.The bottom line is that if you are Vietnamese or know any Vietnamese people, you were in the Vietnam war or anyone close to you was in it, or you were in the regular U.S. military or you're close to someone who is, this book will move you as it did me. Even if none of the above conditions applies to you, if you read this book you will have a good understanding of what the Vietnam war, people, and wars in general are truly like."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I would make this required reading for all potential leaders. Moore is not anti-war, but not pro-war, either; he recognizes it needs to happen, but he wants us to see it in detail. The first two thirds of this book are factual descriptions of the battles at Ia Drang in 1965, intelligently using monologues by those involved for paragraphs and even pages at a time. It is the battle through the words of those who were there, and in its detail and portrayal of context it is not only highly accurate but charged with a vivid sense of what the experience must have been like. After this, the authors speak on the political context of the battle, and then follow the families of American dead afterwards. To read that chapter takes a bit of determination. Gen Westmoreland gets lampooned and Chinese intervention get mentioned in the wrap-up after that, which is as tightly written as the rest, and includes criticism of American political methods and aims in the war. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I was priviledged to serve with the 1/7th Cavalry along side of the survivors of the Ia Drang fight as I arrived in April 1966 as a replacement. I continue to maintain contact with many of them at reunions.It is almost impossible to relay the full horrors of combat into words, but Joe Galloway (who was there) definitely gave his best shot at it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to share some of the memories and feeling of our United States fighting forces. The men in this fight conducted themselves in the highest degree of valor and dedication to their fellow soldiers.To learn more about Rick Rescorla (pictured on the cover), I recommend the book \\"Heart of a Soldier\\" which portrays his entire life.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"People alot more educated and articulate than I have covered the points of why this book is as good as it is. I only want to add two points.If you are a Soldier, Sailor, Airman or Marine, you MUST read this book. Weither your job is to close with and destroy the enemy or repairing mess kits, you will learn more about leading troops than any leadership FM Ive ever seen. If youre Combat Arms, you will learn that even when everything goes wrong, you can still not only hold the line, you can win. You will see things that you can apply in training your own troops. You realize that the harder you train on the basics(even on the seemingly unimportant things), it all comes together when the poop hits the propeller and your men go on \\"auto-pilot\\". Even if youve \\"been there, done that\\" there are lessons to learn. Always remember, if you stop learning, the enemy just beat you. I went through 2 highlighters on my copy.The other thing is that I saw an Ia Drang vet, CPT. Nadal, CMDR A/1/7, wrote a review here. What I wanted to add is thank you, CPT. Nadal. You and every trooper at X-Ray, Albany, Columbus and everyone in support elsewhere in this Op (and their families) showed us what CAN be done, regardless of the odds. You, and ALL of your brother and sister vets, set the standard for the rest of us to follow. This was just one battle in the war. There were 1,000s of others that only those who were there will ever know about. Each one proved that teamwork, training, audacity, knowledge, bravery, comradery and faith can carry the day. We can only hope we, as the next generation of warriors, lived up to the example that you and the rest set. God bless you and yours."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"There is a part of this book that takes it from being a very good war story to an exceptional account of human behavior. It is near the halfway point, when the author takes time to cover the human side of the enemy. It would seem that the enemy, were actually people. They wrote poetry, kept detailed diaries, and looked at pictures of their loved ones between battles. Kind of takes the edge off the illiterate ... peasant impression we are often left with when dealing with the commies.The book's main focus is on a few days of intense battle during the Vietnam war. It seems like a lot longer, as an incredible amount of carnage happens in this short time. The intensity of the battle scenes is as descriptive as I've ever read, actually getting scary for quite a bit of the story.There was a time reading this book when I thought it would be lacking in writing pace. That is, way too much action without a breather. That would have been a minor flaw in an otherwise exceptional book. But even that is a not a problem, as the book winds up appropriately.It begins with a brief history of Vietnam, and pulls no punches by stating that maybe we should have not stuck our noses in there in the first place, given the incredible cost in human life. But a soldier follows orders, even when it means walking through grass so tall you don't see people coming your way until they are a few feet from you. Having to decide whether that person is friend or foe in the split second you have must have been a terrifying experience.And so it goes for battle after battle. While it may not be of interest to have the names of many killed listed to the reader, hey, these guys paid the ultimate price and deserve recognition. The book also wisely winds down at the end, giving the stories of what happened to the few who survived the carnage. Some of these stories are happy, some sad, but that's the point. These were ordinary people thrown into extraordinary situations, and their return to \\"normal\\" life would never look the same again.This book should be required reading."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is a carefully written and professionally crafted tome jointly written by two eyewitnesses and participants in the events described therein. The two authors, Harold Moore (a retired Army Lt. Col) and Joe Galloway, then a UPI reporter, met on the battlefield of Ia Drang and became lifelong friends and associates. Moore actually commanded the U. S. Army force dropped into a remote rural area of South Vietnam controlled by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in November of 1965 in what became the first recorded engagement between the U.S. Army and the NVA.Firstly, the field tactics employed by Moore's men were experimental in nature, since the was the first time Air Cavalry had attempted to systematically employ attack helicopters to quickly deploy men to and from combat. Since this tactic meant consecutive serial moves of portions of the attacking force to the forward area, it meant those dropped first were, by the very nature of the tactical strategy, left in an extremely vulnerable position in terms of their openness to enemy attack during the initial period of time, before their numbers and strength were reinforced. Of course, the NVA understood this weakness and sought to exploit it to the maximum extent possible, attempting to quickly overrun and overwhelm the sixty some soldiers already on the ground.Thus the battle was joined, and the Air Cavalry troops were quickly surrounded and portions of the force cut off from the others. Moore painstakingly describes the escalating set of circumstances that brought the force to a crisis point, and details how both they and the NVA systematically attempted to deal body blows to the opposing forces. From the beginning the casualties on both sides were considerable; in the several weeks of its duration, almost half the U.S. Army forces were either killed or seriously wounded, while on the other side, there were as many as 1,800 NVA casualties. There were literally bodies of dead enemy soldiers stacked like kindling at various points of the campaign. In the end, the superior firepower and sole control of the skies by the U. S. Forces served to balance the otherwise overwhelming numerical superiority of the NVA units in the area. Once the smoke cleared, the NVA forces had (at least temporarily) already evaporated, while the U.S. forces returned to the main staging base, leaving the battlefield deserted.This is an absorbing and interesting book to read, both because of the subject matter and because of the personal beliefs and values of the men who authored it. One comes way from the reading experience convinced these men honestly cared about the men they fought beside, and that they tried to do the best they could to win the engagement and bring everyone home safely. Of course, in war this is something no one can succeed at, yet one appreciated the sentiment and the kind of honest values and degree of integrity such sentiments represent. This is a book I can heartily recommend, as I know you will find it as intriguing and provocative ad I did. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"First off, I want to confess that I was drawn to this book after watching the movie roughly 20,000 times. I don't read too many books, but felt I had to pick up this one.That said, I've never read a book that moved me so much. This book is unique in so many ways. First off, I'd say at least 1/3 of the book (probably more) is made up of direct quotes, taken straight from interviews with the soldiers who survived that bloody battle. Col. Hal Moore will set up the scene, then let the soldier's own words tell the actual story.Secondly, this book isn't told entirely from the US point of view. While writing the book, Col. Moore and Joe Galloway spent a great deal of time meeting with Lt. Gen. Nguyen Huu An, commander of the Vietnamese battalion that Moore was facing that day. How many war books actually give you first hand knowledge of what the enemy was doing, straight from the enemy's mouth?Lastly, the non-fighting aspect of the story. Moore calls the war's innocent victims the \\"Golden Star Children\\". Those who had to deal with the death of a father, a brother, a son, a husband. I have to say, the room got a little dusty when I was reading through this chapter, and I'm not normally prone to dusty rooms, if you know what I mean.In closing, outstanding book that is a must read, whether you loved the movie or hated the movie."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

He insisted on going back to check for MIA. It haunted him (still seemed to haunt him today) did he miss count, did he make a mistake, was someone lost? Yes, he told a story but you could feel the anguish he felt.The description of Moore's visits to family of he dead soldiers was gut wrenching.I like how it was told from two sides (the soldiers with some stories of their families). I like how the book was raw/gritty with first hand about the fighting and raw \\"hate\\" for the enemy. But when the battles was over, years later, the respect shown to the commanders on the Vietnamese side was clear.As a solider he just watched as politics stripped their ability train/fight and it must have been brutal to do his job knowing their was always one hand tied behind his back."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Like most people, I have seen the 2002 movie \\"We Were Soldiers\\" starring Mel Gibson. This movie was directly inspired from Lt. Colonel Hal Moore's book. I was greatly impressed by that movie and I expected a lot from this book that I finally got around to read.I can say I have not been disappointed, although to be honest this book is not written to be a war thriller, a frantic page-turner such as Phase Green or Hamburger Hill. This book is mostly about a precise, richly detailed description of what was the first major engagement in Vietnam of the mythic First Cavalry division. About two thirds of the book is devoted to the three tense, bloody days that Lt.Col. Moore's battalion spent at landing zone X-Ray in the Central Mountains of South Vietnam. It is a story as harrowing as it can be and you can only feel deep, sober respect and admiration for what the soldiers endured there, and the unflinching leadership the military commanders demonstrated. Not only Lt. Col. Moore, but also the other company commanders of the battalion showed great courage and skills during those 3 days.But the third and last part of the book actually covers a much less known battle involving another battalion of the First Cav that immediately followed the ordeal of Lt.Col. Moore's soldiers at X-Ray. This one happened at landing zone Albany, and it was an unspeakable tragedy that did not end as a victory such as the fight at X-Ray. Led by Lt.Col. McDade, this battalion was basically wiped out when it get caught, more or less willingly, into a trap setup by the North Vietnamese. Strung out in a long line of march over a couple of hundred yards in unprepared positions, all companies separated from their commanders who were gathered with McDade for a situation conference, and woefully surprised by the savage enemy assault, McDade's battalion was promptly exterminated. I found the story of what happened much more distressing than the battle at X-Ray as there was no escaping from the utter massacre. It is painful to read.In conclusion, I was fascinated by the destiny of one of the main protagonists of the story, Rick Rescorla, who was platoon leader at the time. He is one of the few people who actually got involved in both X-Ray and Albany battles as he was with B Company, 2nd Battaltion, First Cav, which participated in both battles. He not only managed to survive but he also accounted for himself in stellar fashion during the battle, showing great resolve and leadership. He is actually the man portrayed on the cover of the vintage edition of the book. But wait: incredibly enough, he was also at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, 36 years later as Security Manager for brokerage firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He successfully oversaw the evacuation of most of the firm's employees this morning and died a tragic death when he went back in WTC Tower 2 to help out others still inside and the tower then collapsed. This man was truly made of the stuff of heroes, and Once We Were Soldiers is what it is all about."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Devotion. Honor. Duty. Leadership. Selflessness. Courage. Unquestioning loyalty. Regardless of the merits of the war - this book tells the story of young men who performed their duty to their utmost. It does what few books do - it lets you in to the lives of all the characters, to varying degrees. And it follows up on many of them after the war and/or the battle. It covers the home front as well. It is, as one reviewer noted, heavy on military terminology, but it doesn't detract - if anything, it adds to the story for those that can easily understand it. For those that don't, it's not a distraction in the least. The book is graphic without being gratuitous. It honors those who fought the war - on both sides. And it touches on the realities of the war - the political dilemmas and policy failures, but it doesn't do it in a critical way, but as observations by one who was at the mercy of those policies. I saw the movie and loved it. And the book is so much better, more engaging, and - literally - awesome. The Vietnam War may have been misguided, but few can doubt the courage and dedication of those who were asked to fight this war.

These soldiers were surronded & fighting for survival. If anyone has a low oppinion of draftees of the vietnam era, they should read this book & ask themselves what was I doing? Or what would I have done?. The soldiers who fought there & elsewhere were very courageous. The story reflected in the book shares the horrors of friendly fire, the sights, smells ect. of battle.

It's a gripping, edge-of-the-seat narrative told in a style reminiscent of Ambrose, with heavy reliance on first-person recollections. The book recounts the 1965 Ia Drang Battle, the first set-piece engagement between U.S. and NVA armies in battalion strength.People who've seen the recent, excellent movie may think they know the tale. But the movie tells only half the story, ending with the conclusion of hostilities at Landing Zone X-Ray. Left undepicted by Hollywood is the ferocious fighting at Landing Zone Albany, where the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry is ambushed and encircled by numerically superior NVA reserve forces. The description of the LZ-Albany carnage and gallantry is some of the best writing on warfare I have ever encountered.I was pleased to see that the movie (one of my favorites of recent vintage) raised public consciousness of the sacrifices and bravery of our Viet Nam servicemen.

This stands easily alongside anything Stephen Ambrose ever wrote. The authenticity is one hundred per cent because these authors were there - their passion, emotion and commitment to their mean comes screaming through the pages. As does their frustration with military top brass and politicians. I'll never forget finishing the book on a Sunday morning, sitting up in bed, tears streaming down my face as I read of the impact of the deaths of those brave men who perished.

I was humbled by the almost nonchalant way in which these men spoke about their role in the battles at LZ X-ray and Albany. I have't cried in reading a book in a long time but I could not hold back tears when reading the chapter at the end in which the wives and children back in the States told their own tales of how the battle impacted their lives. This book made me feel so very proud of all of our men and women who went to Vietnam, fought for our country, risked everything, and in far too many cases, never came back home."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

We can debate how the war was fought forever. One thing we can not debate is how brave the soldiers who fought there were. And this book clearly shows that."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

The appendix listing the last known whereabouts of the survivors was particularly moving. I referred to it repeatedly. Two things could make this book better. One, more detailed maps to complement the narration of the battle. Two, the dedication to the troopers killed in the battle are in alphabetical order by rank although no rank is listed beside the names. This arrangement was confusing when trying to determine if a trooper mentioned in the narrative survived or was killed in action. It would be easier for the reader if the men were listed in alphabetical order. If rank is important to the writer perhaps the rank should be appended to the name.Aside from these minor criticisms, the book is captivating for those interested in military history and the Vietnam War in particular."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Very entertaining, especially if you are keen on all the details about a four day span when the two battles took place.The only thing that bothered me is that the book celebrates Lt.Col. Moore (the author) as a hero and Lt.Col. McDade is heavily criticized for his actions. The number of casualties from each battle were similar -- more KIAs at LZ Albany, but not dramatically more. Each lost life is a tragedy, but how much worse of a job did McDade do than Moore? McDade certainly had a less defined mission to work with than Moore, and more difficult or uncertain terrain. McDade may have made some serious blunders, but it would have been nice to have his perspective on his decisions. Regarding Moore's decisions/actions, even the \\"Lost Platoon\\" getting separated from the rest of the battalion is excused at the outset by putting the blame on an overzealous lieutenant.In spite of needing a little bit more balance in comparing the two leaders, I would highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a detailed war history."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Utterly straight forward with no holds barred. If you want confirmation of my review please read General Moore's AAR (after action report).

What is compelling and extremely powerful are the author's straight forward, un-filtered account of the true face of battle. This is not a self-serving, ego driven account.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"In 1965 I was with the 5th Division on Colorado after returning from Korea. I was to be assigned to an engineer battalion as fate had it, the army's way, I had been promoted to E4 out of my MOS and they reassigned to HQ &amp; Band Support Command, working for the division transportation officer, I was really a cat operator, sitting behind a desk. My first task in the summer of 1965 was to take away the equipment of several companies, and two battalions and get them ready to ship. I did not know where, or why. They went around the base saluting officers with &quot; Garry Owen&quot; I had no clue what these guys were forming up to be. I later came up on orders for Viet Nam but had only 6 months left on my hitch and re-upping was not a high priority. I have always felt &quot;fate&quot; played a hand in keeping me alive, I know not for what, and I missed something very bad in Viet Nam. I read this book, which is the story or the Air Cavs arrival in Viet Nam, the same troops I had help ship out months earlier. The book ripped my heart out, it was as if I was there and knew everyone of the guys mentioned in the book, I didnt really, but we all knew people just like them. Not a day goes by that I dont thank God that I am still alive, and I think of those who died in Viet Nam, and in particular this particular battle. Very common men (boys) with a mountain of courage. This is a story that has to be told, and often, lest we forget. I went to the memorial and it brought me to tears, it still does, as does the memories of those who died in this encounter. Some for the right reasons, others due to the stupidity of military command. To those who survived this battle, my hat is off to you, I doubt many could have survived the test."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"American soldiers in Vietnam were similar to American soldiers in wars prior and since. They fought with dedication, loyalty and skill. They were motivated, well led and informed. They knew for what they were fighting and why and recognized the importance of their contribution and sacrifice. Yet the popular mythology is very different.General Moore and correspondent Galloway have made an invaluable contribution to the truth by publishing this most unusual joint memoir - how often do soldiers and journalists team up? Together they have produced one of the classic battle books of all times. Though written in a self-deprecating manner it is impossible to read this excellent book and not be completely in awe of the leadership abilities and dedication of then Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore.Moore took his new battalion - then an experimental airmobile unit - into what turned out to be an incredibly one-sided battle against seasoned, tough North Vietnamese regular forces. The Americans won that battle due in part to their supporting air and artillery but mostly on the shoulders of the soldiers and their leaders, from Colonel Moore all the way down to the squad and fire teams.We Were Soldiers goes a long way to restoring the rightful pride that Americans ought to feel about our soldiers in Vietnam. This is a book that belongs on every American's shelf and is one that you will want to go back to and contemplate from time to time. It is an absolute must read."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"For a long time I have been biased towards reading only WW II histories and therefore thought that no book could describe war better than MacDonalds 'Company Commander'. Well, I was wrong, and this is the book that convinced me of this. This is without a doubt the harshest, most vivid picture of war I have yet to see between the covers of a book. Moore describes, literally, every moment of the most ferocious battle in Vietnam. And unlike the movie, which only shows you half the battle, he tells about the second big NVA attack that decimated the Americans. In this book you will see war in all of its horrific colors, like you have probably, never seen before. In fact it almost makes a war historian not want to study war any more. There is no glory here...only bravery and terror and horror and pain. Pleasse take time to read this book that is oh so different from the movie...you will not be disappointed..."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I am not a professional historian but simply have a deep interest in learning more of history and, in particular, American military history. But, I like most the historical narratives that have a story to tell. Ones that include the impact on the human spirit. Real life stories of the horror and heroism of war. Moore, in &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and Young,&quot; does a masterful job providing enough technical detail to paint the images in your mind while not bogging the reader down in so much techical stuff to overwhelm and bore. At the same time, he tells a very poignant and moving story. I particularly liked the closing chapter in which the stories of the families back home and the impact the loss of loved ones had on their lives. I intend to visit the Vietnam War Memorial again on my next visit to Washington and find some of the names of the brave men who lost their lives at LZ X-ray and LZ Albany those fateful days. This is a unique chronicle of war and a must read for anyone striving to have a greater understanding of the complex and political conflict we call the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"In this work, Moore carefully reconstructs the battles of the Ia Drang Valley in great detail by employing both his personal memories of the experiences, as well as those of other men involved in the bloody conflict. The personal nature of the accounts presented in this work adds great credibility to Moore's claims. Each man, though incapable of knowing the exact details of every aspect of the battles, adds greater clarity to the overall picture through his personalized interpretation of his experience. The horrible realities and incomprehensible fear of taking part in such a conflict come to life for the reader through the painful memories of the men who experienced the battles first-hand, both taking bullets and having to watch their friends die at their sides. One unifying theme runs throughout the accounts of the contributing soldiers; each soldier gained a healthy respect for the perseverance and fighting capability of their under-armed, but not incapable enemy of the North Vietnamese Army. Though the American fighting force enjoyed much more powerful equipment and maneuverability with their Airmobile divisions, the North Vietnamese fought with unquestionable bravery and ferocity regardless of the strength of the enemy's weaponry and technology. Moore believes this indicated a great deal about the enemy's determination that would continue throughout the duration of the bloody conflict.Though the Americans inflicted casualties upon the North Vietnamese regulars at a ratio of 12:1, Lt. Gen. Moore knew this statistic did not accurately represent an overwhelming success for the American fighting forces involved in the battles of Ia Drang Valley. He and the soldiers that fought under his command witnessed firsthand the unquestionable sacrifices the North Vietnamese proved willing to make in fighting the American forces for their cause. Not only did the Vietnamese prove exceptionally determined in fighting for their cause, but they also exercised a battlefield effectiveness that demanded the respect of the American fighting force. In short, Moore argues that from the outset of the battles of Ia Drang Valley, the American military had engaged an enemy that they could not afford to underestimate in neither capability nor determination and willingness to take on the larger and better-equipped American military.Another important aspect of Lt. Gen. Moore's narrative includes the insight he provides into the realities of the American foot soldier's experience in this conflict. Surrounded by dying comrades and making unimaginable personal sacrifices, the men who fought for America in Vietnam forged a bond that only they can fully comprehend and respect. The love and loyalty depicted in the accounts of Moore and the other men involved in the Ia Drang engagement helps the reader to identify with the situation of the American soldiers fighting a war that they had not fully grasped, nor understood the severity of, until their closest friends fell victim to enemy fire in a merciless conflict. In this respect, Moore's and his soldiers' accounts of the battles of the Ia Drang Valley give the reader an understanding of the conflict in Vietnam that transcends the impersonality and limitations of mere battle statistics concerning numbers of killed and/or wounded. Moore shows that many heroes fought in the Ia Drang Valley, on both sides of the conflict, and regardless of overall judgments and interpretations of the Vietnam War, these men warrant respect for their bravery during those horrendous days in mid-November 1965."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"It's difficult to add anything that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece by Lt. Gen. Moore and Joe Galloway. Everything about it is well done. It captures the ferocity of battle like few other books ever written. The language used is perfect.I would like to add a couple personal notes. I taught juvenile delinquents for several years. I put together a long unit about Vietnam because I think it is often neglected in public school history classes and because I had a lot of freedom in what I taught. It was very extensive and included an entire day touring a National Guard aviation unit where the kids could tour a real Huey and a visit by a Marine Infantry vet with two tours. I ran through it at least once a year, and it was very popular even with the other teachers. I used Lt. Gen. Moore's introduction to this book as the introduction to the class every time I taught it. I would draw unit patches and medals all over the board and just stand there and read the introduction to \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" in its entirety. I don't think anything ever written better captures what it was like to be there. The introduction to the book is worth the price of the book.It made me choke up every time I read it, and it caught their attention for the rest of the unit on Vietnam. That's saying a lot from kids who were expelled from public school."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

It's about William Tecumseh Sherman's war, the man who said, \\"War is Hell...\\"The actual quote from Sherman, a future president of LSU, was \\"There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell...\\"This book is about that hell, the hell of Vietnam where technology came fact to face with hand-to-hand combat. It was bloody, it was brutal...But it was also heroic. \\"Heroic\\" not in the sense of a John Wayne movie, but in the sense of heroism described in Walter Lord's epic book on the Alamo, \\"A Time To Stand:\\" \\"All men know fear. Perhaps, in the end, the hero is the one who, knowing that fear, marches on...\\"There were lots of heroes in the Ia Drang Valley in November of 1965. This book is about those heroes--on both sides.Written by General Hal Moore and journalist Joe Gallaway, who were there, this book addresses the heroism and humanity of that battle--- the first direct confrontation of American \\"helicopter soldiers\\" and North Vietnam regulars. Fought at the very start of the war, it remains the turning point of that war, politically, militarily and otherwise.It is striking in General Moore's respect and admiration for his men as well as for the men his forces were trying to kill. He felt a deep sense of empathy for the familes of the men who died on both sides. He is indicative of what a military man should be--He doesn't like the killing, but he does it because it is job, his duty. Duty, Honor, Country. But he never loses sight of humanity, his humanity, the humanity of his troops and the humanity of the troops--the enemy--they are fighting.Pages 335-336 (hardback edition)contain a moving descripton of his visit to the family and to the grave of one of his fallen troops. The soldier's widow describs him kneeling at the grave of his soldier. It may be the highlight of the book. His later reconciliation with Gen. Nguyen Huu An, his Ia Drang adversary, and their subsequent visits to the battlefield make this book even more meaninngful.If you want to read about the glories of war, go somewhere else--read fiction, a novel or something. But if you want to read about the realities of war and the men who fight it, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book does an excellent job of describing two chaotic battles in a very organized fashion. The authors are well acquainted with the subject matter as they both lived through the events described in the book. Harold Moore was the Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry. Joseph Galloway was a reporter for United Press International. The authors also did a lot of homework. The \\"Acknowledgments\\" section indicated that they spent ten years doing research for this book. The clarity with which the book is written indicates that this time was well spent. In addition to conducting extensive research in the U.S., they also traveled to Vietnam and interviewed several of the North Vietnamese leaders who fought against them. This research allowed them to describe the battles from both sides.The first part of the book describes the Battle of LZ X-Ray. The early stages of this battle were very chaotic. The authors, however, were able to clearly describe the events in a chronological and easy to understand manner. This process is then repeated for the Battle of LZ Albany. The end result is an easy read.This book is also an excellent supplement for anyone who watched the Mel Gibson movie. Events in the movie are sometimes confusing. This book does an excellent job of clarifying many of the troop movements. The maps alone are invaluable in describing how the battles unfolded. Bottom line: although this is a factually accurate history book, it reads like an adventure novel. Any reader will clearly see why it was selected by the Commandant of the Marine Corps as his choice book for 1993."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book was outstanding it took a very large ordeal and shrunk it to the story of the 1st battalion, 7th cavalry. And the personal accounts that these people had in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam. This was one of the most significant events in America's history. There were some 450 men in this battalion; they were immediately surrounded by some 2000 Vietnamese soldiers that would only stop fighting when they were all dead. It told the story of the unselfishness that our American soldiers have for each other; probably one of the most touching events through out the book. These soldiers cared for each other all the way through the battle.I recommend this book to people who like attention grabbing books because this was definitely one of them. Also if you like learning about Americas history this is the book for you it hits many points and makes you question what we did and why did we do it. I personally don't like to read but this book was well worth it and I did not want to put it down once I started reading it.

I cried for the young men who fought and died and for the brutality of war. This is a subjective review.In 1967 a retired infantryman, a veteran of WWII and Korea, told his 18 year old son,&quot;Don't volunteer. Our politicians won't fight to win this war, and the South VietNamese can't win it. You would just be fodder.&quot;Even though I grew up in the military and intended to volunteer after college, I believed and honored my father's advice. He knew to give it because men and boys such as those described in this book had already paid the ultimate price.As I watched from stateside for the next several years, I knew that many others (including high school buddies of mine) were still paying that price. I still honor my father's wisdom, but also honor the men and boys who followed their country's &quot;leaders&quot; at such a price."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This book written by General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway is just an incredible book that tells the story of 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore. They were dropped into a small clearing in the la Drang Valley where they were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers where one of the fiercest and significant battles of the Vietnam War was fought.I've had the pleasure of meeting General Moore and hearing him speak several times ... about this book and the battle and it instantly becomes apparent why he is a legend and how lucky his men were to have him as their commander. His affection for the men under his command is very apparent and NY Times said it best when they said 'the men who fought and died in Ia Drang could have no finer memorial than this one'.If you're looking for a book that glorifies war, this is not that book. I think the authors want to portray the realities of war and all of the death and destructions that it lays in its path. General Moore also wants to highlight the American spirit and how the friendship and love soldiers in the field develop for each other and how it keeps them going and fighting.This book has also been turned into a movie called We Were Soldiers staring Mel Gibson."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

And Young is on of the best action/war novels of its time. Unlike most authors, Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway make this book accurate in many ways. They didn't have to do research or ask the young men who have lived to tell about those three horrible days, they were both there, right in the middle of it. In the beginning, a French patrol in South Vietnam was killed. In the years to come, the United States stated to send troops in to help push back the invading north. Then in November of 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Moore, were drooped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang valley. The troops were the surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese troops. What happens next? Do the men survive the next 3 horrible day's?Well, you'll have to read the book to find out more. This is a must-read book if you don't want to read inaccurate accounts on what really happened on that November day. But if you have a weak stomach, DO NOT READ this book because it goes into great detail of the wounds that some of the men have received during this battle and all the blood it also talks about. So if you are tired of reading poorly written war books that don't tell the truth about what really happens, then you should read, We Were Soldiers Once. . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I would give this book 10 stars if I could!I have read this book at least 20 times and I every time I read it I am awed by the sheer power of the words. Never before have I read a book that moved me to laugh and cry and ache with sadness like this one. It is not a book about who was right or wrong. It is a book about the strength of the human spirit to survive in circumstances so terrible and horrific that people like me can only imagine. It reminds us of the fact that all of the soldiers (Viet Cong, American, ARVN, Iraqi) are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers. Even today Vietnam Veterans receive little respect or appreciation for what they did, which was their job. I am humbled by the men I met in the pages of this book, not because they were perfect, but because they were thousands of miles from home in a place they didn't know, fighting a war they didn't understand and they did their best every day with no praise or parades or yellow ribbons at home. If you want to read an account of what war is really like this is the book for you.Some of the most moving moments in my opinion are:2nd Lt. Geoghan, new father, dies trying to save PFC Willie Godbolt.Captain Tom Metsker shot and killed while helping another injured man onto the huey.PFC Ernie Savage kept his cut off platoon alive for two days with nothing more than a level head and sheer determination.There are too many moments to write them all down, but each is as gripping as the last.I read the review by Capt. Tony Nadal, who fought in the Ia Drang valley with Col. Hal Moore and I feel like I know him. I would like to say thanks to him and all the men and women who fought, lived, died and were forever changed by that war. Though those words hardly seem adequate."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I am priviledged to know personally Gen. Moore &amp; Joe Galloway &amp; many of those soldiers who fought in the battle of Ia Drang. I am also familiar with the lingering effects of that battle on those who were there, &amp; their friends &amp; family. I've been to the annual reunion in D.C. held every Nov., been to the memorial service at The Wall early on a Sun. morning as the name of each soldier who fought in that battle is read by a &quot;brother&quot; who is there to honor him. Tears flow freely, without embarrasment. There are never enough hugs. The love Gen. Moore has for those men, &amp; they for each other, is unconditional. When I read the book, I felt such sadness &amp; anger that those of us &quot;back home&quot; were lied to by the very gov't. that was allowing our brothers, sons, husbands, lovers, to be put through such horror - &amp; Ia Drang was only the beginning. When I first met Gen. Moore &amp; thanked him for writing the book, his response was &quot;I had to. I had to. Those men must not be forgotten. America must know of their bravery.&quot; Those men will never be forgotten. And, FINALLY, we learned of their bravery.Also, to correct the synopsis, Joe Galloway did not &quot;accompany&quot; Gen. Moore to LZ X-Ray. He was able to &quot;bum&quot; a ride on a resupply helicopter the night of the first day's battle (Nov. 14th) only after getting permission from Gen. Moore.I was quite surprised by the 9/4/97 comments of Russell L. Ross,Albany 32, ref. changing the book from history to fiction. If Mr. Ross was a member of the 2nd BN who was at LZ Albany, his anger should be directed at Lt. Col. Bob McDade, whose stupidity put his battalion in a position to be ambushed &amp; massacred! I'm also at a loss ref Ross's rambling comments about Jack Smith &amp; the mechanics of the helicopters. I can assure Mr. Ross, there was nothing ficticious in the account of that battle!"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Today we have become complacent to short wars, \\"smart\\" weapons and few casualties. Journalists constantly poll for our opinions and ratings on \\"how the war is being managed\\". War is neither about management nor polls. War is about leadership, survival and sacrifice.Gen. Moore and Joe are survivors and leaders. These men understood what they were getting into. They did not fight for medals, Pulitzer prices or news polls. They performed their duties courageously against a strong and equally determined enemy.If you want to know what war is, this book brings the message home loud and clear. War is about the failure of political leadership and about the incredible leadership of soldiers who carry on orders knowing what the outcome maybe. Leadership is about the guts to tell those under your command that some will die yet no one will be left behind. That when the fight starts, you will be the first one to walk into the battlefield and the last one to leave it. This kind of leadership is not accomplished through fancy PowerPoint presentations or \\"briefings\\" kept to within 10 minutes. This is accomplished through character and this story contains tons of examples, from the rifleman to the platoon leader to the Command Sgt. Major, all real people all real heroes.This book also teaches us about respect and humility. Gen Moore and Joe talk about their foes with respect for in the end it was their battle too. Warriors who did not hide behind non-combatants nor used cowardly tactics as so called freedom fighters.Gen. Moore teaches us that as hard as it may be a senior officer's job is first and foremost commanding his troops. A senior officer has no business getting into the fight. They let their company grade officers and NCOs run that part, while they ensure everyone stays focused and alive. Imagine how awesome our school systems would be if we allowed teachers to teach and parents to raise their children. Do your job, let others do theirs and help when you're asked.For NCOs this is also a textbook in what is required of them, for they too are leaders and their example will determine the outcome of a battle as well as the lives of those under their care. They influence enlisted and officers alike.After the events of September 11, 2001, it is extremely important to understand what it means to sacrifice ones life through service to their country (military service personnel, firefighters, teachers) so that others may live, be free and have a chance to a better life. Rick Rescorla, whose picture appears in the front cover of the book, knew this first hand. He sacrificed for the last time on that fateful day by directing many others to safety while ignoring his own at the World Trade Center tower.This book has a message for all Americans who care and respect their country."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Critics of 'We Were Soldiers....' have lauded it as the definitive statement on how life really was on the battlefields of Vietnam. And certainly the detailed research collected and presented in this book is extremely impressive; full kudos to Messrs. Moore and Galloway. But does 'We Were Soldiers...' make for good reading entertainment? For this reviewer, no.Firstly, the book is simply a (non-fiction) account of a 1965 battle at the Ia Drang area in Vietnam. Harold Moore was one of the leading commanders at that battle, Joseph Galloway was a reporter watching all the fighting. Clearly it was a horrific, gastly battle (..actually, several battles over a few days). Hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Vietnamese soldiers perished, many more suffering from terrible physical/emotional injuries. Moore/Galloway do fine justice in capturing the horror.Unfortunately the authors spend a tremendous amount of time giving mention, sometimes briefly, on all the hundreds of American participants during the battle. With so many characters and the minute details of their actions I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. No doubt Moore/Galloway wanted to make sure every participant in this nightmare got their full credit, which is certainly commendable. But as for a reading experience ... I found it pure drudgery after only a hundred pages. Less would have been more.In addition the book make me feel uncomfortable about Harold Moore and others fighting at Ia Drang, in an unexpected way. While Harold Moore goes into some length criticising the Johnson administration about its Vietnam policies, he then talks about his visit to Vietnam (many years after Ia Drang) to speak with Vietnamese generals who fought on \\"the other side\\". I felt his comments did not do justice to these guys who lost a great many more soldiers than the Americans. And a couple of the quotes which call Vietnamese as \\"gooks\\" brought back a most unpleasent sense of deja vu.Bottom line: stellar research wrapped into a difficult, and disturbing read. Mandatory for military history bluffs, a definite miss for all others."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I read this book in two days; gripped by the horrific scenes that needlessly ended so many futures, so many opportunites to love and make this country free here at home.The author's story, it seems, comes from the macabre records of the graves registration.His precise records of the operation, troop movement, even the ballistic reports of the deaths are compliments of the US taxpayer supported army records. The author creates no new drama, no new hope.Thankfully, he depicts the absurd,Roman circus,that war is. Our lower nature enthralled, we lean over the blood stained pages of something so sacred.I confess,it is sick.The end of this book contains the only art, the only truth of the matter. The true writers of this book are the parents, the brave wives, and children of the men who were placed there to fight or die. It is the reality of their pain that brings us back to the beautiful treasure of life and it's hope. Many will say,don't you dare disrespect the sacrifice these men made for their country.No,I wouldn't dare. I ask you to look deeply at the facts of the war in Vietnam. Respect the sacrifice of those men,all 58,000 of them,and the 100,000 suicides, the poisoned, the thousands of homeless, and incarcerated Vietnam veterans. Honor too, the millions of dead, and forcibly emigrated Vietnamese, who are scattered all over the world. Honor them by finding out the truth of why this war was fought. Start with the Gulf of Tonkin, and go on from there. The stones aren't heavy. They turn over rather easily. Ask and you will find out who made billions in profit from ensuring that this war went on, and on. I did, and I honor the dead of all sides of war, even more.They are twice the heroes. Because they had two enemies to fight.Hell, Healing, and Resistance coming out this fall by Plough publishing will give you many of those reasons to be proud of those men. The 400 pages of personal stories and fact jammed history of what really happens in war, is endorsed by famous and proven veterans, Nat! ional research centers, and teachers, Hell, Healing and Resistance will be a landmark portrait of the true nature of the beast we mistakenly perceive as inevitable.

I found a number of problems with some of the incidents stated. One vet whom I have interviewed presented a far different picture, one that criticized American commanders for an unnecessary number of deaths. It is important that battle history be as factual as possible, so future combat leaders can avoid pitfalls suffered previously. Amazon has asked that reviews discuss the book and not the author. But with this book it is impossible to criticize the book without criticizing the American commander, Hal Moore, for apparent battlefield errors. I agree that the book should be read.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is an account of the first large scale encounter between the North Vietnamese Army and the Americans. Prior to this battle the Viet Cong had fought against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.(ARVN) The success of the Viet Cong had led the North Vietnamese to think that they could win the war by conventional means in 1965. They started to send large detachment of troops down the Ho Chi Min trail. The command problems the North Vietnamese faced was that it took literaly months for their troops to travel the length of the trail. The original plan which led to this battle was for the North Vietnamese to blockade a large town and then to ambush the ARVN relief column.The problem was that whilst the units were moving down the trail America committed large numbers of units to the war. This battle was not only an experiment for the North Vietnamese it also was for the Americans. Previously the French had problems in fighting the Vietnamese. Although they had modern forces their units were slow and the Vietnamese could make decisions about when to give battle. The Americans developed the notion of \\"Air Cavalary\\". Helicopter born infantry which could be quickly dropped in areas in which enemy troops were concentrated. This battle was the first combat experiance of Air Cavalary.Broadly what happened was that the North Vietnamese units failed in their attempt to trap an ARVN column. The Americans dropped an air cavalary unit in an area which had concentrations of the units which had been involved in this attack. The North Vietnamese had a superiority in numbers of troops but no artillery or air support. They decided to attack anyway. There were two distinct battles. One was an attempt to destroy a unit of 400 Air Cavalary troops which initially landed. This was not succesfull as the Americans were able to use artillery and air support to destroy the attacking North Vietnamese. The second was a ambush of American relief forces had been landed and decided to retreat after the completion of the first battle.The result overall of the engagement was inconclusive although it led to both sides thinking that they could win. The Americans inflicted a kill ration of something like 12 to 1. As a result the American commander thought that he could win a battle of attrition. It was from this battle that the search and destroy missions and body counts came from. The North Vietnamese although came out of the battle thinking that they could win. Despite the lack of artillery support and air support they had badly cut up one American column and they had inflicted casualties on the other.The book is pretty much an oral history of both battles. Like any oral history it gives a fragmented picture of what went on as it moves from one eye witness account to another. Not surprisingly as the book is written by an American the account has the veneer of heroism over it. Although in any battle there are different types of heroism. Whilst the American troops were clearly brave and the dependence on supply by helicopter meant that the troops on the ground were not supplied with water(preferance was given to ammunition)the North Vietnamese had to fight with light weapons against a vastly better armed enemy."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

It's not just a book on war but on leadership, it greatly describes how both Lt. Gen. Moore lead his men but how each of his subordinates lead as well.While it never deals with why we were there it doesn't need too. Instead it tells a story of how our troops fought together like brothers and died together like brothers. It is easy to grasp Moore's love for his man in both the way he treated them then and how he treats them now, He not only names what most of his men did after the battle but names each man killed, where he was from, and a bit of personal history of that man.This books strong point though is the fact that when possible Moore lets the men who were there tell it like it was.I would not only recomend this book for the military types but and Viet Nam buffs, but to anyone who truly wants to know how to lead peopleGod Bless all those went, and God speed all those who were brough home."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I decided to read it and am very glad I did. The battle of the Ia Drang valley is told graphically and well. The heroism of the soldiers there is astonishing. Many soldiers in the battle were veterans of WWII and Korea and state in interviews that this battle was the most vicious fighting they had ever seen.The battle scenes are retold by the soldiers who fought there, and as harrowing as these passages are, I was able to read them with fascination and admiration for the soldiers while not becoming overly emotional. But as some other reviewers have stated, the emotional part of the book is what happens to the families back home. It is reading through these heart-wrenching passages, that I too, broke down in tears reading about the feelings of loved ones who lost family members there.Lt Gen Moore and Joseph Galloway are to be commended for writing a wonderful book about some very brave soldiers who fought as valiantly in those few days in November of 1965 as any American soldiers have ever fought in any war in the service of their country. I salute them all.The director of the upcoming movie has written an open letter to the men of the 7th Cav telling them he will respect their valor in his depiction of them. I hold him to his word.

When encountering graphic descriptions of combat, at Ia Drang, I imagined every soldier killed or maimed could have been one or both of my boys (in reality they had not been born during the Vietnam era). The heart break of the surviving spouse, child, parent is poignantly told. We should all be continually praying for peace. But, it is also a story of brave and honorable men. If war does come, I hope our soldiers are of the caliber of Moore and the 7th Cavalry. For those of you that served in Vietnam, thank you and God bless you.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Being an enthusiastic reader, I couldn't wait to get this book in my hands. Having read some of the reviews here, I did have doubts about it's quality but after reading the book, I will say that if you are like some who were evidently looking for a flowery novel with perfectly written prose and a plot sewn together with the precision of Gone With The Wind, you will most likely be overwhelmed in the beginning. It is not an easy read but a good one if you take your time. If you're a reader who doesn't want to think, avoid this one. You won't be able to get through it.Don't be frustrated by the author's obvious (and admirable) desire to give names to the faces of those heroic soldiers wrote about. It is not necessary for you to even remember the names to enjoy the book though it will enhance your sense of \\"being there\\" and the emotions derived from knowing the real people behind the tale .This was written to one end and one end only in my opinion-to let you know what it was really like to have fought in that unnecessary war. It does not, however, rely on the gore usually found in novels about combat (especially the Vietnam War) but more on drawing you into the chaos and intense pressure these brave soldiers were subjected to while fighting in this new kind of warfare. Descriptions of violence are there but are not the grotesque Hollywood type usually found in books on this subject.Having been a fan of military books and movies since childhood, I can say without qualm that this is the finest I have ever read (three times already in only 5 weeks)and would recommend it to anyone who desires to know the truth of this awful conflit and gain first hand knowledge of the what and why that caused it to occur.

His initial chapters describe the training and the strategies behind airmobile forces. Having already seen the movie, I expected to read more about the effect of the battle on the home life of the involved families, but the book limits itself almost entirely to the intricacies of battle.Let me warn the readers who lack military expertise: General Moore wrote in explicit detail of the ground maneuvers. A person who has no recollection of Vietnam's geography will need a map better than the one in the front of the book. Additionally, plan to read in large sections at a time because reading a page or two at a time confuses the descriptions of who is supporting whose flank, who is farther west, and so on.Overall, a very interesting book with just enough human detail to portray Ia Drang as a personal experience at the same time that it was a military event."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"We Were Soldiers shows how the Ia Drang battles were a microcosm of the American experience in Vietnam - exhibiting both the valor and courage, and the almost laughable incompetence of the bureaucratic U.S. military of the time. The book also breaks new ground in directly approaching the real NVA commanders from the battle and getting their inputs and insight.This book tells two clear tales: the first half involving a highly experienced commander leading highly skilled and experienced men into a ferocious 3-day battle, and clearly emerging victorious by a huge margin; the second half involving an inexperienced commander leading raw troops into a disastrous ambush, and effectively losing his battle by a similar margin.The first half of the book clearly and simply describes what has to be one of the great American military encounters in the nation's history. It also illustrates just how important smart leadership and training is in battle. Moore's 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (1/7) deserves to be placed in the same pantheon as the great military units in history, including the Spartans at Thermopylae, Napoleon's Imperial Guard, the 7th Regiment Maine at Little Round Top, and sundry others. The 1/7 inflicted a 4-1 casualty ratio on a far more numerous enemy. Drawing on a slender helicopter-fed supply line, Moore's tiny unit effectively destroyed a force five times its size, and held the ground at the end of the battle.Moore and Galloway manage to put you right there in LZ X-Ray. Electrifying. I have had dreams about that place since reading this book. It is that powerful, and little more needs to be said. The tale of the Lost Platoon is particularly powerful and gripping.The second half of the book, about the battle for LZ Albany, is as plain-spoken as the first and tells a very different and far more heart-breaking story. It illustrates a long list of tactical mistakes committed by the division leadership (none of which, by the way, were committed with Moore's unit) all of which led Moore's poorly trained sister unit, the 2nd Battalion 7th Cav (2/7), into needless disaster and succeeded in helping the NVA salvage victory from defeat. Reading this section is like watching a car wreck in slow-motion, powerless to do anything about it, and saying \\"no, no, nooo....\\" Because neither Moore or Galloway were actually on the scene, this part of the book loses a little of its immediacy; nevertheless this is a painful but worthwhile read.The irony of the LZ Albany battle is that it shows the roots of America's disillusionment with the war by showing the genuine incompetence and impaired decision-making of American leadership at the highest levels.(Hmmm. Sound familiar?)The 2/7 commander, Colonel McDade, though a powerfully experienced soldier, was effectively set up to fail as a commander. From his immediate supervisors on up, everyone turned their backs on him and gave him none of the resources demanded by the experienced and suspicious Moore. None of McDade's troops had any experience in air cavalry doctrine when they were sent to Vietnam. Moore flew into his LZ; Dade was forced to march overland without a clear objective. Moore's men had training; the 2/7 did not.One unit, though chronically understaffed, was given ample training and preparation for their upcoming fight. The sister unit was thrown together at the last minute and tossed to the lions. It was a clear failure of leadership from the division level to the top levels of the Johnson administration.To his great credit, Moore does not mince words and shows great compassion for his brother commander. He also provides an anecdote showing Commanding General Westmoreland's complete cluelessness regarding his troops; the remnants of McDade's battalion were treated to a roadside chat in the rain with Westy while they held their thanksgiving dinner in their hands. Needless to say, all of them cared more about their food than about the general.If every American unit had been trained to or near the level of Moore's, the Vietnam war might have had a different ending. The wisest decision, in the end, would have been not to go at all.This book is not poetry; it is not written to the level of Xenophon's Anabasis or Victor Hugo's description of Waterloo in Les Miserables. This book, however, will stand as a part of true war literature. Perhaps the best battlefield descriptions ever done. Also the clearest account of why it was wrong to go to Vietnam, and exactly what mistakes we made there. A lot of anti-war people would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I didn't see the movie and I'm not a military history buff. I just happened to read the book because I couldn't find anything else that was interesting to read, and the photo insert of the men and their families caught my attention. Needless to say, I was incredibly moved by this book. It was written in a way that was real rather than polished. It was painful and heartbreaking, and I was truly touched by a story I never knew could have happened. I didn't find it to be a difficult story to follow at all. I kept referring to the pages where the authors conveniently listed and described the main players. I did require some outside assistance when it came to the authors' description of the weapons used. Harold Moore was awesome--an extraordinary leader who inspired his men. The gritty images and honest message of this book will stay with you for a long, long time."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"As a young 36 year old woman, I was born about seventeen months after the events in this book occurred. My Grandfather served in the British Special Forces during the second world war, and in the army for close to 20 years spanning before and during that war. I guess, my interest in his war time experiences, (which left him with some terrible physical and emotional scars), has ultimately led me to this truly compelling book, even though it is of another war and time. I saw the movie, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" recently, and was totally stunned and blown away by it. I wasn't simply crying as it drew to an end, I found myself attempting to control the strong urge to sob, as the tears flowed freely, and had found the tears came quickly through various parts of the film as well. After watching it, I took a note of the name of this book, \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young\\", and went on line here and purchased it immediately. This book is incredible and riveting reading, and so very shocking and eye-opening to a 36 year old woman who has only ever known war through her Grandfather's stories. I find the book and its companion movie a truly poignant and moving account of love and courage and comradeship and incredible self sacrifice. The soldiers and other service men (and women) deserved far, far more than the limited recognition they received during and after Vietnam for their courage and self-sacrifice during the years of the conflict. \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young\\" is a book I believe all young people should read, in order to open their eyes about what their fathers, uncles, older brothers, cousins and fellow countrymen, (regardless of their country of origin - I live in Australia myself and many men [and women also] from here served in Vietnam), went through during this conflict, and what they had to do for each other in order to survive. This war may not have been popular politically, but that was not the fault of the servicemen involved in fighting it. These men simply did, what they had to do to survive, and to try to keep their comrades around them alive. As Lt. General Moore says in his book... \\"No greater love hath no man...\\" (than to lay down his life for another). So very poignant and moving. I feel privileged to have read this book, and to have felt (to still feel) deep into my heart and soul the emotions and the love within it. Deepest, sincere thanks to Lt. General Hal Moore and Joe Galloway for putting down in print the stories of these fine, brave men in combat. I highly recommend this book as essential reading. Thank You.

They will never speak of war again. I devoured this book, as I have great respect for the men who fought in Vietnam and little respect for those who sent them there. This book does something that those warmongers of friends that you may have(I do :( ), it teaches them that war is not cool. The sadness in the movies that most of us pick up is masked from them by the explosions of blood that they notice during the sorrow.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"For those who enjoy military history, or want to read a few of the most significant books on the Vietnam war, this book is a must. While newcomers to the topic should start with a more general history of the war, such as Stanley Karnow's &quot;Vietnam,&quot; this book, along with Neil Sheehan's &quot;A Bright and Shining Lie,&quot; will always be one of the classics on this war. The book vividly tells the story of two very bloody battles in the Ia Drang valley, Pleiku province, in 1965: at Landing Zone (LZ) X-ray and, a few days later, at LZ Albany. Lt. Gen. Hal Moore, commander at LZ X-Ray (then a Lt. Col.), and reporter Joe Galloway, who lived through the horror of that battle, aptly describe the chaos of battle in the war's first major encounter between U.S. troops and the North Vietnamese regular army. The authors recount oral recollections of survivors. The book also describes the background of the war, the preparation of the 7th Cav as a new type of unit--air mobile by helicopter--and the mismanagement of the Johnson administration in so many ways: the loss of experienced personnel by the one-year assignment practice, the six month limit on battalion and brigade commanders, and allowing the enemy sanctuary in Cambodia. One of the strongest points of the book is its strong and moving sense of the cost of war to individuals and families: Hal Moore, besides being a top-knotch commander, is a true human being who felt deeply the loss of each of his men, over the years visiting their families and weeping at the graves of his fallen soldiers. This book is a battle history which does not glorify war, but shows it for the bloody, heart-wrenching chaos it is. It teaches that our nation should be slow to go to war, but when we must, it must be conducted with sound policies and tactics that will bring a swift end to the bloodshed and achieve the political goals of the conflict. Families today still mourn daily the loss of soldiers from long-ago battles. The price of war is the highest price human beings can pay. Yet without at times paying this price, both Americans and other peoples who love political and economic freedom would historically have lived in slavery to one political ideology or another. The difficult thing for us as a nation collectively is to have the wise judgment to know when and how to fight. This outstanding book teaches us the importance of such wise judgment when it comes to the nightmare of war."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This was a very powerful opening for me, and I found myself flipping back to the beginning of the book each time the death of an individual soldier was documented. Gen. Moore is an honorable man to the end. He stops short of criticizing his chain of command, despite the constant drainage of manpower and resources just prior to the Cav's deployment to Vietnam.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is the story of the Battle of Ia Drang, Vietnam, in November 1965. It strength lies in great first-person battle accounts. There is also good background information on the US 1st CAV Division, commanders and North Vietnamese units and commanders. The 1-7th CAV fight at LZ X-RAY under LTC Moore is portrayed as heroic stand against the odds, but their are a number of troubling issues. Despite intelligence that there was at least one or more NVA battalions near the Landing Zone, Moore landed without much of a ground tactical plan. Moore seems to hedge whether his mission was merely to find the enemy on the Chu Phong Massif or to assault and seize the terrain. If reconnaissance was the intent, why was the scout platoon not sent in first? If assault was the intent, did Moore honestly think he could assault a larger force atop a mountain with only part of his battalion? Old Apache motto: one man sees as many as ten men; Moore took too many in for recon and too few for an assault.Initially, brigade HQ did not designate any follow-on forces if contact was achieved and allocated only 16 UH-1s and 3 CH-47s to the operation (less than 5% of the division's helicopters). This was a poorly-conceived operation that begged for trouble. Moore surrendered the initiative immediately when he decided to defend the LZ and suffered 40% casualties in the process. Readers should note that the highest ranking casualty was the battalion S-2 (intelligence officer), who was killed while firing at the enemy - not his job. Moore also made the typical mistake of using the battalion scouts as a reserve force, instead of for reconnaissance or security; when the NVA almost flanked his hard-pressed battalion, the scouts might have given some early warning. The 1st CAV division commander should have piled all or most of the division on this effort and new LZs could have been created with engineers. Very little imagination in the infantry community here - no way to win, since the enemy would withdraw into the Chu Phong hills as soon as he had had enough.The 2-7th CAV debacle on LZ ALBANY is presented as a command failure by LTC McDade but brigade again appears culpable with vague orders to march overland to a one-bird LZ. What was the point? Certainly 2-7th CAV was a new unblooded unit that got tired and sloppy and walked straight into a battalion-size ambush. Maps are fair but could be better. Junior officers and soldiers who read this should be careful not to get snowed by heroic visions of glory in this account; the US soldiers fought well but their commanders were new to battle and made significant mistakes that contributed to the casualty rate."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

This has got to be the book which all other ground combat books about Vietnam is measured.In the mid-70s I was on temporary duty at Readiness Command (REDCOM) at MacDill AFB, FL. With me was a Special Forces NCO that told a chilling tale. As a young man he'd been on a radio in Vietnam listening to the events unfold at LZ Albany. Toward the end of the engagement and before re-enforcements arrived the North Vietnamese Army soldiers were walking through the elephant grass executing American soldiers. At the time the location meant nothing to me but imagine my surprise a few years ago when I picked up \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" and discovered that was the engagement to which he referred.Of all the events that are described in detail the one that will stay with me always involves the soldiers that have survived and been brought out of LZ X-ray to Camp Holloway. They're expecting a break for a few days but before the evening is over they're called to go back in and help their fellow comrades that are under fire at Albany. As they lined up and walk past the permanent party hooches to the waiting choppers the fence was lined with Rear Echelon Fellows who couldn't believe their eyes to see these same guys being put back into the fight. I'll bet you anything that everyone of those gallant troops will never forget that walk to the choppers.On a technical level you'll gain a great understanding about the foundation of Air Assault in Vietnam as well as give you much more information than the hour program about the 1st Cav and the Battle of Ira Drang which appears from time-to-time on cable television."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

I lived the battle and led two aasaults. Hal Moore's book is an accurate account of the events of those two days and reflects his love for his soldiers as well as his determination to close with the enemy. As another reviewer described the book shortly after it was published it is &quot;the best description of small unit combat since the Red badge of Courage&quot;. Having just read 71 reviews I note that some of the reviewers criticize Moore on issues of tactical considerations. Without going into a lot of detail the Hueys did well to carry 6 soldiers at the altitude of the central highlands of Vietnam. We did not have good intelligence as to where the enemy was so the operation was planned as a reconaissance in force. Not much different than hundreds of other air assaults by both Army and Marine units during the war. The book was not written to glorify war but to demonmstrate the courage and character of the American soldier."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"The North Vietnamese soldier that Colonel Harold Moore's men captured in the Central Highlands of Vietnam on November 14, 1965 delivered chilling news: \\"There are three battalions [of Vietcong] on the mountain who very much want to kill Americans but have not been able to find any.\\" A few hours later, those Vietnamese made contact with the 7th Cavalry --- and thus began the first battle of the Vietnam War to pit Americans directly against the Vietcong.The killing began right away. Not the killing of Vietnamese. The killing of Americans. Five died in the first few minutes. The hills were a concert of screams and explosions. Hiding behind a termite hill, Moore thought of another man who'd led the 7th Cavalry: George Armstrong Custer. Moore promised himself that he wouldn't let this battle --- Ia Drang --- repeat the sorry history of Little Bighorn.We Were Soldiers Once...and Young is the story of how close Moore and his men came to being slaughtered like Custer's troops. The numbers are spine-chilling: In four days of fighting --- with the enemy sometimes as close as 75 feet to the American line --- 234 Americans died. In this remarkable minute-by-minute account, you get to meet these men. And more: You watch each soldier die. And you get to grieve for every single one.The book's real subject isn't war. It's leadership. Consider the situation. Americans had been advisers in Vietnam, but they had never really engaged the enemy. Moore was career Army: West Point, Korea, advanced studies in fast-moving, guerilla warfare. In June of l965, he began training his battalion for combat in Vietnam. In August, the Army pulled all six of his newly-acquired second lieutenants out. In August, any soldiers who had 60 days or less to serve were separated from the 7th Cavalry. So when Moore and his unit sailed to Vietnam, they had already lost 100 of their most experienced men.The difference between an under-trained unit that survives a fierce battle and one that becomes legendary in defeat is leadership. Listen to some of the ways Moore managed his troops. He told his men:--- \\"Only first-place trophies will be displayed, accepted or presented in this battalion. Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield, and death for the individual in combat.\\"--- \\"Decision-making will be decentralized: Push the power down. It pays off in wartime.\\"--- \\"Loyalty flows down as well.\\"--- \\"I check up on everything. I am available day or night to talk to any officer of this battalion.\\"Or this: Before the battle started, James Galloway (a United Press reporter who became co-author of Moore's book 25 years later) was watching Moore's soldiers shave as he boiled water for coffee one morning before the battle. Moore passed by. \\"We all shave in my outfit --- reporters included,\\" he snapped. Galloway immediately repurposed his coffee water for shaving.And, finally, this: \\"In the American Civil War, it was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as possible. There were sound reasons for this. If you are riding and your soldiers are marching, how can you judge how tired they are, how thirsty, how heavy their packs weigh on their shoulders?\\"Moore applied this philosophy conscientiously. He flew in to Ia Drang on the first helicopter. He led his men from the front. When he saw men from another company beginning to haul one of his dead soldiers out of a foxhole with a harness, he snapped, \\"No you won't do that. He's one of my troopers and you will show some respect. Get two more men and carry him to the landing zone.\\" When it was over and it was time for Moore to turn over command, he requested a full battalion formation. One soldier recalls, \\"We stood in formation, with some units hardly having enough men to form up. Colonel Moore spoke to us and he cried. At that moment, he could have led us back into the Ia Drang.\\"But it still wasn't over for Moore. His wife attended as many funerals as she could. And when he got back to the U.S., in April 1966, he visited some of the families of his lost men. One family thought his visit would last a few minutes. He stayed five hours. And he made sure he went with the family to visit the grave, and there he asked to spend some time alone there, kneeling in prayer and memory.This story --- the story of the relationship of a man to the men he leads and the families who sent those men to be in his care --- is why you want to read this book, and read it now. If you're an executive in charge of workers or if you're a parent trying to raise your children, you above all other readers will be able to read through the ugliness and the pain and understand why Moore's men fought and died for him.Should you ever be in Washington, D.C., the names of the soldiers killed at Ia Drang --- and there are 305 of them, in total --- can be found on the third panel to the right of the apex, Panel-3 East, of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. But you don't have to visit the Memorial to learn from them; thanks to Hal Moore, their deepest legacy is in the wisdom he can, in their names, pass on to you."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This ran in Army Times. In addition to being one of the under-reported stories of 9-11, it seems like a remarkable footnote to a remarkable book.\`The bravest man I ever knew'After a lifetime in which he cheated it many times, death caught up with Rick Rescorla halfway up the south tower of the World Trade Center.But like a good soldier, he didn't sell his life cheaply. Death took him only after he had cheated it again, helping to save 2,700 lives by relying on the instincts and the preparation that had served him well in battles on two continents.Rescorla was a retired Army Reserve colonel and the head of security for Morgan Stanley's Individual Investor Group at the World Trade Center. But many readers will be more familiar with him as Lt. Rick \\"Hard Core\\" Rescorla, one of the heroes of the 1965 battle of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam.\\"Rick was the best combat leader I ever saw in Vietnam,\\" said Pat Payne, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment's reconnaissance platoon leader in Ia Drang.Featured in bookRescorla's role in that battle is recounted in detail in the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young,\\" a searing account of the action by retired Lt. Gen. Harold \\"Hal\\" Moore and Joe Galloway. In 1965, Moore was a battalion commander in the center of the battle, and Galloway was a UPI reporter who covered the entire engagement.Even those only vaguely familiar with the book have seen Rescorla's image - he is the gaunt soldier on the cover with the 2-day old beard and the bayonet fixed to his M16.When Rescorla showed up for Basic Training at Benning in 1963, he'd already seen more adventure than most soldiers do in a lifetime. Born in Cornwall, England, he joined the British army's Paratroop Regiment as a teen-ager, then became a military intelligence warrant officer. He served in that position in Cyprus during the violence that wracked that island in the 1950s, then left the British Army for a London police job in Scotland Yard's famous \\"Flying Squad\\" of detectives.He left England for another military job, this time as a commando in the Rhodesian Colonial security force in Africa. From there he came to seek his fortune in the United States.After breezing through basic training, Rescorla was picked up for Officer Candidate School. Last year he was inducted into the OCS Hall of Fame.He graduated as a second lieutenant in 1965, just in time to ship out to Vietnam with the 1st Air Cavalry Division. In November of that year, still a British citizen, he would draw on all his youthful experience in the battle of the Ia Drang.Headed the \`Hard Corps'Ia Drang was the Army's first major battle in Vietnam, and one of its bloodiest. The battle claimed 305 American lives, soldiers who died in fierce combat with a North Vietnamese regiment that also took heavy losses. Rescorla commanded 1st Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and was almost worshipped by his soldiers, who called themselves the \\"Hard Corps\\" after his nickname. But his courage and infectious optimism resonated beyond those under his immediate command.Payne remembers Rescorla \\"leaping off [a] chopper and strutting into our small very beat-up group of survivors\\" during the night. After placing his men to fill the gaps in Payne's line and pausing to speak quietly to each soldier, he walked toward Payne.\\"I was so amazed to see him walking around because we had all been crawling on our stomachs for eight hours,\\" Payne said. Speaking in a low, confident voice, Rescorla complimented Payne on establishing good fields of fire.\\"Then he looked me in the eye and said, \`When the sun comes up we are going to kick some ass.' I will never forget his words or the look in his eye. He said it in a confident, matter-of-fact way. He was not boasting, it was resolve.\\"Rescorla earned a Silver Star for his actions at Ia Drang, and, in Moore's words, \\"went on to establish himself as a living legend in the 7th Cav in Vietnam.\\"But behind the swagger and the self-confidence, Rescorla hid a keen intellect, according to Dan Hill, a former captain who met Rescorla at basic and remained his best friend. This fine mind served Rescorla well when he left the Army in the late 1960s and put himself through college and law school, before going on to establish himself as a specialist in security for financial firms.His will to live came to the fore again three years ago, when he was diagnosed with inoperable cancer and given six months to live. Against the odds, he beat the disease into remission.As Morgan Stanley's security chief, Rescorla brought his belief in the \\"seven Ps\\" - proper prior planning and preparation prevents poor performance - to bear, to the immense good fortune of his co-workers.Morgan Stanley was the largest tenant in the south tower, with about 2,700 employees in 20 floors. But incredibly, only six, including Rescorla and two security folks who worked for him, still are missing. Everyone else made it out alive.Obsessed with preparationThose survivors owe their lives in no small part to Rescorla's quick thinking at a time of crisis, and his obsession with being prepared for every eventuality.\\"He'd take every possible contingency that could happen, and he'd come up with a plan for it,\\" Hill said. When the first plane hit the north tower, the Port Authority told workers in the south tower to stay put. But Rescorla disagreed and immediately executed an evacuation plan he had made the employees rehearse twice a year.The plan worked, and when the second plane hit the south tower, almost all Morgan Stanley employees were on their way to safety. So was Rescorla, who made it to the ground floor, singing \\"God Bless America\\" to calm the nerves of the evacuees.But he insisted on going back upstairs to check for anyone left behind. He was probably still climbing when the building collapsed.His wife, Susan, and his two children likely will remember Rick Rescorla for his generosity of spirit and his dry English wit.But middle-aged veterans of a hellish battle long ago in the sun and the elephant grass are more likely to remember Rick Rescorla as Bill Lund, another second lieutenant in that battle, does: \\"This was the bravest man I ever knew.\\""},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"First, let's look at what this book is not: It is not beautifully written, it is not the story of one person's experience and it is not dedicated to character building. If you are looking for those things, then look elsewhere.Now if you are looking for the smell, the horror, the courage and the sacrifice of the battlefield, then you will find it in this work. Moore and Galloway have written a book that will serve as a textbook for generations of people who want to know what war is really like in a very objective manner - the heroism, the great leadership, poor leadership, mistakes, and occasional cowardice. It pulls no punches and takes people and organizations to task where appropriate. It is truly an amazing work and one that should be read by anyone when a debate on going to war is raging.The book is in three distinctive parts: The fight on Landing Zone X-Ray; The Fight on Landing Zone Albany; and the aftermath of the battles, for both the US involvement in Viet Nam and some of the families affected by it. Moore was the Battalion Commander at X-Ray and gives a very good view of the decisions he made and why he made them. He is able to walk us through the battle and describe the critical actions by both the North Vietnamese and the US forces that turned the tide of this battle and allowed Moore's force to win a victory. There are many first person accounts of different aspects of the battle given by the US soldiers that fought there and also by some of the key North Vietnam leaders.The second part of the book was about the relief battalion's retrograde back from LZ X-Ray to LZ Albany. Moore was not here so all of the reporting was done thru interviews after the fact. He is pretty scathing in some of his assesments of the decisions being made - although if you do not have military experience you might not find the writing scathing enough for what happened. He describes the complecency by some of the leadership on the movement back, the failure to set out decent security and the indecisiveness in the early moments of the battle. He also points out the slow flow of information from Albany to the higher levels of the US Forces. Albany was fought to a draw with horrendous losses on both sides after a North Vietnamese battalion and the 2/7 Cav had a meeting engagement (which means they ran into eachother in the woods). One lead company was almost completely slaughtered, save a few people that had to do an E&E; (Escape and Evasion) in order to get to safety. The book contains three accounts of men that did that.The final part of the book looked at the political decisions made in the aftermath of the war using declassified top secret memos written by Sec McNamara to illustrate that he knew very early in the war that it could prove to be unwinnable, putting the odds at a US victory at no better than 1 in 2. Also, there are personal accounts from the widows and the children of some of the men that died in the battles. Since I am in Iraq right now with the Army, and I have a two year old daughter, I found these passages particularily moving.My only gripe with this book, is that your understaning of it is assisted greatly if you have been in the military. Since I am, it is no problem, but for someone walking in with no experience, a lot of the terminology used and the prose itself will make following the story a little more difficult. It reads almost exactly like an After Action Review, which probably is the proper voice for this piece, but some readers will have problems with it - as evidenced by some of the earlier reviews.The bottom line - very honest, interesting, work. It will help the reader understand battle, and perhaps understand it a little more than they would like to. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This outstanding account of the first major battle between American and North Vietnamese forces in the Vietnam War tells in gut-wrenching, eye-watering detail what close combat is all about. Authors Hal Moore and Joseph Galloway (Moore commanded the 1st Sqdn., 7th Cav., one of the two squadrons involved; Galloway was a journalist on the ground with Moore) have prepared a carefully researched, well documented account of U.S. and North Vietnamese actions at Ia Drang Valley in the fall of 1965. Importantly, they have drawn not just on American sources and their own experiences, but on official and personal accounts of their former enemies.Ia Drang featured the new U.S. battlefield concept of airmobility and the North Vietnamese decided to give battle in a desperate attempt to find out the best way to deal with American helicopters and fire power. When Lt. Col. Moore and the 450 troopers of his 1/7th Cav. air assaulted into a small clearning in the Ia Drang Valley they were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese regulars. The fighting that ensued consumed Moore's squadron. The enemy increased his forces and applied even greater pressure on the Americans, and a sister unit, the 2/7th Cav., was chopped to ribbons. Enemy losses were extraordinarily high ... a price they were willing to pay to learn the lessons that would serve them on future battlefields.The North Vietnamese did learn. They adjusted their tactics and modernized and increased the number of rocket propelled grenade launchers carried by infantry units. Additional heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft weapons were laboriously brought down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to beef up defenses in future operations. By summer 1970, when a division of North Vietnamese soldiers surrounded airmobile troopers of the 101st Airborne Division at Fire Support Base Ripcord, they were a different enemy.By 1970 the Vietnam War was a different war as well. In 1965 there was support for the war at home and Moore's men went into Ia Drang to win, and win they did. By 1970 U.S. forces were being withdrawn and the ground war was being turned over to an increasingly capable South Vietnamese military. At home, support for the war effort had waned terribly and political will was lacking. U.S. units increasingly became casualty-shy. Even so, the battle for FSB Ripcord (see Keith Nolan's &quot;Ripcord: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, Vietnam 1970&quot;) was as complex and deadly as that at Ia Drang. But in the end, the 1st Cavalry Division held their ground and the 101st did not. A clear sign that the war was, for all practical purposes, over.Read Moore's and Galloway's book ... give copies to friends and relatives ... it's a classic that will stand the test of time. Then remember the words of A. E. Houseman after the bloody struggles of World War One: &quot;Life is nothing much to lose, but young men think it is ... and we were young.&quot;"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Moore has done a great service to those interested in the war in Vietnam as well as those who have not experienced the horror of combat first hand.This book about a relatively large scale U.S. Infantry operation in the Ia Drang Valley is very well written. The author tells the story of his unit's fight and subsequent movement well. So well, that it is possible to visualize the battle, the defensive perimiter and keep the individual soldiers -- whose story it is -- straight. Not only is the tale of the battle well told, but the fears and uncertainty faced by cut off troops who could not see their enemy and knew they had to hold their perimiter is brought home to the reader. This story has plenty of heroics, but also a lot of fear, anger and luck.The story also underscores the problem with U.S. strategy in Vietnam. Unlike World War II, our troops were not driving across the country to hold land and capture territory. Many missions, like Moore's, were designed to find and harass a jungle hid enemy, inflict casualties and then retreat to a well protected base. That type of war without gain must have played heavily on the minds of the soldiers who could not measure their sacrifice in ground gained or villages freed, measurements their fathers and uncles had been able to see in their great war.This is a good book. Moore's US infantry are very sympathetic (the chopper pilots merrit special mention from the author), doing a hard job and doing it well. It reads quickly and is captured my attention from the outset."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Had war planners in Washington D.C. experienced what Lieutenant Colonel Harold Moore saw in his first weeks of combat in 1965 the tragedy of America's involvement in the Vietnam War might well have been avoided. In the fall of 1965 Moore's 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment engaged North Vietnamese soldiers at Ia Drang.The Battle for Ia Drang showed for the first time the steep cost American soldiers would pay in their engagements with the vietnamese communists and set into play a frustrating pattern that would persist until the end of the war- American units would inflict heavy casualties upon the communist forces, but the enemy would simply slip away into the underbrush, leaving behind nothing but dead Americans and an empty jungle.&quot;We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young&quot; is Moore and reporter Joseph Galloway's account of the 1st Cavalry Division's initial deployment to Vietnam and America's first combat actions with the North Vietnamese Army. The lessons Moore learned at Ia Drang showed just how difficult victory in Southeast Asia would be for American forces. The lessons learned by Moore and his troops would have served American decision-makers well.&quot;We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young&quot; is both a terrifically exciting narrative about the Battle of Ia Drang, and a cautionary tale about the clash between strategic planning and the tactical realities of warfare. Unrealistic assumptions can lead to tragic results. Good work."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Even though part of the title reads more like an afterthought, I had a lot of thoughts about this book since I read it a few years ago, and none of them were second thoughts.This book is about daring and superb leadership. If there had been anyone other than LTC Hal Moore running his battalion, it most assuredly would have been been overrun in the first major battle of the Vietnam War between North Vietnamese (NVA) and Americans. This was also a story about poor leadership because the book tells about a follow-up battle at Landing Zone (LZ) Albany where the North Vietnamese launch a horrific ambush against another American battalion led by an inexperienced and ineffective commander. The difference provides a sharp contrast of consequences between battalions, and the role of leadership in battle. After this ambush the NVA walk among the wounded GI's during the night executing them while they are calling for mercy or their mothers. The story briefly mentions Spec 4 Howard K. Smith Jr. the nightly news reporter and son of Howard K. Smith, who pretended to be dead in the elephant grass, and survived. Incidentally, poor leadership continued in Vietnam as officers kept changing commands to get their \\"tickets punched.\\" By the time they were beginning to lead effectively, it was time to turn command over to someone else. Hal Moore kept his command protesting the practice, but eventually had to relinquish command to the policy of the day.The Battle of the Ia Drang pits two highly skilled leaders against each other. Moore's tactical skill enables him to predict where and when the NVA commander will strike at every turn. As a result, his unit decimates the North Vietnamese division they landed right next to.Moore is able to make you feel the excitement from the very beginning, before they leave for Vietnam. Reading about the battle, you actually feel what it is like to be hungry, thirsty, out of ammunition, or wondering if your wounds will be treated. You feel comfortable with a commander who promises that he will leave no man behind, and will be the last to leave the field of battle.Equally interesting, is what the author added at the end of the book, a \\"Where are they today?\\" part. It is nice to know what eventually happened to all of them who fought this horrific battle and cheated death.This is primarily a man's story. It is probably even more important for those who served, maybe more so for those who served in Vietnam. But for anyone, especially for those who may think battle is glamorous or glorious, it is a story worth reading.It was a fight for survival."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"As an Infantry Lieutenant who flew helicopters in Viet Nam and a student of military history for the past forty years I found 'We Were Soldiers Once and Young&quot; to be a fascinating read. It is really two books that run concurrently.The first is about the leadership of a small outgunned army of citizen soldiers who were tryng to figure out a way to win against the big guy. This they learned in the Ia Drang and, given that there would be no change in U.S. strategy to negate the knowledge the NVA acquired from this battle the Viet Nam War was effectively lost at that point for the U.S.The second is as close as you can get to that dirt in the face, taste of terror in your mouth, please God let me live through this, feeling that all soldiers experience in battle without your having to endure the actual thing. So engrossing was this part of the book that, although I already knew the outcome, I found myself trying to will some of the indivdual participants in this battle to a different conclusion than the one that was already written for them.This book is an engrossing piece of living history and I highly recommend it.Yes, war is hell and a tragedy almost beyond comprehension. Commanders make mistakes that lose them. all men are not heroes and not everybody remembers things the same way but for those who of you who know a Viet Nam Era grunt who humped the boonies and you have wondered why he is different from everybody else this book will help you understand. For those who want some insight into what happened in Viet Nam and why we lost that war this book will answer some of those questions. For those interested in only a gut-wrenching account of ground combat this book will give it to you with nothing held back. I think we all should read it, and maybe again."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I must say that I saw this movie before I read the book. I was concerned that the first 20 - 30% of the book would be similar to the movie with a review of the soldiers family lives, life on the base, the creation of the unit, and the training. Not that this information is not interesting, but this book was held out as one of the better books on Vietnam combat, not base life descriptions. I turned out to be pleased with the book in that it started out with action and never stopped. I have read a number of books about combat and this one was one of the best I have read - ranking up there with Back Hawk Down. From page 1 to the end there are no slow spots in the book, it is full speed the whole way.The book tells the story of two different, but related battles that took place in 1965. They were the first major battles of the American effort in the war and they were some of the hardest fought. The author interviewed what seams like almost everybody that made it out for the book, and he lets the soldiers use their own words so that you get a full picture of each section of the battle. It is interesting to see how two or three different people in different locations viewed / remembered the same situations. The one draw back to this form of story telling is that there is not a consistent author's style. This is a minor point because Harold Moore did a wonderful job in telling the story and placing the other solders statements in the text. Overall it is a great book that anyone interested in combat or the Vietnam War will need to read."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Books come to me in some odd ways. While walking through a small bookstore in Newark Penn Station, not necessarilly intent on buying a book, I found a copy of We Were Soldiers Once, on the bottom shelf. Having seen the movie by Mel Gibson, I was intrigued. Whenever possible, after visiting Hollywood for history, I always go back to the history to discover the gaps, the real interpretations, and unltimately, what really happened.In this case, I am very glad I picked it up off that bottom shelf.For anyone looking for a glamourized version of war, this is not it. Throughout the narrative each soldier who fell is mentioned, where they were from, their kin, and how they died. There are places where each paragraph for a number of pages references a fallen comrade. You can't help but feel connected to those brave men, especially when you read of their hometowns... places you recognize.For the first major combat operation of the Vietnam War, it certainly defined the war. And for those were thrown into La Drang, it is an experience they cannot forget. Despite being a detailed account of the battle, with all the nuances that would make a military historian proud, I couldn't put it down. In fact, in more than one occasion, I resented my train for arriving on schedule.Equally impressive was the time devoted to the Vietnamese perspective. We conveniently think of our enemies as marching robots, but if anything, Col. Moore paints a picture of an enemy that was struggling with the difficulties of battle and the realities of the battlefield.If you are interested in a highly engaging battle account, especially of a battle so pivotal in the history of our involvement in Vietnam. And if, as a background, you are intrigued with how our military strategy evolved in such a short period - from amassing troops to using air cover, this is a book you will want to read.Finally, if you are simply interested in learning about the men who gave the last full measure of their devotion to their fellow soldiers and their country, pick it up. Don't let this volume sit on the bottom shelf of a bookstore."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This book, besides moving me deeply, made me realize that my (and probably many other people's) view of war is very unrealistic. I rarely think of it in terms of the possibility of running out of food, water, or ammunition. I don't think about the possibility of not being able to dig a foxhole for protection. I don't think about your gun jamming and needing to be cleared and especially not about having it shot out of your hands and being so shot up that it is unusable. This book tells about each of those situations more than once.Beyond that, this book gave me a better picture about what Vietnam was really like. More specifically, many decisions that turned out to be \\"wrong\\" decisions, as well as many good decisions that helped improve the situations for troops that had been sent into tight spots.I have also seen the movie and, while a movie can show things that books can't, the opposite is the same. I am glad that I have both \\"seen\\" and read about this battle. I have to say that the book is better though. It tells not only about Landing Zone X-Ray like the movie, but also about Landing Zone Albany a few days later. Also, the movie doesn't show such things as American soldiers watching enemy soldiers walking around in the open, shooting wounded Americans, and being able to do nothing about it.Overall, this was a very pointed and emotional book book for me, and I highly recommend it. I cannot stress how important a book this is to read. I would also recommend the movie, \\"We Were Soldiers\\".If you want to read other good books about survival against a determined enemy, I would recommend \\"Out of the Depths; The Sinking of the 'USS Indianapolis'\\" and \\"Left to Die; The Sinking of the 'USS Juneau'\\". These are stories of sailors fighting against the enemies of nature and those armed with teeth, not guns. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Perhaps a new modern classic on warfare, certainly one of the definitive books written about the Vietnam War. Moore has given us both a military history of the battle of Ia Drang and a intensely personal story of those who served there. It reads like a book written by a military man. You will not find the beautiful prose of a William Manchester or Bruce Catton, but heart stopping action that will leave you breathless.In this book you will see both the competence and courage of the ordinary grunt, and the incompetence and mistakes of their commanders. This was not a strategic battle planned out in the corridors of the Pentagon, but, like the Battle of Gettysburg, it just happened. Thus, we have an unfolding of an unplanned battle that changed the course of the war.Moore refuses to vilify the enemy. Like any good solider, he has respect for the men who opposed him. They are portrayed as men of courage, insight and dedication. If you only had opportunity to read one chapter, read chapter 20: Death in the Tall Grass. It tells of the story members of the 2nd Battalion surrounded in a field of grass, the terror of that fight is unmatched."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"LTG Harold Moore served in the U.S. Army for 32 years prior to his retirement in 1977. A USMA graduate, class of 1945, commissioned into the infantry he commanded at every level from platoon through division during his career. His first experience of combat was in the Korean War as a company commander. His participation in the Viet Nam war consisted of his tour as a commander at the battalion and brigade levels in the 1st Cavalry Division. He went on to achieve three star rank and commanded the 7th Infantry Division and Fort Ord prior to his retirement. A co-author in this effort, Mr. Joseph Galloway was born and raised in Texas and began his career as a reporter at the age of 17 by working for a daily newspaper. He spent the next 15 years working for United Press International for the most part from assignments in Asia.We Were Soldiers Once... And Young is primarily a first hand account of the two main actions, the combat at LZs X-Ray and Albany, which occurred during the battle of the Ia Drang. LTG Moore begins the story shortly before he assumes command of the 2/23 Infantry Battalion, later changed to 1/7 Cavalry, at Fort Benning. The first several chapters are used to set the stage for the remaining chapters and allow the reader to put the combat actions into perspective in both a historical and strategic sense. Although not the focus of the book the authors provide an overview of the national reasoning that led to increasing American involvement in Viet Nam's civil war and the deployment of U.S. forces, to include the 7th Cavalry Division, to the country. The reader is also acquainted with, at this point, LTC Moore's new unit. LTG Moore details his unit's training regimen, some of the problems encountered prior to their deployment such as personnel turbulence, the key leaders of his battalion, and some of his basic principles of leadership and training that he used to focus the preparation of his unit. The focus of the remainder of the book, in the main, consists of the battles involving 1/7 Cav at LZ X-Ray and 2/7 Cav at LZ Albany. The story of LZ X-Ray is mainly told in the first person from LTG Moore's perspective; however, the accounts of numerous other participants are utilized to provide a more encompassing and balanced account of the combat. The same technique is used when describing the battle at LZ Albany, the authors provide the overall picture of the actions which they then stitch together with the first hand accounts of people directly involved.This book, in very much the same way as Guadacanal Diary, does a very good job helping the reader visualize the battle from both tactical and personal viewpoints. From the tactical viewpoint the presentation of the actions, positions and overall situations of the various units involved is very clear and understandable and done in a way that allows the reader to keep a picture in his mind of what the battle looked like at any given time. At the same time the numerous personal accounts that are used to embellish the account produces in the reader the ability to visualize the heat, death, noise, fright and other factors that served to make this battle so intense and horrific.Unlike other first hand accounts of other battles that I've read the authors conclude this book by taking the time to explain the pain and loss experienced by the families that lost sons, husbands and fathers in the battle. Most often the costs of war are associated with the casualties and equipment losses experienced by the military while the very human price that is paid is overlooked. More than anything else in the book this demonstrates the mutual feelings of respect and kinship felt between LTG Moore and the men he commanded.This book should be read for two main reasons. It provides a very realistic picture of the horror experienced by soldiers in combat and forces the reader to understand that the affects of death in combat effect more than just the unit. It also demonstrates the huge impact that personal leadership, training and experience can have on a unit in combat, either to the unit's benefit or detriment.PJZ"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I read this book while on vacation last summer and I still find myself thinking about it and its' many unforgettable images of war. This is a first-hand account of the first major US battle of the Viet Nam conflict. The author is the commanding officer of the conflict and, while he allows himself a bit of the glory, he makes his men the heroes of his combat history. We get a reasonable amount of background of the events leading to the conflict and the units that will be engaged for the US. This is helpful yet not overdone and we find ourselves following the troops into their field assignment. They were hoping to engage the enemy and the battle began shortly after the first troops were land by helicopter. The strength of this book is the way Colonel Moore takes us through the ensuing battle moment by moment. If this sounds like it would be tedious reading, it isn't. The US forces were facing numbers roughly five times their own and the combat was relentless. We come to know many of the American GI's and, to his credit, Moore gives us the name of everyone involved no matter how brief his appearance in the book. There is a helpful &quot;Where are they now&quot; section at the end that is much appreciated; the reader goes through a lot with these men and most of us do want to know how their lives turned out. As the one battle subsides and many are relieved, another battle soon erupts between the relieving forces and the enemy some distance away. This battle gives us an even greater sense of presence in the combat. One battle is a great success while another is quite a different outcome. Moore does a good job in evaluating why. As a matter of fact, he does a good job of analyzing where we went wrong in our Vietnamese experience. For those of us who came of age during this conflict, it might be hard to acknowledge some of the facts that he lays on us.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I was 15 at the time this action took place.We were told that we were fighting for democracy in South Vietnam.As it turns out that was an ideal that only the men that brought the war to the NVA really embraced.Like most young boys of my generation we were brought up on such films as Iwo Jima,Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,The Flying Tigers ect. ect.It seemed to be the right of passage that each generation was defined by the conflict that they fought in. In a way I couldn't wait to take my turn.Through this book and many others somewhat like it the courage and heroism shown by many of those sent to Vietnam many of them exactly my age in 68 when things really went from bad to disgraceful the year I registered for the draft.The reports I was getting from friends and others just back from thier own private hell in Vietnam somewhat dimmed my enthusiasum for fufilling my right of passage and passing on college and signing up and shouldering a rifle and standing a post.One only needs to read the Lost Battalion by Charles A. Krohn to see that by 68 things were headed,if you can exuse the expresson,south and at twice double time.The first time I read this book I found myself daydreaming that if there was a time an place I would have liked to put my... on the line it would have been with Col. Moore and his men.I know thats patently absurd who in there right mind would ever say that if they had to hop into a meatgrinder a particular one was much more suitable than another.Remember I was brought up on Audie Murphy and John Wayne they never died or made it look damn good when they did.What this book pounded into my thick scull was that there is no glory in war.Only death gore and the memories of the friends that were killed and the manner of thier death for the ones who survived.I know this doesn't make much sense.Yet does taking a helo ride into hell sound like sound advice? What I don't get when the 2nd Battalion renforced the 1st on the third day and had the NVA in full retreat why in the hell didn't they go an finish the job.And whoever ordered those men to march to LZ Albany I would imagine that the spirit of those troopers slaughtered there haunted him the rest of his life.Or at least I hoped they did my god what a trajedy.I am more than humbled by the narative and the stone cold way it is dilivered.God bless those 79 men who never made it home.I echo many who have written here this should be mandatory reading for high school civics students."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Unfortunately, it was one of the worst experiences to have, if you got over there with the Cav during the opening years of the war. Gen. Moore did a superb job saving the day, but it is obvious the North Vietnamese were learning about our military tactics as well as we were learning about theirs. As Harold Moore insists at the end of the battle, nothing happened here at this moment, that didn't happen over and over again. The NVA just hopped over into their Cambodian sanctuaries to regroup and fight us all over again. The stories of the young officers reminded me of the many young infantry lieutenants and captains that wanted so much to get into the thick of this tropical war back in 1965; the pictures of them with their wives and children show that so much. Who would believe it today??I'm looking forward to the movie, and recommend Larry Gwin's book BAPTISM on the following days of the Ia Drang massacre which he experienced. For me, I was glad to be a helicopter pilot in the Delta a few years later with the Outlaws, and miss all this jungle warfare with the Cav; my flight school buddies of the class of 66-14 sure didn't however. We fleshed out the Cav with our class rather completely!"},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This review is of a book is also published in hardcover and softcover.I doubt that anyone will buy an expensive leather-covered book who doesn't at least know about the regular editions, but if you don't this is one to consider. Earlier Leather bound copies have sold well enough to exhaust the supply. You should refer to reviews for the less expensive editions for good summaries.This are a few truly excellent books about the Vietnam War. To my mind, this is the best of the best. The focus is Ia Drang, an early battle that should have alerted the Washington types that United States had bitten off a much bigger chunk than it thought it was chewing. Courage, heroism and splendid leaderhip averted another Little Big Horn.Ia Drang was the first major battle of the war against the regular army North Vietnamese. Then LTC Hal Moore was ordered there on November 14, 1965 with 450 men of his1st Batttalion/7th Cav with orders to engage the enemy, location and numbers unknown. With limited lift capacity and speed, Moore had less than half his men on the ground when he learned his troops had been landed in the middle of a Vietnamese stronghold.There is no point in retelling what the authors write in an account as compelling now as it was when first published. Both went on to more honors in distinguished careers. Moore retired as a general. Galloway completed 16 month tour of Vietnam and returned for three more tours before the end in 1975 and went on to cover many more wars including Gulf I and Iraq.Both sides claimed victory from this battle for different reasons. In reality, the consequence of the battle was the lessons learned and not learned. Each side took different lessons away. The Vietnamese learned to avoid American firepower. McNamara and others saw a vindication of their tactical approach that would result -- they thought -- in a complete NVA defeat.Although he inflicted casualties on the North Vietnamese at a 5-1 ratio and Americans were not forced from the field, Moore does not consider it a victory. but a draw.Americans draw from Vietnam what they want, sometimes without regard to the warriors and sometimes unwilling who actually fought there. Moore is a general, not a politician, and this is an account of two men who were there, not theorizing in a Washington think tank.A reasoned view of the conflict can be found in a book that carries the primary title of \\"Dereliction of Duty,\\" by a now senior Army officer who has served in Iraq combat areas. The commanders who now serve learned their own lessons from Vietnam. There are others who learn nothing."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

When you are reading about men that are shot and have their gun blown out of there hands, so they shoot left handed rather than right, are shot in the throat and can not speak, and still they fight. I was just overcome and moved deeply by the sacrifices these men have continually made.This book has given me such a deep appreciation for our vets, and makes me realize the importance of honoring there sacrifices. These men were amazing and heroic, and I am glad this book shows a true picture of war for all of those who will never have 1st hand experience, but plenty of opinions.Thank you for your sacrifices!!!

Vietnam was almost \\"my\\" war. I served in the Army at the onset of hostilities in 1964 , and lost many good friends there.Many other reviewers have panned the detailed style of the authors ; I view the book as highly descriptive. I am not critical of style if the content is there , and in this case it IS! If a reader wishes to be \\"entertained\\" , then this is not the right book. The movie is much more compelling on an entertainment scale.What does come through the dryly written text , however , is the belief of Hal Moore in the \\"duty , honor , country\\" aspect of military service. I felt a strong bond to him through the integrity he has displayed towards the men under his command. I , for one , would have felt honored to serve with/under him on the field of battle.There are alot of other Vietnam war books that are much more excitingly written , but none of them describe a greater triumph of the American soldier under fire than this one.

I served in Viet Nam in 1969-70 as an adviser to the Vietnamese under MACV. The lessons learned by Gen Moore at this engagement was often recalled in lessons in both my Officer training and later in my mission as an advisor. This book is well written, concise,to the point and informative, written with love and affection for the troops he lead and served as well as those he oppossed. I feel this is truly one of the great factual stories to come out of Viet Nam along with works by Bernard Fall as well as others.

While J.D. Coleman's book, &quot;Pleiku&quot;, provides an excellent overview of the origin of the 1st Cav and the Ia Drang/Pleiku campaign, Moore's work brings focus to the key triumph of it--LZ X-RAY. He humanizes his soldiers in a way few such books have, particularly when written from the perspective of a field-grade office. He also did not gloss over the glaring short-comings of Cav operational planning which led to the needless butchery on the way to LZ Albany. Why airmobile troops were dispatched on a route march, [to clear the area for B-52 strikes!!], then were led by an inexperienced battalion commander, with little or no flank security and other required patrol discipline, seems never to have been answered. Moore, to his credit, does not pull any punches that the LZ Albany battle perhaps should not have occurred at all, and certainly should not have had the outcome it did."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"I read this book back in 1994, and I've just finished re-reading it. It is one of the best war stories ever written. There are two battles chronicled here, X-Ray and Albany. The battle at landing zone X-Ray, where Col. Hal Moore's 1st battalion 7th Cavalry fought three battalions of NVA regulars, was made into the movie starring Mel Gibson. In this battle, the cavalry troopers landed by helicopter and formed themselves into a defensible perimeter before the NVA could attack. X-Ray could probably be termed a victory for the U.S. forces, since they lost about 70 killed in action, as opposed to about 600 confirmed and 1200 estimated NVA.The second battle, Albany, was not in the film, probably because it was a terrible defeat for the U.S. forces. The 2nd battalion, 7th Cavalry, under the command of Col. Robert McDade, was ordered to walk out of X-Ray to another landing zone about 10 miles away. Leading elements captured two enemy soldiers, and McDade called all the company commanders forward for a pow wow. While the men were leaderless and spread out along the line of march, an NVA battalion fell on them and cut them to pieces. The cavalry was able to form a perimeter near the front of the column and, thanks to the heroism of Captain George Forrest, who sprinted through a hail of bullets the 550 yards back to his company at the rear of the column, another perimeter at the rear of the column. In between these two perimeters, along the line of march, was a grisly killing ground in which survivers of the initial onslaught, most of whom were wounded, fought in small groups, trying to stay alive. Bands of NVA walked around, shooting and killing the wounded. Over 150 U.S. soldiers were killed during this battle, and many more seriously wounded. This could not be called a U.S. victory.Perhaps the most moving and important part of this book is near the end, where family members of some the U.S. officers killed in the battle tell the stories of their lives."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Trying to gather comprehensible, story-telling scenes for a motion picture from this jumble of poorly written hodgepodge would have been very difficult-hats off to the screenwriter.Admittedly I, who read at least one to two books a week, was unable to get more than halfway through this one. I pushed myself hard to finish it, but reading again and again about the major screwups by field officers which caused the deaths of so many men and the way the commander (author) never placed blame or showed criticism for those junior to him made me lose all interest. Perhaps later in the book Moore court-marshalled them all and everything came out well in the end.

The high moral tone of the book started with the mention about the Air Calvary's historical links to Custer. How can the authors take pride in associating themselves with a barbaric Indian killer? And like Custer, the US military in Vietnam thought they could take on the North Vietnamese Army whom they regarded as no more sophisticated than the American Indians slaughtered by them in the 19th Century.There was some tribute paid to the Vietnamese but it was done grudgingly.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"It pains me tremendously to have to offer up a negative review \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\". Lt. General (then Lt. Colonel) Hal Moore's account of the vicious battle of Ia Drang in 1965 should be a very compelling read, giving great insight to the battle that changed to scope of the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, Moore's narrative is nothing more than series of repetitive statements and descriptions of the action that took place. In a few of the negative (or less than enthusiastic) reviews written about this book, it has been cited that this reads more like a battle 'after-action' report than a literary presentation of the events of that day. I have to agree. Writing accounts of actual battles is a tricky proposition. A good writer or editor can make it happen, though. Neither seemed to have helped with this book. After approximately 50 pages of relatively interesting background material to set the stage for the battle to follow, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" just dissolves into 300 pages of non-stop battle sequences. If a proper context is given to the events that are occurring, it can allow the lay person to properly understand and picture what is taking place. Unfortunately, it seems that Moore is intent on telling the stories of every single soldier who fought in that battle, describing their wounds and their determination to fight on. There are far too many names to keep track of and their situations are far too similar to give the reader and distinct sense of who these men were. There is also a very frustrating tendency to jump to different soldiers' points of views without ever giving a proper transition. One minute, the reader may think they are reading the comments of a private who was shot and survived the battle, but the next minute it will be the company captain who is speaking, and there will have been nothing to indicate the switch in speakers.Although Hal Moore's name is listed as the primary author for this book, he really isn't the primary person at fault for the failure of \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\". Moore is a military man, not a writer. His skills lay in his ability to prepare men for battle and then lead them into battle, have them do their job, and get as many out safely as possible. From all accounts, Moore was superb with this task. The fault lies more with his editors at the publishing house and his co-author, journalist Joseph Galloway. By trade, Galloway is a writer and he should be equipped with strong narrative and story-telling skills. He could have and should have taken the tremendous insights that Moore provided and molded them into a fascinating tale of the men who fought on that day. There are many non-fiction war books that have managed to accomplish this. The editors of this book should also have seen that there was no narrative flow to the story and found ways to improve it before they published it. Alas, they didn't and, as a result, \\"We Were Soldiers...\\" is a chore to read.It is clear that I am in the minority in my opinion here. That is part of why I feel it pains me to give this book a negative review. However, my final decision came down to a set of deciding factors: As a person who reads a lot of military history, but has never been in an actual battle or studied military strategy in-depth, could I still follow what has happening in this story with any degree of clarity. Unfortunately, the answer is 'No'. Therefore the negative review must stand."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is a difficult book to rate and I'd prefer not to assign a star rating for that reason. It's a good, although confusing, recitation of individual recollections of the minute by minute events of intense fighting, As a book on \\"what is an intense firefight like?\\" it rates five stars. If the reader has ever boxed, he knows how long a three minute round really is - it can be three days. These men fought one of the most intensive battles in the history of the army for four straight days without break, The horrendous casualties resulted from the same problem faced with a suicide bomber - when 400 men with automatic rifles who are more than willing to die charge you by surprise, you're not going to be able to kill them all before some get to you. And then, 400 or 500 more show up as an additional surprise. The first problem was, it was all a surprise and shouldn't have been. So - a question - it's implied at the very end of the book with a quote from Clausewitz - why was this ill fated assault made and what was it's intended result? Why were so many of our yong men put into such a killing zone intentionally without having any idea of what to expect? The only real answer is that the commanders were frustrated with finding no game in other areas and hoped to find some enemy in this one to kill.But. But after reading a couple of chapters, read the end. Read about the effect of the deaths on the loved ones - the young mothers, the parents - they are cast in the book as the brave, loyal survivors of their killed husbands and sons and the victims of a heartless or incompetent army notification system. Now return to read the rest of the battle. And read carefully the beginning of the march to LZ Albany. Read that part twice. And then read to the end so you know what happened and you know how many men were killed in the first hour. So you know what chance they had to even return fire. So you see not just the normal chaos of a firefight but the absolute loss of any meaningful initial response - total tactical surprise by the NVA.Ask yourself - and it is NOT simple 20-20 hindsight - what you would have done as the battalion commander BEFORE turning left toward Albany. When you saw the high elephant grass and knew without any reasonable doubt there are NVA in the area. What would you do when you saw your men were about to enter an area where, if they were attacked, they would not be able to see much farther than an outstretched arm. Napoleon said, \\"a commander, three times a day should look around him and ask these questions, 'if I am attacked from the front, what will I do? from the flank? From the rear?\\" This battalion commander asked none of those questions - it was, he concluded, a \\"walk in the sun\\" What could he have done? He could have called the air force and burned the place flat with napalm or, at least burned enough to have clear fields of fire if he were to be attacked. He could have called the A-1s with their \\"daisy cutters\\" huge bombs used to create instant landing zones in jungles of trees - a coule of them likely would have cleared a very large area of grass. Or \\"carpet bomb\\" with smaller bombs to clear a route, He could have used artillery to fire into the high grass and flush or kill whatever might have been in there. He could have set up heavy machine guns to place grazing fire along the flanks and outward to protect the flanks as he moved. He could have done many things if he had been thinking of the tactical situation rather than simply concluding it was a \\"walk in the sun.\\" Then the question becomes, what makes you think any of that would have worked? But that's not the important question, The important question is, \\"if you thought of those things and concluded they wouldn't work, why did you decide to go anyway - without even trying them? Why did you expose your men to the huge risk of the unknown?\\" It's not like they shouldn't have expected surprise - they'd been greatly surprised by being attacked by a force many times their size from an area they apparently didn't suspect just two days earlier. You would think, if for no other reason than fear that their might be more of the bastards waiting out there, they'd have been at least a little cautious.Better of course would have been to wonder why they should be walking after fighting so long. They were helicopter troops - where were the helicopters to fly the back to Pleiku? The answer would be, no time - the B52s are coming. To which the battalion commander should have said, tell them to turn around and go have some more coffee. We are not going to march out of here - we're going to fly out of here so get the choppers going. Disobedience? Maybe. But I did it once and had it done to me once. Both times it prompted a discussion and a change of mind and plan. Commanders get tired too and don't always come up with perfect answers to problems that pop up quickly, In this case, the problem wasn't properly identified and the order should have been challenged.And that is why those young men died. Not because of failed political decisions or a president and secretary of defense who were lying to the public while taking us down a trail to nowhere other than 58,000 good young men being killed. And tens of thousands badly wounded. The young men of the Ia Drang Battle died and were wounded because their leaders at the highest local level failed to recognize the tactical situation for what it was and failed to take the appropriate steps to minimize the danger and the ultimate result. It it's a river crossing, they'd look for a ford instead of telling the troops to simply jump in and hope it's not too deep, If it's a bridge crossing, they'll look for mines. How in the world could it not have been thought that there would be NVA hiding in the high grass? How could the battalion commander remove leadership at the company level by calling all the company commanders away from their companies to a meeting in that situation? How could he possibly think it was a \\"walk in the sun.\\"I understand why the book was written as it was - it's not in the current vogue to say anything derogatory about the soldier. Especially not when the author is the chief soldier involved. And I intend no slight of the individual soldiers in this fight. They are justly described as heroes to be admired greatly by any fighting man. But it outrages me that we STILL haven't learned the lessons of Vietnam - that tactical commanders are just as responsible for their men as the commander in chief or the secretary of defense. A competent commander does not put men in harms way without careful thought and planning. A competent commander does not go hunting in a place like xray hoping serendipity will favor him with a large body count without considering there might be more there than he reckoned on, And a competent commander certainly does not cross a tactical terrain feature as was done on the way to Albany that spells certain death if the enemy is concealed in it in force. What does that mean today? What this book - and, certainly, the after action report - should have made clear - commanders should not load troops into humvees and trucks and parade or patrol on streets in Iraq for no purpose other than a show of force. Period. That commanders should not send a helicopter to land on a building in Somalia supposing the idea to enter a building full of hostiles to capture a few of those hostiles and take them to the roof to take them away in a helicopter is going to be a \\"flight in the sun.\\" It shouldn't even be considered without a plan for what to do if a helicopter is shot down or without a way to get reinforcements in by ground very quickly or without a way to evacuate wounded very quickly. Competent commanders should not plan to invade Iraq from the south with 72 ton tanks without knowing the ground on either side of the road won't support the tanks so they are constrained to the road. Commanders should not assume that where the soldiers are going in force will meet people who love them and won't shoot at them from buildings. Presidents make those assumptions but commanders are in charge of the young men charged with carrying the \\"plans\\" out, And those commanders MUST challenge orders they see clearly are invitations to disaster. If they don't they are as guilty as the civilians they now accuse of tying their hands behind their backs and not letting them fight the war as it should have been fought. In brief, competent commanders should learn from the enemy that arrogance born of having high tech weapons of war and well trained soldiers does not convert a high risk situation into a sure win. And, if the commander concludes it's not a \\"sure win\\" then he'd better plan for everything conceivable that could cause a disaster. He should never plan based on the guess nothing will be there to ruin his men's \\"walk in the sun.\\""},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"This is one of the excellent book that tells us about a major battle that took place in Vietnam during the large and dangerous WAR. That many people would like to forget about. Col. Moore does a very good job paying tribute to whoever fought under him at the battle of Ia Drang and those men will be heroes forever. Let the people who fought in that hot sweaty jungle for weeks at time be remembered as heroes fighting for the U.S.A.This book represents how no American soldier can ever give up. On October 23 to November 26, 1965 450 U.S. soldiers found themselves surrounded by a force of Veit Cong who fought hard and unscarred of death that would be waiting for them. Both sides went in looking for a battle and came out with the first major battle of The Vietnam WAR. Harold Moore commanded the men of the 1st battalion 7th Cavalry sent his men into the heart of Ia Drang. They didn't know that soon they would be surrounded by 2,000 Vietnam soldiers. Neither side predicted major losses but they both came up wrong. As many men died in the tall grass of that hot landing zone. The only lifeline that the Americans had was there supplies kept coming in from helicopter. These pilots were fearless when bringing in supplies because they knew that if they stopped there fellow soldiers would stop to. So they showed much courage flying into a Bees nest but instead of Bees flying around it was masses of bullets.There are many heroes in this battle, and even happiness in some parts, but this is a story of courage and the unwillingly of Americans to give up and the fearless Vietnam soldiers who were not scared of anything the Americans shoot at them. Many soldier's said \\"They would come out of nowhere in the hundreds and it was like shooting into a solid wall of soldiers.\\" Or others would say \\"No matter how many bullets you shot they would still keep coming not just from straight but all sides it was like the bullets did not hurt them.\\"If you are looking for a book of excitement or just plain set on the seat of chair action. This is the book that is right for you. We would probally not have this book right now if it wasn't for the courage of all the men that fought in that jungle of sweat and blood and all the men that never gave up no matter what condition.

The mission for any unit must be clear. It also seems to be an effort by the author to exorcise his demons. As a Marine Corps officer, I found it difficult to believe that these troops were thrown into such an amorphous operation. It basically seems like they were to locate the NVA and see how the enemy performed in battle. Well, the Cav definitely found out. The movement from the first LZ to the second was undertaken with no intelligence regarding the location of the enemy. The author calls this a victory simply because the NVA left the battlefield and suffered greater casualties. The truth is the American troops got &quot;whacked&quot; and it was due to poor planning and preparation by their higher commanders."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

He and his troopers move out and land at Landing Zone X-ray at the base of the Choo pong massif mountains in South Vietnam.Occupying the inside of that same mountain is the same North Vietnamese battalion that finally ran the French out in 1954. Battle hardened communists looking to kill Americans \\"very much\\".So starts 56 hrs of hell in late 1965. 400 Americans surrounded almost immediately by 3000 or so PNVA, battle hardened soldiers. Moore narrates his own story and includes testimony from his officers, NCO's and lower ranks about their part in the battle. What they did and what they saw is a side of humanity many will never see. Joe Galloway, a photographer, enters the battle late after he bums a ride from Bruce Crandall one of the hero chopper pilots.The North Vietnamese had the \\"cause\\". They wanted their country unified under Northern rule and they would throw 10 men at each American until they drove the invaders out. The Americans were fighting to thwart off communism in a cold war world that saw the \\"threat from the east\\" in the shape of \\"The Big Red Bear\\".Hal Moore is an amazing man as is his co writer Joe Galloway. In fact every soldier, North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese and American that fought in Vietnam but especially at the battle of IA Drang, commonly referred to as the battle that changed the war.One thing I found that made this book more enjoyable for me was that I sketched out the battle as I read it. There is a lot of \\"on the left\\", \\"from the east\\", \\"to the west\\", \\"to our fronts\\" and, it's easy to get lost in the directional confusion (fitting word for battle). Sketching the lines as I read helped me to keep up and appreciate the hell of it all.A great book about an exceptional group of ordinary guys doing extraordinary things.Note:I've seen Hal Moore on TV and in documentaries many many times. He seems the kind of guy who should be wandering around his small farm, smoking a pipe with his dog while his wife cooks dinner. Inside this mild mannered humble man is the soul of a warrior who understands war and understands killing.The Mel Gibson movie \\"We were soldiers\\" seems to have held true to the story written by Moore and Galloway.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"The most striking lesson to be learned from \\"We Were Soldiers...\\" is the importance of first class training. Moore's Battalion was a team. They had trained together in the US, they had lived together in the US, and through shared adversity had gone to Vietnam with a tight bond. Their training was sound and they understood the finer points of being a soldier. The other units involved in the action, and which moved out of X-Ray by foot were not as well trained. There can be not doubt that they were fine individuals and brave soldiers, but Moore's account highlights a deficiency in their training. Soldiers simply halted, sat on their packs, and lit up a smoke. Even NCOs walked down the column without rifles or helmets to see why they had halted. Any well trained soldier knows that during a halt you immediately face out, take up a defensive posture, and watch your arcs. Every well trained officer knows to deploy early warning, achieve mutual support/interlocking arcs, and to stay in a suitable position to command their troops. On both accounts, the soldiers and officers of 2/5 and 2/7 Battalion failed to adhere to these basic principles. This book serves as a lesson about the value of first class training and demonstrates the importance of ensuring that every soldiers basic skills are up to scratch."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

A second battle ensued only 3 days later and a few miles from the first battle, where a second U.S. battalion was again surrounded producing another savage battle with heavy casualty in both sidesThese forces clashed in such a violent way that in time was gruesome and heartbreaking to read. These soldiers were put in a situation where surrender wasn't an option. Injured men were being executed on the spot by the north Vietnamese.

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG, Lieutenant General (Ret.) Harold (Hal) G. Moore's and Joe Calloway's painstakingly detailed history of 1965's Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, should be required reading for anyone interested in war, particularly those who still believe that there is something noble or glorious about men engaging in politically sanctioned slaughter.This prior comment is no indictment of anyone in particular, especially not the soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang, whether Americans or Vietnamese. Both sides demonstrated uncommon bravery and fortitude under fire. The comment stands however, as an indictment of the waste and horror of battle, the brutishness of men killing each other, and the cost of war in young human lives.The Battle of the Ia Drang was the first major engagement of United States forces against the People's Army of North Vietnam. It took place over the course of a week at two clearings in the jungle called Landing Zone X-Ray and Landing Zone Albany, and was the first battle deployment of airmobile troops in history.Incomplete intelligence and ill-advised orders (to find and kill the enemy, rather than to hold enemy territory) resulted in the 1st Battalion of the 7th Infantry, numbering less than 500 men, being airdropped into the red-hot center of NVA-controlled South Vietnam. The Americans were met by more than 2000 North Vietnamese regulars who were defending their major southern command post. Even before the GIs were off their helicopters they came under withering enemy fire. Moore and Calloway are terrifyingly graphic in their descriptions of the ordered chaos which ensued. Although the Americans won the day at X-Ray, they did so at an unconscionable human price. Their stand at LZ Albany, two days later, was little short of disastrous.Moore cuts the army brass no ice in criticizing the overall strategy behind the Battle of the Ia Drang. It should have been abundantly clear to anyone with eyes to see that the Vietnamese Communists were a superbly trained ground force utterly committed to their cause, willing to fight to the last drop of blood. The human cost of the battle and the nature of the enemy should have forced a massive reconsideration of U.S. means and goals right at the beginning of the greater U.S. committment in Vietnam. That it didn't is a tragedy.Although I have given WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG five well-deserved stars for its story, the book (at least the mass market paperback edition) suffers from very poor formatting. I have read voraciously for the last 40 years and this is one of the few books I have experienced that is measurably devalued by its atrocious editing.WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is not Hal Moore's book, but a history of the 7th Division at Ia Drang. General Moore not only includes his own reminiscences, but those of other survivors, most often directly transcribed from interviews.The various participants' accounts are not clearly set off from each other by conventions such as indents or font changes. As a result, they often impinge on each other confusingly, and it becomes difficult to determine whose voice is speaking at a given moment.Since many men are recounting their personal experiences, a single incident (or person) may be introduced and discussed several times. This undifferentiated style gives the reader an impression of weak writing, which it is not. Still, it becomes too easy to lose one's place in what at times appears to be the world's most incredibly convoluted run-on sentence.But for this editor's flaw, which has nothing to do with the authors or their subject, reading WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is a shattering experience everyone should share."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

Past battles and wars still linger in our minds, but few of us try to remember the full story of war. We linger on the valor and courage while forgetting the pain and anguish. We hold on to the thought that those men and women who died in battle died with full knowledge of their demise when, although they knew the risks, they had full intentions of returning to their mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children. It is important for us as Americans to remember the brutal facts of war when examining the honor the men and women who died on the battlefield showed us in their final moments before dying in defense of the ideals of our country. It is a great treasure when we can find a person or persons willing to tell the stories of those who died with an honesty that allows us to catch a glimpse of what these soldiers were going through so that we may begin to understand the true sacrifices of the men and women of our armed forces. The book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young, co-authored by retired Lieutenant General Hal Moore and journalist Joseph Galloway, is such a treasure. In the book, we see the devotion of the men under the then Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore as they fought to defend the lines assigned to their platoons. We see the bravery and selfless devotion of the soldiers as they fought not for the politicians in Washington or the American people back home who were still unaware of the challenge that lay ahead in Vietnam. Rather, these men fought for each other."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"After seeing the movie version starring Mel Gibson based on this book, I wanted to read the historical account of the battle. Lt Gen Moore and Joseph Galloway do an excellent job describing the details in sequence of the two phases of the Ia Drang battle in the Viet Nam war (the movie covers the first phase only) including both facts and personal accounts of the battle. Lt Gen Moore's introductory chapter is an excellent commentary about our entry into the war especially concerning the mindset of those who first fought in this first big American battle in Viet Nam. The book presents stories of the individuals who fought in both phases of the battle in their own words, which is a strong point of the book. Lt Gen Moore's descriptions and comments are interspersed with these personal accounts of the battle, and a number of pictures of these individuals are included.The last part of the book is most excellent. Here, the authors set up the second phase of the battle at LZ Albany and describe it from the viewpoint of those who were involved. The reader can anticipate the assault that follows. I also appreciate the chapter that follows up with the families of those who died in battle concerning how they have dealt with the loss of their loved one since then. It is very moving.I strongly recommend this book for people who have seen the movie version and want to read what actually happened in this battle. It is also good for students of history (this is an excellent military history) and political science (Lt. Gen. Moore's comments about our involvement in Vietnam are very insightful)."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"'We were soldiers..' is a story that every military and, especially, political leader must read before committing US tropps to battle. For me, it brought back memories and reminded me of people I knew who were there 46 years ago. The most significant point in this story and, in my mind, why the war lasted so much longer than it could, should, would have, is made in the realization by Hal Moore and the 1st Cav commander Harry Kinnard that the US had forever surrendered offensive initiative to the PAVN because they were not permitted to follow the battered PAVN units into Cambodia and destroy their ability to fight. Given the safe sanctuary of Cambodia the PAVN could replace, refit and rest their soldiers in complete security and chose the time of their next attacks which it did on the same grounds many times over the next years.If the political leaders- Johnson and McNamara among others- had not been so timid and concerned more about public relations than their troops and had alowed US units to follow and defeat in total the PAVN wherever it was, there can't be any doubt of a much swifter resolution to the war and saved many US toops from death and life long injuries. Instead, the war lasted another seven years with thousands of deaths and injuries.In the end the thing Johnson and his cohorts feared most- the loss of public support for them and the war - did happen and on a much greater scale than they feared. To me that is one the greatest ironies of their failed strategy."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Hal Moore's and Joseph Galloway's \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" is a rare feat for a work of non-fiction: through phenomenal writing it brings the events of the November 1965 Ia Drang battle to life vividly and harshly. The writing and pacing of \\"We Were Soldiers\\" take the reader as close as possible to the battlefield through Hal Moore's exhaustive interviews with hundreds of veterans of the brutal opening fight between US forces and North Vietnamese regulars, deep research and his own experience having commanded the American forces there. From the first page the reader will be drawn in and it will be hard to put this book down, as clich&eacute;d as that may sound.Moore and Galloway's \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is especially memorable in that--(for this reviewer it was the first time)--not only was the viewpoint of the enemy expressed, but that the authors interviewed the actual North Vietnamese commander they had faced at Landing Zone X-Ray. The insight provided by then-LTC An on how he met and battled his American adversaries helps to paint a fuller portrait of the fighting.Finally, the authors took a rare step to examine the after effects of the battle, and the \\"after after-effects.\\" Moore and Galloway illustrate the true and rarely examined cost of war by interviewing the children of some of the men killed in the battle. The deep and devastating impact the loss of a father could have on the upbringing of a baby girl or a toddler at the time of the battle serve as a stark denouement to the story."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"General Hal Moore and Joe Galloway combined to write one of the most memorable books on the Vietnam War. In 1965, early in the war, then-Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore's battalion air assaulted into the Ia Drang Valley and became involved in a fight for their life against North Vietnamese Army units. In \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young,\\" Moore and Galloway describe not only the battle but Moore's training of his battalion before they went to Vietnam, as well as the follow-on battle at nearby Landing Zone Albany.Moore's description of the fighting is based on his personal recollections and interviews and correspondence with many of the participants. Galloway, a UPI reporter, showed up halfway through the battle (and was later awarded the Bronze Star for his part in the battle) and recounted it for Americans back home. They combine to give a harrowing account of this brutal battle.Reading this book, one can't help but question the strategies employed in the Vietnam War. Although Moore's men fought valiantly and skillfully, their mission - an air assault deep into the jungle to find and kill the enemy - doesn't seem one designed to advance any political goals.Moore and Galloway have written an excellent book on the Vietnam War that should be read by all military officers and by anyone interested in the Vietnam War. Recounting the lives of all lost in the battle as well as the whereabouts of many of the survivors, this book is about Moore's men and, ultimately, an homage to the men under his command that he lost in Vietnam."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Best Viet-Nam book written. Details of events give accurate account of the time and what we did as a nation to work into the position we put ourselves in."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Moore and Galloway use the subject quote from Aeschylus, the Greek playwright, who derived his insights from the Persian - Greek wars of the 5th Century B.C., as the epigraph for the chapter, entitled \\"Mentioned in Dispatches\\" on the after-battle \\"spin\\" that was placed on the first large-scale battle between American and North Vietnamese forces. Once again, Plus ca change... the more it remains the same. Upon receiving the reports of the battle, one of Westmoreland's chief concerns was that there be no hint that the NVA were accompanied by Chinese advisors, whether it was true or not. (It almost certainly was not true).The battle took place in November, 1965, at the very beginning of the heavy American involvement in the war, in the Ia Drang Valley, near the Chu Pong massif, in South Vietnam's Central Highlands, very close to the Cambodian border. At the time Hal Moore was a Lt. Col., in charge of the 1/7th Cav., a unit in the First Air Cav. Division (the same unit was led by General Custer in the battle of the Little Big Horn.) Joe Galloway was a report with UPI, and was at Moore's side during the entire battle. The authors' were not afraid of Aeschylus's quote, and have produced an overwhelmingly accurate and truthful account of the battle. The \\"general reader\\" should make no mistake; this IS military history, featuring units, tactics, weapons, and strategy. There are some excellent maps to aid any reader, and there are compelling and even haunting photographs on many of the mainly American actors in the battle. As the authors say in the prologue: \\"The class of 1965 came out of the old America, a nation that disappeared forever in the smoke that billowed off the jungle battleground where we fought and bled.\\"Slightly more than three years after this battle I was at LZ Oasis, not much more than 20 miles from the Ia Drang battleground, and one could see the Chu Pong massif to the southwest. But in the intervening three years, the Army had undergone a tremendous transformation from \\"the class of 1965\\"; that class seemed as remote as Aeschylus; we were fighting a vastly different war, imbued with the deepest cynicism and numerous forms of escapism. Although unintentional, this book underscores the vast gulf between two versions of the American Army. Another epigraph was also most appropriate, the one for chapter 4, the \\"Vietnamese military maxim\\" that said: \\"He who controls the Central Highlands controls South Vietnam.\\" For whatever reason, the authors omitted it even from their Epilogue, but it was almost exactly in this same area that North Vietnamese troops massed, almost nine and a half years later, first overrunning the provincial Highland's capital of Bam Me Thuot, and within short order, the entire Highlands were under NVA control. They raced down Highway 19, pass the base camp of the First Air Cav. at An Khe, and within five weeks all of South Vietnam disappeared, and the country was re-united.Theirs is a thoughtful, accurate military history, but through the epigraphs in particular, and the pictures of their return to Vietnam, with the opposing Vietnamese commanders, the Senior General, Vo Nguyen Giap, and the general at the battle in the Ia Drang, Nguyen Huu An, one senses the wisdom of age looking back at the folly of war. Moore and Galloway serve as worthy icons for reconciliation.\\"Perhaps.\\" is a complete sentence in the last paragraph on the book, which was written in 1992. It is preceded by: \\"Schoolchildren no longer memorize the names and dates of great battles, and perhaps that is good; perhaps that is the first step on the road to a world where wars are no longer necessary.\\" With America now in its 9th year of war, with no end in sight, I'd love to know what the authors think now. At any rate, they deserve a full 5-stars for this excellent effort."},{"Title":"WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . .

AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","review":"Unlike some of my reviews, I plan to keep this one rather short. With the number of reviews here, most of what I would say would be rather redundant. Suffice to say that I have not read a book that touched me more in quite some time now. While I was not there, as I was serving in another area at this time, I did have friends who were; some made it out, others did not. I cannot imagine the horror they went through in the brief time this battle took place and I doubt very much if anyone who was not there could make that claim.This work is a very personal unit history of one battle during the Viet Nam War. It is a document which covers the first real use of our Air Assault Forces; the first time they were used on this scale against a very well trained and dedicated opponent. This battle took place during the month of November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley. Between October 23 and November 26, 1965 305 American soldiers were killed in what is know as the Pleiku campaign. There were many, many wounded, both physically and emotionally. The total number of Vietnamese killed and wounded will never be known, but it is felt that it numbered in the thousands.The book itself is a rather personal book, and as one reviewer has pointed out, it is probably one of the best accounts of small unit combat since The Red Badge of Courage. I not that there has been some criticism that the book spent too much time detailing and naming individuals who participated in this engagement, naming names, home towns, backgrounds and ultimate fate on the battle field. Good grief people, many of these young men are either dead or quite old now. I personally feel that Lt. Gen Moore would have been less than honorable to not have noted as many of these men as he possibly could have. Their names need to be remembered. Moore should be applauded for this and his efforts to tell their stories.I also note that there is criticism from some of the arm chair soldiers as to tactics, etc. Again, good grief! Under the circumstances I doubt seriously if another group of officers and men could have done any better nor made a better account of themselves. As to those critical of Moore's and Galloway's writing style...again, get real! To be quite frank and blunt, no one really cares about your literary pontifications; they simply are not relevant here, and are sort of pathetic. If you want smooth action, and a flowing story, go see a John Wayne movie or read one of those God Awful Mack Bolan books.The Viet Nam War was a war that almost split this nation apart. I certainly am not going near that debate in this review. I will say though, that no matter what side of the coin you were on, this is one that all should read. We have young men and women in harms way at this time, and Americans need to know just what some of these young people are going though. In a way, it does not matter who won this battle or who lost. The fact is that many brave men, on both sides, gave their all and they should be remembered and honored. This is by no means an endorsement of war or an attempt to glorify war as only a complete fool would do such, it is though an honorable attempt to honor those that deserve it.This was a wonderful work on so many levels and I do recommend it be read by all.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Help Lord the Devil Wants Me Fat","review":"This book has to be one of the greatest books written concerning weight loss and how to tear down strongholds that the enemy has built in one's mind by causing one to overeat.

Then it gets into different dysrhythmias, explaining each one in a very straight-forward manner.As far as one user complaining that the tracings aren't big enough... they are intended to show you the intricacies of the rhythm and spotlight areas of the strip where you'll see the indicated abnormalities... they didn't intend for you to bust out your calipers and figure out how many of these dysrhythmias were occurring, times between them, etc... Those things are explained in the text accompanying each strip and explained in great yet easy-to-follow detail.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about ECG's... especially those planning to get their ACLS."},{"Title":"ECG Interpretation Made Incredibly Easy!

Howerver, it is not excellent (like &quot;Professional ASP 2.0&quot; from wrox).I really studied something from this book which covers some very important topics such as Commerce Server Objects, Pipeline, and Wallet/Pay Now. However, this author did not want to explain them deeply. A lot of things could be gotten from SSCE document. The first six chapters are nothing. Not only waste your time but also challenge your patient.Don't expect this book is a bible for SSEC. It is just &quot;second&quot; reference.Before reading this book, I finished other two books (Pro ASP 2/Pro Site Server 3) from wrox, they are excellent. After that, I read this book, I am really disappointed, because this book did not explain SSCE in details and at the advanced level.Honestly, only because this book is from wrox and the author did good jobs in others, I gave this book &quot;3 stars&quot;.

I'm so sorry but this novel was truly a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"Although the novel is readable and engaging, I was sorry I wasted my time reading it due to the distracting inconsistencies within. Utimately both unbelievable and disappointing, not to mention gratuitiously sensational."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"*****Who is lying and who is telling the truth? Who is lying to themselves? What is the truth? I found myself asking these questions throughout this riveting novel. Jeanne Cross is in a long-term marriage to her physician husband with one child, and on the surface everything seems basically fine, sort of like everyone's life. As the novel progresses, the reader soon realizes that things are far from \\"fine\\" and that Jeanne Cross is lying to herself, pretending to have a good marriage and family, pretending to be content with her life. It is her new friendship with a teacher at the local middle school, Ali---who is everything Jeanne is not---that compels her to begin facing the truth. The rest of the novel is page-turning with unexpected plot twists and turns. This book was hard to put down and I read it over two days because the suspense level was so high.There are many themes in this complex novel. It is indeed about family secrets, about trust and loyalty, about self-deception, about abuse, about repression. The relationships have many levels, and there are no clear true protagonists or antagonists, even though at times there seem to be. Even the perpetrators of abuse have other sides to their personalities, which is indeed how things are in life, also.This is a first novel by the author, Patry Francis, who also has a lovely blog called \\"Simply Wait\\". She has been an award-winning poet, and is now, with this novel, a wonderful storyteller whose next book will be eagerly anticipated by many, including me.Highly recommended.*****"},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I thought the book was great.

It made us think more deeply about everything from the kind of parent we want to be, to society's reaction to sexually predatory women."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"This was an excellent first novel by Patry Francis.

Gavin, her husband, a well-known and respected doctor in the community. Jamie, their adolescent son, a cheerful and friendly personality with a bit of a weight issue. A lovely, united family. But, scratching the surface, some problems come to light. The process of rattling their seemingly perfect bliss and rectitude is triggered off by Ali, a new music teacher at the high school where Jeanne works. Well loved by her students, they often wait in line to speak to her about their problems after school, and she is always available to help. Privately, Ali has a lust for life and men alike. She is married to George but they live in separate houses. George is so in love with Ali that he respects her often questionable choices, her need for freedom. In turn, she loves her husband dearly and is grateful for their mutual understanding. She does not care what is said behind her back and is a good source for the community's juicy gossip.Jeanne and Ali could not be more different in their view toward life, yet a friendship begins and strengthens as time goes by. Perfectly groomed Joanne is inspired by Ali's zest for life and her flamboyant personality. Then a death occurs in the community, affecting them both for different reasons and leading to other disturbing occurrences, until a bottomless emotional spiral drags everyone down. Violence and tragedy strike. A missing diary seems to hold the only key to the truth.A psychological twister & turner written in a sober yet piercing tone. The narrative is entertaining and well-structured, the epilogue unpredictable yet it hits the nail on the head. Well done to the author."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"\\"Liar's Diary\\" is a recognizably contemporary story,with an enveloping plot that draws the reader in.It's too bad, though, that the most interestingcharacter disappears halfway into the book.Also, the ending doesn't seem all that believable.Feels like this may be the author's first novel.Good effort; keep writing and growing."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"The moment Ali Mather becomes the new music teacher at the high school, Jeanne Cross's life is never the same. Ali is like no other person she'd ever met. She is mysterious, passionate and somewhat narcissistic. She is married, but doesn't conceal the fact that she's having an affair with a car salesman AND a teacher. Most people shrug off her behavior as a forty-six-year-old with a midlife crisis, but Jeanne feels there is much more to Ali. The two women develop an interesting friendship, and through their times together, Jeanne suspects that Ali is keeping secrets. It is all recorded in her diary, a diary that seems to interest someone, for Ali has suffered from breakings into her home and harassment lately. But that is the least of things. Ali wants Jeanne to open up her eyes and see the things that go on under her roof. She wants Jeanne to see how her sixteen-year-old son is suffering, and how they are both unhappy with Gavin Cross -- an accomplished doctor and a control freak in their home. Jeanne is forced to make some harsh decisions that will affect her life forever. There are many twists throughout the novel.This is a very chilling and realistic look into a woman who would do anything to block out reality and pretend that her home life is as it should be. The twists and turns in this novel are well done. Just when you think the story has arrived to a certain conclusion, it leads you elsewhere. The climax is completely shocking and you will want to reread the novel to make sense of it all. That is what I'll have to do because there are scenes and isolated events mentioned in the last few chapters that I hadn't read about and didn't make much sense of them. Jeanne is a very interesting protagonist. The psychological developments that lead to her decisions are beautifully written. Ali is also an interesting character, three-dimensional and enigmatic at the same time. The Liar's Diary floored me. It is thought provoking and suspenseful from beginning to end. Patry Francis is a great new author with a lot of potential (and I'm sorry to hear that she has cancer). I cannot recommend this gem enough."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"What an engaging book!!! I could not put it down. Suspenseful,meaningful,intriging. Well written with great characters."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"First let me say that the subject of this story is a topic that needs to be discussed. I think that it may give some of the readers (those who have experienced this) the incentive to seek help.I was really disappointed by the main character in this book. Her denial of what was happening was unbelievable. I also thought that the author took too long to get to the point or express her meaning."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"The author's use of the word \\"zest\\" on the first page should have tipped me off. Unless you're walking down the soap aisle or touring a winery, that word should not be in black and white. Let me qualify this by saying that once I start a book, I usually finish it, if only to write reviews like this one. While the general plot here is interesting, it is presented in that of a dime-store variant: a book that screams cheap and might have been helped by a little sleaze. Though the book's back cover accolades describe it as \\"creepy,\\" the only thing that's creepy is the fact that the plot seems to have been, if not ripped off from, at least inspired by, Sebastian Faulks' Engleby - but without the fine writing, character development, or \\"zest\\".Ms. Francis' writing is annoying as well. You won't find any insightful passages that touch us all on some universal level or beautiful similes that make you stop and think. You just end up saying \\"What?\\" What do you say to lines like \\"gossip was as cheap and plentiful as the rubbery pizza in the cafeteria.\\" Is that from Magnum PI?Then there's the limited vocabulary. I don't know how many times I read, reread, tried to forget, and ultimately substituted my own phrases for her use of \\"I stammered\\", \\"obviously\\", \\"tension\\", \\"nauseous\\", \\"people turned to stare\\", \\"sadly\\", \\"gulped\\", and \\"surprised\\". Perhaps nothing captured so completely her range of vocabulary than her usage of \\"codicil\\" to refer to a final point someone was making. \\"Codicil\\" is a legal document used to re-execute wills!The narration is like tripping down an escalator going up - redundant and painful. Ms. Francis attempts to use a protagonist centric voice that emulates the insecurities of an emotionally bludgeoned housewife. Nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately, this was a clumsy and self-conscious effort. The difference between Ms. Francis and her inspiration, Sebastian Faulks, is the difference between a 1940's movie and one from today. Just like a silver screen dinosaur, Ms. Francis treats us to blow-by-blow descriptions of everything from how the protagonist picked up and invariably \\"gulped\\" a drink to how someone served her antipasto, \\"thoughtfully remembering that I loved artichokes but didn't much care for the fatty meats\\". Why did Ms. Francis think the reader needed to know the main character's love of artichokes? This is a murder mystery. Were artichokes a murder weapon? Were artichokes a clue? Did artichokes symbolize something the killer's ravenous appetite for all things Italian? No, No, and No. Just another tedious detail.Finally, there's the ending, which is identical to Sebastian Faulks' Engleby: narrator ends up being the killer and meets with psychotherapist. But while the novel Engleby is breathtaking, artistic, and awe inspiring in the level of delusion the protagonist and the narration descend into, Ms. Francis slaps us all with a glib, after school-special-esque happy ending. It goes something like this: Sure, all three family members were jailed for having one crime or another, but they're all on the road to recovery. Son is well adjusted, in college, and has a girlfriend. Mother will make parole. And up till now pedophilic/serial-rapist/domestic abusive father is making great strides in therapy and getting back into a constructive relationship with his rape-victim/son. A little far fetched even for the Brother's Grimm.True, this is a page turner - but only because you want to find out the ending. But such is the case with knock-knock jokes. Wanting to get to the end is not by and initself a sign of a great book. It's just evidence that a book exists. Unfortunately this one does."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"The Liar's Diary is the story of Jeanne and Ali's friendship, how it started, why it started and what came from it. Jeanne and Ali both work at the same school, many words are not exchanged between them until one day Ali asked Jeanne if she can start giving her rides to school and so their friendship begins. Ali shows Jeanne parts of herself that she doesn't want to face but Ali thinks she needs to face. This is the story of their friendship and their families. This is a thriller so I don't want to say much more!Though it is a thriller I would call it a family drama thriller. I guess when I think of thrillers (and this shows how little I have read of them) I picture a mysterious \\"bad guy\\" going after someone. Reading this, I definitely realized how long it has been since I read a book like this. It actually started to stress me out, Jeanne's family situation is horrible and it just made me sad. I had to remind myself that this was only a book and was meant to be a bit of entertainment.Once it really got going with the twists and turns I took it for what it was, a book and started to enjoy seeing what happened next, I just had to find out where this would lead! I didn't like the final twist, it had actually crossed my mind as a possible outcome and I thought to myself \\"Oh, that would never happen it would be too dumb\\" but then it did. Oh well. I liked the epilogue though, that was probably my favorite part of the book.I can't say I really liked any of the characters, maybe if anyone Ali was an interesting character. I did enjoy seeing how far the author could push it with the twists and turns and still have it end up semi-believable. I think she did a good job of not going too over the top. \`I definitely think fans of thrillers and mysteries would enjoy this book. I think it is a good mix of mystery, family drama, and friendship. I think I might need to stick to happier reads myself."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"The premise from the back cover of this (paperback) sounded intriguing. I enjoy mysteries, especially those that offer many colorful characters, relationship problems and are of a contemporary setting.The book started out well and had my interest, but after about 100 pages, I had no clue where it was heading. Everything that was happening seemed to move along too frantically and at times, unbelievably. I never felt close to any one of these characters.Jeanne Cross was an exerciser (jogging) yet a pack-a-day smoker. Come on!Her son, overweight, though endearing, still evoked little empathy.The royally messed up lives of others (Ali, Brian, George) had me feeling that each one got what they probably deserved: Ultimately, I did not finish this book, mostly because I just didn't care to know the outcome of these character's lives. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"First, a warning...do not read my review if you have not ALREADY READ THIS BOOK....ok...now that's said...I thought the book was interesting and moved quickly...I did stay up late to finish it, and was surprised by the ending...but I didn't think some parts of the book were very realistic..why would a 16 yr old who is physically larger/stronger than his father not stop the abuse from happening to him? Why wouldn't the son have one day punched the father out when he attempted to abuse him again...I don't get it."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"This book manages to cram every cliche and stereotypical character known to man within its covers.

After 325 pages into this contrived rubbish I am waving the white flag....I surrender. I have managed to get through some really bad books but I can't make it through this one. Jean is a pathetic character in every relationship. She might be insane or redeemed in the end.....but I don't even care.It's the writing that's killin' me. Empty characters are slightly acceptable in a well-written story. It's so lousy."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"Reading someone's diary is one of those things -- the idea is forbidden and exciting and tantalizing, but it is only rarely worth the time and effort.It feels like 'The Liar's Diary' wasn't sure what sort of book it wanted to be. Is it a dramatic character study, or a mystery? There's nothing saying a book can't be both things, but this one never really established an identity either way, but it seems like it should have.'The Liar's Diary' tells the story of a quiet (perhaps boring, perhaps hiding a depth of misery) community introduced to a new person in town. She doesn't fit in very well, but she captures the interest of many. Some people become a little too interested in her, as becomes clear when she starts suffering repeated invasions of her home.The characters of 'The Liar's Diary' are well-drawn and interesting, though at times fit a bit too easily into stereotyped roles to feel like there is a lot of depth to them. Jeanne, the main character, is repressed and unhappy in her marriage, her husband is a distant tyrant, her son is a troubled overeater. Enter Ali Mather, the catalyst that changes all their lives with her allure and her different ways.The mystery of 'The Liar's Diary' is pretty thin, but there is mystery there, and in fact by the end it almost upsets the whole rhythm of the book. I appreciate the attempt, as the conclusion nears, to call into question all that has gone before, but it is handled poorly and jarringly and doesn't flow as well as it could have. In different hands, the same trick could have been pulled off much more smoothly.As it stands, 'The Liar's Diary' is worth reading, but just barely. It makes the attempt to challenge the stereotypes it presents, but it does so clumsily and doesn't follow it all the way through. The idea was great, but it could have been executed better.Like most people's diaries, the idea of 'The Liar's Diary' is intriguing and a little dangerous. After reading it, though, I have to wonder a little if I really had to in the first place."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I had the good fortune of stumbling onto Patry Francis' writing through her stunning blog. Francis, I discovered, is a writer's writer, with a gift for storytelling and for illuminating the shadows around issues close to our hearts. She unwraps emotions with skill and precision, writing deceptively simple statements that speak to the soul. I recommend those of literary mind, and those wishing to be touched and uplifted, to explore this outstanding new literary name."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I would give this novel two thumbs down but one will have to suffice as I'm using my other hand to pinch my nostrils closed at this stinker of a read. Thankfully it was on the bargain table at the book store - but I'm still annoyed that I wasted $5 and a few hours of my time."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I was wandering round Target, waiting for the pharmacy to fill my prescription, and had just reached the books' section when I found it - bottom shelf, red and cream cover with an image of a woman in lacy apparel. I'd looked at several paperbacks already, and it wasn't the picture that enticed me. But the blurb on the back was intriguing. Suburban life falling apart, mutual vulnerabilities, long-held secrets, something darker... those are things I might expect to enjoy. Stunning, magnetic personalities less so, but I decided to buy it anyway.The book began gently, with a character I quickly related to - married, insecure, low self-esteem, struggling with the conflicting responsibilities of wife and mother. Her son has problems of his own, and she tries to help and support, never sure where the line between enabling and ennobling lies.The husband; is he as bad as the narrator paints, or are we seeing only through her eyes? The friend; is she really out of control or controlling; maybe just another flawed personality with hidden depths? The colleagues... the school... Patry paints relationships and gossip with a clear steady hand. I could hear the conversations and picture the scenes; felt I'd been there; felt like I knew exactly where she'd placed me.By the time I reached the top of the roller coaster ride, midway through the book, I realized I'd spent all my time listening to a conversation without noticing it was too late to get away. Actually, I might have put the book down then. I'd reached that point where I need to trust the writer; an advantage established writers have over newcomers, I suppose. I could see the written world falling apart ahead of me, and knew I didn't want to watch dismay devolve into unmitigated disaster. Luckily I'd seen Patry's writing elsewhere, so I did trust her. In the darkest of places, she creates amazingly uplifting articles. So I knew her book wouldn't leave me without hope, and it didn't.The reader begins to guess at secrets as the story speeds up. I found myself hooked, unable to stop reading, and wishing I could protect the character from making those so natural mistakes. I thought I knew exactly where I was going till the sudden shock that I didn't guess, and the puzzle I hadn't even realized would need to be solved.The characters all stayed true to themselves, true to how I'd come to know them through reading. The dilemmas were resolved; sadness and pain leaving a path open to hope. And the clues all made sense. By the end I knew I'd read a really good book, one which I'd recommend to anyone interested in well-developed suburban characters with dark secrets waiting to derail them."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I have one comment - read this book. From the innocent beginning, one would never imagine that the book would be such a gripping unraveling of a small town and its inhabitants. The characters stay with you, and you come to really care about Jeanne Cross and wonder about her envy and mysterious fear of her new friend Ali. The ending was completely believable even though it crept up behind me. I found this book really haunting because the depths of the human spirit will always remain a mystery."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I am not a mystery reader. I chose \\"The Liar's Diary\\" with the encouragement of a fellow bibliophile. What a raging, scary, creepy, yet tantalizing, engrossing read this is!!!!!Jeanne Cross, a rather plain appearing school secretary meets Ali, a beautiful engaging virtuoso violinist who has come to teach music. Ali befriends Jeanne which makes \\"plain jane\\" feel so lucky. But as Ali belies secrets, Jeanne's controlled, seemingly placid life disappears. It is replaced by lies, betrayal, anguishing pain and upheaval. Ali wouldn't lie? The truth can't be false, yet isn't it? No one has ever been as kind to Jeanne as Ali...or, is the truth that no person has been ever been so UNKIND?Married to a prominent, egocentric doctor, Gavin, and having a son that is deeply troubled, Jeanne lives in that elusive state of denial. Until Ali insists she open her eyes Jeanne floats through the day, anesthetizing herself with spirits at night. But, even booze can't keep the truth from rearing it's ugly head when it is unleashed. Or is it the truth? To believe or not to believe that is Jeanne's question?This tale has one turning pages at rapid speed. Just like Jeanne you do not want to believe the evil that lives within people and yet you are annoyed at her naivet&eacute;. You are compelled to search manically with Jeanne, plowing through pages for clues, all along being twisted and turned like you are riding an out of control \\"Scrambler\\" at an amusement park.Plan nothing but reading this book once you start. You can't help it. It is that perfectly written and that enthralling. Be prepared for the end....it will knock your socks off. NO PEEKING!!! :}"},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"Patry Francis is one of my favorite contemporary writers. I have never met her, but I became acquainted with her on-line in January, 2006, when she left a perceptive comment on a blog entry I wrote about James Frey, the lying author who deceived Oprah Winfrey and others with his fictional autobiography. Her blog,Simply Wait is one of the few blogs to which I have links on the right side of this page because I have found it to be consistently well written, provocative and interesting. Her blog writing is personalized, without being simple navel-gazing.The back story on Patry is inspiring, and deserves a book of its own. She met the famous author, Marilynne Robinson, when Patry was a college student. Marilynne was living in Massachusetts with her husband, spotted a short story that Patry had written in a literary magazine and sent her husband to invite Patry to dinner. Over the years, Patry had never stopped writing, getting the occasional short story and poem published in literary journals, but also working as a waitress to make ends meet.And then E.F. Dutton bought Patry's novel, The Liar's Diary and a few months later, Patry hung up her waitressing shoes for good. Not only did Dutton buy the book, they have brought out an audio version and it has been translated into many languages. Patry, after all these years writing and waitressing finally made it big. Then tragedy struck. Just when the book was making it big, Patry was diagnosed with a virulent form of cancer, and over the last year has been in and out of the hospital numerous times.The book stands up on its own, even without the back story about the author. It is billed as a \\"psychological thriller,\\" although I'm not sure it needs the \\"psychological\\" qualifier. The narrator is the wife of a prominent physician in a suburban community, who, despite her social position works as a school secretary. Her seemingly placid life is upset by the arrival of Ali, the attractive new music teacher, who casually breaks hearts as skillfully as she plays her violin.The narrator, Jeanne, winds up becoming a friend of Ali, her only female friend, but then the friendship begins to crack as she suspects Ali's relationships with her son and her husband. At one point in the story, Jeanne, reflecting on her own marriage, wonders \\"When exactly had the romantic veneer begun to peel away, exposing the void that was at the heart of our marriage?\\" But the veneer over the heart of Jeanne's marriage is not the only veneer that peels away, exposing a rottenness that she would rather not notice.The book is very well written, as I would expect anything by Patry Francis to be. (She would know how to write that sentence less awkwardly.) And, yet, it's not quite a perfect book, much as I would like it to be. The ending is not quite believable. It depends on something on a cell phone and I don't think cell phones work like that; at least mine doesn't. I'm impressed again with how hard it is to write fiction and how almost fiendishly impossible it is to write good endings -- at least ones that meet my weird tastes.Despite my picking, Patry has written a good book which I can highly recommend. I gave it four stars."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"A good book that offers insight into human nature. People are often not who they appear to be.

This is a faster-paced read though, I took a really long lunch one day at work because I just didn't want to stop reading, had to see what would happen next. My only complaint is that I really didn't like any of these characters, except the son. However, likeable or not, they were still fascinating, especially the mysterious Ali. What I enjoyed about this story was that it was very well structured, even though it raced along, it was well-layered and full of twists and turns that I didn't always anticipate or see coming."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"This book is a real page turner.

If the large dark rings under my eyes prove anything today, is that the book did not disappoint. Not in a million years. It was heart-wrenching, real, frightening--and an all very well written thriller that will keep you page turning (like I did) until you find yourself at the end. An end that will have your swirling and whirling (again, like me).I can't give away too many details. For one there are just too many and I won't give the book (and author) justice. And secondly, I just want to let the story unfold for you--the way it should. It's a thriller! I can't give a thing away. I just can't!BUT, I do want to say this, the characters in this book, well, are to die for. Very real, riveting, and keep you guessing. I guess you could say they are very human, very real, and complicated. As each of us should be (don't you think?). Read and watch as the story unfolds. It will take you to dark places inside each of us. And into the hearts and minds into a cast of characters that will have you thinking about them--even after you put the book down 12 hours earlier.It's a little like being thrown into suburbia, into a woman's life, into her families life, into her communities life, and learning about it all. How precarious it all is. Especially when something dreadful goes really (really) wrong. It's got all the pieces of a great literary read. Throw in the suspense. The sticky parts. And all the love that goes along with families, friends, and life. That's THE LIAR'S DIARY. Fabulous read to get lost in--make it your bathtub read this weekend. Trust me, you won't be able to put it down (might consider getting out of the bath and moving to your bed so you don't shrivel up into nothing).

I started this book one evening and could not put it down until I'd finished at 3 AM. Jeanne is the perfect wife and mother on the surface, but as the layers are peeled back, we understand that denial and her inability to see or hear the truth about her marriage, her child and herself call her entire morality into serious question. Ali, the flamboyant, creative free spirit with very public fidelty issues seems the obvious target for cliche judgments, but may well be the truest, most honorable character in the book. The Liar's Diary is the kind of novel that you want to talk about long after reading the final page. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"The Liar's Diary, a psychological suspense novel by debut author Patry Francis, should be tooled in fragrant red leather with gilt edges, and placed on your bookshelf in a place of honor.Be forewarned. When you buy it, allow for an uninterrupted block of time. Forget sleep. The lure of The Liar's Diary is strong, for it will call your name incessantly, and your dreams will be filled with Ms. Francis's characters long after you've reached the end of this riveting new work.Full of subtle, twisting truths that bob and weave in a surf of lies, The Liar's Diary is like a fragile raft on a swelling sea of denial. Carefully selected truths are masterfully revealed as we are thrust into the life of high school secretary Jeanne Cross. The raft soars higher - just enough to almost peer over the whitecaps. Jeanne glimpses half-truths so disturbing she retreats into the safety of her compulsively ordered life. Disoriented and in psychological turmoil, we twist and weave in yet another direction beside her, constantly on edge and guessing until the final page.Jeanne strives to be the dutiful wife, mother, housekeeper, nurturer, and employee. But we quickly learn her perfect life is built on a severely cracked foundation. Gavin Cross, the debonair doctor husband, is a controlling father who bullies his son, feeding an explosive eating disorder that sends Jamie Cross to chocolate for relief. Scenarios of mockery escalate, with full blame for Jamie's lack of academic success laid squarely at Jeanne's feet. In her picture perfect house, we soon discover a supremely unhappy woman who lives in suburban hell, trying to defend her beloved son and keep peace in the dysfunctional family.Enter Ali Mather, the new music teacher at Jeanne's school who flounces into Jeanne's staid world of responsibility with flowing strawberry blond hair, fragrant perfumes, and tight jeans, enticing the high school boys and male teachers, and providing hours of juicy gossip for the rest of the staff. Ali, flamboyant, passionate, and unabashedly sexy, is the antithesis of sedate, controlled Jeanne. Yet, through a circumstance not fully understood, Jeanne is drawn to Ali like a powerful narcotic.Ali, married to George Mather, a most perfect husband, has issues of her own. Unresolved childhood traumas send her into the arms of two men in Jeanne's town, shocking the quiet community. George, strangely forgiving and still madly in love with his philandering wife, cuts a figure of loving forgiveness. As Ali embraces her hedonistic experiences, including an affair with the school shop teacher half her age, Jeanne reacts with simultaneous repulsion and fascination.But someone is stalking Ali, entering her home and leaving subtle reminders of their presence. Is it one of her lovers? A student? A jealous wife? Her music is desecrated, personal items disappear, but the police don't take her seriously. Jeanne struggles to help her friend overcome her fears and abandoned relationships, just when Ali's diary disappears and people start to die.The story twists into another realm, shocking the reader multiple times, surging higher now with dark half-truths. Jeanne's son is accused of ungodly crimes, and it's up to her to uncover the facts. She must discover who's lying, in order to save her son.Patry Francis is a gifted deep thinker who knows people and paints them well.Her writing style is engaging and smooth going down - like a big bowl of lime sherbet. First time novelists often try too hard, peppering their prose with ostentatious adverbs and adjectives. But Ms. Francis's writing focuses on the compelling story as the movie plays in your head with a clever appreciation of the craft.I highly recommend The Liar's Diary to anyone who enjoys a good suspense, mystery, or psychological thriller."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"Ali Mather is popular, beautiful and loved by all --- especially by the men in town. Being estranged doesn't mean a thing, as it has still allowed her to have a husband and a couple of boyfriends at the same time. An accomplished musician, she loves making music for herself, her students and society as a whole. It's important that she give back, and her music is the only way she knows how. Her life seems truly complete, but the only thing she doesn't have is a real friend --- someone in whom she can confide. Everyone needs that, right?Ali finds solace in befriending Jeanne Cross, an office worker at the school. From the onset, things were awkward between them, but eventually they both open up and discover they have a lot in common --- more than they ever could imagine.Jeanne's life is fairly ordinary. As the school secretary, she enjoys her work. Raising her only child with her husband has left her in a lurch for years, and she doesn't have any friends either --- at least none she feels she can talk to about personal matters. On the outside, their family seems perfect. But who knows what lurks beyond the closed doors of the Cross household?Getting to know one another doesn't come easy; Jeanne is practically a loner. She has good reason, though. As the wife of one of the town's most influential people, she has to keep up appearances by day. But at night she lives on the prescription drugs her husband gives her, in an attempt to undermine who she really is. Why then did the good doctor marry her? Was it love, or something else?As Ali begins to bond with Jeanne, all of Ali's secrets come tumbling out as well. She's having an affair with one of the teachers and the local car dealer, and to top it off, it appears she has a stalker. As thought becomes reality, Ali finds out an awful secret --- one that will cost her dearly. The mystery unfolds, but the one thing that remains and contains the real truth is missing --- Ali's diary. Who finds it in the end? Sometimes, things aren't as plain as they seem.Patry Francis has written a great first novel. Completely pulling the readers into the storyline, this journey takes you through self-reflection, sensitivity and empathy --- not only for the characters involved, but for real-life situations that occur every single day. Francis forces you to take a closer look at the people you call your friends and situations to which you don't even give second glances. It's a cruel world out there, but the author excels at exposing the world within. If you're in the mood for a good suspense novel, don't sleep on THE LIAR'S DIARY.

And the ending is worthy of the best mystery/suspense novels.Francis skillfully weaves subtle clues throughout the story. The characters are well rounded. Just as in real life, there are no angels here. Even the best intentioned characters make bad choices. This gives the story authenticity as the characters advance the plot. Well, this is difficult to write about because I want to tell you what happened, yet I don't want to give anything away.

Jeanne has never defied Gavin on anything until vibrant forty-six years old new teacher Alice \\"Ali\\" Mather arrives in town. Jeanne makes friends with the newcomer over the objection of her husband.Ali's &eacute;lan gives Jeanne renewed hope that she could find something to lift her spirits. The repressed female also knows she envies her new pal's ability to remain upbeat and seemingly lives life to the fullest. As Gavin objects and threatens his wife, Ali hops into one sordid incident after another leaving a sad Jeanne to wonder whether her staid existence is superior to the fulfilled life of her friend though she admits morality is boringly tedious. Now Ali insists someone is breaking into her home, but stealing nothing. When murder occurs evidence points at Jamie shaking up further his already confused mom.This is a chilling psychological suspense thriller told by Jeanne who is shocked and awed with the freedom and spirit of the newcomer. The story line is character driven as the prim and proper Cross family hides their individual vulnerabilities and obsessions from the world, but readers know them due to Jeanne's account. The intrusion and murder mystery add depth to an entreating look at disturbed individuals in which the audience will be stunned by realistic fascinating Gestalt like twists in which the obvious is not necessarily the truth.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book, but I did so I guess that's something. It read a lot like RL Stine's adult fiction which is overly dramatic and full of needless cliffhangers, like someone who is used to writing for teenagers and can't quite translate for adults.

Beautifully written with a plot that grabs hold and doesn't let go, it is the sort of book that reminds you why you love reading."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"In Patry Francis' The Liar's Diary, we have a stunning debut novel.Enter Ali Mather, 46, the new music teacher at Bridgeway High, who's married and otherwise attached, and a mite too sexy for her own good. Enter Jeanne Cross, the super-efficient school secretary married to orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gavin Cross. They have one son, Jamie, 16, who is in many ways a typically alienated teenager who complains his family life is only a \\"pretense\\".This is no ordinary first novel; it is a novel that wends its way around a mystery, and one that will keep you guessing throughout. The pace is quick, the reading smooth, and the characters finely drawn.Ali and Jeanne cross paths and continue to cross paths in The Liar's Diary. At first, it seems to begin innocently enough. Ali asks Jeanne to give her a ride to the high school; Ali claims an old injury is to blame for her inability to drive the few additional blocks. Jeanne is not happy about this initial encounter with the woman with whom she assumes she has nothing in common, yet at one point Jeanne wonders if Ali is somehow a darker version of she, Jeanne, herself.Such reflections upon Jeanne's psyche and her own prim life are well worth looking into. This is the world of high gloss, the world around which her doctor husband (and the other characters) revolves; it is a world of status, appearance, and all things false.Jeanne keeps daily life together when all around her things fall apart: she works all day, keeps track of and worries about her son, while doing the laundry, cooking and indulging in hyper-rigorous cleaning - cleaning becomes a metaphor for her psychological state.There is a subtle and not-so-subtle interplay of light and dark in The Liar's Diary. Ali is sexy; Jeanne is efficient. And paradise on earth is not what it appears to be.From an innocent start, the novel grows darker: soon, from the looks of it, Ali is being stalked. And someone in Jeanne's family is a suspect. Wait. More happens, there is a murder. I cannot say whom, for that would spoil the plot.Pressure begins to get to Jeanne. She turns to her husband for help.Excerpt from book:\\" Yes, what is it, Jeanne?\\"\\"I found myself stammering like an idiot - with my own husband. \\"Well, I thought maybe w-we could talk a little bit...But, if you're busy...It doesn't look like a good time -\\" God, what was wrong with me?\\"Actually, I'm in the middle of a research piece I'm writing for an orthopedic journal. Is this important?\\" He spoke softly, but his impatience bristled in the air.\\"No. Well, yes. I mean I've been feeling, well, a little edgy lately, and I thought that maybe you might prescribe something for me.\\"\\"Gavin set his glasses carefully on the desk and regarded me thoughtfully. In the past, he had prescribed various sedatives, using the very same word, when he handed me the bottles. I was edgy...\\"I'm glad you're ready to deal with it,\\" Gavin said, smiling and nodding like he did with his patients. \\"You haven't been yourself lately, Jeanne. I've noticed and I'm sure lots of other people have, too. Think about it: You work at Jamie's school. The last thing you want to do is add to his problems.\\" He shook his head the way he always did when he mentioned Jamie's \\"problems.\\" But he was already removing the prescription pad he kept in his locked drawer and scrawling the words.\\" End of excerpt.Patry weaves subtle poison into daily life. A few days later:Second excerpt from book:\\"I held the phone in my hand for a few moments, staring at if it had the answer to my questions. When I looked up, Gavin was standing in the doorway to the kitchen in his bathrobe, his lips fixed in the straight line that said he was trying to conceal his anger. \\"It's that teacher again, right? The one you've been driving to school,\\" he said, starting for the coffeepot. Then, before I had a chance to respond, he added, \\"Tell her to get herself another taxi service.\\"\\"I stared at his rigid back. It was rare for Gavin to order me to do anything, least of all in that tone of voice. And when I asked why, he said,\\" The woman's a bad influence on your son, for one thing. Jamie was up at five this morning, pacing around the house like a lion, caught up in her tawdry little drama.\\"\\"Of course, my mouth was full of protest. How could a friend I never brought home be any kind of influence on our son, good or bad? And next year, Ali would be Jamie's music teacher whether Gavin liked it or not...\\"\\"I sighed deeply, wondering how I would get through another Sunday: smiling at my fellow parishioners while wonderful Dr. Cross greeted everyone by name, cooking a gourmet dinner that my family would gulp down so distractedly they hardly tasted it, facing Jamie's uncompleted homework assignments at night. And meanwhile, Ali was off, taking a few personal days...listening to music...and undoubtedly spending long afternoons in bed with Jack Butterfield, the best lover she'd ever had, according to her. For the first time, I felt some of the envy that flared through the lunchroom seeping into my thoughts like a poison. \\" End of excerpt.Perusing the list of characters - two husbands, a boyfriend, a dead man and dead man's wife, a neighbor, (the list goes on), Patry walks you through each suspect, making you believe each might have committed the murder. Each character seems a perfect prop for his or her suburban life. Yet each character seems to live some sort of lie. Patry then turns the screw another turn and digs the knife deeper. Though not a typical murder mystery, The Liar's Diary is a mystery and does involve a murder.

Jeanne Cross is a suburban housewife and mother who works as secretary at Bridgeway High School. She's wed to Gavin, a bit of a jock, and is mother to 16-year-old Jamie who tends to the pudgy and suffers from dyslexia. Jeanne is not particularly thrilled with her life as is revealed in the rather staccato way she describes it.Things change with the arrival of Ali, a violinist and composer with a lust for life and men. She comes to Bridgeway High to teach music and soon beds the married shop teacher. Outward appearances would indicate that Jeanne and Ali are polar opposites, yet they soon become fast friends despite the disapproval of Gavin. Ali, of course, has the upper hand in this relationship as Jeanne is attracted to her new friend's amoral lifestyle. It seems exciting, exhilarating, fun - everything she does not find in her own world and home.As the story unfolds and grows darker Jeanne reveals snippets of herself, long held secrets. Then tragedy occurs and the key to a murder is to be found in a diary.

This novel begins with great promise, as a closely observed study of a suburban community--but soon gives way to cliched melodrama as it evolves into another expose of \\"darkness\\" beneath the surface of suburbia.Much of the dialogue is overwrought. This is a novel where characters, supposedly in casual conversation, say things like, \\"I had fallen into a troubled sleep. It had been a bad day, one that had persistently challenged my thin veneer of sanity.\\" Oh yes, the old thin veneer of sanity. The novel is also way over-narrated, its heroine subjecting you to every detail of her many \\"duh\\" conclusions.It's too bad because Francis is a gifted storyteller who can create nerve-wracking suspense and her portraits of this dysfunctional crew are filled with precise insights into family life. She needs to ratchet up her language ambitions, tho, learn how to write more realistic dialogue, and move beyond this novel's \\"Lifetime: Television for Women\\" tone.For a much better novel with similar themes of obsession and the dissolution of a family, read Zoe Heller's NOTES ON A SCANDAL."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"You better set yourself aside a good chunk of time when you pick up The Liar's Diary (the stunning debut novel by Patry Francis) because I can tell you from personal experience that once you start reading, you're not going to want to stop until you've finished.On the surface, this is a book about the seemingly perfect Cross family, living their slightly flawed lives out in the suburbs (the only flaw appears to be the superficial flaw of the son who is overweight) and the woman, the unwanted element, who enters their lives--Ali Mather. Below, the surface, however, this is a book about betrayal; it's about secrets and lies and years of abuse and denial and how all of these things if not uncovered and dealt with in some healthy way, can lead to disaster, which in this case, they most certainly do.It is also about Jeanne Cross's awakening and her realization that she has been stuffing down her emotions for close to 20 years. As is typically the case with such repression, when the pressure cooker reaches its limit--it explodes.Most heartbreaking of all, this book about errant mothers, abusive fathers, and lost children. And while there are certainly villans (Gavin Cross being the most obvious choice for villan, but Ali being cast as one as well from time to time), these villans are also human beings, who are damaged and hurting and acting out in the only way they know how.I will not (because I don't want to ruin it for you) go into details of the plot (there are many surprises in store, though!), but I will say without hesitation that if you don't pick up this book and read it, you're going to be missing out."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"Liar's abound in this chilling suspense novel, and their web of deception results in devastation and death.Jeanne Cross, a school secretary married to a hotshot doctor, has spent her life portraying the part of the perfect wife and mother, ignoring the way her husband's secret activities are destryoing the life of their 16 year old son, Jamie.

Jeanne's life and her perception of a model family crumble as she delves deeper into Ali's death and the knowledge she took to her grave. Long-held secrets are unveiled and strip the layers of Jeanne's perfect life down to its evil core.Patry Francis's exquisitely crafted work takes the reader for a convoluted, twisting ride into the realm of compulsive love and lies that pave the way to an unpredictable ending. The pages of THE LIAR'S DIARY are skillfully fashioned into interlocking subplots that are packed with suspense and clever revelations at every turn.Look out though, 'cause in THE LIAR'S DIARY, nothing is as it seems."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"Patry Francis' debut novel is one that will haunt you long after you've put it down. With rich characters and unbelievable plot twists, you won't believe the stunning conclusion. This author is one to read and watch."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"The Liar's Diary begins innocuously at first - a new teacher arrives at the school where Jeanne Cross, a suburban wife and mother works as a secretary. Ali Mather is beautiful, charismatic, and willful. She is a brilliant composer and violinist. Students, fellow teachers, and even crusty old janitors fall under her spell. Jeanne, whose initial distrust and jealousy melts as Ali and she form an unlikely friendship is similarly captivated despite herself. Ali is outspoken, forthright, and sexual. Jeanne is quite the opposite - a woman who does not know what she thinks or feels and who prefers not knowing rather than attempting to probe the shadowy questions and challenges that confront her on a daily basis.A strong undertone of psychological and emotional abuse runs through The Liar's Diary, though Francis is such a fine writer that she never labels it as such. Instead, she reveals through narrative the master manipulator that Jeanne's handsome doctor husband has become -- soft spoken, icily rational, subtly demoralizing. She shows Jeanne wither emotionally from his hostility but it is Jaime who suffers the most. His father's contempt and criticism, cloaked under a guise of false camaraderie, send him to the refrigerator for comfort. He gorges on junk food and hides the evidence while his mother, though worrying about his weight, plies him with the food he loves to assuage the pain that she cannot quite get herself to acknowledge.Ali, though, sees through the faade of niceness that pervades the Cross household and challenges Jeanne to confront it. I will stop here, because to tell you more would be to share too much of a story that grows more complex and intriguing as it builds in intensity."},{"Title":"The Liars Diary","review":"This disturbing, beautifully written story announces a masterful, new writer at work. Francis takes on hideous truths with an elegant, smart style, braidingcomplex characters with plot twists that lead to the novel's astonishing end. I couldn't stop reading this book and I can't stop thinking about this author.Read other reviews for plot synopsis-- but when you read the novel, you will be amazed at how Francis manages her protagonist--a seemingly sweet toe-the-line mother, wife, and school administrator from suburbia; the kind of person who doesn't cause trouble, who doesn't ask questions, who doesn't like to be upset until something too close to home triggers her to go way outside her comfort level.A wonderful debut."},{"Title":"The Oregon Desert","review":"My husband has read this book and decided to give it to various friends..He really enjoyed it.

It's a cliche to say their lives are changed forever by their encounter, but Gordimer introduces fresh and complex twists into this most ancient of plots --Boy Meets Girl, and Nothing is Ever the Same Again.Julie Summers, the archetypal poor little rich girl, meets Adbu -- not his real name -- in a garage workshop in Johannesburg, South Africa. Julie is in flight from her privileged background and splintered family; Abdu is an illegal immigrant from an impoverished desert nation, desperate to make a better life for himself. They become lovers, and a chain of events is set in motion that eventually leads to marriage, deportation and exile in a remote desert village in Africa.The powerful erotic tension between them keeps them together, in spite of the widening gulf between their goals and values. Julie -- who takes for granted so many of the advantages that come with her background of wealth and status -- is fascinated by the strange new world, the exotic culture, religion and language into which her bond with Abdu plunges her. She is mesmerised by the desert, and builds deepening bonds with the women of the clan. Abdu, however, is almost fanatically determined to emigrate to a Western nation and build a &quot;good life&quot;, one with the security and comforts that Julie has the luxury of despising.Gordimer is an incisive and intelligent as ever in exploring complex issues, and she has her finger on the pulse of issues perplexing both post-apartheid South Africa and the global village. Migrancy and refugee movements have become major issues for the 21st century, with wealthier countries adopting increasingly hard-line attitudes and policies, even though many of them were founded by immigrants. In a relatively short book, Gordimer also touches deftly on the entire range of questions raised by cross-cultural relationships -- from the intimate and domestic to the broad and metaphysical ones of religion and identity. She also provides a fascinating study of how two people who love each other can fail utterly to understand one another.I've withheld a fifth star only because I was slightly dissatisfied with the ending; Gordimer often resists closure, but I am a little wary with the trend in current South African writing that has women accepting the &quot;lesser portion&quot; and resigning themselves to fate. But I recognise that the ending is what will spark much debate about this fine work. So, to find out what actually happens -- read the book!"},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Through the use of a highly creative writing style, almost \`expressionistic' in character, Gordimer describes a wonderful illustration of a human transformation. The protagonist is a girl from the privileged White South African Bourgeois, who was virtually surrounded by privilege and opportunity. At least that is how it seems to an immigrant from a poor Islamic country in Europe. And, yet, unlikely as it would seem, she falls in love with this immigrant who is working as a garage mechanic. Having been raised in a more enlightened age in Modern South Africa, it does not seem inappropriate to either her or her bohemian friends at the Caf&eacute;/Restaurant that she frequents for her to do so.He has hopes that his involvement with her will help him stay in the country, which is trying to expel him, but he did not initially intend to fall in love. His vision is one of success that looks so sweet from outside the capitalist economies of the world, but can be so elusive once one enters within. Her vision seems yet to be developed. She has a job, which could be done in most parts of the world. She is an educated girl. And yet, she finds herself, through her own choice transported to the world of the desert; a world without computers and supermarkets. True, there is some electricity and there are cell phones and TV's, but not too much else in the way of modern day amenities, including a lack of running water. But there is always what becomes a strange allure of the desert around her.With technique that is nothing short of brilliant, Gordimer renders a tale of rejection of values from all sides. The man is rejecting the values of his homeland, and the woman is doing likewise, but neither knows truly what they seek at the end of their journey. The interplay of cross-cultural interaction is deeply conveyed within the text. The richness of communication, between people who speak more non-verbally, than with words is portrayed with particular alacrity. Many of the deepest thought processes are left for the reader to understand by inference. And the solutions to problems in the journey are particularly uniquely resolved. The book is truly a modern day piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This book is very subtle and beautiful. The carefully detailed explanation of the relationship that grows and changes between Julie and Abdu is exquisite. The interactions of Julie and her family, and then the quietly growing connections Julie makes in Abdu's desert family, the roots she puts down when she had no anchors until then, are described to perfection. The end of the book is inevitable, once you know it. But although I gradually came to accept and understand it, I am left after reading the last few pages with an ache in my chest for all of the characters.My only complaint is that some of Gordimer's sentences are so tortured and indecipherable I had to read them three times before I could figure them out. Now what's that about? Does she mean for the sentences to be that convoluted? Is this due to bad editing? I know it's not me, as I have read many so-called &quot;difficult&quot; authors: among them Nabokov, Lessing various Russians, Japanese etc. Gordimer is writing in English, my native language, for heaven's sake.BUT---nevertheless I strongly recommend this atmospheric, evocative, painful novel."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"...if you like books that complicate conventional notions of love. The first half of the book is a disorienting bit of restraint, the meaning of which is only revealed once the story's location changes at the mid-point to some unnamed poor African country. Then you see these two characters' lives crossing at an intersection that we might call love. Or are these just the colliding desires of two desperate and unhappy people? Gordimer is a master of economy and subtle observance. There is not an ounce of crap in this book. It's not just about love but about the contemporary world and its stupefyingly unfair inequalities, but also about the startling similarities that people can share amid those inequalities."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"No Pat Answers. A Book Review of The Pick Up, Nadine Gordimer, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, copyright 2001Required reading for any sophisticated reader and non-Muslim women that are involved with, considering involvement with or have been involved with \\"the other\\", in this case a Muslim man.The main female character, Julie, is adrift in her middle class life. She is annoying, self-centered, independent yet vague. She and her friend spend many hours at the EL-AY Table in a cafe somewhere in a cosmopolitan South African location. Here, these folks bide and chat away their time while claiming each other as family. Involved in each other's lives, they are liberal, artist, freedom-loving, accepting and kind of vacuous. Abdu is working illegally, in a nearby garage. His Arabic country of origin remains unnamed throughout the book. We are given a sense of his physicality, his respect for authority and wealth and his incredible desire to flee his own country for a better life.The characters on their own.....bore. \\"She is aware of having to learn in a circumstance she, in all her confident discard of conventional ones, finds she had no preparation for. He, her find; it was also this one, to be discovered in herself.\\" Together, the characters intrigue. Their relationship launches from the land of great chemistry.Casually, Julie \\"picks up\\" Abdu, or does he pick her up? The question subsides as what sometimes happens with people, happens, they fall in love. The sexuality and love-making are very tastefully and elegantly described. \\"That night they made love, the kind of love-making that is another country, a country of its own, not yours or mine.\\"We are unassumingly lead down the path this relationship follows. Ms. Gordimer's voice of the white South African female, circa the mid 1990s, agilely tiptoes into inter-racial, cross-cultural relations without being too self conscious or too precious. The author's style is aloof and occasionally dry while maintaining impeccable style. This winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature describes events, emotions, and interactions as though they are playing out behind a gauzy silk veil, with light, catch-a-glimpse-if-you-can elusiveness.The two lead characters progress to an unpredictable place, in such a way that usually only happens to real people. The author writes as if the story is being told to her as she tells it to us; this is an unfolding we are experiencing together. Her topics captivate: Human relationship, love, sex, family, country, life path, intimacy, interconnectedness; the rich list continues on.... Whether or not we are happy with the conclusion of this story pales next to being privy to a rich, deep, complex relationship and being invited to visit another country."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Okay let's start with what I didn't like......the ending. I found it terribly unsatisfying....perhaps because I am a romantic and had hoped for something more along those lines.That said. As a whole I loved the book for its wonderful writing, challenging to read at times, but a unique and interesting voice that seemed to suit the characters and the plot. I haven't read anything else by this author so I can't compare it with her other works, but I am intrigued enough to pick up another of her novels in the future.What works in the novel is the exploration of the clash of cultures that infiltrates a love relationship between two people of very disparate backgrounds, and the differing motivations they bring to their relationship. Do they ultimately both get what they wanted? Some would argue yes, even in the end. I just would have preferred the storybook happy ending. But that's my cultural and romantic bias."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"I have just finished this book and, while deeply satisfied with the story, I doubt I can tell you what it is 'about', just to recommend it highly.There is a lot of irony, coming from Gordimer, especially when describing the aimless, 'politically correct' (to use an expedient term), loosely-formed political/apolitical group the heroine hangs out with at a local cafe, having eschewed, partly, her divorced parents' suburban living style. The first half of the book deals with a kind of undefined life in South Africa now, mixed in ways not possible during apartheid and lacking obvious goals in life. The second half, the protagonist's decision to go back with her Arab lover to his (nameless) country, gives us more glue, more fleshed-out characters, a richly detailed story of the lover's Islamic family in a poor village in this desert country. Reasons why Arabs and others emigrate are made obvious. So is the shallowness of some of these reasons. The aimless 'girl', about 30, slowly changes and finds something she didn't have, or know existed, in her South Africa, comparatively rich in opportunities for her, contrasted with those for her lover. I kept thinking she was Berger's Daughter, from an earlier novel of Gordimer. Both are alienated -- Berger's Daughter by virtue of circumstance -- she has lost her radical, anti-apartheid, prominent parents and, for a long time, she seemed buffeted by social forces and groups of people, had no governing center for herself; Julie in The Pickup (an ironic title itself, which obtains throughout the book) also allows circumstance to push her, has no inner principle to guide her life. In this book the protagonist does move, movingly, to a point of making her own needful, radical decision and it is both inevitable and a satisfying surprise."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"\\"The Pickup (PU)\\" may be Nadine Gordimer's best novel to date. Her observations about social and cultural conflict and the universal truths revealed in her latest is proof indeed that, despite her well entrenched reputation as an African novelist, Gordimer's aim is lofty and wide and the result is that she has successfully avoided being cast in the limiting mould of an ethnic writer.PU doesn't necessarily make easy reading. Gordimer's prose is terse, occasionally difficult, and distancing. Her perspectives often shift from Julie to Abdu and back again without any warning, so you may find yourself stranded in mid air - like a deer caught in the headlights - but the discomfort is only temporary because you quickly find your feet and recover. The style that Gordimer has chosen to write in isn't alienating but curiously congruous within the context of the social and cultural issues she surfaces in this tale with an otherwise well worn premise of a white girl picking up a black boy and paying the price of her socially disgraceful act.Julie Summers is a white girl from a privileged background in South Africa. She despises her father's life of business, privilege and distinction, choosing to spend her time hanging out with her other liberal minded friends at the \\"EL-AY Caf&eacute; Table\\", where they congregate daily to [complain] about social injustices, etc. Abdu is an illegal immigrant, working long hours like a \\"grease monkey\\" in a run down garage and desperate to make a living in his newly (albeit illegally) adopted home. Julie picks Abdu up after a chance meeting. They become lovers and when Abdu gets deported, Julie decides to marry him and they return to his natural home, an unnamed country in Africa.The internal conflicts and struggles in their relationship before and after leaving South Africa arise from their contrasting backgrounds and the unspoken cultural baggage that accompany them. To Julie, dignity is about principles - she baulks at crawling back to Daddy for help. For Abdu, it is about survival and building a better life for himself, so he finds Julie's attitude genuinely puzzling. Julie gives scarcely a thought to the meaning of \\"home\\" for she always had one. For Abdu, his natural home is a hell hole from which he must escape to find another that allows him to fulfil his potential. Then there are Julie's friends at the Table. What do they really know and what do they stand for ? Is their all talk and no action simply a pastime for privileged white youths ?When the second half of the story moves permanently to black Africa, we sense the subtle changes creeping into the relationship between Julie and Abdu, who becomes Ibrahim, his real name. Here, Gordimer shows great intuition judging their behaviourial shifts as they make the transition. In his own habitat, Abdu becomes even more silent, concentrated and tunnel visioned. Julie's quiet acceptance of her new family's ways shows a genuine attempt to blend in and is both touching and real. Still an outsider, Julie seeks solace in her visits to the \\"desert at the end of the road\\" - her secret place - where she recoups her resources and regains her sense of balance and perspective. Like us perhaps, Abdu waits for Julie to crack up and reveal her true mettle as one of the boys at the Table. But Gordimer has other ideas and the ending she has devised contains a jaw dropping twist nobody will foresee. It is the novelist's expression of eternal surprise and compassion that encapsulates the human spirit. A beautiful ending. \\"The Pickup\\" resonates with a power and optimism that makes this one of the most compelling and deeply satisfying novels I have read. I'm surprised it didn't make it beyond the 2001 Booker Prize longlist. In my opinion, it's more substantial than and far surpasses some which made the shortlist."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Julie Ackroyd Summers is a successful young woman in her early thirties working for a public relations office in Johannesburg. One day, her car breaks down and she is rescued by a mechanic called Ibrahim who is an illegal employee at a garage near the EL-AY caf&eacute; where Julie is a regular patron. Ibrahim comes from an unnamed Arab country and Julie falls in love with him. Their relationship has to be kept secret all the more since Julie despises her privileged background. She is outright ashamed of her father - a businessman whose sole interest in life is money - and his new wife Danielle as well as of her mother who abandoned her daughter to marry a casino owner in California.When Ibrahim receives the order to depart from South Africa within 14 days because he is in contravention of the termination of his permit, Julie tries to resort to every legal way to prolong Ibrahim's sojourn, but to no avail. When Julie informs her father that she intends to accompany Ibrahim back to his homeland, he tells her bluntly: \\"You choose to go to hell in your own way.\\" Before they depart, Julie and Ibrahim get married. Yet life in the small Arab village is far from hell. Although Ibrahim's sole concern is to obtain a visa for an English speaking country, Julie adapts quite nicely to her new surroundings, learns Arabic, teaches English and participates in the family life. When Ibrahim is granted a visa for America at last, he can't believe what decision his wife has taken...A beautiful, powerful novel about characters and their notions of the other being totally overturned. The social mix created by Mrs Gordimer between contemporary South Africa and the small Arab village in the desert is truly stunning.

Its language is nonchalantly smooth and effortless, captures the characters eloquently and the environment with economical words.The language is between the work of an artist and a detail observer of human activities. The setting is in South Africa. The characters are real, too real to believe.From a simple occurence of a breakdown car, Julie and Abdu meets each other and their meaningful (or meaningless) lives are pushed towards a direction of passion, and love. That is before reality enters the picture.Written with simplicity and reality; and the prose of a master story teller, The pickup is one of my favourite books and it ranks up there with novels like To Kill a Mockingbird, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay etc.I love it."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"If you like reading each paragraph twice due to incoherent, sophomoric writing...you'll like this book."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Despite all the criticism this book has received, I can say that I've thoroughly enjoyed it. It is EXTREMELY difficult to understand how life is for someone like Abdu (Ibrahim), who, as an under-the-radar (of the immigration patrol), under the books mechanic, lives a life so far-removed from the comforts of a \\"developed\\" nation such as America. The grammar is hazy because where Ibrahim lives, communication is more through gestures and circumstance than through words alone. They say that about four-fifths of human communication is non-verbal, in fact. In order to fully comprehend this book, one must look beyond the blatant and use one's imagination to empathize with Ibrahim's third-world way of life, which has many cultural norms that are not found in American society, such as religious fanaticism."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"The PickupThis was a wonderful story, even though the author's writing style took a few pages to find the rhythm.

It reminds me of those pretentious reading groups where people used to sit around talking about what this poet or that poet meant. Really, no one knew what they meant because it made no sense, but the dumbbells standing around felt intelligent pretending to understand it.

Why do the stupidest people out there get to decide what's hot and what's not?To illustrate, I'm going to write the above review in the same language as the book, just to give you an idea of what you'll be dealing with if you buy it:Disappointment, shudders. Small fingers pinching your eyes out of your head. Blinding. Scorching. Misery. Tears. She slammed the book down in anger. Where was the justice? How much had she paid already? Well then, it was not so much.Sigh."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This was the first book I've read by Nadine Gordimer--and it will also be my last. The story on the dust jacket intrigued me, and although I read the book very quickly I thought it was deeply flawed. Gordimer's clumsy writing style was distracting and seemed contrived. Moreover, I found her attempt at treating the themes of globalization and cross-cultural interaction very stereotypical. The protagonist Julie is a poor little rich girl who is depicted with veiled contempt and condescenion by the author. I couldn't muster up much sympathy for her either. Once Julie and her lover \\"Abdu\\" go to his unnamed homeland, the story becomes completely preposterous and it is obvious that Gordimer does not know what she is talking about and does not know much about Middle Eastern culture. By refusing to be specific about Abdu's country, Gordimer engages in orientalism--so I was really surprised to see that Edward Said gave this book a glowing review. For a better treatment of cross cultural issues, I would recommend Half a Life by V.S. Naipaul."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Product( the Pickup by Nadine Gordimer) in excellent condition and delivered on time. j. Reinecke"},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"From the first sentence in The Pickup, the reader is immediately overwhelmed with Gordimer's, shall we say, unique style. Her terse sentences, combined with lack of punctuation and direct characterization, make the plot rather hard to follow. Gordimer too largely spares descriptions of the character's appearances and day-to-day life, making them seem distant and almost inhuman, further muddying the waters. Once the reader discovers the plot, however, he or she realizes that there isn't much to analyze anyways.It seems to me like Gordimer simply stretched out a short story's plot and made it novel-length, adding in her \\"profound\\" observations about the bourgeois society and Middle Eastern culture. Her observations are somewhat superficial and obvious, though they do show evidence of a global viewpoint. Still, these observations nearly crumble under the flimsy skeleton of a plot that there is.The description on the book jacket literally takes the reader halfway through the novel; if the book started halfway through, practically the same result would be accomplished. The ending was quite frustrating and made the characters' decisions seem completely, well, out-of-character. A side plot or two provide little except a distraction and more paper. It would not surprise me if Gordimer had good insight into inter-racial relationships, however she certainly chose the wrong vehicle to display that insight in The Pickup."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"I didn't mind the lack of quotation marks for dialog, but I don't forgive the many poorly structured sentences that I could not decipher. The editor failed to do his job. Other than that, she tells a good story about life in a desert Arab town, until the ending, which I found unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"I haven't had a chance to read the book. It arrived almost a month after I ordered it. I ordered it to read with my book club, but it arrived too late for me to read. I'll read it later."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Looks like I'm the second reader from the small town of Los Osos, CA who was underwhelmed with this book. I didn't appreciate the choppy style of writing which seemed more laziness than intentional craft. Also found the premise more than a little difficult to swallow."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Am I missing something here? While I was intrigued by the premise of the novel, I was distracted by the poor writing: the annoying shorthand style and the numerous grammatical errors. Is this woman such a 'great' writer that no single word can be edited?"},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"The Pickup is a really wonderful story. The character of Julie is thoroughly engaging, as she changes from a flighty bohemian to a seasoned woman. This novel would make a wonderful, timely film, and makes me wish I were a filmmaker.The reviewer who criticized Gordimer's writing does not know what he's talking about. What he perceives as grammatical errors are mostly matters of style. There were, however, a few editing slips--and it's probably because editors are timid when confronted with a writer of Gordimer's stature. It's unfair to blame the author for timid editors."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"The Pickup is a thought provoking read touching on several topical issues of which one is the encounter between Western-style and Oriental/Islamic cultures. This cultural encounter is embedded in the relationship between the unlikely couple Abdu/Ibrahim and Julie, both escapees from their respective origins.Abdu/Ibrahim is illegally living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa, having fled his poor origins in an unnamed Arab country in search of a better life in a Western-style country. Julie, daughter of rich parents, has renounced her businessman father (her parents are divorced) in favour of a Bohemian lifestyle with her lay-about friends.The two are attracted to each other not only sexually but also by what they repesent to each other. Abdu (as he is called in South Africa) is in awe of the kind of life Julie has left behind and Julie is drawn to Abdu's oriental origins, his quiet ways, and the enigma surrounding him, a welcome spice in her otherwise bland life.Circumstances take the couple from South Africa to the unnamed Arab country, to Ibrahim's (his name in that country)impoverished village at the edge of the desert. In spite of the enormous difference in the social set up and culture Julie settles down and gets involved. Life begins to make sense to her and she is eventually accepted by Ibrahim's family and the community as a whole. However, Ibrahim, now her husband, is wasting no time finding ways to get out of there. When he eventually succeeds to get a visa for a Western country she chooses to stay behind.Gordimer's description of the life of the rich (black and white) in affluent Northern suburbs of Johannesburg is at the same time amusing and sad. She is not afraid of moving the setting out of Africa, and fascinatingly describes life in Ibrahim's poverty stricken village. I missed her usual irony though in the last half of the book.I am not sure that I find the ending credible, but that makes it even more intriguing. It is a story that stays with you for a long time and makes for interesting and heated debates. The story line is novel and surprising and Gordimer's characterisation is brilliant as usual. In the beginning I did find her new style a bit affected, irritating, and unnecessary (It is almost as if she is experimenting), but one soon forgets about it as the story starts to grip you. I wonder, though, would I have persevered if it had not been for her good name and reputation? I am glad I did. A compelling read."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"at first it's weird, the omniscient-but-distant narrator, reporting everything like third-hand information, and i wondered why she chose to tell the story like that - why not jump into the lives of these two attractive and compelling characters, get into their heads and bed more -but then it starts to make a lot of sense, and ultimately it makes the story feel fresh and real and intimate without blundering into polemic or siding with either character or using their story to say something clumsy."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape, grounded firmly in love and faithfulness. It moves quickly; I was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant. The grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of Julie and Abu. And it is not transient but deepens. Miriam, Abu's sister, remains with me in her moving quietude, and the litle girl Lela, hand in hand with Julie, plucks deep."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"If you enjoy page after page of convoluted, awkward prose; if you like being fed commonplace observations and don't mind being expected to stomach them as profound insights; and if you prefer your literature to take the form of a predictable morality tale, then you should read Nadine Gordimer's THE PICKUP.I can't imagine what led Edward Said to call this novel \\"a masterwork of creative empathy\\" that \\"opens the Arab world to an unusually nuanced perception.\\" Say what? In my opinion, Gordimer simply reinforces Orientalist prejudices -- and makes them look virtuous.The main character, Julie, is a spoiled rich kid, who is alienated from her family and stereotypically rejects her well-heeled past for a bohemian lifestyle and left-wing politics. When she meets Abdu, an illegal immigrant in her country working as a mechanic, he is ideally suited to her habit of self-analysis and quest for self-fulfilment. So, when the authorities catch up with him and Abdu is deported to the unnamed hell hole that is his home country, Julie becomes his bride and follows him.While Abdu struggles to get a visa to another Western country and dreams of the hard work and sacrifice that will eventually grant him access to a Western middle class life (we're dealing in stereotypes here, remember), Julie gets in touch with her untapped \\"traditional\\" side. She discovers the value of a close family, the benefits of the Ramadan fast (though she conveniently neglects the prohibition on sexual relations during the daylight hours), and she learns the true value of her trust fund (\\"why hadn't she taken more interest in learning these things about money! All very well to scorn them, turn up your nose at the bad smell, when there's nothing you really want\\"). She also discovers the mysteries of the desert, which the local people wisely steer clear of.So, what happens when Abdu finally gets the visa he's been waiting for? Will Julie follow? I wouldn't want to spoil the ending for anyone, so I'll only say that it merely confirms Abdu's observation earlier in the novel: \\"Too indulged and pampered to understand that's what she is, she thinks she can have everything, she doesn't know that the one thing she can't have is to survive what she's decided she wants to do now. Madness... I thought she was intelligent. Stupidity. That's it. That's final.\\"We needed 250 pages of annoying drivel to learn that?"},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This book goes deep in explaining how a western woman may find herself desiring non-western conventions. Is it just the novelty of the situation, the novelty of dating someone from a different background, the underdog? Or is the woman desiring another life completely different from her own? From the man's perspective, you wonder through the whole book if what he sees in her is love or if she means an opportunity to settle in a western developed country.The first part of this book is set in South Africa, the woman's country, while the second is set in Abu's no-named but Arabian underveloped country. The first part of the book is pretty conventional, but it does get much better - I thought that the first part was in truth stage-setting for the second part.At the end of the book, I was left wondering if the two main characters were looking for love in each other or looking for means to fill their lives with true meaning. I was also left wondering why the most appropriate choice is not always what it seems from the outside."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"We read this for our book group and the book was one of those great reads that irritated the heck out of me for lots of reasons. How realistic was this? I felt like I really wanted to know which country was involved. Are we protecting some place Nadine? It helped me a little imagining Abdu as Omar Sharif - which might explain a lot - but otherwise the character I could most sympathize with was Nigel! Why do daughters do the things they do? But here again, how realistic is this? We had recently read \\"Infidel\\" and the contrast is just too much. Granted that book is based initially on conditions in Somalia and the culture clearly is very different but it would seem in many respects that much ought to be similar especially with regard to women's rights. It helped also picturing Julie as sort of a Princess Leia doing a Luke Skywalker reversal: staring at the desert and being comforted by it instead of wanting to go anywhere rather than staying there. Cue John Williams' music. If there is to be a movie perhaps two suns over the desert scenery would help?"},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This book, in keeping our expectation from the author is exceedingly well written. While not a fun or easy book, it is worth the effort. I generally devour books in a day or two, but this was one to be taken a bit at a time. The story rings true. This is not a story designed to make you smile."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Truth be told, I really didn't like this story. On a couple of levels.First, the plot. I found Julie to be utterly insufferable. Every decision she makes is not real, it's just another way for her to do exactly what everyone else doesn't want her to do. At nearly 30, she's way too old for the teenage rebellion. She and her \\"friends\\" at the cafe live their entire lives trying to meet some sort of moral code that they think makes them superior to everyone else while they are completely unappreciative of what they do have. Her relationship with Abdu is just a way for her to take her rebellion to its outer limits. Abdu's family in the \\"Arab village\\" (more on that later) is infinitely more interesting than Julie or any of her friends. My only consolation is that Abdu also finds her insufferable from time to time.I realize this assessment is entirely personal. People with these sorts of airs and pretensions get on my last nerve.Second, the writing. Gordimer does her very best to make you need to read every passage at least twice to figure out what she is trying to say. It got to the point that I felt like I was watching a movie through a vaseline smeared screen; you have to squint to see what's going on. And then there's the matter of this \\"unnamed Arab village\\". The author is very determined that this \\"unnamed village\\" be mysterious and a stand-in for the average Arab village, but then she drops a clue that told me within 2 minutes of googling that they're in Morocco. So if you want it to be unnamed and representative, why drop that clue? I don't get it. And then there's the brief side plot of Julie's uncle being unjustly accused of sexual harassment. It had absolutely zero effect on the plot, so it felt like the author just wanted to make the point that \\"Hey! Some women lie about sexual harassment!\\"Every drawn out, metaphoric passage felt like the author poking me in the eye and saying \\"Ha ha! I'm sooooo much smarter than you.\\" What could be an interesting story about the nature of immigration is buried under all this...affectation. It wasn't even a good love story.So yeah. Thumbs down. Only finished it because it was for my book club."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This novel is a must read for both Gordimer fans and those new to her work. It addresses current concerns and takes the discussion of the disenfranchised to a totally different level. Gordimer brings her usual insight and compassion to both her subject and her protagonists."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This book, in keeping our expectation from the author is exceedingly well written. While not a fun or easy book, it is worth the effort. I generally devour books in a day or two, but this was one to be taken a bit at a time. The story rings true. This is not a story designed to make you smile."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This must be a form of English deconstructionalism. Gordimer doesn't like standard rules of English. There are no quotation marks, no conjunctions and often words pile up without a hope of understanding them. She likes dashes, italics and commas--forget the rest. (It does make writing much easier, I admit.) So the reader has to sort through and often wonder if this is done just to tweak the ugly capitalist Western reader.Still the story involved a good enough plot for me to agree to 4 stars. While I found the storyline to be close to a fantasy, I didn't toss it or give it away--I continued wondering why it won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Of course, the ending would be the reason.Imagine any tight-knit family with strong religious ties anywhere in the world and then imagine the ease that a non-religious stranger/wife would have in joining their household--living together amicably without rancor or suspicion. Only in a fantasy, would you have acceptance of the stranger without a big struggle. Even the body knows to reject foreign matter, sometimes to its own demise."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"I love this book and have selected it as one of my book group's monthly picks. My problem is that the Publisher's Weekly description and Penguin's description \\"ruined\\" one aspect of the book for me. They do more than summarize the book's premise, they completely give the story away. So, while I still enjoyed the read, I knew what was coming. I wonder how the book would have read for me if I had that element of uncertainty."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Although I found the writing style a bit unusual in its \\"flow\\", I was once again fascinated by the author's choice of characters and storyline which seemed both familiar and exotic. It reinforces the belief that we underestimate the destiny imbued in any relationship. This would be a beautiful movie."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Gordimer explores what keeps us together and apart, who belongs and who does not, in this haunting story of love and loss, beginning in a South Africa still haunted by apartheid and exacerbated by waves of illegal immigrants seeking their own financial security and an elusive happiness. It is a brilliant tale of identity that applies to all of us."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"New words to look up. Not an easy read, but very gripping. Loved the insight into Middle Eastern culture. Looking forward to our book club discussion."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"This is a tough book to review. The first half of the book is slow and sometimes you lose interest but, the second half is very revealing about the man and the woman and how their feelings about what they each want out of life.This is our book club book for the month so will have a better idea after our discussion."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"Likable:The author is very artful in unwrapping her characters - a bit at a time in tantalizing fashion. You begin to realize that it is not only you, the reader, who are gaining insight into who they are. They are discovering each other & themselves at the same time. The story itself is very compelling - weaving personalities & situations intertwined in a social, psychological, & political backdrop. Their lives are raw & flawed & that tension comes through in every chapter.Unlikable:The dialog is very stilted. Maybe she's using that to convey the characters' conflicted personalities & situation, but I found it iritating & confusing. I was never sure which character was speaking, or if they were thinking to themselves or out-loud. Would it have killed her to use quotation marks?"},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"I'd never read Gordimer before but must say, I expected more. My read was from a Kindle edition and I wondered if the conversion process had screwed up the syntax, but I gather from other reviews this word placement can't be blamed on electronics.The story started out well enough and I was able to tolerate the protagonist even though some of the plot design seemed contrived which along with the ending somehow just did not ring true. Sorry Nadine, don't think it was a great success, but I will try one of your other novels anyway just because I don't like making decisions based on one example."},{"Title":"The Pickup","review":"After reading the first few pages of \\"The Pickup\\", I was determined to reach it's conclusion. The story unfolds of two personalities that are as different as night and day. Here are two people who see the intimate workings of the world through two distinct sets of senses and whose common threads, rather than intertwine with each other's realities, run directly parallel to one another. Theirs is the story of two people who are using one another to fill a void that neither can fill because they are not grounded in the present with an eye toward the future but instead are reliving the past through each other, trying to circumvent the truths that eventually bring them to an awakening of what they are looking for in life. It's an insightful treatment of diversity in relationships that are more about codependency than they are about love."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra With Applications","review":"I just used this book for an undergraduate LA course.Most of the book is remarkably clear and straight-forward. For example, the authors manage to avoid sigma notation entirely in the proofs. The book has a nice balance of applications, computer work and theory. Before taking the course I did some work in Anton's 7th edition. The definitions and theorems in Nakos/Joyner are much clearer and less wordy than Anton's.The book still has a lot of rough edges, though. Typos abound and the text is murky in some spots. I think this would be an excellent text for an undergraduate course if the instructor used it with a critical eye to its weak spots. The second edition, if there is one, should be much more polished and, perhaps, a good choice for self study."},{"Title":"Clarence Thomas: Supreme Court Justice (People to Know)","review":"In honor of Black History Month I encouraged my son to read this biography of the second black man to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. I would not recommend this book to any other readers, except for its unintentional humor.The author never mentions one of the primary obstacles that Judge Thomas had to overcome, namely, that he was raised speaking the Georgia Sea Island dialect of Gullah, and had to learn English before attending school.The author states that young Clarence Thomas approved of the community outreach of the Black Panther Party in California. No clarification is ever given to that statement, leaving one with the impression that a Justice of the Supreme Court condones the violent form of Marxism they espouse.He states that the Senate \\"investigated\\" but never \\"decided\\" the Anita Hill controversy. Doesn't a confirmation vote of the majority of the Senate qualify as a \\"decision?Perhaps the unusual tone of the biography is due to the author's sources. While he cites several issues of \\"Jet\\" magazine, he never includes the one source that would most accurately reveal the man and his beliefs; namely Judge Thomas' own eloquent record of his opinions as a Justice of the Supreme Court.While the author did an adequate job of explaining how the Supreme Court works and provides other, basically factual information, his tone is suspicious and unenthusiastic. He obviously does not comprehend how an individual can be both conservative and a person of color.One wonders why the author chose Clarence Thomas as a subject in a series of books called \\"People to Know.\\" Ultimately, Judge Thomas is unknown to the author, who leaves his young readers with the highly inappropriate suggestion that the most powerful black man in America may have acheived his respected position by \\"selling his soul to the devil.\\" I kid you not."},{"Title":"Life Lessons For Women: 7 Essential Ingredients for a Balanced Life","review":"Listen, I'm not your average Chicken Soup reader.

The warnings are funny, and the graphics reminded me of Japanese comic books...I bought it for my husband."},{"Title":"Gruesome Guide to World Monsters","review":"\\"The Gruesome Guide to World Monsters\\" is presented as a travel guide that will help you plan how to meet (and how to flee) the various monsters of the world. But you have to understand going in that the advice given here are only proven methods for escaping or overcoming SOME of these monsters, SOME of the time. So forget about a money back guarantee that you will come back from your vacation alive, because with some of these survival tips I am pretty sure they are just making things up to give young readers a false sense of hope. All of the monsters that Judy Sierra writes about and which are illustrated by Henrik Drescher are \\"real\\" in the sense that they are a genuine part of the world's folklore and have been around for thousands of years.The book is divided geographically so that you learn about the monsters closest to home in North America before moving on to Central and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. For each we are told the location where you can find the monster (e.g., watch out for the Cannibal Baby in the Rocky Mountains). Then there is the five point scale of the Gruesomeness Ratings: (1) Frightening, are monsters that are scary but not life-threatening, of which there is only one example, the Baku of Japan that comes into your bedroom at night and eats your bad dreams; (2) Dangerous, are monsters that smart travelers can avoid or overcome, such as Zombis; (3) Very Dangerous, are those monsters where you chances of surviving a meeting are 50-50 at best, such as Bloody Mary, the evil spectre who lives on the other side of mirrors; (4) Usually Fatal, are monsters to avoid at all costs, such as the Vukodlak of Serbia, a wicked person who lives on after death; and then (5) Fatal, where once the monster sees you it is too late, which includes the Jinn of North and Central Africa that kidnap people and cause diseases.For each monster there is also a brief description, and most importantly the Survival Tip (e.g., the Ovda of Finland will apparently become powerless if you touch its left armpit). The illustrations should be appealing to younger readers because, quite frankly, they often look like something kids would draw. The exception that proves the rule would be the wicked painting of the Aniwye, a giant skunk that inhabits the Great Lakes region, which means that living here on the shore of Lake Superior if I hear the sound of giant teeth crunching the roof above my bed, I need to exit immediately. In her afterword Sierra explains some of the necessary roles that these monsters have played in the lives of people, from making sure children stay away from caves and forests to preserving the balance of nature. \\"The Gruesome Guide to World Monsters\\" is a nice little introduction to the monsters that people have been talking about for centuries, and if a young reader wants to find out more about the Kishi of Zimbabwe or the Nakk of Sweden, there is certainly enough here for them to be able to look elsewhere for more information."},{"Title":"Gruesome Guide to World Monsters","review":"This book is extremely interesting to me because it talks about the locations of each monster and what each monster does to unsuspecting travelers. Also, this book talks about how to survive each encounter with each monster in great detail. The monsters are rated as (1) Frightening, (2) Dangerous, (3) Very Dangerous, (4) Usually Fatal, and (5) Fatal, with the fatal monsters usually having no survival tips for the travelers.My favorite monsters in this book were the Sigbin, a beagle monster whose intestinal gas is deadly, the Kishi, who has half a handsome face and half a hyena face, the Rolling Head, who ate his whole body and goes after travelers and eat them, the cannibal baby, who sucks up the flesh of unsuspecting travelers, and the Curupira, who sucks out all the organs of hunters who harm the animals in Brazil.This book is great for people who want to know more about the monsters of the world and how to survive them. This book is extremely entertaining for both children and adults. The adults will enjoy the book because of it description of all the monsters and the children will enjoy the book for Henrik Drescher's childish yet detailed drawings of the monsters."},{"Title":"Gruesome Guide to World Monsters","review":"My six year old son is very into Halloween and anything spooky. So when we saw this book at the library we just had to check it out! The very first monster in the book is one that lives behind mirrors and grabs people. This freaked my son out and now he will not go into the bathroom by himself. After that, we had to pick and choose which monsters to read to him about and even then we had to leave a few words out. It says on the back of the book that this book is for age 6 and up. That surprises me and I would not recommend this book for a 6 year old. But, I still give it a three star rating because, as an adult, I find it very interesting reading about these monsters that live in folklore."},{"Title":"Gruesome Guide to World Monsters","review":"The book is like an encyclopedia of mythical monsters. Good drawings and imaginative descriptions. It is fun, but not like a novel."},{"Title":"Gruesome Guide to World Monsters","review":"He read it first when he was probably 5 and he still loves it.

I'm not sure why there are two different titles for the same book."},{"Title":"How to Read Your Own Horoscope","review":"This is the best book I've ever read in astrology.

The images are true; the words even more so... A must for everyone - even if you are not a poetry fan1"},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"Mero's book is an interesting read, and is a very good non-mathematical review of the basics of game theory and its relationship to human ethics. I suspect that its translation from Hungarian led to its sometimes strange choices of words, but on the whole, it is a good way to get a sense of the surprising generality and importance of the subject.Unfortunately, the book is marred by Mero's expansion of game theory into a &quot;theory of everything&quot;. By the last chapter, he has gone from straightforward applied mathematics into fuzzy-headed mysticism. At this point, the book has become more embarassing than interesting. My suggestion is to read the first half of tbe book and forget the rest!"},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"This book is fascinating in how it demonstrates what we do in politics, science, and even meditation can affect our rational (and irrational) decision making processes, both individualy and in community.I actually got referred to this book by a website that discussed Game Theory and when I went to Amazon to purchase it, I was amused by the reviewers on Amazon that were horrified that the last of the book covered Meditation/Mysticism. Thats what absolutely convinced me to buy it. I am a scientist and I am practicing meditation, I see both sides.Mero does a great job of showing how Game Theory can explain the Rational and also show how irrational we are. He practically predicts why the reviewers that didn't like the last parts of his book are the way they are, which of course made them say the things they say in the review!As the famous ad says, Just do it."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"I found this book compelling: an understandable, non-dogmatic, open-minded, non-technical yet scientific look at how mathematical game theory might be applied by someone trying to behave morally in a universe of limited resources. The concepts are clearly stated without jargon in such a way that people with little aptitude or patience for mathematics will remain interested throughout. An important book for anyone interested in morality at any level."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"Laszlo is a master game theorist who is also able to convey the essence of many other complex and abstract fields and explain those concepts vis-a-vis game theory principles.The many fields which he observes are1) Evolution - the debate between group selection and gene selection2) Bluffing - Can there be a formula that can help you bluff.3) Human behaviour in auctions.4) The play between Socialism and Free Enterprise or competition-cooperation in societies and economies.5) Hawks and Doves - is there a mathematical necessity to have both elements in a society as it evolves.6) Quantum physics - why do electrons behave or are observed to be behaving according to principles of quantum physics. Is that the electrons behaviour or is that behaviour its existence.7) What principles of decision making does our conscious and unconscious mind follow?8) And finally a great comcept that amazed me - mysticism or meditation and its comparison with scientific thought. How eastern concept of meditation, which is based on transcending the mind, compares with the goedele's theorem which says that a system of rational thought can be insufficient to explain everything within that system.The book does get difficult to read towards the end but for most part Laszlo manages to simplify concepts of immense complexity in simple language.It's a joy to read and will reignite the scientific thought as well as mystic curiosity in you.Laszlo Mero, A Big Thank You for this effort."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"In this book, Mero adds some flesh to game theory, explaining why so many people become entranced with how it sets up economic and social choices as toy puzzles, in which people are trying to get the best possible outcome.In particular, he explains some of the more infamous non-zero-sum games: the dollar auction, in which a dollar bill is auctioned off, but with a twist - both the highest bidder and the second-highest bidder must pay their bids, but only the highest bidder gets the dollar; and the prisoner's dilemma (and its variants), in which cooperation is the best result for the 2 players combined, but there's the danger of being undermined by the other player and individually losing everything. The dollar auction is likened to an arms race (indeed, the U.S. won =that= particular dollar auction against the Soviets), where what is being bought is military supremacy between superpowers. The prisoner's dilemma can be likened to a situation like a lane closure on a busy highway: if one merges in turn, and everybody else does, traffic keeps flowing somewhat; however, if only one person zooms ahead and merges ahead of where they should in fairness, the traffic can still go on fine and that one zoomer gets a benefit over the other drivers. But if =everybody= tries to cut in line... traffic clog.It is true that trying to extend game theory to morality is a tricky business, and as another reviewer has put it, the book gets downright embarrassing towards the end. However, I am a math teacher, and have used ideas from the book to put more =oomph= in my classes on game theory to gifted teenagers. There isn't much in the way of math in here, but plenty of rational thinking and can lead a little light on to why game theory research has led to the winning of a Nobel Prize in Economics (or two)."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"The first half of the book was absolutely terrific and I am glad I book, however, it gets a little scattered toward the second half."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"The book is divided into three parts:I. Introduces some concepts from game theory, psychologyII. Gives examples from fields of economics, physics, biologyIII. Discusses rationality and irrationality.I found the first two parts both helpful and easy to read. They weren't technical at all, there isn't a single formula in the book. However, the last part is very hard to read and understand. I had to re-read some sentences several times and am not sure if I followed the author correctly.Overall, I would suggest reading the book - it won't take much time and you can learn such concepts as evolutionary stable strategies, mixed strategies. Also, presentation of some concepts from physics and economics is interesting."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"1998 was a crummy year. The single, sole exception to that is Meros' book, &quot;Moral Calculations&quot;. In laymans terms, Mero makes a compelling arguement in a branch of mathematics called Game Theory what constitutes a moral decision. I have read this book five times, and before 1999 is over, I will read it several more times. For anybody who has ever argued over the morality of a decision, you MUST read this book. I hate the cliche of a &quot;brilliant read&quot; but this book has that hallmark. Don't let 1999 pass before you sit down over a long weekend, and reread this book."},{"Title":"Moral Calculations: Game Theory, Logic, and Human Frailty","review":"Anyone who studies Economics gets to know the problems of rationality assumptions.

Weird huh? Well, pemmican aside, this was a pretty magical little book. Reminiscent of The Snow Queen or other child-on-a-quest fairy tales, this story follows the adventures of a little girl searching through the artic tundra for a cure for her ailing grandmother. To save her she has to find where the wild geese go. The story could be a little tighter. I like Pierce and she has a knack for turning a tale, but this one just wasn't as tight as I might have liked. The pictures, however, were wonderful- I especially liked the snow dogs. They held the book where the story slacked off. A nice piece-especially on a cold night in front of a warm fire with your hunk of journey cake."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"To me, this book has always signified the half way point of the strip. It's the last collection and the only collection that wasn't combined to be made into a treasury. That means the Sunday strips are in black and white just like the daily strips.But don't let that keep you from enjoying the many laughs you'll find here. There are so many classic stories, like the title one where Calvin builds a snowman and brings it to life only to have it try to kill him. Calvin kidnaps Susie's doll only to wind up paying ransom to get Hobbes back. Calvin and Susie make a bet over a math test. This book has the first mention of the noodles incident and several great Calvinball games.Since this book came out in 1990, the dated aspects of the early strips are gone. No more is Calvin begging for cable or a VCR. He doesn't seem to have them, either.This also has some of the early critics of our culture, especially when Calvin starts drawing his dinosaurs in spaceships series.Really, you can't go wrong with Calvin and Hobbes. There is a minimum of a laugh on every page. If you don't have this book in your collection, remedy that today."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"\\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" really hit its stride with this volume. Here the laughter and poignancy hit meltdown levels. The title of the collection itself suggests carnage. And it delivers. So why didn't this incredible collection, including some of the strip's finest moments, never make it into a treasury? Perhaps it provided such a great self-contained unit that breaking it up felt like sacrilege? How's that for an emotionally satisfying but realistically implausible explanation? Whatever the reason, this book remains the sole non-treasury volume required to complete \\"Calvin and Hobbes'\\" entire run. Hopefully fans don't miss out on that detail, because this book comes crammed with heightened surrealism and metaphysical horror comedy. The comics page rarely rose to such levels.The momentum starts high and never falters. On page one (well, five) Calvin comes down with chicken pox and tries to spread his vile contagion around, particularly to his female nemesis, Susie. Soon after his bicycle turns psychotic and plots to kill him (becoming an almost anti-Hobbes, since everyone else sees the bike as an inert object). It even growls at him. Next, the fiendish plot to kidnap Binky Betsy turns on Calvin as Susie (who owns the Betsy doll) abducts Hobbes. Then, in a strange turn, Calvin obtains overconfidence in mathematics. He bets Susie that he'll receive a higher grade on a quiz, a whole 25 cents. When Susie suggests higher stakes, Calvin shoots back, pathetically, \\"Yeah! Let's double it and make it 35 cents!\\" In the end he loses (of course) and tells Hobbes that he cheated her out of 25 cents by giving her \\"only three dimes.\\" Hobbes gives wise counsel: \\"I think you'd better study harder.\\" A mouth-dropping brilliant Sunday page follows (sadly not in color, though the 10th Anniversary book includes a full color version) where Calvin attacks himself with a sandwich while Susie watches. He prevails by drowning it in chocolate milk. An amazing display of bizarre over the top comic artistry. One of the best. And lastly, the highlight, the crown jewel of the book: the snow goons. This episode defies words and simply needs to be experienced. Many other amazing stories permeate this volume, far too many to mention. Needless to say, this feels like the comic at or very near its peak. It inspires hyperbolic praise.Here in particular the strip's character of chaos, anarchy, appearance versus reality and individualism ring out. Peanuts meets the Marx Brothers. The parents serve their usual role as straight players and frameworks against which Calvin's insubordination to everything proper in middle class America rebels. For example, at one point Calvin's mom suggests that he use his imagination to cure boredom. So he throws a bucket of water on her. The final panel features a scowling Calvin, banished to his room, grumbling, \\"My upbringing is filled with inconsistent messages.\\" Ghoulish snowmen perfectly defile a suburban front yard. On top of that, Calvin's grades remain dismal and he seems to spend as much time in the Principal's office as he does in class. He is, in so many words, every perfectionist parents' nightmare. In droves. Inside him also stirs a rebellion of sorts. Like Snoopy, his predessesor, Calvin imbues individualism to a near fault. His self-absorbed fantasies shackle his connection to reality. Nonetheless, they can also provide near total liberation. There's far more to this comic than a naughty little boy. And that will likely guarantee readership far into the future."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"Look,,,there's no two ways about it...Calvin & Hobbes is the best comic strip ever!

It shows the steps Calvins' mom uses to get ready for work in the morning, such as putting on a new dress, makeup, and stuff like that. Then she walks down the stairs and out the door only to find herself sprayed with a hose from Calvin! Then it shows Calvin in his room rubbing his butt and saying,\\"What a grouch!\\"This book is great for you if you love to laugh and you think even jokes that don't make you laugh your hide off but still are really pretty funny.

Bill Watterson is one of the greatest writers and creative geniuses of all time. His caracters are well-developed and distinctive even for a book. Calvin is a six year old, not a 40 year old in a six year old's body like many comics. His personality and the way he sees things is much like a child. His views on life and school are much like my own. His quotes have been used in the midst of conversations. It makes me want to be a first grader again so that i can try what he does. Bill's comics can be read for the slap-stick humor it provides but, can also be appreciated for the slick intelligent, and sometimes political humor as well. BUY ALL HIS BOOKS AND SIDES WILL BE SPLIT, TEARS WILL FALL UNCHECKED AND MINDS WILL BE BLOWN. In my opinion Calvin and Hobbes should be studies with Nathanel Hawthorne and Shakespeare because its's just that GOOD.PS I realise that this is not a review of snowgoons but of the entire Calvin and Hobbes legacy."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I have loved Calvin and Hobbes for as long as I can remember, and this book is one of the very best of them all. The highlight of this book is a series wherein Calvin inadvertantly brings a snowman to life, and the snowman turns out to be evil. Calvin and Hobbes soon have a snowman out to kill them, and when the snowman gives himself an extra head, not to mention an extra arm, Calvin announces \\"He's turned himself into a deranged mutant killer monster snow goon!!\\", hence the title of the book. Eventually the snow goon goes off to make an army of snow goons, and Calvin and Hobbes try to come up with a plan to kill them. Of course, Calvin's parents don't take Calvin seriously, as per usual, so the plan goes awry.I won't give away any more than that, except to say this: the strip where Calvin and Hobbes sneak out in the middle of the night, to carry out Calvin's plan, is HILARIOUS.

Certainly no one on this earth. Maybe on planet 5 or 6. Calvin and Hobbes are delightful in this collection of strips. Because of the time it was published the Sunday strips in Snow Goons are not reprinted in color in other books, save several that appear in specialized Calvin and Hobbes volumes, which are available at Amazon.Just because the Sundays lack color does not diminish the hilarity in them. This book in full of laughs and not to be missed by any Calvin and Hobbes freaks (you know who you are) or by one seeking the \\"Best Medicine.\\"The book kicks off with two stories. Calvin gets a typical kid's disease. The next story takes place at the dinner table, which, with Calvin, is asking for trouble. Family values are expressed and Calvin's reactions to them are priceless. \\"It's impolite to leave the table in the middle of a meal.\\" \\"So what am I suppposed to do? Just SIT here and watch you guys CHEW?! Among other things, Cretaceous beasts appear. Calvin's deadly two wheeled, one chained, metal menace develops devious hunting techniques. Calvin's dad is given a very visual report of his foundering in the polls. Calvin becomes lightening. Calvin tries bungee jumping. The wagon is brutalized again. Calvin's dad is confronted about cultural issues. G.R.O.S.S. launches an assault upon a certain female neighbor and classmate. Calvin struggles to learn math, now with assistance from the father figure. Spiff finds yet another few planets overlooked by the rest of human civilization. Another intense match of Calvinball unfolds. Stupendous Man and Tracer Bullet bring justice to the world. An updated Duplicator adds another few luaghs. And Calvin also, unwittingly, creates an army of deranged mutant killer monster snow goons who lack remorse for anything. Only a with help of a hose, a furry friend, and the cover of darkness at a late hour can he have any hope of vanquishing his own out of control and deadly creation.Too many other things happen as well and hopefully this has prodded you to whip out a credit card and purchse this fascinating and fall-off-your-cahir-funny book."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I've always loved the intense imagination of the cartoonist for Calvin and Hobbes and was quite thrilled when Santa brought this book this Christmas for my 8-year-old. Well, to say they're loved immensely by not only him, but the rest of the neighborhood, classroom, etc., would be a sincere understatement. If something can transcend generations, it has to be good and this book and overall collection of Calvin is no exception. I've missed reading these greatly but also have wondered why Bill hasn't taken up writing novels. Can you imagine how \\"far-out\\" they would be with his imagination?! Sure would like to see him take a crack at that! Anyway, be SURE to grab this one in particular if you have a bunch of ornery boys running around. They go bonkers over those snow goons and I even heard, \\"this is WAY better than Diary of a Wimpy Kid!\\" That definitely says it all - especially if you're as tired of \\"potty humor\\" as I am!

He clean his room, does his homework, enjoys his bath, and even has a crush on Susie!

I purchased this collection when it was first made available, and the content was wondrous. Mr. Watterson is an amazing storyteller, and he depicts every character in a humorous light.It would not surprise me in the least if Mr. Watterson WAS Calvin in his childhood, or at least he wanted to act that way. Calvin's father is as unorthodox as ever, and the slightly egotistical Hobbes was, is, and always will be sardonic. Susie is the typical saintly victim, and Moe is the stereotypical bully. The mother, is, well, the mother.Calvin and Hobbes is not literally written on a child's level. I am 16, I have a verbal I. Q. in the 200's, and I get an absolute kick out of reading and rereading Master Watterson's work. It is a shame he no longer writes them."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"The way the author presents Kelvin's point of view is hilarious!I definitely recommend it for a good laugh."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"This was a Great book, non stop Laughs and fun for toilet reading :), Honestly though, My favorite Calvin and Hobbes has to be &quot;Something under the Bed is Drooling&quot; which I also Highly Recommend.

A father who's always too busy to spend any time with his son. A father who's often seen, get this, reading --*reading* -- rather than paying his only son some attention! A mother, who literally, in strip after strip, throws him out the door. Throws, as in \\"child flying through the air\\".

The strips generally form short stories within the book. The book's title refers to one of these storylines, in which Calvin creates a mutant snow man which in turn creates an army of similar creatures. Other storylines involve Calvin getting chicken pox; his creation of his own TV show; and his club known as GROSS (a warped acronym for &quot;Get Rid Of Slimy girlS&quot;).The C&amp;H stories are great because they are funny celebrations of the power of a child's imagination. Calvin assumes such alternate identities as sci-fi hero Spaceman Spiff, caped superhero Stupendous Man, and private eye Tracer Bullet. Often the humor comes from the clash of Calvin's fantasies with the reality around him. The stuffed Hobbes, through the power of Calvin's imagination, becomes both a comrade and a great foil for the boy; their wacky relationship is one of the most memorable in the comic strip genre.Calvin is an academic underachiever, rebel, performance artist, disgruntled philosopher, and all-around bringer of chaos -- although his playmate/rival Susie refers to him as &quot;the incurable weirdness poster child.&quot; Whether discovering a new dinosaur species (the &quot;Calvinosaurus&quot;) or evading the dreaded monster under the bed, Calvin is hilarious. And you've got to love a comic that cites the U.S. Bill of Rights. &quot;Attack&quot; is a great book both for C&amp;H fans and for newcomers to this excellent comic strip."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"Bill Waterson is argudably one of the best comic writers out there. Even through his retirement, he has made great books of past comics featuring his Calvin and Hobbes characters. I laugh and laugh at these comics he creates and I sometimes wonder how he comes up with such brilliant ideas sometimes with the storylines of some of the strips.Calvin, one of his best known characters, is the trouble-making kid in the school. He is funny and imaginative and likes to make funa and games with his &quot;real&quot; pet friend Hobbes. Through the comics, you can see the relationship between a stuffed animal and a human.In this comic though, Hobbes &quot;comes to life&quot; in Calvins eyes. The things that Calvin can sometimes get involved in is so hilarious and sometimes out of this world.I guarantee that anyone that loves comics will fall in love with this one and should definitely buy this book to start their collection of classic comics.All of Bill Waterson's comic books are very well done and very professional. His work is his life and it shows the time and consideration it took to make these characters come to life. Thank you Mr. Waterson for creating such a great comic and thatnk you people for reading my review!"},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I have read almost all of the books in Calvin &amp; Hobbes collection. By far, this one is BETTER THAN THE BEST! I have always been a great Calvin &amp; Hobbes fan, but this has crazy plots and more...like in the Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (the comis strip not the book) Calvin makes a snowman come to life and it makes more weird snowmen. They attack Calvin &amp; Hobbes. Then Calvin's parents come outside and say it's time to go to bed. Will Calvin &amp; Hobbes be able to save the world from the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons?"},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"Calvin and Hobbes... you gotta love them!\\"I'd like to shake the hand of the genius who invented these.\\" - Calvin as he lovingly displays a perfect water balloon.\\"Our class voted Calvin the 'Most likely to be seen on the news some day'.\\" - Susie Derkins, the real expert on Calvin, after Calvin confesses to her that he is hiding from his homicidal bicycle.\\"I dunno, it seems like once people grow up, they have no idea what's cool.\\" - Calvin after his mom refused his request to get contact lenses... one blood red, and the other \\"Yellow striped, like a bug.\\"Oh... and why DO adults forget what is cool?"},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"All Calvin and Hobbes books are great. But this one, in which Calvin imagines that he has brought a demonic snowman to life, may be the best of the bunch. The sequence of strips in which Calvin is sure that the snowman and his friends are out to kill him may be the most brilliant of Bill Watterson's career. He is an absolute comic genius whose presence in the funny pages has been sorely missed since his retirement. &quot;Snow Goons&quot; is Watterson at his finest."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"Calvin and his stuffed tiger Hobbes wreck havoc as usual in this awesome collection of Watterson's timeless comic. Whether Calvin's wild imagination is dreaming of prehistoric dinosaurs or planning a mischevious attack on his arch-rival (fellow classmate Suzie Derkins), you're sure to enjoy the unexplainable antics of this troublesome six year old boy.This particular collection starts with a series of cartoons depicting Calvin with chicken pox. Wouldn't you know it, as soon as he finds out he's contagious, he invites Suzie over to play. That crazy kid.Individual comics follow, but then another series emerges - one where Calvin's bike attacks him upon every attempt at riding it, and his parents remain clueless about how his face could EVER get caught in the bike's chain.In another series, we see Calvin's \\"Get Rid Of Slimy girlS\\" club planning a failed water balloon assault on Suzie, resulting in the disappearance of Hobbes. Hobbes does some smooching with the enemy and is labeled as a traitor.We also see Calvin struggling in math, losing a 25 cent bet to Suzie after failing a quiz. He spends all his test time daydreaming he's interplanetary hero Spaceman Spiff, and is only able to do one lousy problem.When the Christmas season approaches, poor Calvin has to avoid throwing snowballs at Suzie so he won't lose any of his Christmas loot.The amusing title series of this collection is definitely one of my favorites. Calvin builds monster snowmen that (in his mind anyway) come to life and threaten his existence, so he freezes the whole front yard with the garden hose to protect himself, much to the dismay of his father.Last but not least, Calvin builds a human duplicating machine out of a cardboard box, and he makes a special copy of himself that represents everything good in him. His plan is to make his flawless duplicate do all of his homework and chores, while he himself gets all the credit. Everything goes fine for a while, until his duplicate develops a crush on Suzie, making him look bad. Hilarity ensues.Inbetween each of the series are individual comic strips with recurring themes. Open-minded Calvin bugs his parents with questions like, \\"Why do I have to play outside?\\" \\"Why can't we watch TV during dinner?\\" \\"If we were cannibals, what parts of people would we eat?\\" Calvin also grosses out Suzie at every opportunity whenever it's time for lunch at school.We see Calvin engaging in some of his less frequent behaviors as well, such as digging for dinosaur bones in the front yard and demanding his parents and teachers address him as \\"Calvin the Bold.\\"Great, great collection. I loved it years ago and still love it today. Best comic ever in my opinion."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I've got almost every Calvin and Hobbes collection, but as this was the first one I ever bought I'm going to review it. What can I say? What can anyone say? Bill Watterson has broken the mould of comic strips--this is the wittiest, silliest, sickest, and most heart-warming fiction I've ever come across, in ANY medium. I love his characters, and I love his insane plotlines--yet there's always a golden nugget of truth at the heart of each. Along with Gary Larson, Bill Watterson has breathed new life into the comic strip genre (and I'm no big fan of comics). Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant stuff."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I've been teaching my son to read English through Calvin and Hobbes books. I've been surprised how much of it is written with an adult in mind. We have drawn much amusement from these books. The Snow Goons isn't quite as rewarding as other C&H collections, but is enjoyable nonetheless. This is more a weekly format with black and white strip cartoons. None of the Sunday spreads are contained within this collection, where one really saw Watterson show off his stunning imagination. However, it is very much worth adding to the archives, especially for bedtime stories."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I first began reading Calvin and Hobbes in the newspaper around the time he introduced the Killer Snow Goons story, where Calvin builds yet another mutant, deranged snowman--but unlike previous strips, Calvin attempts to bring the snow goon to life a la Frankenstein, leading to the monster creating an army of similarly deranged snow goons.Watterson's artwork as usual is imaginative and humorous, and Calvin and Hobbes' interaction in this book are particularly hilarious. If you've never read C&H; before, consider this book a great place to start; long-read fans will also enjoy it as one of the best selections in the Calvin & Hobbes library."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"I loved Calvin and Hobbes when i was a little kid and I still do now!

These cartoons make me want to be a kid again. Almost everyone hassaid this but I'll say it again. You'll start out planning to read a few pages but you won't stop there. you can't. it's so additive. some ofthe younger kids might not understand some of the big words but older kids will.

It was my favorite. As an adult, I happen to have a child who very much reminded me of the Calvin charater; a mischivous, creative, opinionated little boy with a head full of cow-licks, whose \\"best friend\\" is a stuffed frog.When I thought he was old enough to appreciate the C&H; cartoons, I bought him this book and we have thoroughly enjoyed them together. I will definately be buying more of Watterson's books."},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"My 7-year-old grandson learned to read for two reasons: he wanted to navigate around the free games on the Internet all by himself (of course), and equally as important, he got hooked on Calvin and Hobbes. I attribute my grandson's advanced reading skills directly to Calvin and Hobbes -- which is for children of all ages. Bill Waterson writes simply most of the time, but he also uses some words that are not normally in the lexicon of 7-year-olds. My grandson is reading three grade levels above his class because of this. I also think that he identifies very strongly with Calvin...My now 18-year-old grandson also learned to read because of Calvin and Hobbes.--A very proud Grandma!"},{"Title":"Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons (Calvin & Hobbes)","review":"How can anyone not like Calvin in spite of his mischief.

At one point I wished that the artist had not stopped; now, with hindsight, I can see that he didn't want to see any decline in the quality of his humor, insight, fantasy, and art.
